Frederick won't let me in'ere again if he sees this mess\" Donnel said as he dropped his lance and proceeded to clean up all the books that had been knocked over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he picked up books, one of them caught his eye. One of Henry's books had been opened and was on a page that had a full instructions for a simple spell on it. Watching the mages of Chrom's army be able to attack from a distance often made Donnel jealous. \"Henry won't mind if I just try out a spell\" he justified to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woohee. This is simpler than I thought\" Donnel said cheerfully as he read how to do the spell, not checking the previous page that stated what the spell would do. \"All I gotta do is say what's on the page.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonnel left the barracks, the reast of the fallen books left where they lay. He got a good distance from the Shepard's camp, just in case this spell was like an explosion or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go!\" Donnel said before reciting the spell as it was written \"Sreiht hyie ydob ym hctiws!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Donnel finished talking, he felt as if the whole world was being pulled out from under his feet. He saw the environment around him move at a flashing speed, however he was not moving himself, rather his soul was! Within a few seconds he saw a familar group, his fellow shepards coming back from their battle against Risen. His spirit flew straight forward until he flew into the body of an ally who happened to have been standing directly parallel to his old one, albeit miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose body did Donnel end up in?</span></div></div>",

'Tharja' stared into space for a while, looking utterly confused with where she was or what she was doing. Then she shaily brought a hand up to her face, her expression turned to one of pure panic. \"WHAT IN TARNATION?!\" 'She' yelled out, with more emotion than Tharja ever put into her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonnel looked at his new purple nails in terror, this couldn't be happening, there's no is that spell had put him into someone else's body, right? He had to be dreaming \"Just done got ta wake myself up\" he said, flinching at hearing Tharja's voice come out of his mouth. He grabbed his new, long hair with his hands and tugged hard \"Ow ow ow ow ow!\" It hurt, that meant he wasn't dreaming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonnel took a gulp, this whole time he had been looking forward, but he knew he had to look down at his new self eventually. Looking down, unfortunately as expected, he was greeted by Tharja's generous cleavage and the rest of her body, barely covered in what Donnel would hesitate to even call an outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This here is all that there darn spellbook's fault!\" Donnel stomped with Tharja's heeled shoe. wait, the spellbook! That could turn him back to normal! Donnel look around him, thankfully none of the other Shepard's had noticed 'Tharja's outburst, in fact, they had all walked ahead, leaving him behind. \"Phew, I done might be able ta keep this here all secret\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonnel began to walk in the direction of where his body would be, although to call it walking would be generous. Because of his new center of gravity and Tharja's heeled shoes, he took big stomps while keeping his arms stretched in front of him, expecting to trip. If anyone saw him like this, they would think he looked ridiculous <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him, the long, hard steps he took only accentuated the foreign bouncing sensation he felt on his new chest. He wanted out of this body as soon as possible. By the time he had reached where he left his body, the sun had already long set. It easily took him three times longer to get here than normally walking would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the exact location where his body was, Donnel found</span></div></div>",

However, this also meant he wouldn't be able to rely on her to reverse this mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Golly, I shoulda never have done messed with Henry's book\" Donnel said to himself as he kicked Tharja's leg. He needed to fix this quick, but how? The easiest way would be to ask Henry to change him back, however would Henry be willing to? Asking Henry to cast a spell might be more trouble than it's worth. Henry would turn someone into a frog for fun if you gave him permission to cast a spell on you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonnel of course knew there was another option right now too. Even if it might be an example of not learning his lesson. He now had access to Tharja's tent and all her belongings, surely she would have a spell that could fix all of this, right? And if he managed to fix it all on his own, no one would even know he was messing with Henry's stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wind blew and made him shiver in Tharja's outfit, Donnel chose to</span></div></div>",

However he figured so long as he didn't mess with any spells that had pictures of skulls next to them, he should be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's try this one!\" Donnel said and began to chant a random spell he had picked out.

As he got older days began to blend together. The excitement and hard work that the team\u2019s journey put him through also made the days pass fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, days were passing fast. Until the team decided to begin flying around the world and check on problems facing towns after gathering the elemental spirits<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the group had something much more important to be dealing with, Estelle was insistent on going around helping people first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were staying at Dahngrest for the night, Raven was about to complain, but then Yuri spoke up to him and the others in the inn. \u201cAlright everyone. I made enough.\u201d Yuri said and pulled out a white bag, it jingled, signaling it was filled with gald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-is that\u201d Raven stuttered, if it was what he thought it was, all this traveling would have been worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough gald to privately rent out the hot springs at Yumanju\u201d Yuri said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven whistled with joy. \u201cYuri, you\u2019ve done this old man proud!\u201d Raven put an arm around Yuri smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven was too busy thinking about what he\u2019d try to see at the hot springs to pay close attention to what the others were saying. However it sounded like although Estelle and Judith were happy about getting another chance to relax, Rita was complaining about how Raven was likely to peep on them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the initial excitement was over. Raven left to spend some time at the bar. He ordered and drank a few drinks. After getting plenty drunk, Raven decided on a whim to go to the Don\u2019s study. Don had quite a few books, although Raven personally couldn\u2019t imagine his late friend spending much time reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA particular book caught Raven\u2019s eye. He took it off the shelf and began to flip through it. Nothing in particular interested him, but then he saw something odd on one page. Instructions for an arte. Apparently one that could swap bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh. As if that were possible\u201d Raven laughed at the thought. Although, the more he thought about it, the more he began to believe it. After all, if there were artes that could cause meteors to fall, why couldn\u2019t there be one to do something like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven gave it some more thought and soon came to the conclusion that he should at least try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, but whooooo do I want to switch with?\u201d Raven thought to himself out loud</span></div></div>",

Once he entered, he called out \u201cHey Rita. Come to town square with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita wasn\u2019t even remotely interested \u201cNo way, old man!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mooon!

It worked!\u201d Raven laughed in Rita\u2019s voice.<br>\r\nRaven\u2019s own body suddenly opened it\u2019s eyes and stared at Raven in horror. \u201cWhat\u2026.what did you do old man?!\u201d Rita nearly shouted in Raven\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little arte I learned.\u201d Raven said as he felt around his new body, much to Rita\u2019s discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurn us back now, or I will make you paaay!\u201d Rita said, raising a fist to her own body. she was clearly off balance though, made sense, Raven\u2019s body was still drunk and Rita wouldn\u2019t mentally be able to deal with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be hasty. Do you really want to hurt your own body?\u201d Raven said. Rita then backed off, but not for long. Raven\u2019s hands soon made it to Rita\u2019s chest. \u201cEven from this angle they\u2019re small. Gotta be embarrassing to be going to Hot Springs with Judy tommorow\u201d Raven said with Rita\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the final straw. Rita threw a punch at her own body, but to her surprise Raven was quick to not only dodge, but to knock her on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour body is pretty agile too.\u201d Raven said, now standing above his own body, as he stretched out one of Rita\u2019s legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita rolled over to face Raven in her body. \u201cYou\u2019ve had your fun, old man.

Rita reluctantly accepted the fact she would need to talk him out of this if she wanted her body back. \u201cWhy not take Judith\u2019s body yourself? Then you can\u2026..feel them all you want.\u201d Rita\u2019s face blushed as she had to finish that sentence \u2018Sorry Judith, but I can\u2019t let him stay as me\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven laughed \u201cI thought about it, but if I do it as you, I have the benefit of seeing your embarrassed face when we swap back and the other girls ask you about it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita\u2019s facial expression turned to one of terror. She hadn\u2019t thought about that. What would Estelle think if Raven did that while in her body? Judith would probably tease he, but Judith would tease her no matter what. However she couldn\u2019t imagine how Estelle would react. She needed to swap back now. Rita tried to keep her cool before opening her mouth again \u201cI\u2019ll tell them that you\u2019re in my body.

I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll believe you.\u201d Raven said. He was getting a bit bored of the back and forth, and began to walk back to the inn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita pulled herself up again. There was only one thing she could think of doing now. She needed to find a way to swap them back on her own. Raven must have learned that arte from somewhere. She stumbled off into town, not even sure where to start looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Raven got back to the inn. He was greeted by Estelle waiting for Rita. \u201cRita, what did Raven want?\u201d<br>\r\nRaven put on his best Rita impression \u201cThe idiot just wanted to talk about some lame guild stuff. I was bored to death so I left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEstelle seemed to believe him. \u201cWell, we got our room for the night ready. Let\u2019s rest up for tommorow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide smile appeared on Raven\u2019s face. He hadn\u2019t considered the girls would all be sharing a room at the inn.

He was hear to get rich, not learn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he came across a room with an object resting on a pedestal, that must be it! As he got closer, it became clear that this object was a lamp. He had a pretty good idea what this meant. He grabbed the lamp and began to furiously rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, from the lamp a genie emerged. The genie looked like a giant, fat, toad wearing watermelon pants. \"As rewars for releasing me from my lamp, you may get two wishes\" the genie spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah? Only two?\" Wario exclaimed \"Stupid cheapskate genie. There's no reason I shouldn't get three.\" He mumbled and began to stroke his mustache. He needed to think about this carefully. Wario was greedy enough to wish for everything in the world, but he was smart enough to know about genie's tendencies to twist words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly rubble began to fall from the ceiling, interrupting Wario's train of thought. He looked behind him and panicked. All the walls he had knocked over were now causing the pyramid to collapse! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWario needed to get out of here, quick, but before he tried to leave, he shouted out his first wish almost on instinct, without giving much thought to what he was even saying \"I wish....</span></div></div>",

The genie snapped his fingers and suddenly Wario was no longer in the collapsing pyramid. He looked around and saw he was in a very fancy looking bedroom, it lookes fit for a king! ....save for the fact that it was pink, but he could get it painted later. The wish must have worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWario put his hand on his hips and laughed \"Wah ha ha! Looks like that genie was.....worth.....it...\" Wario's joy began to turn to panic, that was not his voice! In fact, that voice belong to a woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWario looked down at himself and jumped several feet in surprise, he was wearing a pink dress, and clad in that dress was a very feminine body. As he began to slowly float down to the floor Wario looked around the room for a mirror. Thankfully there was a full body one near the closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on the ground Wario stomped angrily over to the mirror, in the reflection was not an image of him, but of Princess Peach, ruler of Mushroom Kingdom. That genie granted his wish alright, no one in the kingdom could possibly be richer than the ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaah! This isn't what I wanted. Stupid genie!\" Wario yelled in a tone that Princess Peach would never use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWario turned and looked at his new body in the mirror and several angles, he was Princess Peach through and through. His attention was drawn to how petite Peach was, he missed how heavy his old body was. Peach was practically a twig in comparison. Her dress was uncomfortable to move in, he missed hus casual overalls. He sniffed her body too, gone was his pleasant odor of garlic, replaced with a smell of fruity perfume. This body was a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to find that genie!\" Wario exclaimed. He couldn't stand being Princess Peach for even a second longer. He looked around the room, but it was clear that the lamp didn't follow him. \"It can't be back at that pyramid!\" Wario shouted in disbelief. It could be under a pile of rubble for all he knew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Wario could think of the lamp any further, some toads entered the room. \"Are you ready, Princess?\" They asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready? Ready for what?!\" Wario snapped at the toads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne toad cowered behind the other \"F-for the party. Everyone is here to celebrate your rescue from Bowser's clutches. The cake is ready and everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWario looked at Peach in the mirror again. She did seem to be covered in more glitter and makeup than usual. So not only was he placed in the body of the princess, but he was placed in her body during an important party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how much stress Wario was currently under trying to get used to being in a different bidy, perhaps a relaxing body was just what he needed, especially the cake \"Might put a few good pounds on her at least\" Wario commented as he rubbed Peach's stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end he decided to</span></div></div>",

Or else I'll-\" before the thug could finish what they were saying, Kiryu flipped them over, knocking them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh\" the fortune teller that Kiryu saved chucked. Seems that man didn't like my services. Kiryu knew that this would lead to some trouble, so he began to walk away, only to be stopped by the fortune teller. \"Wait, young man. Allow me to thank you for saving me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't any thanks.\" Kiryu said humbly, he was just doing what came naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, at least let me express my appreciation. I'll give you one free use of my service.\" The fortune teller said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need my fortune told.\" Kiryu said bluntly, the last encounter he had with a fortune teller was nothing but complete nonsense afterall<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho ho, young man. I don't give simple fortunes, I do something much more special. I give people a whole new perspective on life.\" The fortune teller explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiryu's interest was peaked. \"Alright, I'll try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" The fortune teller said as they began to do something with their hands \"You're lucky I was feeling generous, usually I charge up to 1 billion yen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kiryu could express how aghast he was at that outrageous price, his vision began to fade, what was this persin doing to him? Soon he saw nothing but black for several seconds. Soon his vision returned, but something was wrong. Not only did he feel different, he was in a completely different place. He was still outside, but he was on a completely different street.

It was small and shaped like a TV remote but the design was completely alien. To begin with, it only had a few buttons and each had a completely foreign symbol on it. Looking on the back, there didn't seem to be any slot for batteries; instead, it was only a smooth metallic surface that reflected his confused expression. It was obviously not man-made and the tarnished piece of paper he had found with it only heightened that belief. Body swapping? Possession? It all seemed so ridiculous - like something out of a cartoon. However, with what he had seen this year, maybe it wasn't so ludicrous.<i> Could it be connected to the Metaverse?</i> It was possible but the circumstances in which he found this box were completely different to the app so maybe it was unrelated?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had found this device in Inokashira park earlier today. The silver tint of the buried remote caught his attention as he walked through the park and the note it was wrapped in piqued his curiosity so he dug it up and took it home. If it was real, this could prove useful for both him and the Phantom Thieves and, in addition, it had seemed like the remote wanted him to take it anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paper had explained clearly how to use the remote and each of its functions though he had yet to test any of them. He was hesitant. Sure, the note had explained the remote but he didn't know if he could trust it. He had found it in the middle of a public park; there was no way of knowing where it had come from or who had left it there. Maybe there was information hidden from him, such as unintended side effects, or maybe the remote has an entirely separate purpose. Maybe he was just being paranoid and should just bite the bullet and use it. Though, he could ask someone to help him test it, so he wasn't in this alone if something happened. He could ask a fellow member of the Phantom Thieves or one of his confidants to help him. Though, that could end up putting them in danger and Ren wasn't sure he could risk that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Ren decided to...</span></div></div>",

He replied, saying it was okay to meet up tomorrow, before finding a place in the dusty attic of his room to stash the remote. He settled on hiding it inside his workbench, surrounded by lock-picks he had made. With that, he looked out at the darkened sky and decided to go to bed, anxious to finally test the remote with Makoto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith thoughts of the remote's supposed abilities floating around his head, Ren drifted off into a deep sleep.</span></div></div>",

The seemingly infinite possibilities it provided laid before him in a web of ideas but, before he  could act on them, he had to test the remote with Makoto. He glanced at his phone; the last message he had received said that she'd be here in a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced outside. It was raining. He felt a little guilty about making her come here in this weather but he did need to test the remote. Hopefully, it wasn't just a prank and he hadn't wasted Makoto's time. He took his last bite of curry as the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto had arrived. Closing the door behind her, she approached Ren, curiosity plastered upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you had something to show me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, its upstairs\" Ren quickly replied before leading her into the attic that was his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his room, he retrieved the remote and its instructions before presenting them to Makoto. Reading through the damaged note, her brow became increasingly furrowed. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is real? It seems so ludicrous\" she said with a half-laugh.<br>\r\n\"That's why I called you here. I want to test if it's real or not. The Metaverse seems ludicrous as well but that's real so why not this?\" Ren replied.<br>\r\n\"You do have a point. We should test it out then.\" Makoto declared, smiling. \"Aware swap should be first function to test then.\" Makoto then pressed the button twice,<br>\r\nfirst targetting herself then targetting Ren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Ren's perspective shifted from standing up to being sat down. Additionally, his body felt completely different. Of course it felt different; it wasn't his body. The remote had worked.<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Ren heard his own voice speak as he looked up at his own body, knowing that it was Makoto in control. \"This...This is unprecedented.\" She was completely in shock as she held up her current hands, inspecting her hands. Quickly, she then looked at Ren in her own body, still shocked. \"Is that you, Ren?\" He nodded. \"So it does work, then.\" she stated as her shock vanished. She then approached the remote and picked it up before reverting the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow back in their original bodies, they back discussing the remote and what it could do. \"How does this device work, I wonder?\" Makoto absently-mindedly said as she inspected it. \"There don't seem to be any negative side effects of its use so it seems ok to use but is it connected to the Metaverse in any way?\" she said as she placed the remote down. \"Thank you, Ren, for showing this to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only have one question, though.\" replied Ren. \"Should we show the device to the rest of the Phantom Thieves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did Makoto respond?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She would probably be more comfortable outside if she wasn't herself then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving agreed upon their accomplice in using the device, Ren sent Futaba a message stating <i>I've got something you may be interested in. When are <br>\r\nyou free to meet up, preferably in private?<i> It didn't take long for a response to come shooting back, saying <i>You've got something for me? ooh, now I'm curious. I'm free right now if you want to swing by. ;)<i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems that she's free now so let's not waste any time.\" said Makoto, as she peered over Ren's shoulder. Nodding in agreement, He slid the remote into his pocket as both of them made their way to the Sakura residence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering Futaba's room, Ren and Makoto found their fellow phantom thief sat at her computer, hammering away at her keyboard with great speed and precision. Upon<br>\r\nhearing the sound of you entering her room, Futaba turned her head to see Ren and Makoto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's this thing you wanted to show me then?\" Futaba exclaimed, eyes glistening with eagerness. Ren procured the remote from his pocket and began explaining<br>\r\nthe remote and its various functions, Futaba hanging on his every word. After Ren finished his explanation, Futaba responded. \"A remote capable of switching people's <br>\r\nbodies? Sounds implausible. Though, the metaverse itself is weird enough and, if it is real...\" A mischievous smirk manifested on Futaba's face that make Ren almost<br>\r\nregret his decision. \"So? Show me how the remote works, then I'll know you aren't crazy.\" Ren glanced at Makoto, who only gave a faint smile in repsonse. It should<br>\r\nhave been obvious that she'd demand proof, leaving now only the question of how to prove it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen immediately ruled out possession. Possessing Futaba wouldn't show her that the remote worked and wouldn't be fair to Futaba. Similarly, letting Futaba possess someone unsupervised would be a recipe for disaster. After looking through the remaining options, he came to the conclusion that an aware swap would be the most effective proof. Swapping himself and Makoto wouldn't help as she'd think they were just messing with her. She'd have to be directly involved in a swap. With that careful consideration, only two options remained: Swap himself and Futaba or swap Makoto and Futaba?</i></i></i></i></span></div></div>",

Why don't we give it a try?\" Ann said, putting down her cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phantom thieves made their way up to the third floor on the thieves den and just as Morgana said, there were multiple panels for the phantom thieves to stand on. \"So, how do these work?\" Ryuji said as he walked on to one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno!\" Morgana exclaimed. \"Just try thinking or saying things, you idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up you dumb cat. Hey Ann-\" suddenly a puff of smoke enveloped Ryuji, where he once stood was now an exact replica of Ann in her Shujin uniform \"Do you have any idea...s\" the second Ann suddenly looked down at herself in pure shock \"What the hell?!\" Ryuji yelled as he examined himself, all over he looked exactly like Ann<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other phantol thieves were completely shocked. Ryuji had morphed into Ann just from saying her name on the panel, this must be what Jose had meant when he said the panels could change their appearance. Being calm and collected as always, Joker threw out a suggestion \"Ryuji say your own name\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?? Sure? Ryuji\" and with another puff of smoke Ryuji turned back to normal \"I'm back!\" Ryuji laughed, now that he knew he could turn back to his normal self at any time, the initial shock of his body changing had turned into excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the phantom thieves knew how these panels worked, who used them next?</span></div></div>",

He looked forward to the lazy sunday ahead of him now that he and his friends had seemingly captured the killer responsible for the chaos in Inaba, a teen from a different school by the name of Mitsuo. There had been several murders and even more kidnappings, but with the crisis out of the way he could live like a normal highs-chooler and enjoy the rest of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey big bro,\" a soft voice rang out from the living room as Yu was putting on his shoes. \"A package arrived for you today.\" Sitting by the TV, Yu's little cousin Nanako was point towards a small box left out on the kitchen counter for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu raised an eyebrow. \"Doesn't look like its from Tanaka...\" He put in a lot of orders for items useful to his investigations and forays into the midnight channel with the rest of the investigation team, but he couldn't recall making one recently. Curious, he opened up the box, seeing a small device decked out with 4 buttons and a leaflet with soe basic instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well, that looks like a lot of nonsense,'</i> Yu remakred mentally as he read the notes with a blank expression. 'But then, this whole year has been a lot of nonsense.' Body swapping was of course, impossible, but Yu had reason to be more credulous than the average person. After all, he could phase through televisions and fought monsters on a regular basis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I owe it to whoever sent it to give it a shot, even if it is an elaborate joke,\" Yu honestly couldn't imagine who might've sent it to him, but it'd be mean to deprive the prankster of their fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that for your TV upstairs?\" Nanako asked from across the room, having been watching silently the whole time Yu read the instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu shrugged, \"I guess you could say that.\" It was best not to go into detail before you could prove something; otherwise people don't really believe you. He knew that from experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'If I want to test it, I suppose Nanako is right here,'</i> Yu reasoned absently. She was a smart kid, and he knew she would keep a secret if he asked her too. Still, if it worked, it might be best to keep knowledge of it confined to the investigation team. They already knew the supernatural was real, so it'd be less likely to shatter their worldview. There wasn't much to do in Inaba on your own, so Yu figured that basically any of his friends would be available right now</span></div></div>",

A sudden burst of nausea overtook him as the room seemed to spin around and his perspective became much, much smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try what?\" Yu heard his own voice ask, as he found himself sitting down on the other side of the room. Standing by the counter, he saw his own body looking at him like a deer in headlights. \"...uh, big bro...?\" There was a brief clatter as Nanako dropped the remote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick downward glance confirmed for Yu that the remote worked. He pulled up a pair of small, delicate hands to his eyes, and looking past those hands he saw his legs were exposed - he was wearing Nanako's dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Yu was quick on his feet. He had spent this whole year involved in stranger things than this. While his balance was off, he managed to pull himself to his feet. \"Don't worry Nanako - it's me. Everything will be fine,\" he assured his cousin in his own body as he stood up, his balance more than a bit off center. If the remote switched them so easily, it'd switch them back just as easily. However, the issue of 'damage control' still remained. Yu had enough experience to deal with this, but how would he explain this to Nanako? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big bro, are you me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering the clattering sound after they switched, Yu realized that Nanako - who was now looking herself over with a sense of awe - didn't really process the remote. He could try explaining everything to her, but it might lead to... issues. If he could get a hold of it without her realizing though, there was a chance he could switch them back without Nanako knowing about the device at all and just play dumb about it. Maybe she'd think it was a dream? Or just some magical event like in a movie? He knew he had to commit before her sense of awe turned into panic though. </span></div></div>",

I was going to visit some friends too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu smiled. \"Great to hear! Just be safe and get home before dinner.\" Nanako gave a smile and a nod back, and with that Yu opened the front door and made his way up the street towards the shopping district. Inaba was pretty tiny, so he could walk just about anywhere. He had his uncle's scooter, but he generally saved it for trips out of town with his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenerally, Yu could find any number of friends just by wandering up and down the street of the shopping district. Kanji and Rise both worked there with their families, and Chie and Yukiko often went shopping nearby. Yosuke and Teddy were probably off at Junes, but that was a bit further away. He supposed it would help speed things up to sed everyone a text to see if they were available, and stopped to flip open his cellphone as he reached the end of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

It struck him as a rather drastic choice, but it probably left the fewest loose ends in the long run. With a click he activated the device, and suddenly he felt weightless, floating like a cloud over his own body, which seemed to keep up the conversation with Ai as though he was still inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though processing what had happened to him, Yu stayed in this state for maybe a minute or two, just watching fascinated. He thought he'd be able to adapt fast to something like this, but he was evidently wrong. He felt like a set of eyes just floating around, meeting no resistance as he spun around every possible direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I'll leave you be for right now,\" he heard Ai say as his attention settled back on the situation below. \"I should probably go study a bit, after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you at practice then,\" Yu's own body replied with a nod, as he took a right turn and continued down the sopping district. Yu wasn't totally sure what his body was going to do without the remote, but he guessed it at least gave him a convenient opening. He found that with a little focus, he could push himself along at a fairl steady pace, easily keeping up with Ai until the two came across an empty block. As Ai stopped to let a car pass, Yu made his move and pushed through her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Yu gasped in a high pitched voice, letting out a sudden burst of air as he suddenly had lungs again. He could feel long hair tickling at his neck, and a sharp breeze across his legs. A quick look downwards revealed his legs were completely exposed - he was wearing a dress! It was the very same white and pink outfit that Ai had been wearing. He also realized, as his face turned red, that he had breasts. He could The device worked perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the device, he became suddenly aware of the fact that he had it clenched in Ai's right hand - his hand for the moment. He reached downwards to put it away in a pocket, but merely brushed a hand against the hems of his skirt. He awkwardly hid it away in Ai's purse instead. He fished around a bit more, but realized to his frustration that Ai had given him her compact mirror. Wanting to see his reflection, he walked up to a nearby storefront, staring into the window long enough to get a faint reflection of his new face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap,\" he said in Ai's voice, \"that thing works. For real!\" The situation was beyond surreal, but he couldn't help but smile for a second. As far as supernatural occurrences went, this one had a lot more potential to be fun than the last one. Wearing a skirt didn't bother him that much, but he had to admit that being a girl was an experience he wasn't expecting. \"Well Ai,\" he whispered under his breath as he straightened out the ribbon around her chest, \"how about we see where this takes us, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to seem like a weirdo, he turned away from the window and walked across the street as Ai had intended, fiddling with his new, long hair as he did. He didn't really know where his body had run off to, but he typically returned home briefly by the time it got dark just in case his uncle got back. Yu figured he would just swing by his house at that hour and use the device to return to his body then. That meant he had basically the whole afternoon to explore the possibilities before returning to normal. </span></div></div>",

If he was in a new body, it'd pay to take in a new perspective, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu figured that if all of his friends would be gathered into one place, it'd probably be Junes, since Yosuke and Teddy worked there. The others might atleast be getting lunch. Ai herself didn't really care for the place - it was probably a bit too cheap for her tastes - but Yu knew she frequented it on occasion. <i>'Maybe I can even fluster Yosuke a bit,'</i> he thought to himself with a smirk as he picked up the pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>~'Every Day is Great at Your Junes!~</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu hadn't been in Inaba long, but that jingle had already gotten stuck in his head after too many trips to the food court.

Can I not hang out with my classmates?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie gave a bit of a grimace. \"Be nice, Chie,\" Yukiko interjected. \"She's Narukami's friend, remember?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any friend of sensei has to be a good person after all!\" Teddy burst in, all of a sudden.

While yelling to himself about the pain, he dropped the package and it's contents fell out. Yosuke looked around to make sure that no one saw that embarrassing scene. Once he was sure he was alone, he looked at what had fallen out of the package. It looked like a remote and manual. Yosuke assumed it was some kind of T.V. remote and began to put it back in the package. It wasn't until further inspection that he realized it wasn't a T.V. remote at all. It was labeled as some kind of 'Body Swap Remote'. \"The hell? We don't sell anything like this here.\" Yosuke thought aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke wanted to label it as some sort of prank and toss it out, but at the same time he was extremely curious.

The safest thing to do for now would be to wait for school tomorrow and wait for a good chance to use it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Yosuke had slept in and had rushed to get ready for school, he made sure to grab the remote from under his bed before he went out the door. Because he had slept in he was behind most of the people walking to school, but this may be beneficial! Now no one would see him and question why he was pointing around some weird remote. As he walked to school, Yosuke noticed two people he recognized walking far in front of him. It was Chie and Yukiko! Perfect, they could be a good first test for the remote!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie had always been a bit of a jerk to Yosuke, often hitting him and criticizing him. She still hadn't forgiven him for breaking her Trial of the Dragon DVD. Switching bodies with her could be a fitting bit of payback! Maybe she wouldn't be so critical of him if she knew what it was like to walk a mile in his shoes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko was also a good candidate to switch with. She was easily one of the most popular and beautiful girls in school. If Yosuke swapped with her, he could bask in her popularity for the day. Even if it was the popularity of the opposite gender. Of course, he would have to switch back before school was over. He wouldn't want to be stuck working at her parents inn for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he didn't need to switch with either of them right now. There were plenty of other people that he both did know and didn't know in school that he could switch with. In the end Yosuke decided to....</span></div></div>",

It had been nearly two months since Yu had left Inaba, Naoto had left soon after him, and now Rise was getting ready to leave and restart her idol career. It wan't far! Not only had his sensei let him behind, but two gorgeous babes were also leaving him in the dust. Just the, Teddie had an idea \"I know! I'll become beary famous and be know worldwide! Then Sensei and the others will want to come see me!\" Teddie thought aloud for a moment, but even he knew that it would never happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie continued doing his part-time job as Junes' mascot, but one day he found something strange on the ground. It seemed to be some sort of package. He picked it up and shook it around. Judging by it's size and how light it was, he jumped to the obvious conclusion that it was....\"Candy!\" Teddie yelled aloud and began to tear open the package. He frowned when he saw what was inside, it wasn't candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the package was a remote of some sort and a manual. Teddie tried to read the manual, but he wasn't very good at reading. He instead chose to look at the pictures in the manual to find out what the remote did. He couldn't figure out any specific of how it worked, but it seemed that this remote could swap bodies around. \"Cool!\" Teddie shouted out, getting some looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie began to think about what he could use the remote for, his first thought of course came in the form of using it on his friends. It would be fun to swap all of their bodies around for a little while, plus, if he so happened to end up in the body of one of the girls, he could get real up close and personal with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Teddie didn't limit his swapping thoughts to those he knew. The entire town of Inaba deserved the chance to at least have Teddie in their body for a little while!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Teddie thought about what to do with the remote, he was suddenly interupted. \"Damn it Teddie! You already had five breaks today, you have to actually work!\" Yosuke shouted at Teddie. That's when Teddie had a third idea, who could tell Yosuke about the remote too! If Yosuke knew, maybe he could read the manual and teach Teddie exactly how each of the remote's buttons worked. Of course, there was also the chance that Yosuke could ruin Teddie's fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Teddie decided to...</span></div></div>",

With this remote, he can easily skip work and hang out with the fair maidens of Inaba with Yosuke being none the wiser. Immediately - without thinking - he used the possession function in order to get out of being yelled at by Yosuke and then maybe he could have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the world shifted before Teddie as he was suddenly thrown upwards. However, he  quickly realised something felt off as he found himself floating above the ground and felt weightless. In a panic, he flailed around a bit before realising what had happened; the remote had made him into a ghost. He looked down to see what his body was doing during his discovery, hoping that it hadn't fallen down and hurt itself. That would be unbearable. Instead of that, he found it talking to Yosuke, as if nothing had happened, and promising to get back to work. After learning that his body would be fine, Teddie decided to see what kind of fun he could have with the possession function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie rose through the roof to gain a bird's eye view of Inaba in his ghostly form. Awed by the freedom given to him, his eyes darted across the village as he tried to decide on a destination. Eventually, he decided to go everywhere, looking for someone to possess from the people he knew. He soared across the streets of Inaba, yelling in excitement despite being inaudible to others. Eventually, he identified his possible targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie and Yukiko were walking across the Samegawa flood plains. Maybe he'd having some fun as one of them, though he would have to try and fool the other if he chose one of them, which might be a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRise was in the Tofu shop. Teddie considered how it might be to be in the body of such a beautiful idol. Being an idol, combined with his devilish bear charms, might be the perfect option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie's strangest discovery was that Naoto was in town, which left her as an option. In Teddie's mind, being a detective would be beary cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left Teddie spoilt for choice in who to possess but who did he decide on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked down at herself as if her own body was foreign to her. She then embraced herself in a hug, giggling the entire time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yukiko?\" Chie said in shock \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yukiko' seemed to only now remember she was wasn't alone. She turned to face Chie, but never made eye contact. Her focus was solely on herself. \"I'm... feeling.......bearific.....Chie!\" Teddie said with Yukiko's voice. As he talkes he bounced uo and down. Watchinf the alight bounce of his chest and the way his skirt would move about everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're acting totally weird, and did you just say bearific? Teddie is rubbing off on you WAY too much. Maybe I should teach him a lesson for having you act weird.\" Chie tried to joke around, but how her friend was acting was still making her worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Teddie is a handsome bear! You shouldn't hurt him!\" Teddie tried to defend himself,  which didn't help him seem like the real Yukiko at all<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that settles it. There's something wrong with you.\" Chie said. \"Maybe you have a fever? We have been going to the T.V. world a lot lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddie was getting nervous. He didn't want anyone to find out about the remote yet, but if Chie kept noticing how strange he was acting, she would surely find out. What would she do if she found out that he took Yukiko's body? He shuddered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what could he do? He took notice of the remote that had somehow reappeared in his left hand. Perhaps he could do something to distract Chie from him or make her not notice anything?

The only respite he ever got from his boredom was when he was graciously given the power to force people inside a TV, with their anguished faces serving as Adachi's only source of joy. Though, it was that power that put him in this situation, imprisoned on several charges such as murder. It only served to magnify his boredom in the long run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former detective sighed as he laid back against the wall of his cell. What he wouldn't give for another chance to spice up his life. Eventually, he'd probably go insane from the boredom. There wasn't a single thing in this prison that he could use to entertain himself. All he could do now was fantasise about good food that he could no longer taste. He had truly hit rock bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat there, wallowing in his misery, he noticed a guard approach his cell door before opening a small hatch and hurling a small box through it towards his head. Barely dodging it as it collided with the wall, he looked at the guard suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sent in as a gift for you. Don't get your hopes up, we already checked it and there's nothing useful inside. I don't know what loser would want to give you a gift, though\" The guard remarked, an arrogant smirk plastered on his lips before he quickly left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdachi's gaze then turned to the white box that laid next to him. Holding it up, he couldn't find a trace of any designs or text on it; it was a plain, white box. Satiating his curiosity, he opened the box to reveal a small piece of paper and what looked like a remote control - though it's button layout seemed bizarre and alien. Confused by this gift, he opened the folded piece of paper that accompanied the remote. Reading through it, it seemed to be a set of instructions for the device and outlined the absurd functions it supposedly had: body swapping, shapeshifting and possession. It was simply ludicrous; these things just don't exist in the real world. <i>Some nut-job must've sent me this either as a prank or because they're schizophrenic</i> He thought, shaking his head. However, a small voice in the back of his head was telling him to try it. After all, he had the power to enter TVs - did body swapping seem that outlandish compared to that? His curiosity continued to build and build as he thought about it. If it did work, this could be the opportunity he was waiting for, something to spice up his life again and help escape from his drab cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to begin with a small test. If the note was correct, the possession function would turn him into a ghost that would be invisible to others. A perfect, discrete trial. Holding up the remote to himself, he pressed the possession button and suddenly felt weightless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down to see that he was floating above his own body, now a translucent ghost. <i>So it does work</i> Adachi though as he smirked. Looking down at his body, he watched it lay against the cell wall, sighing in boredom without the remote. It seemed that, while he was using the possession function, his body would act on its own, alleviating him of worry. With his test concluded, he flew back into his body as the remote reappeared in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is perfect. Maybe there is a god if I've received this.</i> he though as he began to formulate his escape plan. Obviously, he couldn't escape in his own body and would need to use the remote to take another. Neither shapeshifting or unaware swap would work as he'd still be in the cell, leaving only possession and aware swap as his only two options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he used possession, he could simply leave the jail as a ghost and then freely take any body he wanted and continue his spree from there as his body kept up an act to deceive the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he used aware swap, he could switch with a guard and leave in their body, leaving the guard to rot in jail as him, which would be hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, which function did he choose? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had just received his mission orders from Saix and was purchasing items from the Organization's Moogle in preparation for that mission. While browsing through what the Moogle was selling Roxas saw four new spells for sale. \"What do these ones do?\" He asked the Moogle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a good eye, Kupo. These are limited edition spells that won't be for sale for long, Kupo.\" The Moogle told Roxas and then explained to him what each of the four spells did. The spells seemed to be designed to change the bodies of the caster and whoever else the spells were used on. Roxas couldn't think of what he would use the spells for, but he chose to purchase them anyway, after all, Spells were spells and you never know when one will be useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had the spells equipped, he talk to Saix to begin his mission. Which world was Roxas being sent to on this mission?</span></div></div>",

Once on the other side, he found himself on one of the little islands around Neverland. Roxas tried to fly, but it appeared that the pixie dust had run out and he could no longer fly. He looked around, but he was unable to find Tinkerbell. How was he supposed to continue this mission if he was unable to fly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Roxas remembered, he had those spells that he had bought from the Moogle! He looked at his inventory and saw that just like his other spells, it seemed that these all had a limited use rate for the mission. Since he had bought one of each, he could only cast each one once during this mission. They should recharge after the mission though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas considered his options, if he couldn't find Tinkerbell, the he could just become her and fly with her wings, one of the spells he bought was called Morpha, meaning that his body transform into Tinkerbell's until he was done with the mission. He wasn't sure if he could handle fighting the heartless if he was so tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of seeing neither Tinkerbell or any Heartless, Roxas decided that he had no other choice and began to cast the Morpha spell on himself. He closed his eyes and thought of Tinkerbell while casting the spell. When he opened his eyes, he felt shorter and lighter. He also felt a breeze around his legs. He opened his eyes and looked downward at himself. The spell had worked and he had been transformed into the tiny fairy Tinkerbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas tried to gasp, but was unable to. In fact, he was unable to speak at all! He remembered that Tinkerbell hadn't talked to him anytime he saw her, but he didn't know that she was completely unable to speak, thankfully he didn't have a partner on this mission, so he shouldn't have to speak at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas tried to summon his Keyblade, thankfully he was able to. His Keyblade had thanfully shrunk to fit his new form. He tried to use his new wings and thankfully they worked and he was able to fly around Neverland. Now that he could explore the islands, it was time to hunt some Emblem Heartless. He flew out in search of them</span></div></div>",

The way the spell was described to him to work was that it would 'Make you someone else' while that description was vague, Noctis had at least some idea of what it would do.

He could try it right now on himself quick and easy to see if it worked, or he could try it with his friends.
