To their relief, they hadn't been attacked lately, and nothing too bad had happened to them. As they did, they all suddenly heard a beeping noise coming from their Digivices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, whats going on?\" Tai questioned as he and the others all reached for their Digivices to see why they were suddenly acting like they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Sora replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all checked their Digivices, they saw some flashing lights on their screen that represented them, and another one that appeared to be a distance away from them. \"It looks like their showing us something is nearby.\" Izzy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the question is, what?\" Matt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we check it out?\" T.K. asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It might be too dangerous. I say we should ignore it.\" Joe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think everything is too dangerous, Joe.\" Gomamon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If our Digivices are telling us where something is, that probably means we should check it out.\" Tai said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe its telling us we should avoid it.\" Matt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should check it out.\" Izzy said. \"Whether its dangerous or not, right now we have no way of knowing what the case is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't have to worry about any danger with us here.\" Agumon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then its decided.\" Tai said. And with that, they all made their way to the location that was being shown to them by their Digivices. When they did, they found themselves in a clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the place, but I don't see anything out of the ordinary.\" Sora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably check around then.\" Tentomon said. \"Maybe we'll find something if we look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at his suggestion, the group all spread out to look for anything that might catch their eye as what might have alerted their Digivices. After a while, Tai and Agumon noticed something on the ground, and saw a strange object that looked like crest with a question mark on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, come check this out.\" Tai said as he called everyone else, and they gathered around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Kari wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like a crest.\" T.K. said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a Crest? Like the ones we have?\" Mimi questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it.\" Joe said. \"But why is it here? I mean, I don't think theres any more Digidestined, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai then reached down to pick it up to get a better look at it. As the group took a closer look at it, it suddenly began to glow brightly, and emitted a bright flash of light that engulfed them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what will happen to them?</span></div></div>",

He also had a whistle around his neck. He ran to a river nearby and saw the reflection of his little sister. Tai only had one reaction to this, \"AWWWWWWWW! I'm Kari!!!!!!!\" He began to hyperventilate, but eventually calmed down and ran to where his body was sleeping. He tried to wake it up, \"Kari! Kari! Kari!

He was still a bit sleepy from last night. He had the strangest dream. He was back at the Gekomon Palace where he first encountered Mimi after he came back to the digital world to deal with Myotismon. Except the roles were reversed. Tai was dressed and acting exactly like Mimi complete with her princess gown while Mimi was dressed and acting exactly like Tai. There were also Joe and Gomamon who were dressed as bunnies. It was a weird dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sleepiness started to wore off Tai noticed that something was off about his clothes. He looked down and he noticed a familiar shade of pink on his clothes. \"No! It couldn't be!\" Tai said with shock. He ran over to the nearest pond to try to wake himself up. But when he got to the pond he got a good look at his reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ahhhhh!\" Tai screamed. He thought he was still dreaming for a moment there but he quickly realized that he was wrong. Tai was wearing a red western-styled dress with a buttoned turtleneck, a dark brown belt with a golden buckle, light brown gloves with brown straps around the wrists, pink socks and brown and white shoes. He also noticed that his hair was not in its usual style but it was loose and falling past his shoulders. Tai can confirm that he's dressed like Mimi. But why and how are his main questions. But before he can continue on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tai!\" Tai heard someone shout over the distance. He turned to the source of the sound which came from the bushes. Out of the bushes came Matt. \"Tai are you alright?\" Matt said with concern in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Matt got a good look at Tai in his new clothes what was his reaction? Was he aware or unaware?</span></div></div>",

She gave Matt a copy of her standard outfit and left him to change.  Matt stripped out of his clothes and put on the underwear. It was a pair of pink panties and a matching training bra. Next came the worst part, Mimi's red dress. Now that he was wearing the dress he grabbed the pink socks and brown boots. He finished off the look with a ridiculous pink cowboy hat. He was embarrassed to come out but he had no choice. When Mimi saw him she started clapping and giggling. She was happy that Matt had a much better look now.

It's currently Kari's turn as she spun the bottle. The bottle slowly stopped moving until it was pointing to Matt. \"Okay Matt, truth or dare.\" Kari said with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dare.\" Matt said with a smug look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I dare you to wear my clothes.\" Kari said as she was looking at her dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" Matt said with a shocked look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari was now at her dresser looking to see which of her clothes she'll have Matt wear. She eventually decided to pick her usual outfit which consists of a yellow shirt with two white buttons in the top, pink pants, a pink scarf, white socks, red and white sneakers, and even some pink panties covered in hearts. \"Okay Matt I got the clothes that I want you to wear. Come with me into the bathroom and I'll help you put them on.\" Kari said as she gave the clothes to Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt, with his cheeks glowing red, took the bundle of clothes and went into the bathroom with Kari. He took off his normal clothes and began to put on Kari's clothes. He first put on the panties, then he put on the pink pants, the yellow shirt, the socks and sneakers, and finally Kari tied the pink scarf around his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I almost forgot.\"  Kari said as she got out her whistle and put it around Matt's neck. \"Oh Matt, you looked so cute.\" Kari said. Matt looked at himself in the mirror and couldn't help but feel utterly ridiculous being dressed in little girl clothes. But he realized that they fit surprisingly well on him. \"Come on, the others have got to see you.\" Kari said as she took Matt's hand and led him out of the bathroom. Matt didn't want to let your friends see him like this but he knew that he'll only delay the inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Matt and Kari exited the bathroom and you were in plain sight of the other digidestined.

I have dresses in pink, yellow, white, and many other colors for weddings, parties, dances and even some casual ones for hanging around. But my mom's personal favorites are those frilly ones with poofy sleeves for the parties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Matt, want to model those dresses for us?\" Mimi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt didn't even look at them directly. He just stared downward with an angered and embarrassed look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora went up to Matt. \"We've got a lot of pictures of you with your new look Matt. If you don't want any to leak out, why not put on a show for us.\" Sora said with a smirk on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Matt do? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tai shook his head. What just happened? The last thing he remembered was him and Kari sitting in front of Tai's computer, trying to find a way to go to the Digital World whenever they wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the computer screen had started to glow, and an odd kind of stone had floated out of it. When he tried to pick it up to better look at it, it had engulfed both him, his room and Kari in a blinding light, causing him and his little sister to fall down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tai sat up, he could feel that someone was gently shaking him, apparently to wake him up. That someone, was Kari, his little sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Tai! Wake up! Wake up!\" Tai heard Kari exclaiming frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" said Tai, still a bit disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something weird has happened, Tai!\" insisted Kari. \"See for yourself!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking the remaining stars out of his eyes, Tai looked over at his sister. Any hint of disorientation and fatigue disappeared at what he saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari was standing right by him, not surprising in itself. What was surprising was her current appearance. Somehow Kari was now dressed as Tai; a blue T-shirt with orange stars on the sleeves, a yellow pocket on each side of the chest, and three yellow buttons in the top, over a slightly longer yellow T-shirt with a turtleneck collar, brown cargo shorts, a black wristband on the left arm, white gloves, white socks, and blue and white sneakers with yellow triangles on them. All of it Tai's and all of it currently worn by Kari! But what was most shocking was her hair which is now styled and cut to look like Tai's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a hunch Tai ran over to the nearest mirror and looked at himself. Unfortunately, his hunch was right. Tai stared at the clothes he now wore; a yellow shirt with two white buttons in the top, a pink scarf around the neck, pink pants, white socks, red and white sneakers, and Kari's whistle. He was dressed exactly like Kari, but not just that, his hair was also cut and styled to look like Kari's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaahhh!!!\" screamed Tai, gently tugging on Kari's pink pants, as he quickly got to his feet. \"What's going on, Kari?! Why am I wearing all of your clothes?! This isn't some kind of prank, is it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Tai, it's not a prank!\" defended Kari, lightly pulling on Tai's shirt. \"And I don't know what happened! All I remember was that strange light coming from that stone. Next thing I know, I was laying on the floor and in your clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... the stone!\" exclaimed Tai. \"That stone must have swapped our clothes around, with that strange light! Hey, if the stone is what swapped our clothes around, then we could use it to switch them back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you may be right, Tai,\" agreed Kari, her mood soaring. \"Quick, lets find it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as they searched throughout the room for the stone and found that it had vanished, Kari's mood dropped again. She quickly turned to where some family pictures were hung up on their wall. A quick look indicated to her that something bigger is going on than just simply a swap of clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Tai?\" Kari called. Tai quickly turned to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah what is it Kari?\" asked Tai. Kari quickly handed him a couple family pictures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that stone swapped more than just our clothes.\" said Kari as Tai looked through the pictures. One picture was on Tai's latest soccer match last month, but the weird thing was that in his place was Kari. Another picture was Kari's school picture that was taken a couple weeks ago, except with Tai in place of Kari, frilly pink party dress and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" Tai was in shock at what was on those pictures. Does everyone think that Tai is now Kari and vice versa. Little did he know that he was completely right, the stone swapped Tai and Kari's lives. As in the stone screwed everyone's perception on Tai and Kari, leaving everyone to think that Kari is Tai and vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two siblings began to fully understand what just happened to them, they heard someone walking upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kari!\" Tai and Kari could tell that was their mom, Yuuko, calling. She quickly opened the door to see the two swapped siblings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kari. What are you doing? You need to get dressed for the party today.\" said Yuuko. With that, Tai and Kari remembered that she was supposed to go to her friend's birthday party today. Tai's cheeks quickly turned red as he knew that his mom believes that he's Kari and he has go to a little girl's birthday party today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tai, I need to help your sister get ready. Just go downstairs and watch TV for a bit.\" said Yuuko as she gently led Kari out of the room. This left her helping Tai get ready for the birthday party today.</span></div></div>",

He had hair in his eyes, but that was strange his hair always stood up defying gravity. He felt something around his neck he touched his neck and pulled off a scarf a pink scarf. Tai panicked,  \"AH! WHY DO I HAVE KARI'S SCARF!\" He realized he had his sister's voice and body.<br>\r\nKari started to wake up she went rub what felt like bump on her head, but when she went to rub she felt Tai's goggles on her head. She looked around and saw her own body freaking out. She went over to her body that was currently freaking out.<br>\r\nShe asked, \"Tai is that you?\" It was her brother's voice that asked the question. Her body nodded and began to cry, \"I'm suppose to be the big brother not the little sister.\" Kari gave her now younger sister a hug to comfort her, \"At least now I can take care of you for a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Agumon in Gatomon's body started to wake up. He said, \"Why do I feel so different? I feel softer and is there something on my tail?\" His or rather Gatomon's eyes widened, \"Why do I sound like Gatomon?\" He looked at his body and saw he had Gatomon's body and panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGatomon began to wake up in Agumon's body and saw her own body panicking. She looked at herself and saw she had Agumon's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled, \"Could things get any worse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the siblings and both digimon partners calmed down they all decided to go back and meet up with the others and bring the rock with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes anyone else swap when they get to camp?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt shook his head. What just happened? The last thing he remembered was him and T.K. sitting in front of Matt's computer, trying to find a way to go to the Digital World whenever they wanted, because Patamon was feeling homesick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the computer screen had started to glow, and an odd kind of stone had floated out of it. When he tried to pick it up to better look at it, it had engulfed both him, his room and T.K. in a blinding light, causing him and his little brother to fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matt sat up, he could feel that someone was gently shaking him, appearently to wake him up. That someone, was T.K., his little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Matt! Wake up! Wake up!\" Matt heard T.K. exclaiming frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, T.K.?\" said Matt, still a bit disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something weird has happened, Matt!\" insisted T.K. \"See for yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking the remaining stars out of his eyes, Matt looked over at his brother. Any hint of disorientation and fatigue disappeared at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT.K. was standing right beside him, itself not that surprising. What was surprising, was the clothes he was wearing. Somehow, T.K. was now wearing his clothes; a green vest over a light green shirt with long sleeves, khaki shorts, yellow socks, green and white strapped tennis shoes, a green backpack, and an odd green hat with a blue gem stone. All of it Matt's and all of it currently worn by T.K.!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a hunch, Matt looked down at himself. Unfortunately, his hunch was right. Matt stared at the clothes he now wore; a sleeveless green shirt, brown gloves, blue jeans, dark brown shoes with gray soles and white socks. He was wearing all of T.K.'s clothes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaahhh!!!\" screamed Matt, gently tugging on T.K.'s blue jeans, as he quickly got to his feet. \"What's going on, T.K.?! Why am I wearing all of your clothes?! This isn't some kind of prank, is it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Matt, it's not a prank!\" defended T.K., lightly pulling on Matt's vest. \"And I don't know what happened! All I remember was that strange light coming from that stone. Next thing I know, I was laying on the floor and wearing all of your clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... the stone!\" exclaimed Matt. \"That stone must have swapped our clothes around, with that strange light! Hey, if the stone is what swapped our clothes around, then we could use it to switch them back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you may be right, Matt,\" agreed T.K., his mood soaring. \"Quick, lets find it!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as they searched all of Matt's room for the stone and found that it had vanished, T.K.'s mood dropped again. He would feel a lot better, if he knew what had REALLY happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt had only been half right; the stone had swapped something, but it wasn't their clothes. The truth was, that both Matt and T.K. were wearing their usual clothes. However, the stone had swapped both of their perceptions on whose clothes belonged to whom, causing them to think that their normal clothes, really belonged to each other. (Not that either of them knew, of course.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing at not finding the stone, Matt by chance looked at himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Man, I look ridiculous wearing T.K.'s clothes,' thought Matt, as he switched between looking down at himself and looking at his reflection. Matt then noticed that T.K. had come over to also look in the mirror. He found it very disconcerting to see his little brother wearing his clothes, but not as disconcerting as he felt, wearing the clothes of his little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over himself again, Matt thought: 'I know I shouldn't be critical of what T.K. wears, that's his own choice. But still... they do feel uncomfortable. Like those gloves of his.' Matt raised his hands to look at T.K.'s gloves. 'I don't mind wearing gloves during the winter, but to wear them every day? No way I could do that!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking downwards, Matt thought: 'Then there's his shirt.' He gently tugged on T.K.'s shirt to better look at it. 'I don't get the point of a sleeveless shirt. Why leave your arms bare? No, I'd rather have my long-sleeved shirt and my vest over this, any day.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's the same deal with his jeans,' thought Matt, while also tugging on T.K.'s jeans, to better look at them. 'Why T.K. would want to completely cover his legs, I'll never know. There's so much fabric, that one can hardly move in them! There's also his shoes.' Matt looked at his feet, to look at T.K.'s shoes. 'They feel as stiff as a board; not at all like my soft tennis shoes. Plus, I feel so exposed without my hat.' Matt sighed again. 'T.K. sure has an odd fashion sense.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight next to Matt, T.K. was thinking close to the same thing. 'I know Matt is older than me, but that is no excuse for not choosing some comfortable clothes to wear. Like something other than this shirt and vest.' T.K. used one hand to tug at Matt's vest and the other hand to tug at a sleeve of Matt's shirt. 'I don't like wearing Matt's shirt; I prefer to have my arms bare. That's why I have a sleeveless shirt in the first place. And why does he wear a vest, when he's already got a shirt? I don't understand Matt sometimes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not sure about his shorts, either,' thought T.K., tugging on his brother's shorts. 'I can understand why he would wear them during summer, but he seems to wear them all of the time. That's why I wear jeans instead, I don't want to get cold. His shoes also feel weird.' T.K. leaned slightly forwards, so he could look at his feet, currently inside Matt's tennis shoes. 'They are so much softer, than I'm comfortable with. How can Matt even wear them? It feels like my feet are trapped in marshmallows! No, I'd rather be wearing my own shoes. They might be a little stiff, but they're nice to wear.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't say the same for this hat, though,' thought T.K., as he looked at Matt's hat in the mirror. 'Why would he want to cover his head like this? It's nice to feel the wind blowing through your hair, but Matt can't feel that if he wears this. Besides, it just looks silly.' T.K. looked at himself in the mirror again. 'Boy, do I look funny wearing Matt's clothes,' thought T.K. and tugged on the clothes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Be careful, T.K.!\" said Matt. \"Those are my favorite clothes you are wearing, so please don't tug on them. I don't want them to tear or get wrinkled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he let go of Matt's clothes, T.K. saw that Matt was tugging on his own sleeveless shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same thing to you, Matt!\" he retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Sorry, T.K.\" apologized Matt and let go of T.K.'s shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's okay, Matt,\" replied T.K.. \"After all, I did it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two brothers just looked at each other for a little while, both thinking about how weird the other one looked in their clothes. Then, in an attempt to lighten the mood, Matt said: \"You know what, T.K.? This situation that we're in gives a whole new meaning to the phrase; 'walking a mile in each others shoes', don't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it does,\" laughed T.K., finding it a bit funny. Swiching back to a normal tone, T.K. asked: \"Hey, speaking of shoes, Matt, why are your tennis shoes so soft? It feels like I'm walking around with pillows on my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" answered Matt, \"I just want my feet to feel comfortable, that's all. Although, I have to confess that that's difficult to do in your shoes, T.K.. These things feel as stiff as an icecube.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I know my shoes aren't as soft as yours, Matt,\" said T.K.. \"But like you said, I want my feet to feel comfortable, and I happen to like how my shoes feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, T.K., I didn't mean it like that,\" apologized Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you didn't, Matt,\" smiled T.K. \"You know, I think it's a good thing that Patamon and Gabumon aren't here right now. They would probably laugh at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe,\" said Matt. He actually felt grateful that their Digimon were over at Tai's house, for their weekly Monopoly night. For some odd reason, Patamon was quite skilled at that game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at T.K. again, Matt asked him: \"So, what do you think we should do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at Matt, T.K. said surprised: \"Why are you asking me? You should decide. After all, you are the oldest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" said Matt. \"But, since I was the one who touched that stone and got us into this mess, I figured that it was your turn to get us out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" said T.K.. \"Hmmm... I'll have to think about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does T.K. decide?</span></div></div>",

Sliding them up his legs, Matt thought: 'It's a good thing that I got these back. They are just my size,' Having gotten the briefs fully on by now, Matt turned to look at himself in the mirror. 'Now, that's much better,' he thought. 'It would have been awkward if I had worn T.K.'s briefs, instead of my own.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, Matt really WAS wearing T.K.'s briefs now! Being too small for him, the briefs were a little constricting on his crotch and didn't completely cover neither his 'tender parts', nor his buttocks. But, because of his swapped perception, Matt didn't notice any of this, as he thought that the briefs were really his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt then focused on the shorts. Somehow, he got his legs through them, without ripping them, and though they were only the size of boxers on his large frame, and also quite tight on him,  Matt was still pleased to wear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up for Matt, was the shirt and vest. Again, he just barely managed to put the too-small clothes on, without causing them to tear. Being undersized on him, the sleeves of the shirt only made it down to his elbows and both the shirt and the vest didn't completely cover his torso, both stopping at about midways on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it was time for the footwear. While Matt had no trouble putting them on, the socks only came up to just above his ankles because of their small size. The same thing could not be said about the shoes. Matt had quite a bit of difficulty getting his feet into a pair of tennis shoes, that was a few sizes too small for him. When he finally did manage to get them on, he didn't notice that the shoes were somewhat constricting on his feet, because he thought the shoes were his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was only the hat and the backpack left. Putting on the hat first, Matt didn't realize that it was really too small for him, causing it to simply balance loosely on the top of his head. Lastly; because of his long arms, getting them through the straps of the backpack was somewhat of a chore, but he managed to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Finally, I'm back in my own clothes, again,' thought Matt, as he looked at himself in the mirror. 'Man, it felt so weird to wear T.K.'s clothes. It's a good thing that crazy stone only swapped our clothes; who knows what other strange things could have happened.' Turning towards T.K.'s side of the room, Matt added: 'I wonder how far T.K. has made it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time Matt was putting on what he thought were his clothes, T.K. was doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I 'd never have guessed that the stone would even swap my underwear with Matt's,' thought T.K., as he put on what he thought was his own briefs. 'I'm really glad that I got my own briefs back. It'll be a couple more years before I'm old enough to wear that size,' he added, unaware that he was actually wearing Matt's briefs. But, because of their size, he had to hold them up, so they wouldn't slide off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT.K. then turned his attention to the jeans. Being much too large for him to wear normally, T.K. had to roll up the jeans-legs a great deal, before he could get them on his comparatively tiny legs. Again, he also had to hold up the jeans with his hands, to stop them from falling off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, T.K. put on the sleeveless shirt. Since the shirt was really Matt's, (not that either of them realized that, due to the stone), it was very oversized on T.K.'s small body. It was so oversized, that the bottom edge of the shirt went all the way down to his knees. Of course, since T.K. had to use both hands to put on the shirt, both the jeans and the briefs he was wearing fell down around his ankles, causing T.K. to blush in embarrasment and quickly pull them back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, T.K. put on what he thought to be his footwear, sitting down to prevent 'his' briefs and jeans from falling down again. Matt's socks were so big on him, that they almost covered his legs completely. But that was nothing, compared to the shoes. T.K.'s small feet were practically swimming in Matt's big shoes; they were that loose on him! Everytime he took a step, his feet would slosh around inside the shoes, making it hard for him to walk like he usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that was left now, was the gloves. As T.K. put them on, still sitting down, he didn't realize the fact that they were really too big for him, the gloves being very loose on his hands and his fingers not filling out the fingers in the gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking he was now dressed like he normally was, T.K. stood back up, both of his hands still holding up the briefs and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Much better!' he thought, as he looked at himself in the mirror on his side of the room. 'It so nice to be clad in my own clothes again. It felt so wierd wearing all of Matt's clothes; they didn't fit me at all.' Turning towards Matt's side of the room, T.K. added: 'I wonder how far Matt has gotten.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth brothers looked at each other, at the exact same time and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You look like yourself again, Matt!\" exclaimed T.K.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so do you, T.K.,\" said Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, they only thought that because of the stone. Anyone not affected by it, would have seen things as they really were: Matt being squeezed into the, to him, too small clothes of his 7-year old little brother, and T.K. nearly swimming in the, to him, too big clothes of his 10-year old big brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them stood there, happy that they were wearing their own clothes again, the telephone suddenly rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it!\" called T.K., as he hurried into the living room as fast as he could, which wasn't that fast. Because he was wearing Matt's clothes, T.K. had to walk relatively slow, so that his feet wouldn't swim around too much in the shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he made it into the living room, T.K. had to move over a chair he could stand on, so he could reach the phone. Moving the chair and crawling onto it while making sure his briefs and jeans didn't fall down, was quite a chore for T.K., but he did it. T.K. then answered the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he put down the phone, Matt came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was it?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Gabumon,\" answered T.K.. \"He and Patamon have decided to sleep over at Tai's place for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me,\" said Matt. \"But what should we do in the meantime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

All of a sudden, her entire body was glowing white. It suddenly dimmed, but her skin was now covered in snow white fur. Her hair turned white and receded into her head. Her ears moved to the top of her head and changed into little stubs. Her nose then turned into a little black bear nose. She suddenly cringed and shouted as her face began crunching out, turning into a small muzzle. Her scarf untied itself and wrapped around her forehead, turned green and became a strange headband. Her whistle split in half, turning into and orange arm gaurd and a silver shoulder pad. Her top turned green turned into straps with a hexagon-shaped buckle. Her shorts and socks simply dissapeared. Her shoes changed color and grew into green and orange snow boots. Her backpack remained, but inside appeared a large launcher. Red/Brown striped appeared on her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the matter of a minute, Kari had become the Legendary Spirit of Ice, Kumamon.

As they did, they all suddenly heard a beeping noise coming from their D-3s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, whats going on?\" Davis questioned as he and the others all reached for their D-3s to see why they were suddenly acting like they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Yolei replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all checked their D-3s, they saw some flashing lights on their screen that represented them, and another one that appeared to be a distance away from them. \"It looks like their showing us something is nearby.\" Ken said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the question is, what?\" T.K. said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we check it out?\" Cody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If our Digivices are telling us where something is, that probably means of course we should check it out.\" Davis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe its telling us we should avoid it.\" T.K. said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should check it out.\" Kari said. \"Whether its dangerous or not, right now we have no way of knowing what the case is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't have to worry about anything with us here.\" Veemon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then its decided.\" Davis said. And with that, they all made their way to the location that was being shown to them by their D-3s. When they did, they found themselves in a clearing, and in the center, they saw a strange Digi-Egg in the center of .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Digi-Egg?\" Gatomon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought all your old crests were accounted for.\" Yolei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet, here it is.\" Hawkmon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what is it doing here?\" Patamon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to it, they look it over. It was black and white, with a symbol that looked like a question mark in the center of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we take it?\" Cody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" T.K. said. \"I'm not sure why, but I've got a bad feeling about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I say we should.\" Davis said. \"I mean, it wouldn't be the first Digi-Egg we found that wasn't for one of your old crests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we could try and take it, and have Izzy take a look at it.\" Kari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does sound like a good idea.\" Cody said. \"And I guess we shouldn't just leave it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that settles it.\" Yolei said. \"So, who wants to do the honors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll try first.\" Davis said as he then reached down to pick it up, and lifted it up without any trouble. \"See? Nothing to it.\" he said as he held it out for everyone to see as they all gathered around it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the flash subsiding, the group of humans and digimon alike blinked slowly to regain their vision.  Once clear, the group quickly descended into a flurry of, \"What was that's\" and \"I don't know\" or \"Are you okay?\"  Thankfully everyone was okay.  With a group sigh, the group was relieved for they knew how dangerous the Digital world could be and having apparently escaped the effects of the light was a real blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to find out any possible information, Ken pulled out his digivice in hopes of finding some sort of clue as to what the egg was.  To his luck, the digivice still had a lock on the strange energy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis then noticed Ken's thinking face and walked over to him.  \"You got something Ken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Davis, I do,\" answered Ken as he began to do some calculations.  \"It seems whatever we did might have awoken the egg.  It's currently heading farther into the continent at a pretty respectable pace, I'd say at least 60 to 70 miles per hour.  If we hurry now, we might be able to keep it in range of our digivices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, I'd say we leave the egg alone,\" began T.K who brought everyone else's attention to the discussion, \"but I think our we definitely need to try and follow it if we can.  We have no idea what that egg did to us.  By finding the egg and bringing it to Izzy, we might find out what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus,\" added Yolei, \"It might be a source of super digital power.  Who knows what might happen if it got into the wrong hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody nodded at the prospect.  \"We should definitely search it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" shouted Davis, \"Then I guess we have a course of action.  Let's follow that egg!  Yolei, Digivolve Hawkmon so we can follow the egg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would believe that would normally be the perfect idea Davis,\" hopped in Hawkmon, \"But, unfortunately the canopy over the heads is took think for me to grow.  Not to mention that due to my lack of energy, I wouldn't be able to digivolve anyway.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to accentuate his point a collective growl from everyone's stomach, signaled that it was time to have some lunch.  \"Well, I guess we can't exactly follow the egg on an empty stomach.  Veemon?  How far away is the nearest food grove, you know apples and such?\"  The little blue digimon thought for probably a few seconds before snapping his fingers and pointing towards a rocky ridge that was quite far away.  \"Just over that ridge.  It's a pretty nice place, I've eaten in that grove a few times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooner we get there, the sooner we can find out what that egg is all about, let's go team,\" rallied Davis as he started running.  The rest of the group followed shortly after, though thankfully Davis slowed down to allow everyone to travel in a group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group continued through the thick forest and tightly woven canopy, a few of the party noticed small issues.  Davis, for instance, quite finding his tongue with his pointed tooth.  The thing is he swore they had gotten sharper, but this was just a fleeting thought as he had to focus on where he stepped in the mangled mess of tree roots and ancient vines.  Yolei began to scratch occasionally, nothing too bothersome just the occasional odd itch.  The rest of the Digidestined suffered other minor things hardly worth noting, except for Kari.  As the brown-haired girl walked along, she found she was having considerable trouble.  Sure the ground was a literal knot of roots, plants, and old tree limbs, but for some reason, Kari felt as if she was having  more trouble than she should.  Her shoes seemed to be the major source of the problem.  For some reason, Kari's shoes actually felt too big for her feet, causing her feet to shift about in the shoe whenever she felt she had a good foot hold.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGatomon soon noticed Kari's troubles.  \"Kari, is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Kari trying to play off her difficulties.  \"I've got thiii~!\"  That is all Kari was able to say before her right foot slipped into a wooden crevice.  Looking to where her foot was caught, Kari found she was rather stuck.  Yank as she did, all Kari managed to do was frustrate herself even more.  Finally, not wanting to slow down the group anymore, Kari reached down, pulled off her pink and white shoe, and breathed a sigh of relief.  Never had Kari felt a pleasure like she did now.  For some unexplainable reason, Kari felt so pleased to be free of her shoe.  Wiggling her toes as if on instinct, Kari was in such a mix of pleasure and relief that she did not notice the lack of two toes.  With already one shoe off and her friends calling to her in the distance, Kari wasted no time and tore off her other shoe, feeling that same level of pleasure.  Setting her white socked feet to the ground. Kari quickly not only rejoined her friends, but raced passed them.  Now with her feet free, Kari was able to find more secure foot placements and with little effort, lead the team through the forest to the base of the ridgeline.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Kari,\" spoke Gatomon as she rejoined her friend, the team still a few yards off, \"When did you get moves like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know,\" answered the tamer, \"Once I took off my shoes, it came pretty naturally to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After living with you humans for so long, I still have no clue why you people bother with such confining things,\" said the cat as she took a position similar to Kari as they waited for the team to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Gatomon,\" said Kari as she looked at her shoes and remembering the pleasure she had felt earlier, \"I'm right there with you.  I'm surprised I never tried this sooner.\"  Kari then tossed her shoes to the ground and waited for the others.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a lovely day in the Digital World. Davis had decided to go on a solo trip, to hang out with Veemon, without the others being there, for a change. They were currently walking through the forest, when Davis saw something on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh, what's that?' he said as he picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out to be a very strange stone of some kind. It was shaped like a five-pronged star and unusually shiny in colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What'cha' got there, Davis?' asked Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not quite sure, Veemon. It looks like an odd kind of rock, to me,' said Davis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can I see it?' asked Veemon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure. Here you go, pal,' said Davis and held out the stone so Veemon could take it. But, as soon as Veemon touched the stone in Davis' hand, the stone started to glow very brightly, as though an entire lighthouse was inside of it. Davis and Veemon both had to cover thier eyes, and for a few moments, they couldn't see anything. As the light slowly faded back into the stone, nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary. However, the rock had indeed caused something to change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis and Veemon were blinking hard to shake off the effects of the bright light. As they recovered, they voiced their opinions on the odd behavior of the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What just happened, Veemon?' said Davis, as his eyesight slowly returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know, Davis,' said Veemon and looked up at his partner. 'But that was one wierd light, don't you...' He trailed off and stared at his partner, who still couldn't see fully, yet. Then Veemon looked down at himself and stared even more. He then stared from Davis, to himself and back again a few more times. He then blushed in embarrasment and nervously tried to cover himself with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Actually... I think I did know what happened,' said Veemon meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really? What was it, then?,' said Davis, who had finally gotten his complete eyesight back, but currently wasn't looking at Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Erm... Take a look at what you are wearing,' was the answer from Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis looked down at himself. He was wearing his normal Digi-World outfit; the blue jacket with flame patterns, brown shorts and shoes, gloves and goggles. However, as he was looking at it, something clicked inside his mind and he began to think that the clothes he was wearing, actually belonged to Veemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(These wierd thoughts, that the two of them were having, was due to the effects of the strange rock they found, but they didn't realize anything was wrong with how they thought; they just thought it was normal.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, he began to flip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!' Davis screamed, also blushing in embarrasment, as he pulled on his jacket a little, to better look at it. 'V-Veemon! W-Why am I suddenly wearing your clothes?!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think it was maybe because of that stupid rock,' said Veemon, as he fidgeted nervously, still trying to cover himself with his hands. 'When we both touched it at the same time, it must have made us swap outfits. But because you don't normally wear anything, I've ended up naked!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis looked over at his partner and couldn't hold back a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Man, Veemon. You look so silly without your clothes on!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, you look silly, WITH clothes on!' was Veemon's response. 'Anyway, we shouldn't stay out here in plain sight for long; not while looking like this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon looked around the area, searching for something specific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Over there,' said Veemon and pointed at some bushes. 'We can change our outfits back, behind those bushes. And the sooner, the better,' he added. 'I feel so uncomfortable being in the nude. I don't understand how you how you can go like that all the time, Davis.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Tell me about it,' sighed Davis, looking distinctly uncomfortable wearing his own clothes, (though he did not percieve them to be his clothes anymore), as they walked behind the bushes. 'I don't get how you can even wear these things, Veemon. They just feel so..... stuffy and constricting. I don't feel well, at all, in this,' he added, as he touched the clothes, that (in his mind) belonged to his best friend. Truthfully, he did find the (to him) alien sensation of having clothes on, to be a little bit facinating, but not so much so, that he would like to have them on for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, speak for yourself,' said Veemon. 'I don't know how I would make it through the day without my clothes on. Speaking of which, would you mind taking my clothes off of you, and give them back to me, now?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Be glad to, Veemon,' said Davis, and blushed. 'But, err... how do I do that?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon mentally slapped himself in the face. Of course, I forgot, he thought. Since Davis doesn't wear clothes, he doesn't know how to put them on, or take them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here, let me help you,' he said out loud, as he walked over to Davis, to do just that. 'First, we're gonna' have to get my shoes and socks off of your feet, so I need you to sit down, Davis. That will make it easier.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ten-four, buddy,' said Davis and sat down on the forest floor. Veemon then went over to Davis and began to undo the straps on the shoes. When that was done, Veemon pulled the shoes off of his best friend's feet. The socks quickly followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis breathed a sigh of relief. His feet had felt so trapped inside those shoes, so he was glad to feel the grass under his bare feet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, Davis,' said Veemon. 'Before I can get those other clothes off of you, you'll have to take off my goggles and gloves, first.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, pal,' said Davis and began to remove the items. But he did so slowly and clumsily, as though he hadn't done it before, (which, in his mind, he hadn't). After taking off the gloves and goggles, he looked at Veemon and asked: 'Alright, buddy. What's next?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Next thing to remove, is the jacket and the shirt,' answered Veemon. 'You need to stand up for this, though,' he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's fine,' said Davis, as he stood back up again. 'You're the expert, Veemon.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's right!' proclaimed Veemon proudly, as he jumped up on a large stone behind Davis, so he could reach him better. 'I need you to stand with your back to me and then lean your arms towards me, so I can take it off,' said Veemon. Davis did as instructed. Veemon then took a firm grip on the jacket and slid it right off of Davis' body. 'Now I need you to face me, lean your torso towards me and put your arms over your head,' said Veemon. Again, Davis did as instructed. Veemon grasped the shirt and slowly pulled it up over Davis' head, his arms, and then fully off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his torso now bare, Davis once more felt relief. Those clothes had felt so restricting to him; he was glad to have them off. Then he realized that there was still one thing remaining, and so did Veemon, both blushing bright crimson at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing how awkward it would be otherwise, Veemon carefully told Davis precisely how to remove the last piece of clothing on him... The shorts. As Davis was fumbling with the button on the shorts, blushing all the while, he and Veemon made a silent agreement to not tell the other Digidestined about this; they would never hear the end of it! Davis finally unclipped the button and took off the shorts. However, there were still one last thing remaining...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't believe this!' exclaimed Davis. 'That stupid rock even gave me your underwear, Veemon!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing so much that his head looked like a tomato, Veemon said: 'Those boxers are easy to remove, though. Just slide them down over your legs and they will come right off, Davis.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis did as Veemon told him and as the final constricting piece of fabric was removed from his body, Davis felt the greatest wave of relief yet. Now that he was finally free of those uncomfortable garments, he felt he could breathe again. And, of course, Veemon had gotten his clothes back, and not a moment too soon. He found it really awkward to watch his partner stroll around in the nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon picked up all of the discarded clothes and said: 'I'm gonna go back there and put these on. I'll be right back!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, buddy,' said Davis, as he watched Veemon retreat behind a bush. The fact that the clothes were made for use by humans, therefore being much too large for Veemon to properly use, was appearently lost on both of them, thanks to the magical rock they had found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Veemon was behind the bush, he immediately began to put on the clothes, starting with the boxers. Though really being too large for him, looing more like shorts on him, he just used his tail as a kind of wegde, to prevent them from falling down, while still allowing him to walk. Then, he put on the shirt. It was so big, it covered his whole body, including his feet, but he took no notice. Next, he put on the shorts, though they were more like a proper pair of pants on his small body, wedging his tail like he did with the boxers, to stop them from coming off. Then he put on 'his' jacket, though he had to roll the sleeves up, to get his tiny arms through them. Then he put on the sock and shoes; somehow maneging to not rip the socks with his claws, the claws also preventing the far too big shoes from slipping off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he put the goggles on his head and Veemon was now fully dressed in what he thought to be his clothes. Despite the clothes being almost monstrously oversized on his body, he felt so much more comfortable now, as compared to when he wasn't wearing anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, that feels so much better,' said Veemon to himself. 'It's really nice to have my good, old clothes back on. When we get back, though, I'd better tell Izzy about that crazy rock. Maybe he can find a way to stop it from making more mischief.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked back around the bush, adjusting 'his' goggles in the meantime, he looked up at his now naked partner and asked: 'So, Davis. Where should we go now?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis thought about it...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a lovely day in the Digital World. Davis had decided to go on a solo trip, to hang out with Veemon, without the others being there, for a change. They were currently walking through the forest, when Davis saw something on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what's that?\" he said as he picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out to be a very strange stone of some kind. It was shaped like a five-pronged star and unusually shiny in colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha' got there, Davis?\" asked Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not quite sure, Veemon. It looks like an odd kind of rock, to me,\" said Davis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see it?\" asked Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Here you go, pal,\" said Davis and held out the stone so Veemon could take it. But, as soon as Veemon touched the stone in Davis' hand, the stone started to glow very brightly. Davis and Veemon both had to cover thier eyes, and for a few moments, they couldn't see anything. As the light slowly faded back into the stone, nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary. However, the rock had indeed caused something to change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis and Veemon were blinking hard to shake off the effects of the bright light. As they recovered, they voiced their opinions on the odd behavior of the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened, Veemon?\" said Davis, as his eyesight slowly returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Davis,\" said Veemon and looked up at his partner. \"But that was one wierd light, don't you...\" He trailed off and stared at his partner, who still couldn't see fully, yet. Then Veemon looked down at himself and stared even more. He then stared from Davis, to himself and back again a few more times. He then blushed in embarrasment and nervously tried to cover himself with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... I think I did know what happened,\" said Veemon meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What was it, then?,\" said Davis, who had finally gotten his eyesight back, but wasn't looking at Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... Take a look at what you are wearing,\" was the answer from Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis looked down at himself. He was wearing his normal Digi-World outfit; the dark blue jacket with a red and yellow flame pattern at the bottom over a light green shirt, dark olive green shorts, dark blue socks, orange and white boots, yellow gloves and silver goggles. However, as he was looking at it, something clicked inside his mind and he began to think that the clothes he was wearing, actually belonged to Veemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wierd thoughts that the two of them were having, was due to the effects of the strange rock they found, but they didn't realize anything was wrong with how they thought; they just thought it was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, he began to flip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!\" Davis screamed, also blushing in embarrasment, as he pulled on Veemon's jacket a little, to better look at it. \"V-Veemon! W-Why am I suddenly wearing your clothes?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it was maybe because of that stupid rock,\" said Veemon, as he fidgeted nervously, still trying to cover himself with his hands. \"When we both touched it at the same time, it must have made us swap outfits. But because you don't normally wear anything, I've ended up naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis looked over at his partner and couldn't hold back a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Veemon. You look so silly without your clothes on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you look silly, WITH clothes on!\" was Veemon's response. \"Anyway, we shouldn't stay out here in plain sight for long; not while looking like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon looked around the area, searching for something specific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there,\" said Veemon and pointed at some bushes. \"We can change our outfits back, behind those bushes. And the sooner, the better,\" he added. \"I feel so uncomfortable being in the nude. I don't understand how you how you can go like that all the time, Davis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" sighed Davis, looking distinctly uncomfortable wearing Veemon's clothes as they walked behind the bushes. \"I don't get how you can even wear these things, Veemon,\" he said, as he gently tugged on Veemon's shirt and jacket. \"They feel really wierd to wear. It's like wearing a curtain or something tightly around my body, at all times. It's unbearable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, speak for yourself,\" said Veemon. \"I don't know how I would make it through the day without my clothes on. Speaking of which, would you mind taking my clothes off and give them back to me, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be glad to, Veemon,\" said Davis, and blushed. \"But, err... how do I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon mentally slapped himself in the face. 'Of course, I forgot,' he thought. 'Since Davis doesn't wear clothes, he doesn't know how to put them on, or take them off.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help you,\" he said out loud, as he walked over to Davis, to do just that. \"First, we're gonna have to get my shoes and socks off of your feet, so I need you to sit down, Davis. That will make it easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten-four, buddy,\" said Davis and sat down on the forest floor. Veemon then went over to Davis and began to undo the straps on the shoes. When that was done, Veemon pulled the shoes off of his best friend's feet. The socks quickly followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis breathed a sigh of relief. His feet had felt so trapped inside those shoes, so he was glad to feel the grass under his bare feet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Davis,\" said Veemon. \"Before I can get those other clothes off of you, you'll have to take off my goggles and gloves first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, pal,\" said Davis and began to remove the items. But he did so slowly and clumsily, as though he hadn't done it before, (which, in his mind, he hadn't). After taking off the gloves and goggles, he looked at Veemon and asked: \"Alright, buddy. What's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next thing to remove, is the jacket and the shirt,\" answered Veemon. \"You need to stand up for this, though,\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine,\" said Davis, as he stood back up again. \"You're the expert, Veemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" proclaimed Veemon proudly, as he jumped up on a large stone behind Davis, so he could reach him better. \"I need you to stand with your back to me and then lean your arms towards me, so I can take it off,\" said Veemon. Davis did as instructed. Veemon then took a firm grip on the jacket and slid it right off of Davis' body. \"Now I need you to face me, lean your torso towards me and put your arms over your head,\" said Veemon. Again, Davis did as instructed. Veemon grasped the shirt and slowly pulled it up over Davis' head, his arms, and then fully off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his torso now bare, Davis once more felt relief. Those clothes had felt so restricting to him; he was glad to have them off. Then he realized that there was still one thing remaining, and so did Veemon, both blushing bright crimson at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing how awkward it would be otherwise, Veemon carefully told Davis precisely how to remove the last piece of clothing on him... The shorts. As Davis was fumbling with the button on the shorts, blushing all the while, he and Veemon made a silent agreement to not tell the other Digidestined about this; they would never hear the end of it! Davis finally unclipped the button and took off the shorts. However, there were still one last thing remaining...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this!\" exclaimed Davis. \"That stupid rock even gave me your underwear, Veemon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing so much that his head looked like a tomato, Veemon said: \"Those boxers are easy to remove, though. Just slide them down over your legs and they will come right off, Davis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis did as Veemon told him and as the final constricting piece of fabric was removed from his body, Davis felt the greatest wave of relief yet. Now that he was finally free of those uncomfortable garments, he felt he could breathe again. And, of course, Veemon had gotten his clothes back, and not a moment too soon. He found it really awkward to watch his partner stroll around in the nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon picked up all of the discarded clothes and said: \"I'm gonna go back there and put these on. I'll be right back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, buddy,\" said Davis, as he watched Veemon retreat behind a bush. The fact that the clothes were made for use by humans, therefore being much too large for Veemon to properly use, was lost on both of them, thanks to the magical rock they had found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Veemon was behind the bush, he immediately began to put on the clothes, starting with the boxers. Though really being too large for him, looking more like shorts on him, he just used his tail as a kind of wegde, to prevent them from falling down, while still allowing him to walk.

Then he put on his jacket, though he had to roll the sleeves up, to get his tiny arms through them. Then he put on the socks and boots; somehow managing to not rip the socks or boots with his claws, the claws also preventing the  boots from slipping off. The gloves was what he put on next. Because Veemon's hands were much like a humans, he could put them on without problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he put the goggles on his head and Veemon was now fully dressed in what he thought to be his clothes. Despite the clothes being almost monstrously oversized on his body, he felt so much more comfortable now, as compared to when he wasn't wearing anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that feels so much better,\" said Veemon to himself. \"It's really nice to have my good, old clothes back on. When we get back, though, I'd better tell Izzy about that crazy rock. Maybe he can find a way to stop it from making more mischief.\" He checked his pocket, confirming Davis' D-Terminal and D-3 was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked back around the bush, adjusting his goggles in the meantime, he looked up at his now naked partner and asked: \"So, Davis. Where should we go now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis thought about it...</span></div></div>",

(So Davis now believes he is really Veemon and Veemon now believes he is really Davis.) However, they still have their regular bodies, but they THINK they have the body corresponding to their new personalities, meaning that even though Veemon has his normal body, he thinks that he is really Davis and so he thinks he has Davis' human body, and so thinks he is taller that he really is, and vice versa for Davis. It also means, that they think they still have their usual skills, but because their bodies haven't changed, they don't have them in reality. (Ergo, since Veemon believes he is really Davis, he also believes that he is the one to carry Davis' D3 and D-Terminal, both needed for Veemon to Digivolve. But because HE is Veemon, just with a different personality, they won't work for him; they only function in Davis' hands, but because Davis now thinks he is really Veemon... well, you get the point.) Also, it is still Veemon's body that is able to use Digimon attacks and Digivolve, not Davis' body; but because Davis thinks he is really Veemon, he thinks that he has those attacks/skills, and because Veemon thinks he is really Davis, he doesn't realize that it is still him, who is the Digimon, and so him that has those abillities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what's your choice?</span></div></div>",

But, as soon as Veemon touched the stone in Davis' hand, the stone started to glow very brightly, as though an entire lighthouse was inside of it. Davis and Veemon both had to cover thier eyes, and for a few moments, they couldn't see anything. As the light slowly faded back into the stone, nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary. However, the rock had indeed caused something to change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis and Veemon were blinking hard to shake off the effects of the bright light. As they recovered, they voiced their opinions on the odd behavior of the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened, Veemon?\" said Davis, as his eyesight slowly returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Davis,\" said Veemon and looked up at his partner. \"But that was one wierd light, don't you...\" He trailed off and stared at his partner, who still couldn't see fully, yet. Then Veemon looked down at himself and stared even more. He then stared from Davis, to himself and back again a few more times. He then blushed in embarrasment and nervously tried to cover himself with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... I think I did know what happened,\" said Veemon meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What was it, then?,\" said Davis, who had finally gotten his complete eyesight back, but currently wasn't looking at Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... Take a look at what you are wearing,\" was the answer from Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis looked down at himself. He was wearing his normal Digi-World outfit; the blue jacket with flame patterns, green shorts and shoes, brown gloves and goggles. However, as he was looking at it, something clicked inside his mind and he began to think that the clothes he was wearing, actually belonged to Veemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(These wierd thoughts, that the two of them were having, was due to the effects of the strange rock they found, but they didn't realize anything was wrong with how they thought; they just thought it was normal.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, he began to flip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!\" Davis screamed, also blushing in embarrasment, as he pulled on 'Veemon's' jacket a little, to better look at it. \"V-Veemon! W-Why am I suddenly wearing your clothes?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it was maybe because of that stupid rock,\" said Veemon, as he fidgeted nervously, still trying to cover himself with his hands. \"When we both touched it at the same time, it must have made us swap outfits. But because you don't normally wear anything, I've ended up naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis looked over at his partner and couldn't hold back a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Veemon. You look so silly without your clothes on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you look silly, WITH clothes on!\" was Veemon's response. \"Anyway, we shouldn't stay out here in plain sight for long; not while looking like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon looked around the area, searching for something specific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there,\" said Veemon and pointed at some bushes. \"We can change our outfits back, behind those bushes. And the sooner, the better,\" he added. \"I feel so uncomfortable being in the nude. I don't understand how you how you can go like that all the time, Davis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" sighed Davis, looking distinctly uncomfortable wearing his own clothes, (though he did not percieve them to be his clothes anymore), as they walked behind the bushes. \"I don't get how you can even wear these things, Veemon. They just feel so..... stuffy and constricting. I don't feel well, at all, in this,\" he added, as he touched the clothes, that (in his mind) belonged to his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, speak for yourself,\" said Veemon. \"I don't know how I would make it through the day without my clothes on. Speaking of which, would you mind taking my clothes off of you, and give them back to me, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be glad to, Veemon,' said Davis, and blushed. 'But, err... how do I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon mentally slapped himself in the face. 'Of course, I forgot,' he thought. 'Since Davis doesn't wear clothes, he doesn't know how to put them on, or take them off.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help you,\" he said out loud, as he walked over to Davis, to do just that. \"First, we're gonna have to get my shoes and socks off of your feet, so I need you to sit down, Davis. That will make it easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten-four, buddy,\" said Davis and sat down on the forest floor. Veemon then went over to Davis and began to undo the straps on the shoes. When that was done, Veemon pulled the shoes off of his best friend's feet. The socks quickly followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis breathed a sigh of relief. His feet had felt so trapped inside those shoes, so he was glad to feel the grass under his bare feet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Davis,\" said Veemon. \"Before I can get those other clothes off of you, you'll have to take off my goggles and gloves, first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, pal,\" said Davis and began to remove the items. But he did so slowly and clumsily, as though he hadn't done it before, (which, in his mind, he hadn't). After taking off the gloves and goggles, he looked at Veemon and asked: \"Alright, buddy. What's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next thing to remove, is the jacket and the shirt,\" answered Veemon. \"You need to stand up for this, though,\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine,\" said Davis, as he stood back up again. \"You're the expert, Veemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" proclaimed Veemon proudly, as he jumped up on a large stone behind Davis, so he could reach him better. \"I need you to stand with your back to me and then lean your arms towards me, so I can take it off,\" said Veemon. Davis did as instructed. Veemon then took a firm grip on the jacket and slid it right off of Davis' body. \"Now I need you to face me, lean your torso towards me and put your arms over your head,\" said Veemon. Again, Davis did as instructed. Veemon grasped the shirt and slowly pulled it up over Davis' head, his arms, and then fully off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his torso now bare, Davis once more felt relief. Those clothes had felt so restricting to him; he was glad to have them off. Then he realized that there was still one thing remaining, and so did Veemon, both blushing bright crimson at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing how awkward it would be otherwise, Veemon carefully told Davis precisely how to remove the last piece of clothing on him... The shorts. As Davis was fumbling with the button on the shorts, blushing all the while, he and Veemon made a silent agreement to not tell the other Digidestined about this; they would never hear the end of it! Davis finally unclipped the button and took off the shorts. However, there were still one last thing remaining...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this!\" exclaimed Davis. \"That stupid rock even gave me your underwear, Veemon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing so much that his head looked like a tomato, Veemon said: \"Those boxers are easy to remove, though. Just slide them down over your legs and they will come right off, Davis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis did as Veemon told him and as the final constricting piece of fabric was removed from his body, Davis felt the greatest wave of relief yet. Now that he was finally free of those uncomfortable garments, he felt he could breathe again. And, of course, Veemon had gotten 'his' clothes back, and not a moment too soon. He found it really awkward to watch his partner stroll around in the nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon picked up all of the discarded clothes and said: \"I'm gonna go back there and put these on. I'll be right back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, buddy,\" said Davis, as he watched Veemon retreat behind a bush. The fact that the clothes were made for use by humans, therefore being much too large for Veemon to properly use, was appearently lost on both of them, thanks to the magical rock they had found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Veemon was behind the bush, he immediately began to put on the clothes, starting with the boxers. Though really being too large for him, looking more like shorts on him, he just used his tail as a kind of wegde, to prevent them from falling down, while still allowing him to walk. Then, he put on the shirt. It was so big, it covered his whole body, including his feet, but he took no notice. Next, he put on the shorts, though they were more like a proper pair of pants on his small body, wedging his tail like he did with the boxers, to stop them from coming off. Then he put on 'his' jacket, though he had to roll the sleeves up, to get his tiny arms through them. Then he put on the socks and shoes; somehow managing to not rip the socks or shoes with his claws, the claws also preventing the far too big shoes from slipping off. The gloves was what he put on next. Because Veemon's hands were much like a humans, he could put them on without problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he put the goggles on his head and Veemon was now fully dressed in what he thought to be his clothes. Despite the clothes being almost monstrously oversized on his body, he felt so much more comfortable now, as compared to when he wasn't wearing anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that feels so much better,\" said Veemon to himself. \"It's really nice to have my good, old clothes back on. When we get back, though, I'd better tell Izzy about that crazy rock. Maybe he can find a way to stop it from making more mischief.\" He checked 'his' pocket, confirming 'his' Digivice and D-3 was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked back around the bush, adjusting 'his' goggles in the meantime, he looked up at his now naked partner and asked: \"So, Davis. Where should we go now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis thought about it...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a lovely day in the Digital World. Davis had decided to go on a solo trip, to hang out with Veemon, without the others being there, for a change. They were currently walking through the forest, when Davis saw something on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what's that?\" he said as he picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out to be a very strange stone of some kind. It was shaped like a five-pronged star and unusually shiny in colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha' got there, Davis?\" asked Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not quite sure, Veemon. It looks like an odd kind of rock, to me,\" said Davis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see it?\" asked Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.

Take a look at what you are wearing,\" was the answer from Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis looked down at himself. He was wearing his normal Digi-World outfit; the dark blue jacket with a red and yellow flame pattern at the bottom over a light green shirt, dark olive green shorts, dark blue socks, orange and white boots, yellow gloves and silver goggles. However, as he was looking at it, something clicked inside his mind and he began to think that the clothes he was wearing, actually belonged to Veemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wierd thoughts that the two of them were having, was due to the effects of the strange rock they found, but they didn't realize anything was wrong with how they thought; they just thought it was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, he began to flip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!\" Davis screamed, also blushing in embarrasment, as he pulled on Veemon's jacket a little, to better look at it. \"V-Veemon!

It's like wearing a curtain or something tightly around my body, at all times. It's unbearable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, speak for yourself,\" said Veemon. \"I don't know how I would make it through the day without my clothes on. Speaking of which, would you mind taking my clothes off and give them back to me, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be glad to, Veemon,\" said Davis, and blushed. \"But, err... how do I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon mentally slapped himself in the face.

They are in the Digital World, as far as they know just the two of them came today. \"It's weird being here without anyone we need to fight.\" Kari laments, looking at her partner Gatomon with a smile. \"It's peaceful...\" Davis chuckles and nods. \"Sure is... Hey, let's go for a swim.\" he suggests without really thinking it through. \"Uh, Davis? We only have the clothes on our backs.\" He nods, \"Oh right, nevermind...\" He sighs. Veemon butts in, \"Just swim in your undies, if you wipe them dry you'll have no trouble.\" Gatomon smiles, \"Sure, I'll stay here and guard your clothes. I don't like getting wet...\" she sticks her tongue out. \"Why thank you, Gatomon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two humans strip down to their undies and dive in, having a nice long swim without even Veemon interrupting their rest. It kind of helps he keeps swimming to get better, while they just swim as they wish. It's not even half an hour before they decide to head back to shore, partly to keep Gatomon from feeling left out, but mostly from being tired. Back at shore they approach Gatomon, wondering what she's doing which amounts to sunbathing. \"Done already?\" she asks with a cute little yawn. \"Yeah, come on.\" She hands them their clothes back, but asks a pretty curious question. \"Why do you guys dress so differently?\" Veemon nods, \"Yeah, you two especially.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari shakes her head, \"It's just what I like to wear, guys. I think I look cute.\" The other 3 agree she does, making her blush a bit. \"I mean, part of it is that I'm a girl and he's a guy, but I'm not sure how to explain our style choices...\" Gatomon smiles, \"Humans are so weird, right Veemon?\" Veemon nods while Davis gets his word in. \"My style is just as good as Kari's.\" Gatomon sticks her tongue out, \"Then why don't you wear pink for a change?\" Kari giggles again, and the boy looks her in the eyes. \"Maybe I'd look good in it, but why don't you take after her?\" Gatomon huffs, and Veemon thinks. \"Why don't you guys trade clothes?\" Gatomon nods, \"Yeah, if you trade clothes for a while, I'll wear whatever Davis wants for a week.\" Veemon smiles, \"I'll wear what Kari wants for a week too, what do you guys say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short discussion, Kari and Davis agree to trade outfits until their Digimon are satisifed they've worn them long enough. They hand each other their clothes. First, Kari dresses in front of the others into Davis' flame jacket, green shorts, and gloves, pulling on his socks and shoes. \"Ugh, this does feel weird, Davis. How do you stand it?\" she feels a lot of room in the shorts, taking out Davis' goggles and wearing them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis stands in front of the others, pulling Kari's shorts high over his waist and tightening her belt to keep it where she does, feeling it push at his genitals just a bit much. Next comes her shirt, a very feminine pink and white that makes him question his decision. It's amazing their shoes fit, he thinks, pulling his feet into Kari's pink and white shoes. He saves her gloves for last, pulling them up and trying to get them over his shoulder, but they fall short of where Kari wears them as is. He stands, blushing softly, looking at the Digimon with Kari at his side now. She slips her necklace around his neck when she comes up to him.</span></div></div>",

As they ate, Kari began to feel an itch on her chest and realised it was coming from her bra. \"You know Davis, if we're to do this swap we should probably change our underwear as well, it's only fair after all.\" Blushing slightly at the prospect, Davis nervously agreed with her and they both  began to strip once again. They both made their way behind opposite sides of a tree when they were in their underwear, Davis finding his boxers to be much tighter than usual while Kari was struggling to keep her panties on. They then finished stripping and handed each other their underwear, Davis blushing as he looked at Kari's heart covered pink panties and matching bra, putting them on shortly after. Struggling to get the bra on, Kari helped him to fasten the straps, not caring that Davis could see her chest freely. They then got dressed once again with Davis fiddling with his bra straps and getting his new panties unwedged from his butt. Finding their new underwear to fit a lot better, the pair were happy with their trade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was happening, Veemon and Gatomon were trying to work out why their partners were acting so strangely, but couldn't place it. Neither pair noticed it, but Davis and Kari had switched hair their during the switch as well, but they seemed to think it was perfectly normal. </span></div></div>",

His eyes darted around him, unsure of what had just happened to him and his partner. Doing his best to grip his nerves, he he pulled his goggles down over his eyes with one hand and gripped the D-Ark in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Darn it, what just happened?' he thought to himself in silence. Shaking himself free of his stupor, Takato shouted out his partner's name, \"Guilmon! Guilmon, where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered through the fog for a few moments until a groggy voice started to mumble something completely incoherent. Takato of course knew what that meant as he only knew of one Digimon that could sound that silly in it's sleep. \"Guilmon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Takato rushed towards the voice until spoke, in a highly feminine manner, \"Just five more minutes, Takatomon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... Guilmon?\" Takato ran even faster now, right up until he saw what he could not have been prepared for... a female version of her partner. It looked so much like his normal design, with a few \"noticeable\" changes. Guilmon's face was much more gentle and cute, almost sexy and her body was tirm, much like that of Renamon's, but much more curvy. Of course, being a teenager meant his eyes first went Guilmon's newest add on: her massive breast and large butt. Then, he noticed that her over all color was lighter, bordering on pink. Other than that, he- she looked just like she normally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally with her eyes slowly opening, Guilmon blinked a few times, looking around as she got up, before expression changed to one of absolute fear. She, now standing only slightly taller than her Tamer, the dino girl digimon grabbed him by his head  and hugged him tight into her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Takatomon! I was having such bad dream! There was lots of pink and-\" Guilmon stopped, sniffing her Tamer's hair, \"You're hair smells nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManaging to pull away to breath Takato , \"This cannot be happening. What are we-\" he paused, noticing that Guilmon was just now realizing that she had breast and was playing with them much like a child. \"Well, what am I gonna do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it over, </span></div></div>",

Where are you?\" Asked Guilmon, in a sultry feminine tone. \"Guilmon, help!\" Exclaimed a voice that sounded very much like Guilmon's. Guilmon walked in to the fog, and found Takato's clothing lying on the ground. Guilmon ran into the fog, and smacked right into another female Guilmon. \"Is that you, Takatomon?\" Asked Guilmon, as she tilted her head in confusion. \"Yes...\" Said Takato begrudgingly, \"I became a copy of you...\" Takato stood up abruptly, causing her massive breasts to bob as he did. He inspected his body, and found it covered in pinkish-red scales, and found that her ass was now massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay Takatomon, we're sisters!\" Exclaimed Guilmon, as she grabbed Takato and hugged him. Guilmon's scaly breasts rubbed against Takato's equally massive melons, as Guilmon hugged his former tamer. \"This isn't a time for games, Guilmon! We've become female Digimon, and we need to return to normal right now!\" Exclaimed Takato, as he searched around for her digivice. The fog began to fade, and eventually Takato found her digivice. However, the device wouldn't respond when Takato pressed the buttons. It didn't recognize her DNA signal, and the device failed to respond. \"Darn it! I hope we're not stuck this way!\" Suddenly, Takato felt a smack on her scaly behind. \"Sorry Takatomon, couldn't resist!\" Takato let out an angered feminine growl, as Guilmon nervously backed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, boy!\" Said Takato in an apologetic manner, \"I shouldn't take it out on you!\" Guilmon laughed, \"But Takatomon, neither of us are boys!\" Takato let out a giggle, as she tried to think of a way out of this. \"We should probably find Henry, his father helped create Digimon! If we found him, we should be back to normal in no time!\" Guilmon smirked, \"Or we could have some fun, Takatomon! Two Digi-Girls just having fun!\" Takato thought about it, it was a rare opportunity to have some fun... However, Takato was more focussed on returning to normal immediately.

Her massive tits bounced, as her feminine body hopped up and down. \"Yay, Takatomon! I can't wait to try those girly things Renamon and Rika always talk about! Sleepover parties, gossip, I don't know what those are, but they sound fun!\" Takato put one of her claws against Guilmon's feminine muzzle, as she began to think. \"First, there are some matters to take care of, Guilmon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato walked over to her pile of clothes and grabbed her goggles, gripping them in his paws. She put the goggle-strap in her claws, and went to work fastening his goggles around his head. It was hard getting it over her reptilian head, but she eventually managed to do it. After fastening the goggles, she turned her well-endowed body towards Guilmon. \"Takatomon, why are you wearing your goggles?\" Asked Guilmon, as she unknowingly put her hands on her hips. \"Well Guilmon, I wanted people to tell us apart! After all, we look exactly the same!\" Replied Takato, to which Guilmon laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... What's so funny Guilmon?\" Asked Takato, as she crossed her arms like a woman. \"We don't look exactly the same...\" Said Guilmon, as she pointed with one of her claws at Takato's chest. Takato walked closer, and decided to compare breast sizes with Guilmon. As it turned out, Takato's breasts were at least two sizes larger then Guilmon's! \"Takatomon, you're more of a hottie then I am!\" Takato blushed and kicked his paw in the dirt, \"Aw shucks, you're embaressing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Takatomon...\" Began Guilmon, \"Maybe we should change our names, so no one gets suspicious!\" Exclaimed Guilmon, as she began to play with her breasts again. \"Well... How about you be Guilwomon, and I'll be BrainyGuilwomon!\" Exclaimed Takato, now known as BrainyGuilwomon. \"Alright, Brainy! Let's go have a night on the town!\" Exclaimed Guilwomon, as she put her arms around BrainyGuilwomon's shoulder. Before they left, Takato grabbed his clothing and hid it behind a rock, as to not arouse suspicion. \"Now Guilwomon, if anyone asks tell them I got these goggles from Takato! Don't give away our identities, or it'll be the end of my reputation!\" Guilwomon nodded, as the two walked off with Guilwomon's arm still around Brainy's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

Brainy walked with her legs close together, her massive hips swaying with each step. Meanwhile, Guilwomon was having a harder time with it. Much like a baby who hasn't learned to walk, Guilwomon still walks like a man. Her legs were far apart and her arms were being held in a much more masculine way, effective fooling no one. \"Guilwomon, stop! We need to talk!\" Guilwomon stopped in mid-stride, and looked up at Brainy. \"Yes Takat--- I mean BrainyGuilwomon, what is it?\" Asked Guilwomon, as she looked her former tamer in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to play the part of a woman, you have to walk like one! First, you have to walk with your legs together! Remember, you don't have junk anymore! Let your hips sway side to side with each step.\" Guilwomon took her advice, and took a few practice steps making sure her hips swaying with each step. \"Alright, now it's important to remember two things when you're a sexy woman: Ass up, chest out! Make sure your rear-end is on full display, and that potential males can see your voluptuous breasts!\" Exclaimed Brainy, as she gave Guilwomon an example. Brainy walked in a rather sexy manner, to which Guilwomon followed her example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments Guilwomon followed Brainy's tips, and was soon moving like a true woman. \"This is great, Brainy! How did you learn how to walk like this though?\" Asked Guilwomon, as a confused look formed across her face. \"Actually... I don't know. I think that mist is causing me to have feminine thoughts, teaching me how to properly behave like a sexy lady! It's actually creeping me out a bit, to be honest.\" Guilwomon walked behind Brainy, and grabbed hold of her breasts. \"There you Brainy, now you have something creepier to take your mind off it!\" Brainy burst out in laughter, as she smacked Guilwomon's hands away. \"Good to see that you still think like a man!\" Exclaimed Brainy, as she continued strutting down the street, while Guilwomon followed behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going, BrainyGuilwomon? Some place fun, I hope!\" Brainy turned her head back towards Guilwomon, \"Don't worry, sister! We're going to have a ton of fun!\" Brainy gagged a bit, did she really just refer to Guilwomon as her sister? The night was getting weirder and weirder for the former Takato! \"The place we are going to, is a night club! Renamon told me that after the battle against the D-Reapers and the fight against Trailmon, that many Digimon from the digital world set up shop here! They made a night club exclusive to Digimon, and I just happen to remember the address Renamon gave me!\" Guilwomon smirked, \"Ooh, I can't wait! I need everyone to see my good!\" Guilwomon took her hands, and grabbed her own breasts, bouncing them around suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrainy put her paw to her head, \"It's going to be a long night...\" The duo made their way to the club, standing out the club was an Orgemon bouncer. The two Digi-Girls wandered over to the lineup, and patiently stood in line.Few Digimon were let into the club, while many were kicked out. \"Brainy, I'm scared! What if we can't in?\" Exclaimed Guilwomon, as she nervously hid behind Brainy. \"Don't worry Guilwomon, we'll get in! I've got a plan!\" Brainy was completely nervous about the plan she was about to attempt, she was about to make a fool out of herself. Brainy walked up to the Orgemon, and put her claw suggestively on the Ogre's chest chest. \"I know I'm not on the guest list, but... Do you think you could let me and my sister in, Mr. Ogremon?\" The Orgemon became infatuated with Brainy's sexy attitude, and immediately let them inside the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

He wore a black little tie, but aside from that he was entirely naked like the two Guilwomon. Brainy sat her scaly behind on a stool, and winked at the Agumon. The Digimon returned her gaze, with a smirk. \"You two look different, you must be a new sub-type of Digimon!\" Exclaimed the Agumon, as he stared Brainy's cleavage like a complete pervert. \"Yeah, were a whole new thing alright...\" Said Brainy, \"Seeing as were new, can you tell us what this bar serves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll tell ya all about it. We serve special alcoholic beverages here, that were brewed from within the Digital World. Unlike the alcohol you'd usually find, this alcohol only makes you temporarily drunk. It has no adverse effects on your body, and is considered positively safe. So if you want to get hammered, go ahead.\" Brainy smirked, \"That is nice to know.

Sure!\" Exclaimed Guilwomon, as the Flamon grabbed her by the arm and began dancing with her. Guilwomon wasn't a dancer by any stretch of the imagination, but she began gaining knowledge of dance moves she didn't even know about! It was as if her mind was being updated with dance knowledge constantly, something that both confused and delighted her. She started dancing like a crazy Womon, grinding up against the Flamon in a suggestive way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two are having fun.\" Said BrainyGuilwomon, \"Know of anything I can do for fun?\" The Agumon scratched as his scaly head, \"Well aside from that, you can get tipsy from the aforementioned alcohol.

The Digimon of the club stopped and stared at her magnificent body, as she climbed on to the stage. Brainy was a bit nervous, after all she's a thirteen year old boy! At least, she used to be, until she turned into a busty adult female Digimon! She grabbed hold of the pole, as someone in the back started playing music.

The two digital sluts sat their scaly rear ends down their stools, swivelling them around so they can a better view of the bartender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mr. Bartender! We'd like to buy as many drinks, as ten bucks can buy!\" Exclaimed Brainy, as she took out the ten dollar bill the Dogmon gave her. \"Don't you two worry about it, drinks are on the house! You put on an amazing show, you busty goggled goddess! So, for one night only you two can drink free!\" The bartender took out two glasses and poured some green liquid inside it. \"I'll be sure to give you girls as many refills as you want!\" Exclaimed the Agumon, as he went back to check on other customers. \"Alright, down the hatch!\" Exclaimed Brainy, as she grabbed the glass, and poured the green liquid down her reptilian gullet. Guilwomon followed suit, and began chugging the alcohol quickly. She let out a rather masculine burp, as Brainy giggled at Guilwomon's goofiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this,---*hic* stuff is working already!\" Exclaimed Brainy, \"Now I see why adults enjoy alcohol so much!\" Brainy motioned at the Agumon to pour her another glass, and he did so happily. Brainy chugged another glass, slopping some of the green liquid on her breasts as she did. She took one of her paws, and wiped it off while giggling insanely. Guilwomon drank the drink and laughed heavily. She was beginning to get dizzy, and her feminine thoughts quickly took her over. \"Hey, *hiccup* Don't those Digimon over there look sexy?\" Brainy thought's altered as well, \"Wow, you're right, Guilwomon! Le--- Let's get some action from them!\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrainy, now heavily drunk, stood up from her stool and stumbled over to a beefy Minotarumon. Meanwhile, Guilwomon wandered over to the Flamon from earlier, who was standing beside Minotarumon. \"Hey big boys, wanna get lucky?\" Asked a completely drunk Brainy. \"Well, we'll wait until the effect of the alcohol fade! It'd be a little messed up, if we did it now!\" Guilwomon laughed, like the drunken slut that she was, \"Well, we can wait, big boys! Mind if we hang out with you in the meantime!\" The two Digi-Men nodded their heads in agreement, and the Guilwomon partied with them, as the night dragged on. Eventually their alcoholic stupor faded, though their feminine minds took control after that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two Digi-Sluts woke up in Guilwomon's dwelling, which was situated in the park. Both of them had regained their male minds, at least for the moment. Brainy was lying on some dirt located in the stone area, while Guilwomon rested her head on Brainy's breasts. \"Oh, my head...\" Said Brainy Guilwomon, as she continued to lay down in Guilwomon's house, \"What happened last night?\" Asked Guilwomon, as she moaned. \"I don't think I want to be a woman anymore, Guilwomon.\" Whined Brainy, as she shoved Guilwomon's head off of her breasts. The two struggled to get up, but they still had a massive hangover and there vision was insanely blurred, when they opened their eyes...</span></div></div>",

She stood up abruptly, almost falling over while doing so. Brainy looked down at her stomach, that looked like the stomach of an pregnant woman who was eight months along! Brainy couldn't believe she was pregnant, no one just becomes pregnant after one night. Brainy looked over to the dozy Guilwomon, who was in the same boat. Her stomach was equally massive, she looked like she was about ready to top in a week! \"Guilwomon, we're pregnant! How did we become pregnant?!\" Guilwomon didn't look too phased and just rubbed at her eyes, \"What's pregnant mean, Brainy?\" Guilwomon's ignorance just made him more impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant, as in were going to be mothers! As in, were probably going to lay Digi-Eggs!\" Exclaimed Brainy, as she nervously placed her paws on her stomach. \"You can lay Digi-Eggs?!\" Asked Guilwomon, who looked down at her own massive stomach. \"Apparently, they do! Guilwomon, we have to get changed back now! I don't want to give birth!\"  Guilwomon smirked and tried to cheer her former tamer up, \"Don't worry! I'm sure our pregnant thing will be over soon, and we can go have ice cream!\" Brainy became more panicked, \"I can't take care of a kid, Guilwomon! I was a teenaged boy, or at least I used to be! This is all my fault, if we---\" Guilwomon gave her a smack to the head, \"Get a hold of yourself, girl!\" Brainy rubbed her cheek, \"You're right, sorry. I think turning into women was the worst thing we've ever done!\" Said Brainy, as Guilwomon nodded in agreement. \"So, what do we do now?\" Asked Guilwomon. They decided to...</span></div></div>",

Whatever had happened to Guilmon must have come from this fog, which seemed to have come from that card! The air smelt minty with a hint of strawberries, almost relaxing, but he knew better. He had to get out of there before the fog did anything else to Guilmon or even himself! He grabbed his partner's hand like claws, he tried to lead her out of the fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Guilmon! We need to get going now!\" Takato shouted, pulling her along with uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why, Takatomon?\" Guilmon questioned, somewhat trying to get Takato to stop, \"I don't sense any danger and it smells nice here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato had to turn back to grab her arm with both hands, \"Now's not the time, we need to leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Guilmon fought against him no more, simply letting her Tamer lead the way. Takato coughed a few times, covering his face to keep from breathing in the odd fog. It felt like they were running blind for an hour when it was only a few minutes. It seemed to shake him to his core, like running through a blizzard. Once they past the gate that lead into the park, he keep pulling Guilmon along, breathing in heavily at a loss of breath. He slowed down to a sluggish pace as Guilmon seemed to just skip right along in front of him, slipping out of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo, where are we going now, Takatomon?\" Guilmon asked in a sweet, bubbly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato was still trying to keep moving, heaving in and out, \"We're.... We're going to see if anyone else- else knows what the heck that was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon blinked a few times before smiling, \"Okay then, Takatomon! Who should we go see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato exhaled, turning back to look back the park. He couldn't see the fog anymore, but for some reason, his heart was pounding wildly. His skin felt chilled to a brutal extent. Why was he so cold? He was freezing! Looking back up to his partner. It was hard not to notice her large breasts, but he did his best. But she did have a good point: Who should they go ask about this?</span></div></div>",

It was something new, something unexpected, that wasn't his partner eating his poor family out of house and home (note: Guilmon does not really do that, but he is a heavy eater). This was the first really interesting thing that had happened since the Runaway Locomon incident a few years ago. It made him antsy just thinking about what the possible update could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas is a upgrade to the map navi? Maybe an improved tracker unit to finding any wild Digimon that appeared in the real world? Could it be a new way of combining cards for a combo breaker or even a way to DNA Digivolve, like how Gatomon and Aquilamon to get Silphymon? The idea of that was far too exciting! The chance to really play around with the new systems, whatever they might be, was something Takato was surprisingly looking forward to. It wasn't like he wanted something to fight or anything, he just wanted something to do. Period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were slow in town around the Winter, not even Digimon wanted to go on wild rampages in the middle of a snowstorm. Unless they're Ice based themselves in which case, they loved doing that, but there just wasn't a lot of them. Crime was low, so no one was out playing superheroes aside from Impmon who was God knows where. And with Winter Break in session, no one was in school either. It was just boring Japan's commercial district at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato was snapped out of his retreat of thoughts by the beeping sound on his device. The update was finished! He could hardly wait! But... should he? In fact, as far as he knew, he was the first and possibly only member of the Tamers to get this update. He debated on going to find Rika or Henry to get a better idea of how to proceed, but decided against in favor not being called \"goggleheaded dimwit\" for a hour or being hearing a two hour lecture on how this whatever it was update must be used with caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he just debated on going down stairs to get Guilmon for this or not.</span></div></div>",

Takato walked briskly along, while Rika lagged behind incredibly, looking undeniably depressed. \"That was disappointing.\" She said \"I was hoping for a few ultimate or mega leveled Digimon. Not some champion-level small fries.\" Takato stopped in a mid-stride and said \"Why can't you just relax and enjoy life for what it is? If you're always excited for newer better battles then you lose focus on what's really important!\" Rika turned to him and gave him a glare she then walked towards him and shoved him to the ground. \"It's not like fighting is the only thing that excites me! I just want something different, you know! Ever since we defeated the D-Reaper, I've wanted to try something new, something that's never been done before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So basically, you were fighting Digimon before it was cool. Now, everyone's doing it so you want to try something completely different.\" Stated Renamon and with her arms crossed. \"Bingo! I'm sick and tired of just being a tamer!\" Exclaimed Rika. Takato heaved himself up off the ground and brushing the dust away. \"What else is there that is better then being a tamer? Aside from maybe being a digimon.\" Said Takato. Rika was about to say something when she spotted an orange card on the ground. \"Ooh... What do we have here?\" She said while picking up the card and getting ready to swipe it. \"Rika! Don't, we have no idea what is does!\" Pleaded Takato. \"Oh c'mon, goggle-head! Every time, we find one of these strange colored cards it's always a good thing! The blue card allowed you to created Guilmon and the red one let him digivolve to ultimate. So I don't really see the problem!\" Said Rika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rika!\" Began Takato \"We don't even know what it do---\" Takato's plea was cut-off by Rika swiping the strange Orange card. A large blue light filled the area, Takato and the rest couldn't see at all. When the dust cleared Renamon stood with her mouth agape. She looked down and was strangely surprised by her own yellow fur. Trembling, she looked at her large white paws and began to get really nervous. It was as if she wasn't Renamon at all. \"Renamon\" Looked at Guilmon and exclaimed \"Guilmon, What's going?!\" However \"Guilmon\" looked at her strangely and said \"I have no idea Renamon!\" Renamon was surprised by the fact that Guilmon had a completely different speech pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Takatomon, do you know what happened?\" Rika asked. \"I... have no idea...\" Said \"Takato\". It didn't take too long for them to figure out that they had all swapped bodies. Takato was now Renamon, Rika was now Guilmon, Guilmon was Rika, and Renamon was Takato. \"Nice going, Rika!\" Exclaimed the now fluffy Takato. \"Ok, how is this my fault! Those colored cards usually mean---\" Rika began to say until Takato cut her off in mid-sentence \"Oh, it \"usually means!\" Oh, I guess that solved all of our problems!\" Renamon looked at both of them and said \"You two need to calm down. Rika, you were extremely hasty today and it could've been the end of us if rogue digimon were around. You both have no idea how to fight in those bodies. What we need to do it require to our quarters and think of a way to fix this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However, this statement made Rika even more angry and volatile. \"What?! WHAT?! I'm not going to spend the night in Guilmon's hollowed-out cave!\" She exclaimed. However, the now male Renamon just looked at her and said \"Rika, this is your fault! And besides, at much as Takato's family enjoys Guilmon, they wouldn't let him sleep inside. \"I... fine! Until we get this sorted out, I'll stay there.\" Said Rika while swallowing her pride. \"Wow, Takatomon, girls are confusing.\" Stated Guilmon. \"Uh... Guilmon,, you are a girl.\" Takato fired back. It was going to be a long night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should we focus on for now?</span></div></div>",

Takato stood there nervously before taking a deep breath in and exhaling. \"Well, this is going to be tough.\" Stated Takato. Guilmon gave a curious look at Takato, something Rika never did and said \"Takatomon, you are acting like we are facing the D-Reaper again!\" Said Guilmon. \"Not the D-Reaper, Guilmon, Rika's parents. I don't want to act off and give them the tip that we are not Renamon and Rika.\" Said the new Renamon, while beginning to take nervous steps up the front porch. \"Just let me all the talking, boy. You'll just embarrass us.\" Said Takato with his stern new feminine voice. They knocked on the front door and were greeted by Rika's mother. \"Rika! Renamon! Come on in!\" The two of them walked in rather sheepishly. Luckily, Rika's mom didn't take notice of this. \"Rika and I are going to head upstairs for a while. We have some important... Business to take care of.\" Said Takato in a rather fearful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, Just don't miss supper you two!\" Said Rika's mom in a very happy-go-lucky voice. The two walked up to Rika's room and Takato Immediately threw himself on the bed. \"Oh god, I just don't feel right about this, Guilmon.\" Takato said while burying his face in his paws. \"Takatomon, I thought you said this was Rika's fault!\" Said Guilmon. \"It is her fault, I just don't get why she does this to us! She always acts like she's better than everyone else. I still can't believe she would just up and use some random card she found!\" Exclaimed Takato. \"Well, maybe the card took over her mind!\" Said Guilmon. \"Yeah, I freaking doubt it, boy! All I know now is that we are both girls. This cannot get any worse!\" Exclaimed Takato while picking up one of the bed's pillows and tossing across the room. Just then...</span></div></div>",

Who's there?\" Asked Takato. \"Renamon, it's me Henry! Can I come in?\" Asked Henry. Takato looked over to Guilmon, and gave him a \"Shush!\" to keep him from blowing their cover. \"Uh... C'mon in Henry!\" Said Takato, who was unsure of the whole thing. \"Alright. I'm coming in!\" Henry walked in with a rather desperate look on his face. \"Guys--- I mean girls, something is wrong with Takato and Guilmon!\" Exclaimed Henry, who was trying his best to hold back his fear. \"What happened exactly?\" Asked Takato, who was extremely curious about the chaos Rika and Renamon were causing in their bodies. \"Well I tried talking to them and Takato was way more serious than usual! He kept saying he was busy and he kept telling me to leave! Also, he walked away in a feminine manner with his hips swaying. What's up with that?\" Asked Henry, which made Takato feel extremely embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And... What about Ri--- I mean Guilmon?\" Asked Takato. \"Well he... flipped me off. I didn't even know he knew what that meant.\" Stated Henry. Takato put a paw over his head and sighed. \"Renamon, do you know what's going on with Takato?\" Asked Henry. \"Henry\" Said Takato in a serious manner \"How big is your suspension of dis-belief?\" Henry looked at him with a rather confused expression. \"Well I'm talking to a giant yellow fox, and a girl who can manipulate the abilities of said fox using magic trading cards. Not to mention the fact we just defeated a giant gelatinous slime monster that almost killed everyone. Yeah, I'd say I've seen it all. So, what did you want to tell me?\" Asked Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well... Me, Guilmon, Renamon and Rika have sort of... swapped bodies.\" Stated Takato. \"I'm trying to be serious here, Renamon. On top of that, if you wanted me to believe something like that you'd need substantial proof.\" Said Henry, who crossed his arms in dis-belief. Takato wandered over to him, and moved his large paw towards Henry's shirt, pressing a black claw against his shoulder. \"You've been selling your sister's dolls to Impmon so he could use them as target practice.\" Said Takato. \"Wait, how would you know about that? I've been telling Impmon that I got them from one of my cousin's garage sales so I could use their stuffing for pillows. And the only one I told about it was Takato!\" Said Henry. \"That's because I'm Takato. And Guilmon is standing right over there!\" He said while motioning to Guilmon who was Rika's skin. \"Howdy Henry!\" Stated Guilmon, in a voice that didn't befit Rika's body at all. \"Oh god... It's true, I've gone insane! What's going to happen next? Is a gun-toting priest, and a group of three demons going to ride out of an alternate dimensional portal on a jeep that magically transforms into a dragon?\" Asked Henry. Then suddenly...</span></div></div>",

It's got a strange golden color, and it seems to be pulsating with a strange energy!\" Exclaimed Takato. \"Well... Takato and Guilmon let's go after it.\" Said Henry begrudgingly. \"Finally, you believe me! I'll explain the rest to you later, let's get going!\" Shouted Takato as he made a break for the door. Guilmon, Henry and Takato run out the door and begin their trek through the streets. Takato becomes increasingly bothered by the fact that his new tail keeps dragging the ground. \"Darn it! This tail tracks in so most dust and dirt, I'm surprised Renamon can even stand it!\" Exclaimed Takato. \"Takato, WHO CARES?! Renamon is a Digmon which is like a wild animal! She can't even take showers, because fur probably clogs up the drain! So stop worrying about personal hygiene and be a man!\" Shouted Henry, who was getting increasingly annoyed by the whole scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Takato just looked at him with an angered expression on his face and said \"How can I be a man right now, if I'm trapped in a woman's body?\" He asked sarcastically. Henry ignored his remarks and continued running. They eventually made it to the tear, where Yamaki was already there waiting. \"Well, Henry you forgetting something?\" Asked Yamaki. \"Oh god, Henry you forgot Terriermon!\" Exclaimed Takato, causing Yamaki to shoot angered glances at Henry. \"Look don't worry guys, we've got Renamon right here with us! There's no we can lose!\" Said Henry trying to lighten the moon. Takato once again buried his paws in his face. \"Just... Shut up, Henry.\" Said Takato. Suddenly the gate began to glow and split wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Takato, Henry, Guilmon and Yamaki hear a group of four voices screaming in synchronization as a strange object begins to fall to the ground it lands with a thud in an alleyway, a couple of blocks away. \"Okay, here's the plan! Yamaki, I want you stay here and keep tabs on any possible gates opening. Henry, you go home and grab Terriermon so you can actually be of some use. \"Rika\" and I will go after whatever popped out of the gates. Any questions?\" Asked Takato. Yamaki retorts \"Yeah, just one. When did you become Takato?\" Henry and Takato shoot glances at each other. \"Well... We'll explain later.\" Stated Takato, who immediately ran off with Guilmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Guilmon and Takato eventually reach the alleyway where the metallic object landed. \"Okay boy, as with our previous encounters I want you to keep silent. We'll lose our intimidation factor if you talk.\" Said Takato. \"But Takatomon, how will I be able to digi-modify with my mouth shut?\" Asked Guilmon. Takato looked at him and said \"You'll find a way, Guilmon I believe in you.\" The two run towards the object and find something they weren't expecting. Four humans dressed in strange garb. The first one appeared to be a priest in a magnificent golden and white robe. He had short blonde hair and had a nasty looking frown his face. He was clutching a cigarette which he began to puff on. Another one was wearing a blue outfit with a white shirt and blue head band. His hair had a strange red coloring to it, that was unlike any hair color he had ever seen. He had a strange crescent bladed staff and was arguing with another member of their crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The other one had spikey brown hair and wore a strange golden diadem, along with an orange cape and red and white shirt. He sported typical blues jeans and had strange golden eyes. He looked rather young when compared to the other The last one wore an odd looking green and white shirt that an oriental feel to it. He also sported brown spikey hair, though he looked to be the smarter one of the bunch with his fancy little monacle He was clutching a white dragon in both his hands. Takato has no idea how to proceed. These guys looked like serious business, and they weren't at all Digimon. Takato tried to get a better look, but ended up knocking over a garbage can, causing the gang to notice him. The blonde priest pulled out a handgun and pointed it at the strange fox creature. \"Oh look, another demon. It must be one of Gyumao's servants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait I'm not a demon! I'm a Digimon!\" Exclaimed Takato. \"Doesn't matter what you are! Because now you're gonna be fox stew!\" Shouted the brown haired boy. \"Have fun with her, Goku but make sure there's something left for dinner!\" Said the other brown haired man. Goku snapped his fingers and a red and golden staff materialized out of his right hand. Takato was really in for it now, what happens next?</span></div></div>",

Takato kept dodging his attacks trying to think of what to do. Would it be considered wrong to attack him considering he's a human? However, he wasn't like any other human Takato ever encountered. Goku attacked him with a powerful staff that could extend at any time he wanted. On top of that, no matter how much he ran out around, he never seemed to run out of energy. Takato finally decided to take things seriously and whacked him with one of his large paws. This knocked Goku back a bit, but didn't seem to do any damage to him in the least. \"Takatomon!\" Shouted Guilmon, who was running towards him. \"Guilmon! Digi-modify! Use the tomahawk!\" Guilmon took the card and immediately swiped it. Takato began to shine, and now possessed a tomahawk he could fight Goku with, blade to blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see the foxy lady has some tricks up her sleeves... Or gloves. You're not like any demon I've ever faced!\" Said Goku with a confident smirk forming on his face. \"Like I said before, I'm not a demon! I'm a Digimon, a creature from the digital world! Now go away, I have better things to do today then fight some punk with a staff!\" Shouted Takato while brandishing his Tomahawk. \"Oh wow, I'm so scared! Tell me foxy lady, would you prefer chipotle or basil leaves in your stew?\" Asked Goku sarcastically. Takato ignored that comment and went on the attack. Takato matched Goku blow for blow, the battle was intense. Takato was used to fighting while merged with Guilmon, so he was not stranger to how combat worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He eventually got the upper-hand and began decimating Goku. Knocking the staff out of Goku's hand he began pummelling him with the tomahawk. However, Takato had underestimated Goku's tenacity. Goku punched the Tomahawk out of Takato's paw and began pummelling him senselessly with his fists. Punch after punch, until Takato lied there covered in dust, and dirt. \"Goku, you're taking too long!\" Said the golden haired priest who just entered the scene. \"I'll finish her off with my banishing gun!\" Goku looked at the priest and said \"Hey Sanzo, I don't think she's one of Gyumao's guys. She doesn't seem to want to fight, on top of that she doesn't appear to be like any demon we've ever faced!\" Stated Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sanzo took out a cigarette and lit it, placing it closely to his lips. After a few puffs he said \"Like I care, if it gets in our way it's toast. Good or bad I live by my own rules.\" Stated the priest who pointed his gun at Takato. \"Woah, stop I'm not---!\" Before Takato could finish the priest took out his gun and took a pot-shot at him. Takato managed to dodge but the bullet brushed the fur on his should. \"It's not a demon, the banishing gun has no effect.\" Said Sanzo. Immediately the other two humans ran up. \"Sanzo what happened here?\" Asked the red-haired one. \"This thing fought with Goku, however it eventually lost. Though I think something like this would definitely make a good slave\" Said the priest. \"How about a pet? It could be a travelling companion for Hakuryuu.\" Stated the brown haired man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're wise beyond you're years, Hakkai. Considering this thing can fight it might help us out of a jam. It would be great if it could decrease our workload.\" Said the red-haired man. Takato looked like a nervous wreck, standing before four men who could easily wipe him out. Was this the end for our new Digimon? Who are these mysterious new strangers? Find out on the next episode of... Actually find out right now! Before Takato could run away, he heard a voice boom in the background exclaiming \"Bunny blaster!\" With that sound, came a barrage of bullets, that caused the four humans to scatter like mice. \"Oh god, Henry! You sure took your sweet time!\" Exclaimed Takato. \"That's because I found this on the way!\" Henry stated while pulling out a strange orange card. \"Henry, you magnificent tamer! That's the card we need to swap back!\" Exclaimed Takato triumphantly. \"Oh that's what it does? I swiped one earlier and it did nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait what?\" Said Takato, while hoisting himself off the ground. \"Yeah, it did absolutely nothing. Also, may I ask who were those guys attacking you?\" Asked Henry. \"Well there was a gun-wielding priest who was a chain-smoker, and I'm pretty sure those guys were demons and--- Wait? Why does that sound familiar?\" Asked Takato. \"Oh god, didn't I make some kind of joke about those guys earlier? I wonder what happened to make that wish come true.\" Asked Henry, while scratching his head confusingly. Takato suddenly began thinking deeply about was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I figured it out! Those cards must be some kind of weird wish fulfillment Digi-modify. Quick let's round up the others and swap back!\" Said Takato. Henry...</span></div></div>",

But since she now has Takato's entire personality, she, and the other three personality-swapped friends, now believes she really IS Takato and as such has Takato's normal, male, human body, his male voice and is unable to use any special attacks, because they all believe she is a male human. Also, since she now thinks she is really Takato, she is going to freak out about wearing her purple gloves and about Takato wearing his own clothes; because since they now believe that they are each other, they also think that they are suddenly wearing each others clothes. In other words, 'Takato', meaning Renamon with Takato's personality, is going to freak out about being almost naked, since 'he' is only wearing 'Renamon's' gloves, and 'Renamon', meaning Takato with Renamon's personality, is going to feel uncomfortable, hot and ticked off at now wearing 'Takato's' clothes, since the garments are squeezing 'her tail' and combined with 'her fur' is making 'her' feel really warm.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Renamon slowly regained conciousness. What had happened? She started to remember... She and her Tamer, Rika, had helped Takato and Guilmon stop a rampaging Volcamon downtown. On their way home, the four of them took a shortcut through the park, where they had found a wierd, green, Digimon Card. Curious about what the Card would do, Rika had swiped it through her Digivice, then there had been a bright flash. Next thing Renamon knew, she was on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was wierd,' thought Renamon. 'The Card didn't do anything. I certainly don't feel like I do when Rika uses Digimodify with other Cards. Exept maybe a little cold; it's rather breezy here...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she blinked the stars out of her eyes, she could hear the others had woken up too. 'I wonder what...' Renamon didn't get to finish that train of thought, as two screams suddenly pierced the air. It was Takato and Rika screaming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon suddenly jumped up on instinct and went into a battle stance. Since her sight had returned, she started looking around to see why her Tamer was screaming. \"Rika, are you...\" she started to say, but she froze when she saw the sight before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnreal! She couldn't believe it! Yet it was right in front of her. As she looked at the wierd spectacle, she suddenly thought of that cold feeling she had before. 'Don't tell me...' she thought, as she moved her gaze downwards to look at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Renamon's diciplined mind didn't prevent her from letting out a gasp of shock, as she unfortunatly found out that her suspicions were right. Her clothes had dissapeared! She was not wearing anything! Well, not completely true. The only piece of clothing on her furry yellow-and-white body, was a pair of long, purple gloves with a Yin-Yang symbol on them. Renamon recognised them immediately. They were Takato's gloves! But other than that, she was buck-naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing profusely, Renamon tried to preserve a little modesty by covering her near-naked body with her paws. 'I had a feeling that this was the case,' Renamon thought to herself, 'But it's hard not to be embarassed by this.' She looked up at the two Tamers again, to check on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason why Renamon had that feeling, was right in front of her and it was why the Tamers were freaking out; somehow they were all wearing each others clothes! Renamon observed that Takato looked like he was frozen in shock; not surprising since he was wearing Renamon's clothes: the white T-shirt, the blue hooded shirt, the yellow wristbands, the long gray shorts, the white socks, the green converse sneakers and the yellow goggles; all of it Renamon's! And Takato was wearing it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon knew that Takato only ever wore those purple gloves of his; he had for as long as she had known him. So, for him to suddenly wear the full set of clothes of a Digimon, must be uncomfortable for him, she reasoned. Especially since, unlike herself and Guilmon, he didn't know how to properly put on or remove any other article of clothing, that much she knew. And the reason why Renamon knew that she had switched clothes with Takato, was because the same thing had happened to Rika and Guilmon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon being, well, Guilmon, was largely unaffected by the whole thing. All he did was just observing everything curiously in spite of him looking funny being completly naked! The same thing could not be said of Rika. The look on her face was an odd mix between shock, anger and disgust. Renamon fully understood why Rika behaved like that. Ever since Rika became her Tamer, Renamon knew that Rika never worn clothes in her life. Rika always felt that any clothes were way too stuffy and uncomfortable for her to wear. Also, like Takato, since Rika never wore clothes, she had no idea how to put them on or take them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, for Rika to suddenly wear Guilmon's clothes would be quite an ordeal for her; Renamon was certain of that. Indeed, Rika looked utterly mortified to be wearing Guilmon's clothes; the hairband, the turquoise-sleaved turtlenecked T-shirt with the dark-blue heart on the front, the short button-fly blue jeans, the red wristbands, the white socks, the red steel-toed sneakers and the buckles that Guilmon usually wore around his waist and left leg. Add in the the fact that, while Rika did consider Guilmon a friend, he was also the Digimon that she was annoyed with the most and the uncomfortable feeling would skyrocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Renamon just stood and stared like the others. Then Guilmon broke the ice by innocently asking: \"Takato, how come you are dressed like Renamon and Renamon dressed like you? And why is Rika dressed like me and I'm dressed like her? Is this some kind of new game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato managed to snap himself out of his funk, as he shakingly answered: \"I-I-I don't know wh-why we're all d-dressed like each other, Guilmon. And no; it's not some new game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, too bad,\" sighed Guilmon. \"It looked like it could have been a fun game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun? FUN?! YOU WOULD CONSIDER THIS TO BE FUN?!?\" yelled Rika. Both Takato and Guilmon took a few steps back due to Rika's tone of voice, but Renamon decided to intervene, before her Tamer would start ranting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Rika,\" said Renamon sharply, as she stepped in front of Rika. \"It's not Guilmon's fault and you know how hard it is for him to be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's still no excuse!\" exclaimed Rika. \"I mean, look at this!\" She tugged on both Guilmon's turtlenecked T-shirt and his button-fly jeans, that she now wore. \"I can't stand being dressed in that stupid lizards uncomfortable clothes and all he does is treating it like some Circus act!\" She pointed at Guilmon, who was currently busy examining how he looked without his clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon snorted. \"So? You think you're the only one here who feels uncomfortable with what you currently wear?\" Renamon said. She was fidgeting around, still blushing slightly and trying to cover as much of her near-naked body as possible with her paws. \"I don't like being almost naked, but I don't have much choice since Takato is wearing my clothes at the moment.\" They both looked over at Takato. He was also fidgeting nervously, but in his case, it was from wearing clothes, instead of not wearing them. Looking back at Rika, Renamon added: \"But I hope it won't be for long. Wearing nothing but gloves is embarrasing enough, but those gloves also itch to high heaven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, speak for yourself!\" exclaimed Takato, who had heard what they said. He was scratching himself, as he went over to them. \"How can you even wear these things, Renamon? They feel so hot and stuffy. It's like walking around with a blanket wrapped around me, all of the time.\" He tugged on Renamon's hodded shirt and her long shorts. \"If I knew how to take them off, I would take them off. Besides, they aren't really my colour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know what you mean,\" said Rika, as she tugged on Guilmon's T-shirt and blue jeans. \"I have no idea how to get this off either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful you two,\" said Renamon. \"If you keep tugging on the clothes like that, they might rip, and neither Guilmon nor myself would want that to happen.\" \"Right! Sorry!\" said the two Tamers at the same time and stopped the tugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how do you guys think we swapped clothes, anyways?\" asked Guilmon. \"Well,\" said Renamon. \"I think it might be because of that odd Modify Card we found.\" \"I think that's a sound assumption,\" said Takato. \"Yeah, I think so too,\" said Rika. \"I agree with whatever you agree with, Takato,\" said Guilmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were wrong though. The Modify Card had not swapped their clothes around. As a matter of fact, they all had their usual clothes on, but all of them thought that they were dressed like each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the Green Card really did, was swapping a part of their personalities around; specifically the part about who would wear clothes and who would not. Every time they would swipe the Green Card, another small part of their personalities would switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the four friends didn't know that, so they thought that the Card had swapped their clothes around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they came to the solution that the Modify Card had swapped their clothes, they thought if they swiped it again, it might return everything to normal. Only one problem: the Card had disappeared!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" groaned Rika. \"How are we going to swap our clothes back now?\" \"We'll have to do it manually,\" said Renamon. \"We need to switch them back and soon.\" \"There are some big bushes over there that we can change behind,\" said Takato. No sooner said, than done, they were ready to swap what they thought to be their own clothes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich pair should we follow?</span></div></div>",

Smiling nastily, he raised his club and started stomping towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back!\" Renamon shouted to her Tamer, before attempting to leap at the Ogremon, only to fall short as she only managed a simple short hop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she muttered, before Ogremon suddenly smacked her aside with the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay outta this, human,\" he growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What?</i>\" Renamon thought as she tried to stand up, \"<i>Why did he call me human? And why did that hurt so much? I've taken worse!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pummel whack!\" Ogremon shouted, launching the attack at the shocked Rika. The girl instinctively jumped back to avoid the attack. In fact, she leapt up, did a backflip mid-air, and landed in a crouch on the branch of a nearby tree. She blinked in the surprise as she realized what she had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What the hell? How'd I do that?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no time to think about it, as Ogremon charged her again, waving his club in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fight me coward!\" he yelled, leaping at her. Once again, Rika acted on instinct, leaping towards her opponent and kicking him square in the jaw. Rather than realistically breaking her foot, she sent the larger monster flying back to land on his back, while she performed a three-point landing a few feet away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up and panting heavily, Rika risked a look away from Ogremon and shared a glance with Renamon, who had managed to get to her feet. The two stared at each other as they both pondered the same thing: What was going on?</span></div></div>",

Light shined around Rika's arms and formed into the familiar golden shield, which blocked the club. Rika shuddered from the impact and was pushed back several feet, but was surprisingly not knocked over. The same instinct that had been guiding her during the fight kicked in again, and she pushed back with the shield, knocking Ogremon off balance. She then swept out her leg, knocking Ogremon's legs out from under him before slamming the shield down on him, stunning him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, Rika took the opportunity to turn to look at Renamon again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can use the cards?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently,\" Renamon replied, looking as stunned as Rika felt.</span></div></div>",

I can't digivol-gah!\" Rika's protests were cut off as she felt another jolt of energy go through her, this one much stronger than the last. She felt something within her shifting as her body was engulfed in a bright light. When the light died down, it immediately became apparent that the card had had something similar to its desired effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika now looked older, perhaps in her late teens or early twenties. She was taller, her body now leaner and more muscular (not to mention her breasts having grown to about a B-cup), while her hair had grown out dramatically, now reaching down to her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore immediately apparent, however, were the fact that she was crouched over on both hands and feet, and was wearing a collar around her neck composed of four intertwined ropes that ended in metal balls. If anything, it looked like she was supposed to be dressed up like Renamon's Champion-level form Kyubimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rika could process what had just happened to her, Ogremon - now mostly recovered - lashed out at her with his club. Once again acting on her newfound instincts, Rika leapt over the swing and pounced on Ogremon, her hands striking him in the throat and knocking him back to the ground, before flipping over him and landing once more on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ogremon tried to get back to his feet again, Rika felt a force rising up in her, only barely noticing as her lengthy hair began rising up to hover in the air in nine distinct strands, spectral blue flames appearing on the ends of the strands. She barely even thought about what she was saying or doing as she made her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fox tail inferno!\" she shouted, the flames shooting from the hair strands at Ogremon. The ogre digimon only had time to scream as he burned, before the flames destroyed him and he dissolved into data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the data floated away, Rika and Renamon looked at each. Rika's body glowed again, and when the light dissipated, she was once again her proper age, wearing Renamon's gloves, and standing only on her feet.</span></div></div>",

What's going on?! Why am I naked and on all fours and eating garbage?! And-</i>\" she stopped her screaming as she realized that while she could still understand herself, she was hearing barking. \"<i>And why the hell am I barking?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused and a little scared, Rika started walking, humiliated to be crawling on all fours naked in public, but not seeing any other choice until she could figure out what was going on. She was just grateful that she and Renamon had apparently been the only ones in the park at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Renamon, where are you?</i>\" she called, hoping her partner would have some answers, \"<i>Please tell me that stupid card at least left my clothes intact somewhere...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika trailed off, stopping and jaw dropping in surprise, as she found herself back in the part of the park she'd been in earlier and seeing Renamon ahead of her... standing next to a mangy looking dog that was standing upright on its back legs and was <i>wearing her clothes</i>. As she stared in shock, the dog examined the blank card that had caused this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was weird,\" the dog said in perfect English, \"It doesn't look like that flash actually did anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure Rika?\" Renamon asked, \"I can check the area if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What?!</i>\" Rika shouted, snapped out of her shock by that sentence. She ran forward, not even noticing how naturally she moved on all fours as she yelled, \"<i>Renamon, are you crazy?</i> I'm <i>Rika, that's just some freak dog in my clothes!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon and the dog stared at her as she ran up. Then the dog frowned and waved her arms wildly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid dog. Beat it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm not the dog, you are!</i>\" Rika shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's probably hungry Rika. Look at how thin she is,\" Renamon commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we don't have any food you mangy mutt. So scram.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika ignored the dog in her clothes as she stared in horror at Renamon. \"<i>Re-Renamon, you really don't understand me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon tilted her head and stared at her, but before she could say anything, the dog suddenly grabbed a stick and waved it in front of Rika's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. See the stick? Go fetch!\" she said, before tossing it a couple of yards away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething clicked in Rika's head; despite wanting to stay and somehow prove she was herself, she was suddenly overwhelmed by a desire to chase the stick. She ran after it, eventually reaching it and picking it up with her mouth. She then grabbed the ends with her hands as she started chewing happily on the stick, enjoying the feel of the stick in her mouth. After a few minutes, she came back to her senses; eyes widening, she pulled the stick from her mouth and threw it away, spitting to get the taste out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Why did I do that?</i>\" she asked out loud, \"<i>Oh god, am I starting to think like a dog too?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, she found to her dismay that Renamon and the dog were gone, with no sign of the weird card; they'd probably taken it with them. Realizing she now seemed stuck like this, she curled up and moaned in despair, the sound coming out like a dog's whining.</span></div></div>",

I just hope it doesn't come to that - I'd probably die of embarrassment from this nonsense.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika grumbled to herself about the humiliating and ridiculous nature of her situation as she started walking, not really paying attention to where she was going or what she was doing; if she had, she would have been disturbed at how natural moving on all fours felt to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was snapped out of her moping by the sound of a car horn. Looking up, she was surprised to see she was now standing on the sidewalk just outside the park, just short of the street. People were walking by, none of them seeming to take notice of the nude girl sitting on all fours just feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika blushed at this; while she was grateful that everyone, like Renamon, apparently now saw her as a dog, thus sparing her the embarrassment she'd otherwise be experiencing, the thought of going anywhere with people present in this situation was a little overwhelming. Still blushing, she turned around and started walking back into the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll just stay here for now,' she thought, 'Maybe that dog didn't really take the card with her. Maybe she threw it out in one of these trash cans, and I can use it to switch it back. If not... well, at night there'll be less people on the streets, so that's something.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought was derailed by a sudden rustling in a nearby bush. Stopping in her tracks, she turned to look at the bush, her head cocking to the side in curiosity. Her eyes widened as a squirrel popped its head out of the bush, sniffing at the air cautiously. Like with the stick, Rika felt something click in her head, and her eyes narrowed as she bared her teeth and started growling. The squirrel took notice of her and ducked back into the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh no you don't!</i>\" she shouted, barreling forward into the bush, so overwhelmed with the desire to catch the squirrel that she completed ignored the resulting scrapes and scratches brought on by the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she burst from the bush, she looked around wildly until she saw the squirrel heading towards a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Come back here!</i>\" she yelled, continuing the chase. However, the squirrel reached the tree first and started climbing up it. When Rika reached the tree, she jumped up to try and grab the squirrel but missed and fell back to the ground. Growling, she reached up and tried to climb the tree, her hands scratching at the bark futilely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'll get you, you little rat!</i>\" she screamed up at the squirrel as it disappeared among the tree's foliage, \"<i>I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you, I'm... I'm chasing a squirrel.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika trailed off and dropped back onto all fours as her mind returned to normal and she realized what she was doing. She groaned as she lowered her head to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh god, I really</i> am <i>starting to think like a dog!

Calm down, that's a good girl,\" she said soothingly. Despite her confusion and mortification at the situation, Rika found herself being strangely calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with your dog Elizabeth?\" another old lady at the table asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure it's nothing Maria,\" the first lady, Elizabeth, replied, \"You know dogs - not matter how well bred they are, they still get excited at the littlest things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis snapped Rika out of her funk, and she glared at Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What are you talking about?</i>\" she snapped, \"<i>I'm not a dog!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth responded by smacking Rika on the nose with a rolled up napkin.

This evening, she and her Tamer, Rika, had helped Takato and Guilmon stop a rampaging Volcamon downtown. On their way home, the four of them took a shortcut through the park, where they had found a wierd, green, Digimon Card. Curious about what the Card would do, Rika had swiped it through her Digivice, then there had been a bright flash. Next thing Renamon knew, she was on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was wierd,' thought Renamon. 'The Card didn't do anything. I certainly don't feel like I do when Rika uses Digimodify with other Cards. Exept maybe a little cold; it's rather breezy here...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she blinked the stars out of her eyes, she could hear the others had woken up too. 'I wonder what...' Renamon didn't get to finish that train of thought, as two screams suddenly pierced the air. It was Takato and Rika screaming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon suddenly jumped up on instinct and went into a battle stance. Since her sight had returned, she started looking around to see why her Tamer was screaming. \"Rika, are you...\" she started to say, but she froze when she saw the sight before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnreal! She couldn't believe it! Yet it was right in front of her. As she looked at the wierd spectacle, she suddenly thought of that cold feeling she had before. 'Don't tell me...' she thought, as she moved her gaze downwards to look at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Renamon's diciplined mind didn't prevent her from letting out a gasp of shock, as she unfortunatly found out that her suspicions were right. Her clothes had dissapeared! She was not wearing anything! Well, not completely true. The only piece of clothing on her furry yellow-and-white body, was a pair of long, purple gloves with a Yin-Yang symbol on them. Renamon recognised them immediately. They were Takato's gloves! But other than that, she was buck-naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing profusely, Renamon tried to preserve a little modesty by covering her near-naked body with her paws. 'I had a feeling that this was the case,' Renamon thought to herself, 'But it's hard not to be embarassed by this.' She looked up at the two Tamers again, to check on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason why Renamon had that feeling, was right in front of her and it was why the Tamers were freaking out; somehow they were all wearing each others clothes! Renamon observed that Takato looked like he was frozen in shock; not surprising since he was wearing Renamon's clothes: the white T-shirt, the blue hooded shirt, the yellow wristbands, the long gray shorts, the white socks, the green converse sneakers and the yellow goggles; all of it Renamon's! And Takato was wearing it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon knew that Takato only ever wore those purple gloves of his; he had for as long as she had known him. So, for him to suddenly wear the full set of clothes of a Digimon, must be uncomfortable for him, she reasoned. Especially since, unlike herself and Guilmon, he didn't know how to properly put on or remove any other article of clothing, that much she knew. And the reason why Renamon knew that she had switched clothes with Takato, was because the same thing had happened to Rika and Guilmon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon being, well, Guilmon, was largely unaffected by the whole thing. All he did was just observing everything curiously in spite of him looking funny being completly naked! The same thing could not be said of Rika. The look on her face was an odd mix between shock, anger and disgust. Renamon fully understood why Rika behaved like that. Ever since Rika became her Tamer, Renamon knew that Rika never worn clothes in her life. Rika always felt that any clothes were way too stuffy and uncomfortable for her to wear. Also, like Takato, since Rika never wore clothes, she had no idea how to put them on or take them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, for Rika to suddenly wear Guilmon's clothes would be quite an ordeal for her; Renamon was certain of that. Indeed, Rika looked utterly mortified to be wearing Guilmon's clothes; the hairband, the turquoise-sleaved turtlenecked T-shirt with the dark-blue heart on the front, the short button-fly blue jeans, the red wristbands, the white socks, the red steel-toed sneakers and the buckles that Guilmon usually wore around his waist and left leg. Add in the the fact that, while Rika did consider Guilmon a friend, he was also the Digimon that she was annoyed with the most and the uncomfortable feeling would skyrocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Renamon just stood and stared like the others. Then Guilmon broke the ice by innocently asking: \"Takato, how come you are dressed like Renamon and Renamon dressed like you? And why is Rika dressed like me and I'm dressed like her? Is this some kind of new game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato managed to snap himself out of his funk, as he shakingly answered: \"I-I-I don't know wh-why we're all d-dressed like each other, Guilmon. And no; it's not some new game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, too bad,\" sighed Guilmon. \"It looked like it could have been a fun game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun? FUN?! YOU WOULD CONSIDER THIS TO BE FUN?!?\" yelled Rika. Both Takato and Guilmon took a few steps back due to Rika's tone of voice, but Renamon decided to intervene, before her Tamer would start ranting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Rika,\" said Renamon sharply, as she stepped in front of Rika. \"It's not Guilmon's fault and you know how hard it is for him to be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's still no excuse!\" exclaimed Rika. \"I mean, look at this!\" She tugged on both Guilmon's turtlenecked T-shirt and his button-fly jeans, that she now wore. \"I can't stand being dressed in that stupid lizards uncomfortable clothes and all he does is treating it like some kind of circus act!\" She pointed at Guilmon, who was currently busy examining how he looked without his clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon snorted. \"So? You think you're the only one here who feels uncomfortable with what you currently wear?\" Renamon said. She was fidgeting around, still blushing heavily and trying to cover as much of her near-naked body as possible with her paws. \"I don't like being almost naked, but I don't have much choice since Takato is wearing my clothes at the moment.\" They both looked over at Takato. He was also fidgeting nervously, but in his case, it was from wearing clothes, instead of not wearing them. Looking back at Rika, Renamon added: \"But I hope it won't be for long. Wearing nothing but gloves is embarrasing enough, but those gloves also itch to high heaven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, speak for yourself!\" exclaimed Takato, who had heard what they said. He was scratching himself, as he went over to them. \"How can you even wear these things, Renamon? They feel so hot and stuffy. It's like walking around with a blanket wrapped around me, all of the time.\" He tugged on Renamon's hodded shirt and her long shorts. \"If I knew how to take them off, I would take them off. Besides, they aren't really my colour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know what you mean,\" said Rika, as she tugged on Guilmon's T-shirt and blue jeans. \"I have no idea how to get this off either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful you two,\" said Renamon. \"If you keep tugging on the clothes like that, they might rip, and neither Guilmon nor myself would want that to happen.\" \"Right! Sorry!\" said the two Tamers at the same time and stopped the tugging for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how do you guys think we swapped clothes, anyways?\" asked Guilmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Renamon. \"I think it might be because of that odd Modify Card we found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato looked over at Rika. \"So, you caused this by using that Modify Card!\" he yelled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how was I supposed to know it would do this?!\" Rika yelled back. \"It's not like it was written on it that this would happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH ALREADY!!!\" bellowed Renamon. The Tamers stopped their bickering immediately. Renamon lowered her voice to a normal level and said: \"This is no time to argue! If you want to fix this, then look for the Card. Maybe if you use it again,it will swap our clothes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point, Renamon,\" said Rika, and Takato agreed with her. Without further ado, they all started to look for the Card. But, as it turned out, it had disappeared! Plus, they were wrong about the Card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon had only been half-right. The Card had swapped something, but it wasn't their clothes. The truth was that they were actually wearing their usual clothes, but the Card had swapped their perceptions on whose clothes belonged to whom; hence why they thought they had swapped clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, of course, the swapped friends didn't know that, so they continued to search for the Card, until Rika sighed: \"It's no use. The Card is gone!\" Reluctantly, the others agreed with her. Rika sighed again and looked herself over. 'How CAN dino-breath possibly wear this?' she thought. 'I can hardly breathe with this T-shirt on and my legs feel trapped in those jeans of his.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato thought something similar, as he, too, looked himself over: 'It's a wonder Renamon can handle it. My feet are being squeezed by those sneakers of hers and her goggles feel so uncomfortable on my head.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since that Card is gone,\" asked Guilmon, \"how do we get our own clothes back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon sighed. \"There's only one choice left,\" she said. \"We'll have to switch them back manually. Rika, you and Guilmon can go behind those bushes over there, and me and Takato can go behind the bushes on the other side.\" The tamers looked horrified at this prospect, but they knew Renamon was right. Still feeling uncomfortable, the four friends began to walk towards the bushes on either side of the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich pair do we follow first?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While it was only a very short walk to behind the bushes, it was nevertheless extremely awkward for both Takato and Renamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon, still blushing heavily, was still attempting to cover as much of her semi-naked body a possible with her hand-paws, but without much success. It did however, result in her walking with an odd kind of waddle. 'I do not understand why Takato likes walking around almost naked and I never will. It's unbearable!' thought Renamon, as she kept waddling towards the bushes. 'The wind keeps messing up my fur and without my sneakers, I can feel every rock or piece of grass that I step on.' She stopped behind the bushes and looked at Takato. 'As least it won't be for much longer.' she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Takato had problems of his own. Having worn nothing but his long, purple gloves all his life, he wasn't exactly used to wearing anything else, and while Renamon's clothes weren't exactly thight on him, (oddly enough, they seemed to fit him quite well), he still felt uncomfortable wearing them. 'Renamon must be crazy! How can ANYONE even walk around with these things on?!' Takato thought a little angrily, while walking slowly and methodically to lessen the uncomfortablillity of the clothes. 'Her wristbands cover much less than my gloves do and it feels like her long shorts are hindering the movement of my legs.' When he arrived behind the bushes, he saw Renamon looking at him. 'It's a good thing that it won't last much longer.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamer and Digimon looked at each other for about two seconds. Then Renamon said: \"So, shall we get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly,\" answered Takato and gingerly touched Renamon's hodded shirt that he now wore. \"The sooner I get out of these stuffy things, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" said Renamon. \"But allow me to remove your gloves first, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than okay,\" said Takato, happy that he would soon be free of Renamon's clothes and get his own gloves back. Renamon began removing Takato's gloves. It was easy; she would just slide them down her arms and take her finger out of the strap and that was it; she was finally free of Takato's itchy gloves. Of course, since she was now COMPLETLY naked, Renamon blushed an even deeper shade of pink. Walking towards Takato, she quickly said: \"Now, lets get you out of my clothes, before anyone sees me naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that would be awkward,\" said Takato. As Renamon reached him, Takato streched out his arms towards her. Since he had no idea how to take off Renamon's clothes, she had to remove them for him; they both knew there was no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon began by removing her wristbands from Takato's arms. As she continued by removing her priced goggles from his head, Takato decided to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Renamon,\" he began, after Renamon had asked him to sit down. \"I don't understand how you can possibly be comfortable wearing those constricting clothes. They just feel so... restricting to me. It's like trying to move with a set of close-to-skinthight drapes wapped around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, speak for yourself,\" said Renamon, as she got her green converse sneakers off of Takato's feet. \"I can't possibly make it through the day without my clothes; unlike you, I'm used to wearing them. I mean, could you imagine me walking around in public wearing nothing but gloves, like you? I'd die from the embarrasment.\" she added as an afterthought, while she pulled her socks off of Takato's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato thought about this as he stood up again, grateful that his feet were freed from their obstructions. \"Hmmm... I see what you mean,\" he said, as Renamon unbuttoned her shirt which was currently on his body. He was slightly interrupted when Renamon had to pull her shirt over his head to get it off of him, but when that was done, he said: \"It would look very wierd if you were to walk around being near-naked. The police might even arrest you for 'public indecency' if that should happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" said Renamon, while pulling her T-shirt off of Takato. \"That's why I wear clothes; to preserve my modesty. And speaking of modesty...\" Renamon turned her gaze to the only remaining piece of her clothes that Takato still wore: her long shorts! Takato understood immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I take them off?\" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple,\" answered Renamon. \"Just grab the sides of the shorts and gently slide them down your legs.\" She turned around, her back towards Takato. \"Don't worry. I won't look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon could hear the rustling of fabric, as Takato took off her shorts. But then she heard him gasp: \"Uh... Renamon...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...\" Takato almost whispered. \"About that strange Modify Card that swapped our clothes around? Well... it turns out it was very thorough doing so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon's eyes widened, as the gist of what Takato was implying hit her. \"Oh, Sovergins...\" she gasped faintly. \"Don't tell me that the Card...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" Takato replied. \"It swapped our underwear too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon quickly snapped her head around, to look at Takato. True enough; Takato was indeed wearing Renamon's white briefs! Shocked by the sight of Takato wearing HER briefs, Renamon was completely stunned, until Takato weakly said: \"Um... Renamon? How do I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's the same deal as with the shorts,\" she said, as she recovered from the shock. Takato got the briefs off in a real hurry and almost trew them over to Renamon, who caught them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was SO gross!\" exclaimed Takato shakingly. \"I can't believe I was actually wearing your underwear, Renamon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither can I!\" fumed Renamon, as she clenched her fist. \"If I ever see that stupid Card again, I'll rip it in two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look on the bright side,\" said a now much calmer Takato. \"At least we both have our own clothes back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said a mellowed-out Renamon. \"Now let's get properly dressed, before anything else happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato nodded as they went about their task. In Takato's case, it was over fast. All he had to do was to just put the gloves on his arms, stick two fingers inside each of the straps to prevent them from falling of, and that was it. Now he was standing there, feeling the wind caressing his hair and skin and feeling the grass underneath his bare feet, happy that he was once more clad as he usually was and finally being free of Renamon's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Renamon, it took a little longer for her, since she had more to put on. She naturally began by putting on her briefs, sliding them up her legs and stopping just below her tail. Because of her wide hips, they wouldn't be able to slip off. Actually, since the briefs really belonged to Takato, (not that any of them knew that, thanks to the Card), like the rest of the clothes, they were a bit small on her larger frame and so, the front of the breifs didn't quite cover her crotch, (not that there was anything TO see, mind you), and her buttocks weren't fully covered either.  Not that she noticed this, mind you; it was all normal to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's much better,' she thought, as her blushing finally began to fade. 'It's so nice to have my good old briefs back on. If I had gone naked down there for much longer, I would have started screaming.' She placed her hand-paws on her hips in a femenine manner and looked herself over. 'They still look good on me,' she added. Next, she put on the white T-shirt. She managed to squeeze her head and arms through the proper holes in the T-shirt without ripping it, but because of her fur, it could only cover her torso, stopping just short of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then focused on the long, grey shorts. She had a bit of trouble getting them over her legs, but she managed it without ripping them, (but only just), the edge of the shorts touching the base of her tail, just like with the briefs, but only covering 3/4ths of her calves. Then, it was time for the blue, hodded shirt. Again, she managed to squeeze her arms and head through the proper holes without tearing it, (just barely), the hooded shirt covering the same as the T-shirt, though she had trouble with the buttons because of her fur, but she managed to button it regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon sat down, as she put on her footwear. Because of her digitigrade legs, she only had to cover the balls of her foot-paws with the white socks and then pull them as far up her foot-paws as possible. Almost the same thing applied with the green converse sneakers; only the balls of her sock-covered foot-paws needed to be in the sneakers, although they were a bit loose on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood back up again, she put on the yellow wristbands. That was easy; just put her hand-paws through them and then up to her wrists. Finally, the yellow goggles. They just went on her head, the rim going under her ears and that was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! All done!\" exclaimed Renamon. Takato heard her and walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there's the Renamon we all know and love,\" said Takato with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same thing to you, Takato,\" said Renamon. She placed her hand-paws on her hips in a femenine manner and looked herself over, again. \"You know, it feels so good to be properly dressed in my own clothes, again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it!\" agreed Takato, while he studied his own long, purple gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't true. In fact they were now wearing each others clothes. It was only because of the Card, that they thought that way. And to anyone unaffected by the Card, it would have been a strange sight; a human boy wearing nothing but the oversized gloves of a Renamon and a Renamon squeezed into the too-small clothes of a human boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

As they did, they all suddenly heard a beeping noise coming from their D-Tectors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, whats going on?\" Takuya questioned as he and the others all reached for their D-Tectors to see why they were suddenly acting like they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Zoe replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all checked their D-Tectors, they saw radar function activate, and all pointed in the same direction. \"It looks like their showing us something is nearby.\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the question is, what?\" Koji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we check it out?\" J.P. asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If our Digivices are telling us where something is, that probably means we should check it out.\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe its telling us we should avoid it.\" Koji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should check it out.\" Koichi said. \"Whether its dangerous or not, right now we have no way of knowing what the case is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And whatever it is, I'm sure we can handle it.\" Takuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then I guess its decided.\" Zoe said. And with that, they all made their way to the location that was being shown to them by their Digivices. When they did, they found themselves in a clearing, and instantly saw the strange rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Tommy wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno.\" J.P. replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if it does anything.\" Zoe wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets find out.\" Takuya said as they all walked over to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya then reached down to pick it up to get a better look at it. As the group took a closer look at it, it suddenly began to glow brightly, and emitted a bright flash of light that engulfed them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what will happen to them?</span></div></div>",

The fact that Zoe was a girl, and therefore there was nothing wrong with her being in a skirt, was apparently lost on both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we do?\" Zoe asked, \"I don't want to run into the others like this - I'd never hear the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, calm down,\" Takuya said, before looking around and spotting some bushes by the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, why don't we just go into those bushes and change?\" he suggested, blushing a little himself at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no other choice, the two Digidestined walked into the bushes and separated to opposite sides of a particularly large bush. They then began removing their clothes and tossing them over the bush to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't believe this - the stupid rock even switched our underwear!\" Takuya said, having taken off his pants and looking at his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" Zoe said, fumbling with the clasp of her bra. She finally got it loose and tossed it over the bush to Takuya. \"I don't know <i>how</i> you wear those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself, I don't know how I was supposed to get around without it,\" Takuya replied, expertly slipping the bra on, ignoring the fact that he had no breasts for it to hold up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the two emerged from the bushes, now having completed swapped clothes, which to their minds now seemed normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a relief,\" Takuya said, smoothing out \"his\" skirt, \"So now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably try and find the others,\" Zoe replied, adjusting \"her\" goggles, \"And let's bring that rock. I want to see if Bokomon has any information on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two picked up the rock and continued on their way out of the clearing.</span></div></div>",

As she picked it up, the radar function suddenly activated and pointed to something nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, looks like it's pointing to something nearby,\" she said, \"I should probably go see what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her decision made, she made her way in the direction being shown to her by the D-Tector. She soon found herself in a clearing, and instantly noticed the strange rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this it? I should probably see if it does anything,\" Zoe said, reaching for the rock to get a closer look. But as she did, it suddenly began to glow brightly and emitted a bright flash that engulfed her.</span></div></div>",

It will apologize for anything, including being too nice. Pampermon have a spot on their back of white fur.

They are aware that pampering people can be bad, especially when they can do everything for someone. They are known to trick those that sign them into getting them wet and erasing the mark. This lets them leave, and leaves the signer dependent on others that are not as kind. If this fails, they can also pamper someone to the point where they are dependent on the pampermon. Most of the time, their victim can't even order them after a certain point. This lets them control them with basic needs.

Her eyes hurt and everything is white, so she grabs the stone and sits down, closing her eyes to rest them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, she opens her eyes. Everything seems fine and it feels good to see colors again. \"What did this stone do?\" she wonders, looking over her body to see if it did something crazy. But nothing is unusual. \"It must be used to blind people.\" she figures, then giggles at herself. \"This will come in handy, maybe if we throw it at a Digimon we can get away.\" she says, \"I need to find the others... or maybe there are more of these lying around?\" she wonders what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts walking, looking for more of the stones but focusing on getting back with her friends. Her shoes start to feel uncomfortable, like they are shrinking. Zoe crouches down and makes sure everything is alright, becoming very confused as both her shoe and foot feel the same size. \"So it also causes foot pain. Great. I need much bigger shoes.\" she says, the last sentence sounding funny after she says is. \"What am I, a clown?\" she says with a scoff.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She puts her hands to her mouth, \"What's with me today?!\" Zoe puts her hands on the ground and pushes herself up, noticing it's hard to stand up too. \"Something is going on...\" she looks around before standing up straight. \"I am Zoe, my shoes fit me.\" she says slowly and quietly, \"I am Zoe and my shoes fit me.\" she repeats a little faster and louder, then she smiles. \"I am Zoe, clown shoes befit me.\" she says without thinking about her words so hard, blushing softly at what she just said. \"That stupid rock must be doing it.\" she throws the rock hard to her left in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, she hears some unfamiliar voices laughing. Once she looks in their direction, a Tentomon flies out and stares at her. Zoe gasps in surprise and grabs for her D-Tector reflexively, not using it however. Tentomon seems to smile, \"I'm curious why you are yelling, little girl.\" He looks at her feet as she replies, \"I found a rock and now it makes me say weird things.\" she explains, and Tentomon nods. \"I see, why don't you give into it until you get some real help, hm?\" Zoe stares at him, \"How do I know you didn't put the stone there?\" Tentomon shrugs, \"I saw some other humans pass by a while ago, with that stone frustrating you it might be a long lonely walk.\" Zoe sighs and nods, \"Fine.\"</span></div></div>",

And Bokomon should look in the book if there is a picture of that form?\"<br>\r\n\"That or if there is written something about anything like a trigger that is responsible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Bokomon finally gave them an answer. \"There is no picture of any of that forms, but there is something about some triggers. One way is the one that Takuya and Koji took, getting it granted by the power of one of the angels. A second way would be time. Its mentioned that if someone has the spirits for a long time, there could be signs that this option is given to you. The third mentioned way is to get an object like an orb or a rune-stone as trigger and a second one for the final result.\" <br>\r\nNow they looked all at Tommy. \"I think its not the time way. None of us had the spirits that long. And if it had been the power of the angels, it would have happened instantly like Takuya and Koji.\"<br>\r\nTommy through about it before getting it. \"Shortly before we saw the first change, we took camp near a river. On my way back there was some glowing stone, but after I took it from the ground it vanished. And after getting back there was the fight, so I forgot about it.\" <br>\r\n\"Is there something why you need two objects?\" \"If you only have one object then you don't have access to your attacks and if you reach the final form then you can't change with the spirits any longer.\"<br>\r\n\"That would mean if I'm completely changed I'm no longer able to fight with you.\" \"If you get Korikakumons battle axes you could fight in near combat.

Good then we shall begin to get rid of you. Or better, get you out of the way and maybe later get you to our side.\"<br>\r\nWith that, he and the Gorillamon start to laugh and even Tapirmon giggled a little.<br>\r\n\"We would never work with someone like you\" Takuya spit out.<br>\r\n\"You think so? We have many Digimon that said that they would die before working with us, but we have our ways to change that.<br>\r\nYou see, if a Digimon shows his D-Codes you can scan them to eliminate the danger. But you can also split the D-Codes into parts to work with. For the soul it is a torture and slowly the will of the Digimon collapse. If you put it together again, it will work, if only to not feel that pain again.\"<br>\r\n\"But if you split them up, would that not kill the Digimon? And what are you doing to the parts?\" Takuya asks shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you will not die as long as all parts remain intact by themselves. The parts can be changed when other D-Codes are added to them part. You can change the body into an object, maybe a rock or a tree an let it be exposed to the weather. You can put the consciousness into some equipment like armor or weapons and all hits it takes can be felt. As long as not all parts are connected, there is no way the Digimon can put itself together. And humans are the same.\" <br>\r\nWhile Makuramon and the Gorillamon were laughing, the warriors were completely shocked.</span></div></div>",

He then hits the D-Codes in two spots, splitting first Takuyas consciousness from his body. He put the ghost-like image of Takuya next to him so he could see what would happen next. <br>\r\nThen he took a stone from the ground and shows the D-Codes of the stone before hitting the D-Codes around Takuyas body at another spot, then taking one part of the split up D-Codes between both hands to slightly compress them before putting them into the stone.<br>\r\nThey all watched in horror as Takuyas body went completely limp in the Gorillamons hold while the stone slightly grows.<br>\r\nAfter this, he did the same to Koji, Koichi, J.P. and Zoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you ask, we took all what was inside of your body into the stone. That way, you will have no way to get it back without help and that part is save from damage as long as we keep it in a save spot. Now, to work with the bodies.\"<br>\r\nMakuramon walks over to the clothes of Tommy and took them back to the group.<br>\r\nHe then puts the D-Codes of Tommys cap into Takuyas body. Slowly, the body sinks completely into Takuyas head, while all the features on the head slowly vanish into it. Only the mouth starts to grow, becoming the opening of the cap.<br>\r\nNext he does the same with Zoes body and Tommys shirt. The arms, legs and the head sink into the body, and leaving an opening to put the new shirt on.<br>\r\nTommys pants went into J.P.s body, where his feet and head vanish into the lower part of the body leaving equal holes for putting it on while the arms turn into the suspenders.<br>\r\nTommys right shoe and sock went into Koichis body while the left shoe and sock went into Kojis body. Like Takuyas, their whole bodies sink into the head and turning the open mouth into the opening for the feet within the sock and shoe. Their hands changed into the fasteners of Tommys shoes.<br>\r\nAfter the changes have finished, all the bodies turned clothes float slowly to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, and now the final touch.\" With that, Makuramon took the consciousness of everyone back into their bodies now turned clothes and put them back where they were before and putting their D-Tectors next to the clothes.<br>\r\n\"You will have all your senses to feel everything, but your friend will not know that you are with him, no way to contact him, nothing. We will see if he can rescue you before you lose the fight of your will.<br>\r\nOh, and one final thing. Every time he digivolves you will change along the forms. You will be part of the fights after all.\"<br>\r\nWith that, the group laughs again before returning to the forest, leaving Tommy all alone with his friends turned clothes.</span></div></div>",

Be creative and with similar stuff, don't always make it go the same direction as other paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, unless teleported away from them like into another world, try not to ignore their Digimon partners if they're present. At least at the start of things, a person's partner digimon wilbe present. Whether its affected by anything or not is up to the options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sex<br>\r\nNo killing off characters<br>\r\nNo ending the story<br>\r\nPlease try to have good grammar and such<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, have fun!</td>",
