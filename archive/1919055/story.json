You look over to see that someone was with you in bed. You couldn't tell who it was but from the faint outline you could make out that I was a women. You scratch your head and then crack your neck  as you get up from the bed and head to the bathroom. You step inside, feeling the texture of the bathroom tiles as you walk forward and up to the sink. You look into the mirror and see your usual face, your hair was a mess and you needed a trim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...hey where'd you go?\" you heard the woman on your bed mutter. You look back to see her leaning upward, her chest covered with a blanket. You walk out of the bathroom and walk towards the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" you say before letting out a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...what time is it?\" the woman yawns. You look at the alarm and look just in time to see it turn 5am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About 5am. You want anything?\" you reply offering to grab the lady a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5am? Ugh I have to open the shop in an hour.\" the woman replies clearly having hadn't gotten enough sleep last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to wake you up in a half hour?\" you offer and the woman nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks (your name). *yawn*\" soon the woman falls back asleep and you nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet dreams...Ino\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes pass in the blink of an eye as you left of the bedroom and went into the kitchen to fix breakfast for the two of you. You set the table which didn't take long, you lived in a small apartment with only a few rooms, a kitchen/living room, a bathroom with a shower, and a bedroom. Regardless you were happy, especially since you had such nice and beautiful friends. You had several  close friends, all of them women, all of them very beautiful looking, in fact it almost seemed like a harem in a way but you didn't mind. Some of the girls of your 'harem' were older than you some younger than you but age didn't matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you recall a memory from last night, you had received a call from Ino, she had called and asked you if you could help her study for her next exam. She was having a hard time getting down a jutsu and you agreed to help her. You and Ino spent several hours on trying to perfect the jutsu but at around 1am you called it a night. Ino asked if she could sleep in your bed tonight and you didn't see the harm in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm *yawn* morning\" Ino said as she finally woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Awake already? But I thought you were gonna sleep for another twenty minutes?\" you asked as you put a large plate of riceballs on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"{*yawn* I was but *yawn*...\" Ino continued to yawn for another two minutes before continuing \"...sorry. That jutsu really is a pain. I think I used up all my chakra last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense.\" you say with a chuckle \"you've been trying to get that jutsu of yours down for a while now. What was it called again? Mind something jutsu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*ahem* its called the Mind transfer jutsu. And I've already got it mastered. I'm just trying to get it to the point where you can't break out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright, you don't have to yell at me. Besides, you'll wake the neighbors\" you groan before suddenly hearing a knock at the door. \"hmm wonder who that could be?\" You get up from the table and head to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Are you awake in there? I hope it's not too early\" called the voice from outside. You make it ot the door and turn the handle to see none other than ____ standing on the porch.</span></div></div>",

What with the fairy tail guild being the number one guild in the land filled with powerful and sexy mages yet not one of them could stand up to Anon. The new ace of fairy tail who put gladiarts out to dry and even made Laxus back out of battling no one could stand up to him and no female could refuse him and as such whenever he fancied any action all he had to do what make his move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd today would be no different, for this hot spot mage as he wonders into the guild hall greeted by the cheers of his fellow guild mates and eyes of lust from every female he catches eye sight with. It had been another tough mission for Anon and now he needed to unwind the question is how? He banged the hell out of the most chicks in fairy tail heck even doing it on the master desk making the old man leave the room. Still gazing around today all the ladies for fairy tail are here today but did anon fancy any of them to relax with? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps he'd like to go off to another guild perhaps mermaid heel a guild full of hot women ready for him? But what about others places like the palace where the sexy princess lived or the  prison for all the bad mages which also have devil hot females? He did not know but in the end our hot hero decides too...</span></div></div>",

A simple black tank top which left little to the imagination with very short black shorts to match anon knew this would one work out he would enjoy and so return to his royal room to change himself into a simple loose t-shirt and some loose shorts before going to the palaces gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA private place where only he could be by his orders, Anon quickly makes his way to the gym to see Kallen all ready stretching out for the exercise with her back to Anon.

Such a display of course got Anon's attention, his body warming up from the sigh of such a women and his hands eager to get on the knight he calmly walks over to the stretching Kallen before clamming his hand around her breasts making the knight let out a surprised moan as Anon begins to fondle the cloth cover breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not really surprised are you my red haired love?\" Anon asks in a quiet tone pulling Kallen into him as he continues to knee her large breasts in his hands.

He quickly speeds up this action feeling his finger getting hotter and wetter he then begins to talk dirty to his knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that don't you? You like my finger inside you don't you my red hair slave!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting in-between her word Kallen shouts out a chorus of yes, yes i love it making Anon quickly withdraw his forefinger before quickly forcing both his forefinger and middle finger back into her womanhood making Kallen let out a loud moan from the quick penetration. She couldn't control the sounds coming out of her mouth and neither the feeling of pleasure racing though her from his foreplay before suddenly Anon withdraws his fingers and his hand from her breast making her quickly turn around panting and wanting more before she hears him say.              <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is perfectly fine to throw the girls of the other Yugioh series into this, but you must first catch all the 5ds girls first and give a good reason for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Slavery in New Domino: Remember my old original 5ds harem story? Well it's now back as the first option here but with a minor tweak. From any reason to Mega-Ultra Ebola\u00ae\u00a9\u2122 causing wiping out a good chunk of the world because some NWO-types wanted to enact their devious plans but failed halfway, the Earthbound Immortals lashing out and cursing the world they failed to bring devastation to, the Three Pure Nobles/Z-ONE going back in time ending up making some few changes, or all of the above slavery is now in New Domino City to bump up birth rates. Women can now be auctioned off if they commit a crime, or if a boss/loved one/guardian signs a document stating they are to be sold. Slaves can also be won in duels between owners as well. Maybe you feel like being a hero and plan on rescuing the 5ds girls, or you just want them to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to include that old serum from the original story that causes a girl's curves to grow two times their original size, makes them submissive to you and makes their holes eternally virginal tight, and lactate go right ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: Psychic Conqueror: you are a psychic duelist who feels like testing his abilities out to gain a harem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: A Harem for the Future: The android girl Misaki from the World Championship 2011 game is sent back in time to ensure you get a harem to save the world in the future. How the two of you go about this is up to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #4: Lessons from the Duel Monsters Spirit World: like Luna you spent some time in the home of duel monsters spirits during your childhood. On one day you remember that time period, and a few very interesting lessons from a spirit on how to become very popular with the ladies. Time to apply those lessons now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #5: Grim darkness of the far future there is only more choices. You ought to know this by now.</span></div></div>",

You never bought into that idea that Duel Monsters Spirit World exists, but yet every now and then you dream about the place you are certain does not exist. Strangely enough a younger version of yourself, no older than five at the least, is walking amongst the spirits generally having fun. This reoccurring dream is normally very short-lived and you can barely remember fragments of it most of the time. Tonight is different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight the dream is completely vivid and feels more like a memory. Almost as if you were actually in the spirit world at one point during your childhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Anon. I have a gift for you back at my home.\" You hear a female spirit say to you. And there she was. The popular for obvious reasons Dark Magician Girl. The female Magician has served as your guide during your stay in this world, and the two of you had an absolute blast together. Your younger self wished you could have spent the rest of your days by her side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit took you by the hand and led you through a green field to her abode. Whoever built it couldn't have made it scream \"wizards live here!\" even if they used a spell to make the building grow a mouth. She later admitted that it wasn't actually her house, Dark Magican and Dark Sage were allowing her to stay until she finished her tutelage under them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought you to a room filled with tomes which were assuredly magical in nature, and drew a symbol on the hand she held on the trip here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There all done! When you get older this will help you with the ladies, Anon.\" She assured you in a sweet voice accompanied by a smile which was betrayed by the devious glint in her eyes. Before you could question her the dreams ends, and you are wide awake to a very unsettling sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour left hand is now on fire. You immediately begin panicking. You put your legs to good use as you rush to your bathroom in hopes that running water will be able to put this flame out. Had you been in a less frantic state you would have noticed the fire around you hand wasn't  hurting earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurried to the bathroom sink, wasting no time to turn turn the water on and to place your burning hand underneath it. After several minutes of this the fire refuses to go away much to your utter confusion. It's not really hurting you for some reason so what gives? To only as more to your confusion the fire's color changes into a dark blue with what appears to pink hearts surrounding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid someone drug you without you noticing it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's finally time for my gift to be used, Anon.\" You heard a voice say coming from the fire. You know that voice. It's the same one you heard from your dream. Soon the image of the Dark Magican Girl manifested in the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't you remember how all those years ago I gave you a gift?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, that time spent when you were a kid in the duel Monsters Spirit World actually happened? It's late at night, your hand is on fire, and a popular monster image is in the fire. You are probably insane, drugged up, or maybe this really is all happening. You're not certain which is preferable to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your gift is making my hand burn?\" You bluntly ask the mage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfff. No. It's for helping you get a girlfriend, Anon.\" DMG replies, adding more to your confusion. \"You just have to throw it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is burning women to death going to get me a girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were more polite when you were a kid, you know that?\" Said an annoyed DMG. \"It's a spell, Anon. Think of it like a love potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I have to throw in the shape of a fireball instead of tricking a girl to drink?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you put it like that, yes,\" says the blonde mage, her smile returning. \"I figured since we had so much fun together during your last trip here I ought to give you something to help you out later in life. Judging from your apartment I can say you needed it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the Dark Magican Girl failed to mention is she also gave you that spell because she was bored, and you liked the type who could give her some amusement down the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only temporary until I can afford an actual house.\" You say rather defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes. \"That's what they all say.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided you are probably going crazy. The Dark Magican Girl just insulted your apartment and is telling you to throw fireballs at women to make them want to be your girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you let out slowly, \"How is this going to work when everyone can see the fire coming?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think I wouldn't have that planned out? The only person who can see it is you, Anon. I have you covered since your childhood.\" You then ask her what if you hit someone more than once with it, and a mischievous smirk emerged on her face. \"Find out for yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire goes out with her image and you return to bed to sleep on what has transpired. If all of that truly did happen you'll probably be the luckiest guy in the city. The next morning you learn you can call upon the fire af will. Nice to know it wasn't a drugs or a dream. You set out to find a girl to test this gift out on. Who do you run into?</span></div></div>",

One day you become curious about what you can do with your powers, and that ends in you gaining a collection of babes from all eras willing to service you. Your deck for this will be the Tag Force 5 starter deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption#4: Driven by Lust: You are so determined to getting a harem that you have built the means for you to enter all yugioh eras, and multiple means of enslavement from mind control to serums.

The mission in question was to search for an abandoned hideout of the late Toad Sage Jiyara. The Hokage recently found some research notes that belonged to the old man that caught her interest. She said it had something to do with an experimental Jutsu that she wanted to try out. You made a joke about it being some sort of age reversal Jutsu durning the briefing. She didn't think it was funny.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were grateful that she didn't feel like beating your end, but that was probably because she wanted to relax now that the Great Ninja War was over.  You heard that Naruto guy, the one that defeated Pain, defeated Madara freaking Uchiha! And that the past four Hokage came back from beyond the grave to help! But more importantly, Madara's dead, again, and no one will live in a fake imaginary world created by a crazy old coot! You made a note to do something nice for the guy when you get the chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the village, things are looking up now. Ever since the survivors of the war came back, the village's reconstruction has been accelerating, and so far no other village has tried to pull anything funny. Maybe there'll be peace in the Ninja world after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut peace for you? Not lately. You've been following a map to Jiraya's hideout, and you came to the conclusion that the old man made this map to drive people insane. The first stop had you dig under the hot springs to find the next piece of the map. When you found it, you weaken the ground underneath a certain Hokage that decided to take some time to relax, and made her fall into your tunnel. To say Lady Tsunade was angry was an understatement. How you aren't in the hospital is something only the Sage of the Six Paths could know. The next couple of stops involved Jiraya's favorite places, more hot springs. Though you might be banned from a good majority of those places, it wasn't all bad. You got to see Tsunade's chest, that has got to count for something. Another stop had you got to this forest where you found this triple bladed scythe that you took a likening to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have finally found the place you've been looking for the past two weeks, and you have the hope that you could be in the Hokage's good graces again. The Sage had the place hidden away in a swamp. Seemed fitting enough that he would build the place in an area filled with frogs. </span></div></div>",

One landed on the back of your neck and jammed its proboscis into your neck, breaking the skin an beginning its meal. <i>Smack!</i> Your hand made that sound when it made contact with the back of your neck, and the mosquito as well. Another one landed on your face and quickly started its meal of your blood. You brought your hand to it, but the insect got off before you killed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mosquito flew to a near by pond, only to be caught by a tongue of a toad, and to become a snack of the amphibian. The toad then released a loud croak before jumping off the lilly pad it was on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued on your way to the building, swatting any mosquito that attempted to make a meal out of you. You propped yourself on a near by tree to take a break, because it has been that long. You released a large sigh, and took out the map. You looked over it to review your mission. Your first stop, the first sign that this mission was going to be a long one, could of went better than you wanted it to. To see Lady Tsunade so furious, and yet at the same time so arousing was something else, you thought. You don't care how old she is, she's still hot. Now only if you could stop going back to when her chest started to jiggle would help. You started imagine those massive mounds of flesh going up and down on something else, and a scenario where they're jiggling in your face.... You shook your head to being yourself back to reality. Maybe reviewing your other stops, the ones that did not involve naked women, would help you out with tightness in your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This one,</i> you groaned mentally. One of the ones that got you into legal trouble. The second stop had you technically trespass on Hyuga property, and then how you escaped became full trespassing. They didn't even give you time to explain. Thankfully any legal trouble stops were short in number. The best one was the one where you got the scythe. It gives you the feeling that it has been used religiously in more ways than one for some odd reason. There were a lot of deer staring at you with these strange eyes when you dug up the next piece of the map. Yet the feeling that you were trespassing lingered on as left the forest with your prizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your eyes off the map, and looked up at the sky. \"Lord Jiraya, I hope you're watching,\" you say, thinking the Sage was watching your mission from beyond the grave. \"It would only be fitting that you would be a perv in death, as you were in life.\" You sighed one more time while putting the map away. You killed a mosquito that was having a time with your face. The sooner you got out of this swamp, the sooner you could put this business behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraya's hideout was half size of a two story house, and the years in the swamp hasn't been too bad to it. It looked like it was still in good condition, aside from the grime and filth it gained. You opened the door and felt something fly by near your face. Some blood trickled down your face as you saw what looked like a shurekin hit the tree you previously propped yourself on. You then realized the old man had the place booby trapped, and that might of been a warning shot. You dropped to the ground as more shrukiens hit the tree.</span></div></div>",

I'm coming after you!\" You yell in a fit of anger resulting from all the dead man has put you through. The swamp became quiet, aside from the croaking of toads and frogs, and the buzzing of insects. You got up and dusted yourself off when your heard what sounded like growling. You turned your head and saw in the hazy swamp fog, a pair of two glowing, piercing, yellow eyes. Eyes that looked at your very soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No, no, no...\" You say staring straight back at the eyes. \"I've been chased by a naked woman that posses strength that can crush a boulder, and have gotten in trouble with the Hyugas.

You threw the kunai with the explosive tag now attached to it at the source of the eyes, and then fired off a fire ball Jutsu at it. It could of been the Jutsu, it could of been the tag, but you could care less. Whatever it was, it was most likely dead. If not, the scythe could finish the job. Just as you were about to enter the building, you say what looked like more eyes appear out of the fog, with intense growling followed afterwards. You then proceed to use the Jutsu once more, firing at all of the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Jiraya wasn't good at genjutsu, was he?\" You asked as you shut the door behind you. \"And if those were his toads, shouldn't they introduced themselves or something?\" You shrugged it off as a genjutsu or something. Wanted you wanted to know is if you'd get a vacation after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came across a hallway, and had the feeling that this has to be a trap. You placed your back on the corner, and used the scythe to spring any traps. Sure enough, the scythe did its job. You watched as shurekins flew by hitting the wall. You weren't going to let an old man be death of you when another old man almost trapped the world into a genjutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found a room that contained scrolls, and felt like you found what you were looking for. You entered the room cautiously, using your scythe as a minesweeper on the floor as you approached a desk. You saw a journal on the desk, and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the past couple of weeks the \"growling\" has become more frequent than usual, and with increased intensity,\" you read out loud from the journal, \"And what appears to be eyes show up more than they used to.\" You continued to read from the journal, dismissing this as a trick made by Jiraya. It's better than the other. Swamp monsters aren't real. That's the stuff of legends and folk lore. Things that parents tell their children to stay out of swamps, and for older ninjas to tell genin to make them not leave the comrades behind during swamp missions. Tailed Beasts? A man with unique eyes fighting a god, sealing it inside of him, and creating the moon? That's believable. Especially the latter, because that makes so much sense why there's nine demons made up of chakra. To you at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a kunai that the Fourth Hokage used to help him out with that teleportation Jutsu of his on the desk. \"This would be a great souvenir,\" you said putting it in your pocket. You wondered if this counts as stealing, but you decided Jiyara owes you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had past since you found the room, and it was getting to you. Whatever journal or scroll you found was either old book ideas, or rough drafts. Not that the mission itself was helping as well. You created a clone to take over while you rest up. Every now and then, you would doze off and dream about the hot spring stops before the clone would wake you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Lady Hokage, not there,\" you mumbled as you dreamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, slacker,\" your clone said knocking you on the head with the scythe's handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bad,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Lady Tsunade heard you, she'd beat you into next week,\" the clone replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it my fault I'm dreaming about what you're reading?\" You asked the clone. \"Why are you even reading the old man's smut anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm bored.\" The clone answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes. \"Where are we now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just finished reading the story where the guy's girlfriend became an idiot, and the one where this leaf shinobi and hidden mist ANBU black ops operative fall in love. It's actually a pretty good story,\" the clone answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much more do we lack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty five more journals, and fifty seven more scrolls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrific.\" You sighed. \"Am I going insane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, you're lazy. I'm probably going to go insane here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read smut makes you lose sanity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not all smut. Some stories have nothing smutty at all.\" Insisted the clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Do you think this is all an elaborate test made by the Hokage to see if I'm worthy enough to be a jonin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would she let you see her naked then?\" The clone asked. \"Unless that's a part of her plan I don't see that happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this point I'm willing to believe anything,\" you reply. \"Note to self, head to home when I get done here. The Hokage can wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours, many scrolls and and eleven journals later, the clone and you had read most of the scrolls here, and only one journal was left. Your eyes were tired from reading, and you could really go for hitting one of those hot springs you're still allowed at, and forgetting this mission altogether. The clone wasn't faring much better. The clone leaned to far back in the chair it was sitting in, and with a quick cloud of smoke, it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slacker.\" You said as you grabbed the last journal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting old,\" you read out loud, \"and I can't always get a young beauty like I could when I was younger. So, I decided what if I could reverse the age process to look and be young again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to read the journal and found out that Tsunade's information was wrong. Jiraya didn't just create one experimental Jutsu. He created a couple that only a perverted mind like his could only produce. And one was an age reversal that actually could regress a person's age. A few of them was based on some information he plundered from a base of Orchimaru's. You read that the justu the Sage had created were the following: a mind control Jutsu, two similar Jutsu that could make a woman's chest or butt bigger; one that involved hormones, and one that could turn a woman into a bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got to be kidding me. This has got to be fake,\" you say to yourself. You read downward on the page and saw that the old man did have some success with these Jutsu. At this point like you said earlier, you're willing to believe anything. You're willing to believe that the journal's telling the truth, and Tsunade's testing your loyalty based on if you use them or not. Heck, you're even willing to believe she wants you to use the bimbo Jutsu on her because she wants to become a brain dead bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what to do with these scrolls?</span></div></div>",

Seems like you skipped taking a bath, and went straight to bed when you got home. You just rubbed your eyes and took off your forehead protector. \"Bath time,\" you said heading for the shower. A nice, warm shower is what you need. As the water washed over you, its warmth remind you of the hot springs, and seeing Tsunade's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower, you found something to wear and searched for something to eat. You really need to go grocery shopping soon. The milk in the refrigerator is almost spoiled, and the only thing you can eat for breakfast is an almost empty box of cereal. But it'll do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This smells better than that swamp,\" you said taking a whiff of the milk. \"But then again, almost anything will,\" you say as you poured the milk into a bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, you decided you should now that a better look at those scrolls. A well rested mind should do you wonders to help learn new Jutsu. You placed the scrolls and the journals you brought back on the table, and grabbed the journal that you read the last time. You wanted to make sure of that you didn't miss anything. You didn't miss anything. You went for the remaining journals to see if they had any hints and tips on the jutsu. Most of them were unfortunately just stories Jiraiya didn't go through with. Only two journals had anything on the jutsu, but they'll help. You looked at the scrolls, and saw they were easy, but some required a good amount of chakra to use. The mind control Jutsu gave you the impression that you could use it only once a day. You could probably use it on multiple targets, but that would leave you pretty drained. The age regression one took the most, no question. The bimbo Jutsu would work best together with the mind control, you noted. The expansion Jutsu and the hormone Jutsu required the less amount of chakra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what are you going to do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For some reason, she couldn't think way she should get angry at you. \"Thank you, *your name*. I'll take this back to the kitchen.\" She said getting off the couch with the glass. As she got up, you noticed her rear end looked like it was getting bigger. Hinata placed the glass in the sink without an incident, and came to the living room. For some reason, her seat felt different than before. As if it was somebody's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Hinata?\" You say getting her attention. She jumped off your lap, and started to apologize with a blush on her face. \"That's okay, Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fog in her mind was starting to become much worse. She started to forget basic things like the skill needed to be a ninja, and trivial things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long would it take for the Jutsu to come full circle?</i></span></div></div>",

That was a good sign, for you at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was something the First Hokage famous for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, her big boobies?\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"That's Lady Tsunade, Hinata. An she's not famous just for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Give me another question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from that, what else is she famous for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, uh,\" Hinata says, scratching her head. \"For having big boobies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least her intelligence was starting to reach the proper bimbo levels, and shouldn't she have some to by now? You decided her expansion was taking too long. \"Hinata, I'm going to use the Jutsu again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did it do again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't remember?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think you never told me what it did in the first place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should of remembered,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think maybe you did.\" She said. With that you used the Jutsu on her, again. This time, it looked her growth was catching up to her draining intellect. Her chest started to enlarge, making her feel hot. \"Is it me, or is it getting hot in here?\" She asked fanning herself. She took off her coat, and it looked like in a while her breast would probably burst out soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her lips started to look bigger, you wondered how she was doing in the brain department. While the Jutsu should make the fog in her mind worse, her intellect shouldn't be be too bright. So, you decided to test it out. \"Hinata, I think you're doing it wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What am I doing wrong? Am I sitting wrong?\" She asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I think you're wearing it wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata still had some brains in her, but still less than enough to not believe you. \"How am I wearing it wrong? Is it on backwards?\" She asked looking at the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I mean you're wearing it wrong, because you're wearing it.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She still had enough sense to see the error in your logic. Thankfully for you, the fog in her mind would get worse, and she'd become a bimbo faster the more she had to think about something. So, all you had to do is say things that don't make sense, and her lack of intelligence would make her try to understand it would make her a bimbo faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For some reason, I can't help but think the rule had been changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What rules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rules that say you need to wear a shirt over your bra. For the life of me, I can't help but think a bra counts as a shirt, and a shirt counts as bra.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can use my bra as a shirt, and wear it over my shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and no. All you need is your bra, and no shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But people would see my boobies then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you want them to, and if you wear your bra. You don't have to wear your shirt, like your bra, but you can though. You don't want to break the rules do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" The near bimbo said taking off her shirt. \"Hinata's, like, a good girl who follows the rules!\" You'd give her maybe four minutes before she's an airhead. And you couldn't believe your eyes. Her tits were now bigger than Tsunade's! You could wait to see how big her's would be when you turn her into a bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hinata, I'm thinking about getting my name changed to Master, what do you think about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that's totes cool, Master!\" She said in a higher pitch voice. \"Can I call you that from now on?\" She says in her regular voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Master,\" she says, \"Something feels wrong with my boobies. They feel bigger than they used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could feel them for you to check,\" you say moving your hands towards them. Hinata covered her breasts with her hands, but then dropped them, not seeing why she shouldn't let.</span></div></div>",

You licked your lips when you saw your soon to be bimbo slave's tits bounce a little when her struggling bra was ripped off, and her simi-erect nipples. Your fingers sunk deeply into her expanded flesh getting a small moan out of her. The heavy orbs of flesh had a warm feeling to them making your squeeze them more. Carnal thoughts had no trouble entering your mind, and Hinata's moans were becoming more audible. You took your hands off and said, \"They feel fine to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Hinata whispered in a begging tone. \"Please keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it when I grope you, Hinata?\" You ask as you twisted her nipples. You wanted to suck on them so badly, but decided to wait until she was a full bimbo before you did that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master,\" she said, \"please grab my boobies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I want to, I think I need to check your butt,\" you said taking your left hand away from a nipple and squeezed her butt, \"It feels like it could use some checking too.\" Hinata took off her pants, and whatever her panties were before, they were stretched into a thong now. You ripped it off just like her bra too. Your hardon became harder as you had Hinata in her naked glory in your house, and her blush was also nice. You guessed she was trying to resist her transformation to a degree and regaining some of her normal sensibilities. That needed to go. Now. You grabbed one of her boobs with your right hand, and grabbed one of her buttocks with your left. You then moved your over to her other breast, and started sucking on her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Master, squeeze harder!\" She moaned as you pleasured her more to get her back on track to bimbohood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shook her head and pulled away from you. \"Master, do you have, lik- a bathroom?\" You pointed down the hall, and smiled as you got a good look of her behind. It was still growing but it looked like it was getting close to stopping. \"Come on, stupid door, open,\" she said to the door. She pouted as the door didn't open, \"Stupid mean door, Hinata- I need to get in.\" She got on her knees and begged to the door, \"Pretty please, Mr. Door? Like, I forget how to open you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having trouble?\" You say as you walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. This door is totes mean!\" She replied. She gasped as you turned the door knob, and opened the door for her. She hugged you tightly and said, \"Like, Master, you're a really smarty pants and a hero!\" before regaining some of her senses and entered the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned on the sink, and splashed water in her face. \"Get a grip on yourself, Hinata,\" she mumbled. \"Look at yourself!\" She saw the changes to her in the mirror and wondered what was happening to her. \"Master! He's doing this to me! I need to- like thank him for making me turn into such a hottie!\" She said in a high pitched sultry voice. \"Like, I bet if I sucked his cock, he'd let me suck it any time I wanted to!\" She giggled. Her transformation was complete now.</span></div></div>",

Her tits were bigger than Tsunade's, and was fatter than the Lady Hokage's. The same was for her rear, now two fat mounds of flesh that jiggled still after they expanded. Her lips became puffer and looked like it wouldn't have trouble sucking anything. In her head was nothing but a thick pink fog, and the love of sex. You figured Hinata would be smarter, but you guessed that the Jutsu was very effective. You imagined how Lady Tsunade would look after you hit her with it. If it was possible, the hardness in your pants became harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata let out a giggle first and then said in a stupid, high pitch voice, \"Like, what did you do me? My boobies are soooo big now!\" She squeezed them and moaned loudly. Hinata started to bounce up and down, watching what should be called udders now hit her in face sometimes. \"Heheh. Big and bouncy boobies! Bouncy boobies! Heheheh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I turned you into a bimbo, Hinata,\" you explained while getting her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's, like, a bimbo, and why did *your name* turn Hinata into one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bimbo is a girl that has a big chest and butt, but really isn't smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like Hinata!\" She gasped. \"Why did you make Hinata's boobies and booty bigger, and take away her smarticles?\" The bimbo demanded in a way that made you feel bad. \"Like, are bimbos the girls that get to have a lot of hawt sexy with guys with super cocks and tasty cum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned at this. \"Yes, Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata squealed loudly at this. \"Now, like, Hinata can have hawt sex with tons of guys with super cocks! Thanks, *your name*, but Hinata has to leave now and find a bunch of manly guys.\" The bimbo said heading for the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You can't leave! You're my bimbo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why can't Hinata have hawt sex with other manly guys?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I said so,\" you answered. Hinata had a look that was the closet she could manage to deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, okay, but Hinata wants super cocks now!\" She said like a bratty kid being denied her way. She stomped her foot down and made her tits and butt jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give you that Hinata, but it'd have to be mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I turned you into a bimbo,\" you replied. \"And I think that would be breaking the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What rules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rules that say you have to be the bimbo slave of the person that turns you into one. I think you'd be in so much trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata's a good bimbo that doesn't break the rules!\" She said falling for your trick. \"But can Hinata sometimes, like, suck other super cocks besides yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not many people like bimbos, Hinata. People would probably make fun of you for having those assets of yours, and for not being smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata pouted. \"People would make fun of Hinata for having big boobies and a big booty, and like, not being a smarty pants?\" You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't worry, Hinata. I like bimbos, big boobies and big booties. I might make fun of you for being a bimbo, but I would do in a way that's not mean.\" You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thanks *your name*! Your so nice, can I be your bimbo slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can, you bimbo.\" You said.</span></div></div>",

Did you plan on going somewhere?\" You asked staring at your mind controlled slave's bust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was heading to the Leaf Village to find someone I know if they've seen my master.\" Her answer caused you to grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that you accomplished that!\" You replied grabbing her behind. \"I'm your master now, and I think I'll change a few things as I go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Master, but what about me do you want to change?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For starters your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't told you my name yet, Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou liked how she called you \"Sir\". \"I know but you don't need it. I want you to forget your old life because now you're living a life of being my little pet. I can't think of a name for you at the moment, but that can wait. I've been walking for too long, and I need something to drink.\" You groped her breasts, \"These better have milk in them. If they do I'm going to need them to double as pillows when I'm finished. If you wake up before I do start worshipping my cock,\" you ordered your plaything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, what if someone discovers us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake me up. If they're chicks and I don't wake up, try subduing them until I do so I can use the Jutsu on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they're willing to become your slaves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If any babes willing to become my slaves come by here get them to join your worship.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed your lips on one of her nipples and found that she...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then again, you are the new guy here, so it's justified. You thought if you helped out with older members you'd go a long ways. Nothing your training to become a Soul Reaper could of prepared you for what that man did to you. You stayed awake during it because you were worried what Mayuri would do you if you weren't awake. As soon as you get the time, and stop limping, you're going to get a petition up for two things. First one is that there's a class teaching new Soul Reapers about the dangers of Mayuri. Second thing is that all Soul Reapers get Mayuri related hazard pay and insurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did that man do to? Who knows? You bet he didn't even know. All you remember is that you saw your life flash before eyes, and evil scientist laughter. You think maybe it was to do something with your Zanpakut\u014d, and Reiryoku? Maybe it something about using mind control? Maybe it was something about using your Zanpakut\u014d to alter minds and bodies? Or was it something about making it more likely that a Soul Reaper could be born in the Soul Society? Or was somethin that involved using your Zanpakut\u014d to leech strength from victims and put them under your control? You weren't entirely sure what Mayuri was doing. You felt like he was just doing it to be a sadistic jerk. You just want to forget about it, just like a good portion of everything you learned at the Spiritual Arts Acadmey. Mayuri offered to \"help\" you bout with the memory problem, but you were not going to fall for his tricks again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may have forgotten somethings, but you learned an important lesson today- never trust a man with a toilet seat hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're going to try to remember that.

You can travel pretty quickly from city to city since you've hypnotized a Fearow a while back. you decided to spend a day planning your capture and watch Misty's show and how she battles before deciding what the best way to approach this is. After seeing her in her mermaid outfit you decide that you want - no - you need to have her for yourself as soon as you can. But later when watching her battle other trainers you find a lot of pride and a strong determination for getting things done. A strong personality like that would take a long time to control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your plan into motion the next day as you approach her sisters first. 'Time to put it to the test.' you think to yourself eager to see if you can in fact control other people. Her sisters didn't want to give you the time of day at first but with enough persuasion and the right bait you can get anyone. You simply advertised as a new age hypno-therapist who could solve most people's problems with just an hour of there time. they hooked on and you found yourself hypnotizing them. You watched as their eyes went blank watching your stop watch swing back and forth. you rejoiced at the fact that you can in fact control human-beings. <br>\r\n\"Can you hear me?\" You ask calmly despite your growing 'excitement'.<br>\r\n\"Yes we can hear you.\" the three replied simultaneously. Your excitement continues to grow.<br>\r\n\"I am your master. repeat it.\" To your surprise they didn't completely follow this as your pokemon did. <br>\r\nWhile Lily immediately said \"You are our master\"  the other two stumbled with the words trying to resist.<br>\r\nYou grumble increasing the out put of your psychic powers. it took a different amount of time for each of them but eventually you managed to break all of them.<br>\r\nYou felt exhausted. \"Okay.\" You said having finally been satisfied with your hold on all of them. \"When you wake up remember your programming and be thankful that I took the time to make you slaves.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Master. We love being your bitch slaves.\" They said eyes glazed over smiling happily as they were programmed to do.<br>\r\nWith a snap of your fingers they all blinked awake and bowed to you. \"Thank you for our new lives master!\" Lily said happy as a clam that she was now an obedient tool. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, we don't know what we would be doing if it weren't for you!\" Violet said<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes I'm great I know.\" you respond \"Now onto more pressing maters, controlling your sister.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know if even you're great enough for that master.\" Daisy said \"Misty is really stubborn, she'll try her hardest to reject your gift of obedience.\"<br>\r\n\"Worry not my sexy slave.\" You say with an evil grin on your face \"I know just what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you arrive at the gym knowing that your slaves have told Misty all about how this guy used hypnosis and how great it felt. Then when you arrived they acted surprised and excited that their favorite hypnotist just decided to show up for a gym battle.<br>\r\n\"Now, now. Lets not get overly excited.\" You say knowing full well that your ploy is working \"I'm just here to see if I can win a gym badge. Although it would be okay if you wanted me to give you a session after the match.\"<br>\r\n\"How about this,\" Misty said curious to see if she could be hypnotized without becoming a pokemon again \"If I win you'll hypnotize me for free. It would be nice to have a good experience with hypnosis for once.\"<br>\r\n\"You drive a hard bargain.\" you try not to smile as this was your plan the whole time. \"But I don't see why I can't. It will be interesting to try and put you under.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was swift and Misty won just as you planned. Not that you couldn't win, you had plenty of absolutely loyal pokemon with more than enough power to crush her but the plan was to make her think that the hypnosis would be earned and enjoyable so her defenses would be as low as possible.<br>\r\n\"Well a deals a deal. Prepare to be mesmerized.\" You said in a somewhat joking manor.<br>\r\nMisty was quick to under, quicker than you expected even if she was trying to be hypnotized. The hard part was breaking and reshaping that strong will of hers. Her sisters were right she was stubborn but with a combination of your efforts and her sisters helping relax her she eventually fell.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" You asked after a couple hours of relentlessly rewriting of her mind.<br>\r\n\"I am your loyal and obedient slave Misty master.\" A smile spreads across your face as you wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much \"Misty\" did you leave in Misty?</span></div></div>",

Growing up he was constantly making passes at girls, sometimes much older ones, and somehow he kept from getting his head beaten in for his impertinence.  Eventually, as he grew older, as he entered his teens, he figured out why; he had a talent for a unique and unknown form of bending, one that he'd been subconsciously using every day.  Now that he knew about it, he dubbed it Pimpbending, and refined it so that he could use it intentionally and with more power, altering a girl's mind and body to be more pleasing to him.  So, with this power came opportunities; as always, reshaping Azula into a more docile and fun babe would probably please Zuko to no end, but then again wouldn't it be fun to go after the decidedly unattached Ty-Lee?

It was getting harder for Nami's towel to cover her expanding breasts, and you could only thank the fact that Nami's zoning out right now to notice.

How will you turn the lovely lads in Fairy Tail to your harem girls?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: On the Job Harem: You are a member of the Fairy Tail Guild who gets sent on a job with one of the girls at the guild. On the job she gets blasted by an enemy spell that turns her into the willing slave of the first person she sees. Fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you look at it you're that person. You later use that spell for your own advantage. Reader's choice on the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: Neo-Phantom Lords: you were the member of Juvia and Gajeel's old guild who wants to bring back the guild to do something good with the name. The twist? You want it to be you and a whole bunch of babes. Thankfully you find a new spell to help out with that endeavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: Perverted Alchemist: You are a wizard independent of any guild that specializes in potions that alter the mind and body. You're also a pervert as big as Happy is blue. One day you lose to temptation and start enslaving with your potions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #4: Exiled Royal: You are a member of the royal family of the Pergrande Kingdom who got exiled to Fiore on bumped up charges. While you plot your way to clearing your name you come across something to give you a harem. It can be anything from magical artificial, potion recipe, or spell. I came up with this storyline because we could use some more worldbuilding in the world of Earth Land. Go nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #5: Read the choice title </span></div></div>",

You learn her name is Momo Yaoyorozu and she is apparently a brilliant student. You don't need that but given how her Quirk worked. So you needed to change her quirk. Luckily you knew what would be much more fitting for her new personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou erase her IQ and write in 90, lower but still smart. Certainly smarter that all the other girls you'll be taking control of. Then you go to work on her quirk, it was very powerful but not sexy enough for you to enjoy in someway. Then you write in a Quirk you made up; Pretty- Anyone who finds her attractive must obey simple commands she gives. It could come back to haunt you a little given your love of her boobs but hey, it's fun to make her identity more dependent on her looks. Then you write her to be bi-sexual and give her a strong attraction to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you close the book and disperse the book. It's always a weird feeling when reality morphs around you, like sitting in the middle of silly putty that's swirling around you. When it dies down you go back to focusing on class and enjoy the occasional glance she gave you. It feels good to have the pretty girl be the one to nervously look at you for a change. When class was over you happily waited for her to come and try to talk to you, maybe use her 'new' Quirk to make you kiss her or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

Being in another castle, being kidnaped, getting her kingdom taken over, and then being rescued by Mario (and occasionally Lugi). The toads don't even defend themselves. Her guards coward in fear when Bowser comes knocking. It makes you think that Peach is rather willing, doesn't it? Is Bowser really that good at stealing princesses? Did some witch, demon, or dark god(s) put a curse on her? Does Bowser call in advance to tell he's coming to kidnap her? Point is, it's like anything can kidnap her. <b>Anything.</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm almost willing to wager that if someone else kidnapped her, besides Bowser or the rare new villain if the big turtle isn't around, there's four outcomes. A) It would disrupt the cosmic balance of the universe. B) Mario and Bowser's reactions would be priceless. C) One of them would fight the other so the loser doesn't get to the princess first. Or D) They would both team up to get their princess back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where you come in. You are a non-toad resident of the Mushroom Kingdom that dabbles in science from time to time, and you're fed up! You're tired of preparing to be ransacked twice a month by a fire breathing turtle with an army. Tired of Princess Peach's failure to keep Bowser out, and the failure that is her leadership. Something has to be done.  It's time for a change in leadership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have what I need now,\" you said putting what you need for your plan. \"If Bowser can kidnap the Princess, so can I,\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to use?</span></div></div>",

The ability to breathe fire, some black magic, and an army.  And an undying desire to kidnap the Princess. That's one thing you like about Bowser. He can actually lead, his people doesn't cower when some enemy kingdom comes knocking on the door, and he has determination. But it makes no sense about how he won't give up. Is he really that obsessed with Peach? What does he see in her? He he in love with her? They're not even the same species (you're not entirely sure if Peach is a human, or just another Toad), but you wouldn't judge. If he didn't always bring his boys with him to wreck things up. You have heard that Peach does have some magic powers, so that makes sense. Bowser's a wizard, he'd probably like to make himself stronger. Or is this just something to keep Mario in shape if something worse than Bowser arrives? You don't know, but you'll just have to go on the assumption that the turtle crafted the rumor that's he's in love with Peach to gain sympathy and supporters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood outside Princess Peach's throne room, and got ready to enter it.

You're the only man for hundreds of miles, surrounded by a few hundred shipgirls who range from lolis, a few lolis who are fairly busty, decently endowed, milky, and then full on milk trucks, and they don't seem to mind you marrying more than one of them. And then there are the sirens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut here we are with the choices because you know. So what's it going to be, Commander/Shikikan?<br>\r\nOption #1: You realize that you have basically have a harem and decide to put some moves on the botes.<br>\r\nOption #2: You are a new Commander/Shikikan and you have to build it all up from scratch. Enjoy finding those mental cubes. <br>\r\nOption #3: Psychic Shikikan: a Siren attack on the base leaves you in the emergency room, and when you come out you're now psychic. You can see what I am going with here.  <br>\r\nOption #4: Shota Commander: same as the above but you're now a shota with an aura of being irresistible towards the botes.  <br>\r\nList of girls: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://alg-wiki.com/shiplist\" target=\"_blank\">https://alg-wiki.com/shiplist</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not too much of a fan of the epilogues or Homestuck2 at the moment. But, enough about that and how I think it will end up being a burning trainwreck. Let's talk about how you'll add the ladies of Homestuck into your harem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: The Lord of Heart + a juju: Once upon a time in a universe different from the Trolls and kids' you and a few friends played the game Sburb, and by some odd chance you were among the few in Paradox Space destined for one of the master classes, and your aspect was heart. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">As the choice title says.</span> As all Lords must endure to progress your personal journey was filled with extreme suffering which required a Herculean effort to overcome. Which you did by the way. Yay you. You are also the only survivor from your session. Through the incredibly questionable and downright reckless choices made in prototyping an especially powerful Black King was waiting for you and your friends at the end, standing between you and The Ultimate Reward. To make a long story short he was an ungodly motherfugger that gave even you, a God Tier Lord of Heart, a mind numbingly difficult time, and it was nothing short of a <span class=\"cgrape\">miracle</span> that you killed him let alone lived to tell the tale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix years after entering the universe created by that session you have grown bored, and there's a lust filled hole in your heart only a harem can fill. By a stroke of luck, you come across the Treasure juju John and the MSPA Reader use to gain their zapping around time and space power. You can see where I'm going here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what can a Lord of Heart do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe don't have a lot of examples of Lords in canon, let alone a Lord of Heart(emotions/soul/inner self), since the only one being Caliborn/Lord English who is presumably stronger than your \"average\" Lord due to being a cherub, absorbed the energy of his God Tier clock, and became a fusion of five different people with different classes and aspects. To make this chapter was less wordy just go with this analysis of it<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://god-tier-analyzer.tumblr.com/post/81984586573/oh-oh-i-noticed-you-have-done-a-few-analysis-of\" target=\"_blank\">https://god-tier-analyzer.tumblr.com/pos...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTD:R : \"-He can manipulate emotions on a cosmic scale, which can range from making people fall in love forever, or causing the most painful heartbreak in the universe, a feeling no one ever wants to feel. He can also manifest his soul into a powerful cosmic weapon, as well as manipulate, steal and destroy others souls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you've payed attention long enough for this that's how you're going to enslave them. By manipulation of their hearts and souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: Some other method: Continue going through any other ideas you might have if the first one isn't to your liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: The Wake Up with the harem option: So you don't like the idea of enslaving and just want to wake up with a harem like some dude waking up and being served on butler island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And located on that planet in one of the more remote areas is a large Victorian style green and dark pink mansion that is empty save for one occupant. Who is it? Why it's you, Anon, the Lord of Heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are currently in the master bedroom, aka your room, dressed in a bathrobe that matches the color of your aspect, in your desk chair using your GIBSONTOP, a laptop that bears the visage of Mel Gibson much like John's Crosbytop did for Bill Crosby. To the right of you is a red cane with a heart ornament on top. It is your HEARTCANE, one of your most powerful weapons, and perfect for someone of your class. You have recently returned from exploring some of the universe created by you and your friends, but whatever you were looking for you were unable to find. What will you do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinue to click \"refresh\" on your favorite website, and hope see if maybe the hiatus of the creator of your favorite webcomic is over. You irritably click on \"Refresh\" over and over, knowing that the result will be the same as the last attempt. It does occur to you maybe it won't ever get updated considering everyone on your version of Earth died when the meteors came crashing down, but knowing the weird time shenanigans of Paradox Space you still have a little hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose patience with the site, exiting the tab, and begin contemplating whether or not to watch one of the perverted HAREM ANIMES you have downloaded on your laptop. How you love anime and the idea of being a lord of a harem of beauties dedicated to catering to your every whim and carnal craving. One of your favorite animes was one where the main character started out as a young prince who became king of a war ravaged kingdom, and ended up as a conqueror of the opposing empire full of witches led by an empress who were hot as they were evil. You loved how he put them all in their place as he made them his harem girls. That show helped the six years younger you through puberty, and proved to be therapeutic for stress you gained during the path to godhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to hold off on watching anime, you have a far more important task than watching anime at the moment. Figuring out where the flying heck your gang of leprechauns are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all other Lords you gained a group of leprechauns to serve you with powers or own jujus that possess powers based the aspect of the Lord they serve. In your case, Heart, their abilities revolve around emotions, souls, and a one's inner self. Or their items do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not entirely sure where they are, but you have a suspicion they're off getting into fights with the local Carapacians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you think about the chess people fighting with your green men you catch the sight of a Prospitian dressed in a mailman's uniform in the corner of your right eye heading towards your humble abode. Looks like it's fairly heavy judging by the the way he's struggling. You probably ought to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delivery man collapses on the steps of your manor exhausted after days of lugging around parcel. He doesn't even hear you open the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I need to sign anything?\" You say, receiving no reply. He's out like a light. Wow. This guy busted his back carrying a treasure chest covered in an excessive amount of locks and chains for you, and didn't even get down in time to help him out. You feel like a total dick now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring the chest and mailman inside, putting the latter on a couch in the living room, and then proceeded to cut off the chains with a cutter stored away in the tool room. Once the box was less covered  you found a folded note on top of it which might be useful in determining the nature of the contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Boss, we struck gold when you were away. We have no idea what this bad boy can do, but we know a juju when we see one. Signed, Eros.\" You read off. Eros is one of your leprechauns, and one of the ones you trust the most. This answers one question, but leads to a few more questions in its place like a hydra. A question hydra. You open the chest and against your expectations of something more menacing, you discovered a transparent version of sburb logo emitting a white glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gut tells you that if you touch this thing you're going to experience a not-so-fun time, but you dismiss it. What's the worse that can happen? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: You learn not to test fate and zap around points throughout the comic <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: the same as the above but you you meet the first member of your harem after the fifth zapping in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any ideas about the names/abilities of the heart leprechauns let me know. Email me. Don't want any conflict here</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If there is a lesson about touching strange objects of great and unknown power you definitely learned it the hard way. All you remember was a brief moment of pain and flashing light before you're zapped around various unknown places that you've never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first location was above a balcony where man without lips covered in grey paint with fake looking horns, and a white wig wearing a green suit fearfully clutching a wand defensively against the Jolly Green Giant staring him down with a massive golden rifle. If the Jolly Green Giant stopped being jolly, took up the usage of steroids, and had a skull for a face with pool ball eyes. Oh, and a golden peg leg that was doing the same rainbow glow the oversized coat and gun of his were doing. Talk about tacky. Even if you wanted to you cannot save the lipless man from being shot to death by the hulking monster as the same force that brought you here drags you away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour next location was a room that is clearly at Derse, Kingdom of Darkness judging by the architecture and the extreme amount of purple all over the place. It probably isn't the one from your session as this place is far too intact compared to the way your Derse was left. You turn your head over the sounds of a struggle to see something that only confuses you more, but answers one question. This definitely isn't at any point in time your Derse. It was easy to deduce that on account of a winged one arm Black Queen dressed in harlequin clothes with a mangled hat, a slashed eye, and tentacles was trying to force a Jack Noir into silly outfits. It actually makes you miss the Jack Noir from your session. Sure he was a stab happy jerk, but he was on the level. Things take a violent turn, you watch the archagent place the murdered monarch's ring on his own finger, and ascend until you're zapped out of here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are then taken to more random places after that. From the rooftop on an apartment being used as a training ground for apparently rapping roof ninjas, a jail cell on a Prospit where another Jack Noir was currently bashing the head of an already dead knife ridden burly Prospitian into the the cell door, and then the Skaian battlefield where the Black King from the first session you poofed into commands his army in massive prototyped form. This King actually looks less intimidating than the way yours did with the harlequin clothes and one arm and all. You certainly wouldn't mind taking a crack at another version of him, but it seems a coalition of soldiers from both armies led by a purple cloth wearing Dersite carrying a makeshift red banner march towards the black tyrant want the first crack at him. More power to them. They look like they have an extensive list of grievances with them the King was not prepared for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these lists shall be undelivered and unheard as the first Jack Noir you saw in this zapping trip across canon descends from the sky, destroying the King's specter and beheading him in his depowered state. Something tells you this is going to end poorly. Before you're dragged away to another location you see that feeling to be correct. You witness indiscriminate destruction at the hand of Noir, and not even his fellow Dersites are spared from his rampage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you believe you have learned to control this newfound ability of yours. You close your eyes, and end up in a mostly snow covered forest that is slowly becoming greener as the snow melts. It's still too cold for you given you are still in your bathroom. But thankfully a perk of reaching the god tier is the ability to swap your current outfit for your god tier clothes. That's much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the menacing growl of a dog moments from attacking behind you, and guess what? It's that same Jack Noir from earlier. Only this time he lost the hat and tentacles, but became a dog man with green lightning powers? What's with this guy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he can presumably stab you to death with his blade a girl who is at least six years younger than you wearing a green dress that surely can't be suitable for the cold quickly steps in between you and Jack.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Bad Jack! Bad boy!\" She chastises the murderous Carapacian as if he was a disobedient pet. What's hilariously shocking is that it actually works! Noir stands down, his ears lowered as if he was a dog knowing he's in trouble with his owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around to face you wearing a relieved expression. She's kinda cute with those green eyes of hers hiding behind her glasses and her long black hair. \"Sorry about that. He can be a handful to deal with.\" She says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally a chance to interact with another human being after six long years! You're not going to let this go to waste. Or so you think until you feel that another zapping coming along. You try to stop it, but fail to control this power much to your growing frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Hell no! You are the freaking LORD of Heart, act like it and tell this power to fall in line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Fail! Enjoy the continuing trip<br>\r\nOption #2: You successfully zap back to Jade, but an older one with dog ears on a golden battleship<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your mother isn't around and you miss her. One day you get your own fairy godparent, and who knows where that will lead. But since you know the title of this story, you shouldn't have to use your imagination. <br>\r\nSo here's the information you need to know about the sister, and your fairy godmother. <br>\r\nYour godmother's name is Cietro, she is one of those fairies that have a body like the Tooth Fairy. She wears an outfit like the one Jessica Rabbit wears, but does not have the body of Mrs. Rabbit. She has black hair.  She has a DD chest, and a butt that isn't that impressive, but still could be worthy of the \"Dat a$$\" meme. Personality: She has a thing for young boys, and is a bit of a seductress like Blair from Soul Eater and Rangiku from Bleach. Meaning she'd put her boobs in people's faces, mainly her god child. She has a fetish about serving people, but also likes to be pampered. She also never had sex before, and is a bit nervous to. She might be a seductress, but she's a bit scared to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister: Her name is Candice. She is a she's a geeky gamer girl nerd. She has c-cup breasts, but has a nice, big fat jiggly butt that she is proud of and likkes it being messed with. She would like a bigger chest, but is okay with her's. She's a bit mild mannered, and has a will to match. She might be smart, but she'd fall under mind control pretty easy. She tries to be a mother figure for the RC, since she's not around, while still being his sister. She is a bit of a sex-postive feminist too, and cannot handle pressure too well. So if the RC had some sort of enslavement pheromones, it would not take long for her to crack. Wears white jeans, and a blue top. She loves to play video games and likes to play with mods, and maybe make her own. Her friends call her a bimbo shoutacon as a joke due to one bad mishap that gets on her nerves. She claims to still be a virgin, and on her word, even though she has never had sex before she would love to hotdog a guy.  You get to decide if she still is a virgin, and what previously bad mishap was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here's your choices to meet Cietro:<br>\r\nDuring the day after you get back from school.<br>\r\nOr the second option where you meet her during the night while Candice is taking a bath. </span></div></div>",

This option will take place before the Fall of Beacon, but you can take some liberties and go about a storyline that is completely different. 2nd option can be anything you want. You could be the kang of all hobos who got into some dust that will give you mind control powers or a magic book for all I care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeapon for the Student at Beacon storyline: a halberd with an attached gun that can transform into an ax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSemblance: M\u00e1ti kai Fil\u00ed(Eye and Kiss). Much like how a vampire has the ability to put people under a trance, you too can do this so long as only as it's a woman and she looks into your left eye. To avoid many problems you normally cover the eye with an eyepatch. To seal the deal on your target you must engage in a deep kiss, exchanging your saliva with them. Once that is done, the girl will become fanatically devoted to you while retaining her original personality. <br>\r\nExtras: 1: you can change your target's personality so long as you offer some suggestions before the kiss.<br>\r\n2: It doesn't work instantaneously in some cases. It all depends on how your target feels about you beforehand, how strong their will is, and their current state. One kiss will not work on Weiss, Blake, Glynda, or Cinder for example. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGot it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>New changes</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: The straight shouta storyline. Similar to the first option and Zone(who's been a great help for this story) background you are a student at Beacon who lost two of your teammates during the breach while the other one got taken home by their parents? The difference between this one and the first option? You are a kid again. Your semblance \"Irresistible Youth\" awakens, putting you in the 10-11 year old range physically. \"But how does that help me get a harem?\" Your semblance gives you an irresistible aura that awakens maternal instincts in women, making them want to pamper you with affection and do anything you say till you're happy. It is semi-passive so you will have to work hard on certain <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Cinder</span> ladies who aren't that affectionate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Didn't know why I failed to do this with the last update here here I go.</span><br>\r\nOption #4: Atlasian Changer of Flesh: you are a student at the Atlas Academy that signed onto an experiment by the military designed to unlock and enchance semblances. To your surprise it was a success. Here's what your semblance does: Changer of Flesh: allows you to tinker with the bodies through your aura. You can toy with someone's hormones to make them horny when they see you. Or you could maybe make a girl curvier once your semblance matures and you pump them with enough aura. Set before the Fall of Beacon for convenience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #5: You are marked by dark fates. You crave nothing but more choices. This will never end<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Better than that Jaune Arc kid, but compared to some of the others, you were subpar. Pyrrha Nikos, the champion, wiped the floor with you in less than a minute. You always seemed to just miss with your halberd. Even the youngest student, Ruby Rose, could easily handle you. it didn\u2019t help that your team was a mess. During the breach, two of your team fell in battle. The third one was brought home by her parents, so you were left alone. Ozpin, the headmaster, assured that as long as you kept training, when a spot opened on another team, you would join.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were looking bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil you developed your Semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t realize it at first, but one of your eyes changed colors after you wore a patch on it for a week.

Until you found out by accident it needs to be sealed with a kiss. Like a contract. That meant you weren\u2019t going to use it on any guys. Also people with strong willpower took time.

You could get some of the hottest girls in Beacon to fall for you or maybe get them to help you out with training. You had so many possibilities available to you.

That semblance of hers is something you have yet to effectively counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow ow,\" whined Ruby still on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou extend a hand to the shorter girl to pull her off the ground and she accepts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you, Anon,\" she says once she regains her bearings. \"Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine really.\" You replied. \"I wasn't looking. Only one useable eye to look out of.\" You point to where your eyepatch ought to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tills her head quizzically and looks into your eyes. Both of them look fine to her what are you talking about? Especially the left one which is very hard to not look at in Ruby's mind. It's just so entrancing and making her light headed. She can't turn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just occurred to you that you can see the out of both your eyes, and all you see now is a Ruby Rose who's silver eyes are dulled and seems completely out of touch of the world around her save for you. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust great. You kneel down to pick up your eyepatch off the ground where you discovered it had been cut, and somehow stayed on long enough before Ruby bumped into you. It must have happened during your training session, and how Crescent Rose managed to only cut your eyepatch is nothing short of luck. You take a good look at Ruby, really studying her. who is remains enthralled by you even if it was accidental. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby is at least a year or two younger than you. You can see the resemblance to her older sister Yang, a girl with a body you cannot deny in good faith your desire to explore for yourself, but it's not entirely there. Ruby and Yang must be only half-sisters and you can only guess which parent is the one they share. She's still cute to you. Maybe she can be a cute guinea pig for you too. After all learning the limits of your semblance is something you've been curious about lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ruby,\" you say as you move a finger in front of her face to see if her heavy eyes will follow. Then don't by the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" She slowly asks in a monotone voice, sounding more like a mindless drone than someone with free will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go back to my room? I mean, if you're free at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have time to spare,\" said your test subject of questionable willingness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you leave the hallway before anyone else can get an eyeful the way Ruby did to prevent any possible headaches. And you debate over which path to take with Ruby. The trance's strength varies from person to person right down to how they feel about you and how strong their will is. You wouldn't say Ruby is weak willed, but it's obvious she's a simple soul which isn't a bad thing of course. And judging on from what you've seen she's sort of socially awkward which may or may not help you in the long run. But you will certainly keep it in mind when figuring out what you can and can't do with Ruby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe some suggestive conditioning will be a good start with her. Or you could figure out just how devoted Ruby will be to you if you go full force with the final part of your semblance. Share a few minutes long French kiss full of saliva exchanging with her. You can always put her under a trance again if you feel like changing her personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Go easy and try giving her suggestions<br>\r\nOption #2: Go full force and ensnare her </span></div></div>",

Why go through a tedious process where you'll have to slowly influence Ruby over time you tell yourself. Especially when she is in your room right now, and you can cut to the chase with just one salvia swapping session. Not worrying about anyone catching you having a mind control session with her out in the middle of a hallway or room is also something you can avoid as well. Forget being labeled as a creep or being expelled from Beacon if that happens. What Ruby's older sister will do to you makes fighting a Nevermore barehanded seem more preferable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ruby,\" you say to the mostly unwilling guest to your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you reply to her you take another good look at her. You are more into girls with bigger curves like Yang or Goodwitch, but Ruby's body isn't necessarily unattractive. Maybe in a few years she'll develop more similarly into Yang's body type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does occur to you that you are about to throw a Beowulf sized wrench into this girl's life if you go through with this. You have talked to Ruby before a few times. All she aspires to be in life is a huntress, and here you are moments away from potentially turning her into a slave. Your slave. Will you even stop at her? Will you turn your mesmerizing gaze on her friends and teammates?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute. There's no need for you to be mulling over this. Just create yourself a battle-harem full of huntresses. Maintaining world peace and casting down the forces of evil by day, servicing you by night. Yes. Hell motherfugging yes. And with one sexy and awesome thought you just got rid of all your fomenting internal conflict. Pat yourself on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever. you probably need to be more strategic about this, and plan ahead. Start your harem out small. Four to five girls. The rest of Team RWBY will do just fine. And you especially need to be careful in regards of certain activities. Getting your girls pregnant while you're still a student at Beacon is a very stupid idea. Angry parents and Professor Ozpin will presumably not enjoy your explanation as to why their daughters and his faculty members are now pregnant, kicked out of school, and calling you \"Master.\" You want kids but you also want to get your Huntsman license. You also want to avoid birth control pills. You've recently read an article about how those things end up messing with women's hormones quite negatively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll think of something when you cross that bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever kissed a guy before? No, giving your dad a peck on the cheek doesn't count.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. These lips have never made contact with anyone else's before.\" She answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's about to change. I'm going to give you a nice-\" as you say that Ruby starts to shake meaning you found something she's going to be uncomfortable with. Nice going doing this with a socially awkward girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Ruby an eyeful and attempt to reassure the enthralled girl she has nothing to worry about. The both of you will enjoy this. You probably ought take it slow with her just to be safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby trembles as her lips pucker up and you take your time to press your own upon hers. So far so good. Your tongue creeps out and passes through into her mouth, the shaking intensifies some. As your salvia begins to enter her mouth you finally find her tongue. Might as well make this special for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minute your tongues wrap around the others the scythe wielding girl shakes hard enough you start to worry this is going to end very poorly for you. Goodbye Beacon and hello Yang's fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to break the kiss, but to your surprise Ruby pulls you back in. You heard a cute little moan out of her too. She's enjoying it more than you imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally chuckle. By the time you're done Ruby Rose is going to be all yours. Heart, body and soul. She probably is at this point. The two of you break apart for a breather, and her eyes slowly regain their color. You turn around to get a spare eyepatch to cover your eye. You're out of aura now so no more hypno sessions until you grow stronger at using your semblance. Ruby still has that out of it look, and you wonder if you fried her brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat prospect flew out of the window upon you asking her about the mechanics of Crescent Rose, and Ruby returns to her usual self when weapons are involved. You're going to love spending the rest of your life with this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Talk with your new devoted slave. Give her the reason why your room is so barebones and why you're team-less. Or go play video games with her. Whatever comes first.<br>\r\nOption #2: It sure would be bad if someone barraged into your room after looking for Ruby and saw her enter your room. Especially since if you can't use your semblance on them now. But you're a smart guy right? You can totally talk your way out of this hypothetical situation, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You get it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I get it.\" She coughs before doing her best Goodwitch impression she can manage getting a laugh out of you. Not too bad you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second thing I need help with. Mind helping me out?\" You asked. \"If I don't improve my skills I won't be able to stay at Beacon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you ask your team about this?\" Come to think of it your dorm seems to posses more than enough space to suit more than a mere one person. All that's in here are a few beds, books, and just you. Really activates her almonds when she thinks about it more. \"You do have a team right, Master?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mood turns quite dour, and you fall over onto a nearby bed. \"I lost two of them in that crazy breach. Grimm just started pouring out on the streets, and it's an absolute miracle we had our weapons with us. Not that it helped all that much. We got overrun, and two of us went down before Professor Port and Professor Goodwitch bailed out what was left us.\" You explained, the hopeless battle replaying in vivid detail all over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby  brings you back into reality, expressing her condolences and apologizes for asking about topic you hate thinking about. You sigh and finish your tale. \"The parents of my surviving teammate and friend came by and took him back home. As you can see, Team A isn't really effective when there's only one person as the \"A\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you tried getting into a new team, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've tried, but there aren't many openings at the moment. I can get moved to a team if I impress Professor Ozpin enough though. So there's that.\" You rise off the bed with a less down in the dumps look. \"I just want to know what happened that day, you know? It really feels like someone was behind it.\" You turn to her, and it almost looks like Ruby knows more about the breach than you think. Maybe she and her gang got trapped in that too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby starts telling you of how her went on a trip with Oobleck a few days ago, ending up in a fight with the militant faunus group called the White Fang and a criminal named Torchwick who they've been dealing with for a some time now. While her story is certainly fascinating you were going to stop and ask in the middle of what this had to do with your predicament. Until Ruby placed the blame for the breach upon the Fang and Torchwick. That got you really interested and really in the mood for some payback. She then tells you last saw Torchwick being taken into custody. Time for you to get more creative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, this Torchwick guy didn't happen to have any girls as cute as you hanging around him did he?\" You ask with some evil intent in your visible eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was that one,\" Ruby says, trying to remember the name of Roman's sidekick that aided him during one bout they had. \"I think he called her \"Neo\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neo, huh? Can't wait to meet her.\" You lost two of your friends because this guy did so you're going to take his Neo. Ruby advised you to be cautious in that regards. Something about this Neo girl gave Yang a hard time during that train brawl. That will require some more planning out now that you think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevenge plots aside what will you do now?<br>\r\nOption 1: Do something nice for Ruby since she's the first member of your harem. Might as well since you're now stuck with her<br>\r\nOption #2: Skip to the next day</span></div></div>",

You probably passed out on your bed because going full throttle on Ruby needed a huge chunk of your aura. In fact, you would bet money on it given how miserable you were upon waking up. Lousy semblance. You made a mental note as you hastily dressed yourself this morning to take it easier with any potential targets of yours in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, you are writing down anything you deem important from Professor Goodwitch's mouth on your notebook as the lecture continues. It's not that difficult anymore since you read books on becoming a better note taker. At least you think so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou definitely will not try your hand at using your semblance on the instructor any time soon. Glynda might be very attractive for her age, but you prefer not receiving the boot out of Beacon. Still, the idea of using her riding crop on her one day is quite tantalizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used your uncovered eye to look around the room and it landed on the first member of your harem. Busy writing down her own notes like a good student Ruby fails to notice your attention. You wonder if she has any ideas on who to use your eye on next, or if she'll leave that in your purview. Most likely she will. You do not believe Ruby has a knack for that. You do however believe today might be a good day for you to hone your skills through a training session with her. Taking notes in class does not help in thinning the horde of grimm in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou divert your eye to the individual next to Ruby, a girl with an air of elegance you find very alluring. Even the scarred left eye of Weiss Schnee adds to her charm. You don't really know too much about Weiss herself beyond the fact she's the granddaughter of the founder of the SDC, Nicholas Schnee, and she's a talented student at this academy. You are curious about who Weiss really is, and what kind of possibilities your touch can have with her. The Schnee Dust Company's website provided you very little information on her when you did a report on her grandfather for one of your classes. You swear a company as wealthy as her family's could clearly afford better website designers too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" Your thoughts regarding Weiss and poor website designs are interrupted by an expecting Goodwitch who noticed you may have stopped paying attention to the lecture. \"Mr. Anon, could you possibly tell the class what the semblance of the most notorious war criminal of the Great War was?\" She asked, putting you on the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well,\" you mutter trying to remember the answer without looking at your notes. \"His semblance allowed him to create wings out of his aura?\" You answered unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the class you paid attention on her lecture and focused less on what you're going to do afterwards. Which by the way, your time here is done. What will you do now?    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I apparently now have an upgraded account there will be five options. <br>\r\nOption #1: go practice with Ruby. You need it.<br>\r\nOption #2: Try your hand at Weiss<br>\r\nOption #3: Option #2 but something or someone gets in your way<br>\r\nOption #4: Go do your own thing. Enjoy your day. <br>\r\nOption #5: Reader's choice </span></div></div>",

It was going to take time, so maybe you should be careful to just start conditioning her. Make her slowly gain feelings for you. Of course, the more risk, the more reward.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was important to keep him in her thoughts to weaken any resistance. \u201cEvery day, you think of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery day I think of you.\u201d Blake repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt night, you might even have erotic dreams.\u201d You pushed. This was a risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt night\u2026 I\u2019ll have\u2026 what?\u201d her tone started to gain a little of her own personality back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax,\u201d You tell her and you saw her shoulders slack a little. \u201cit\u2019s only natural to imagine Ninja of Love scenes. They are such wonderfully written. The adult parts make the story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d She agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, when you imagine those scenes, you will imagine yourself in there.\u201d You carefully say. \u201cIt\u2019s only right to imagine the guy as someone who appreciates the story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuy has to\u2026 appreciate the story.\u201d Blake repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m the only guy you know that likes Ninjas of Love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are.\u201d She slowly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it makes sense to imagine us acting out those scenes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt makes sense.\u201d Blake agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery time you have one of those dreams, you will feel horny,\u201d You continue. \u201cThis horniness will come back anytime you see me. When you see me, you remember those dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get horny when I have those dreams,\u201d Blake stated. \u201cSeeing you will cause me to remember those dreams and feelings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good.\u201d You tell her. \u201cNow, after I kiss you and walk away, you will wake up and not remember consciously anything except that I like Ninjas of Love and we talked about it for a little bit. All my suggestions will stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will only remember us talking about Ninjas of Love.\u201d Blake muttered. \u201dBut all of your suggestions will stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood girl.\u201d You leaned forward and pressed your lips against hers. They parted slightly and you pushed your tongue in, careful to add some of your drool into her mouth. She tasted good and you regretted break contact.

Well besides Blake breaking out of her trance, beating you up, and telling everyone you're a creep who tries to mind control people. Other than that no harm at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to know more about you, Blake.\" You say to the enthralled girl. You think getting her to talk about the more private details of her life would be a great start before you attempt more risque ideas. \"But let's take this to somewhere more private, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly nods her head before giving you a less than lively \"Sure\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you leave the more crowded area, and head for a better place for you to get a girl under a trance to spill her guts to you. If such a place really existed. You decide to grab Blake's left hand to see how she reacts, and it appears she doesn't seem poised to return to normal. What would happen if you get more physical than mere hand holding?   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou use your other hand to wrap around Blake's waist and she stops in her tracks. She shakes slightly, her eyes slowly become less dull with life returning to them. Yep. That's a tell tale sign you found something to make Blake uncomfortable enough for the trance to show fracturing. You give her another dose of M\u00e1ti kai Fil\u00ed to stop the shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright, Blake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes return the dullness they previously were earlier. Maybe a little duller, and she starts mouthing words without actually saying anything. You certainly hope you don't end up frying Blake's brain until she's a drooling vegetable for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... fine.\" She replies to your relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you find an empty classroom that was left unlocked to provide you with your private place. How thoughtful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Blake. Is there anything you're embarrassed about?\" You asked the dull eyed girl. \"That wasn't really a good way of phrasing it. Is there anything you don't want most people outside your little group of friends and family to know about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes her a while to answer you, the shaking returns, and color begins to return to her eyes before going back to their entranced state. But you get something out of her. \"I'm a faunus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really you? I'm not seeing it. Mind sharing with the class your proof?\" Blake reaches for her hair ribbon, taking it off to reveal a pair of black cat ears that were previously hidden by the bow. \"I think they're kinda nice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask her if there's anything else she has any other secrets under wraps that she will gladly share with the rest of the class again. What you got was a story of her time in the White Fang, what you've heard and were led to believe is a terrorist organization full of faunus who decided that militant violence is the only way to get their kind respected. You're not entirely sure what to say about that. Blake doesn't really give off that kind of vibe to you, and she also did say she left because of the Fang's gradual increase of violence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, you move on to another push. Playing with Blake's cat ears. She gives off some shaking but it also looks like she's enjoying it. Time to bust out the big guns. Your hands move further south, towards Blake's chest, and you cup her breasts. She shakes harder than before causing you to end your short lived groping session but not before you give her another eyefull of your left eye. On one hand you found your limit with Blake, something she clearly enjoyed as much as you playing with her ears if not a little more. Now what will you do?</span></div></div>",

You got to play with her cat ears, tried to feel her up, and gained more understanding about this girl's life. Fairly successful if you had to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake is going to be your kitty and nothing is going to stop that. But you are going to need to slow walk her into that. Her will is a tad bit too strong for you to enslave outright and making her your number one fangirl, plus doing so might actually fry her brain as you're worried about. However, you will give your kitty a touch of conditioning to make it easier for you to finish the job. Something simple and not overtly drastic the way making her a sex fiend or a yandere as those would raise some questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake, listen to me. From now on you're going to enjoy my company more, and want to hang out with me more. Got it?\" You were halfway tempted to add she will be more brave about exposing her faunus heritage, but you thought at the last minute that's something Blake needs to do on her own eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods her head affirmatively. Excellent. You surprise the enthralled girl with a quick kiss planted in her lips, sending enough of your saliva is placed in her mouth to get the conditioning to work. She predictably shakes but that subsided rather quickly. You play with the ears of your new kitty one last time before you have her hide them away with her bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you are in the hallway where you put your eyepatch back on, and Blake returns to normal mildly confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't where-\" Blake clutched at her head in pain. You sure do hope she didn't get brain damage because of you. Another highlight of today: if Blake is going to be the standard for most strong willed girls three usages of your semblance is completely unnecessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to take you to the nurse's office?\" You ask with concern in your voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake smiles. \"Yeah, that would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your kitty to the vet, you mean nurse's office and say goodbye for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day wasn't too eventful. Boring classes, did a little sparring with other students, and watched one of your favorite persons here at  tussle in the ring after you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora Valkyrie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora certainly is an interesting girl you have to say. You could watch her just be herself for hours, you often wonder what you could do if you had some of her energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough what happened in the ring ought to have been against the rules of Beacon. Though it would be hard to make ignorance against the rules you think. The poor sap who sparred with her had a Lightning semblance and used it on her with no prior knowledge about what electricity does to Nora. And kept using it on her and she fell on the ground laughing and saying his lightning tickled. You wonder when he's going to be able to regret his decision. After he's able to walk properly again no doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do now?<br>\r\nOption #1: Try your hand at Nora<br>\r\nOption #2: Turn in for the day, get a surprise visit from your kitty at three in the morning <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her body relaxed and her eyes remained dull. \u201cIs it okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIf it\u2019s you, yes.\u201d She agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like physical contact much, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo, not really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIf it\u2019s from me, it will feel pleasant,\u201d You assure her. \u201cSo anytime from now on, any touch from me will feel pleasurable, just like with your ears.\u201d She nodded and you bent in to kiss her. When she puckered up her own lips, you froze. There was one other thing you wanted to add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome other girls may need my help overcoming troubles too,\u201d you tell her. \u201cSo there\u2019s no need to get jealous if you see me with another girl. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes.\u201d Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You laughed internally and finally kissed her. Your lips and hers melded together. She tasted fruity, but you couldn\u2019t tell what kind. Working your tongue forward, you separated her lips so you could get your saliva in her mouth. Making sure to put plenty in there, it took time to break the kiss. You took a step back and let her stand there, seemingly stuck in the kissing pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap.\u201d You were worried you might have overloaded her brain. However, you notice her slowly going back to normal. Now that you had kissed her, she should be devoted to you. If her will was to strong, it probably wasn\u2019t a good idea to stick around. You decided to head out and if it worked, she would find you. \u201cBye, Blake. I hope to see you soon.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It might take another session or two to get her to be completely enamored with you. It was combat class with Glynda Goodwitch and you hoped you got an easy opponent. You got to class early and sat down. Other people began to stumble in and you saw Blake enter. She met your eyes, smiled, and waved. You gave a small wave back and then saw Blake\u2019s partner, a blonde named Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat girl was hot and had some of the biggest breasts in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe obviously notice your and Blake\u2019s actions so when she sat down, she was whispering excitedly to Blake. Blake tried to ignore her and focus on her book. You snickered and waited for class to begin. Glynda started off with a fight that seemed to happen frantically. Jaune versus Cardin. Jaune was a nice guy, though his combat skills were really subpar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin was just an asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bullied Faunus and anyone he thought weaker than him. Sparingly, he didn\u2019t bully Jaune much anymore, but enjoyed smacking him around in the ring. His large mace and powerful build did a lot fo damage. You were often surprised Jaune could block it as much as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the fight, while most people\u2019s eyes were on the fight, you noticed Blake glancing back at you. When you caught her eyes once, you smiled and swore you saw her normal stoic face blush. That was good news for you. It meant your power stuck and Blake was probably thinking of their conversation and the desire she had of him touching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJob well done for one short session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight ended and then Glynda called you up as Jaune and Cardin went back to the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour opponent was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Weiss was a skilled Dust Mage and had physical abilities to boost, PLUS her glyphs which could alter the field in unpredictable ways. This wasn\u2019t going to be good for you, but maybe Glynda was putting you against superior opponents on purpose just to pus you. That thought kept you going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight began and Weiss jabbed forward. You jumped back, putting distance between you and striking back with your halberd. She parried it easily enough and send a wave of ice at you. Ice Dust she kept stock in her weapon. You jumped to the side and fired a bullet at her. She jumped to the side and used the ice to block you. Suddenly, a torrent of fire erupted from a space in between and you just managed to avoid being cooked alive. You turned your weapon into a pair of axes, the nice thing about having a large weapon it could break down into more, and charged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped over the ice and delivered a swipe down at Weiss. She used the rapier to block it, a bored look on her face. Your second axe came down with determination to make her at least try, when a glyph appeared between you. It turned black and blew your back. Landing on your back, Weiss pelted forward and continued to jab you while you were defenseless. You shot a bullet at her leg, which temporarily unbalanced her and the slashed at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled away and sent another wave of ice at you. This time you couldn\u2019t avoid it and got trapped. It only took a couple more jabs to bring your aura down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe match is done.\u201d Glynda declared. \u201cMiss Schnee. You need to remember that blockades can be used against you too. Mr. Anon. You need to work on your counters. Aiming for her feet was a good idea, but your follow up should have targeted her closer leg. Less time for her to react.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, professor.\u201d You said and followed Weiss to the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish she would put me up against someone good.\u201d Weiss muttered. \u201cYou barely put up a better fight than Arc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoooorryyy, I don\u2019t have a rich dad to buy my fancy equipment and dust.\u201d You spat back.

What should I do with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit, while lacking a sizeable bust, Weiss was hot. Her pure white skin, petite frame, and flawless face was a site to behold. It was like she was a porcelain doll. She was also quite talented. However, her attitude could use some work. The problem was you didn\u2019t have much time until Glynda questioned where you were. She was also stubborn, so force too much Semblance into her might cause damage.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These girls really have a creative bent to them. You looked down to see a pile of dog food cans, some of which are empty. So where's Zwei?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zweeeeei!\" Yang calls out to her pet in an almost singalong voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pile of cans shake suddenly, and out comes a black tricolored corgi with a bobbed tail from the bottom. Yang gave Zwei a quick scratch behind his ears before the dog directs his attention to you. Zwei wasn't really sure what to make out of you, but some gentle petting on top of his head from you changed his attitude about you quickly. You received a happy bark out of Zwei which put a small smile on your face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This</i> is the devil Blake is scared of? Where is Blake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake?\" You could have sworn she was behind you a moment ago. You turn around to see no sign of the black haired faunus, but heard a bark and then a hiss behind you.

As lame as it was you couldn't deny it being a little funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you just didn't say that,\" groaned the faunus.

Since you liked The Man with Two Souls I think you would like this. It goes into questions of the mind, though there are some rather\u2026 descriptive sections in there when they try to find out if pleasure of the body can surpass pleasures of the mind.\u201d You reached out to show her the book at the same time she reached out to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands touched and she looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news was she didn\u2019t draw them away immediately. Her cheeks even turned slightly red. It seems your previous commands that she enjoyed physical contact were solidly implanted. That mean you could progress to the next stage. The trick was to get Blake to trust you. It lowered her mental barriers. You were the one who removed your hand and handed her the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can barrow it and if you like it, feel free to borrow the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Blake said, clutching it to her chest. \u201cI\u2019ll take good care of it.

Your previous orders about her feeling good when you touched her ran through your mind. This massage was probably making her incredibly aroused. Not only that, it was making her trust you, which would lower her resistance to your ability. You continued until you found a really big knot in her back. That was probably where she had the problems. You positioned yourself, and began to push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNyaaahh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze at the sound and Blake slammed a hand over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was-\u2026?\u201d You started to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOookay.\u201d You went back to work and you could swear you heard Blake purring happily. Not pushing that issues was the right thing to do.

You begin absentmindedly fantasizing about all the fun you'll have when she's yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Anon?\" Blake asked \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down to find that you are 100% erect. You feel your face warming as your skin turns red. Luckily Blake was embarrassed  so you two matched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" You began. You couldn't let all your work go to waste, you've come to far to be-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought was interrupted when Blake turned around and kissed you. She tasted pleasantly salty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the kiss broke the both of you were silent for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't tell Yang about this,\" Blake said \"She'll never let me hear the end of it,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and say \"Well I can't keep this to myself. I just got kissed by a beautiful girl,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake smiles and says \"It broke the tension,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another quiet moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you broke the silence by saying \"Well, can you do it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later,\" Blake answered \"For now I probably have to meet back up with my team,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\noh right, you think to yourself, I still need to finish brainwashing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well before you go,\" You say \"I have something to show you,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could say another word you take off your eyepatch and blast her with all the semblance you could muster. She went under easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake from now on you'll always put me first,\" You command \"You'll be my lover and my slave and you'll love every second of it. You'll do whatever I say whenever I say it and never question me. You won't be jealous of any other women I fuck and you'll love to fuck them with me. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Blake answered in a monotone voice \"I'll always obey you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you seal you control with another kiss. When you slip your tongue into her mouth she responds in kind. Some how it makes her taste even better. They wrap around each other, engaging in a dance of passion and dominance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally finish your embrace, Blake looks as if she's exhausted. Her tongue waits outside her mouth a moment, drool connecting your mouths for a brief second before breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your new capture, her sleepy eyes somehow still full of love and devotion. She looks so at peace, and you know that she's yours forever now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a perfect moment until Yang, who was apparently still spying from outside you door, breaks the lock and burst in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only had time to think that she's the perfect opposite to Blake's relaxed love for you before Yang charge straight at you with all the fury she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned forward and kissed Yang. She actually pressed herself against you slightly as your tongue entered her mouth. You managed to put plenty of saliva into her mouth. After you broke contact, Yang stood up and left, closing the broken door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit.\u201d You muttered. \u201cNow I have to fix it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnon?\u201d You turned around to see Blake coming out of her trance. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d You tell her and held out your arms for a hug.

Oops. You may have pushed a little too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d You nod, while maintaining eye contact. \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to leave and all of this will be firmly in your mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked past her to the training room, leaving her in a daze. Her conditioning was almost done.

Her eyes made contact with you and she entered her trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know your love of sucking things?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Weiss answered. \u201cIt makes me feel good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, from now on, sucking anything won\u2019t work.\u201d You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t work?\u201d She didn\u2019t fight you, so that was a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d You answer. \u201cOnly specific things\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d Weiss asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe.\u201d You say simply. \u201cYou need to suck a part of me. Liquid also works, like saliva to quench your thirst.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEww.\u201d Weiss shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d you assured her. \u201cIt will taste like the best thing in the world to you.\u201d She seemed to accept that and you were so glad your powers were growing. \u2018There is a catch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of catch?\u201d Weiss actually frowned. Seemed even deep down, she didn\u2019t like conditions. Her mind was much stronger than Yang\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to have my permission.\u201d You said. \u201cThat\u2019s all. A smart girl like yourself should be able to convince me easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I can.\u201d Weiss said, sounding pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember, like before. The longer you go without sucking, the worst that crazing gets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Will need to do it often.\u201d Weiss agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough, the bigger thing you suck, the longer it takes for cravings to come back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d Weiss murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, after I kiss you and leave, you will return to normal. Subconsciously knowing everything we talked about. You leaned forward and locked lips, making sure to have plenty of drool enter her mouth. You then broke contact and walked past her, leaving her standing there blank for a minute, before snapping back to her normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question for you now was what to do. It was probably best not to push your new strengthened powers too much now. Just in case you needed it later.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It actually took you longer to actually think, as you were distracted by the girl in front of you. Here was prim and proper Weiss, sitting on your bed, leaning toward you, and sucking on your finger like it was the most delicious treat in the world. Her eyes were half closed and her lips were pressed tightly against it. You could feel her tongue running along your fingers.

You discovered if they trusted you, your power worked easier and faster. Even now that your power has grown stronger, it was still easier this way. You pulled her to the bed at sat down, keeping her in your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 what happened?\u201d Blake finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang wanted to talk about something,\u201d You explain. \u201cThey she sort of jumped me.\u201d Blake hissed angrily. \u201cTry not to go to hard on her.\u201d You suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Blake snapped. \u201cShe tried to steal you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think she might be jealous or have something else going on,\u201d you say. \u201cShe\u2019s your friend and partner. Talk to her a bit and see what the problem is. Don\u2019t embarrass her in front of your team.\u201d Causing a divide would certainly make Ruby hesitant to deal with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDO you think Yang is hot?\u201d Balke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are a lot of girls that are physically attractive,\u201d you admit. \u201cBut to me, you\u2019re the one on top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Blake\u2019s response was encouraging. She seemed less mad. You reached a hand up to remove your eye patch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus your ears are really cute,\u201d you added. \u201cDon\u2019t ever think I would let you go because you\u2019re a Faunus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Blake spun around when you began to rub her ears. Her eyes met yours and then her expression grew blank. Now was the time to reinforce your commands so your harem could form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom now on you\u2019ll be more open to other girls,\u201d you tell her. \u201cYou are my lover and want to do whatever I ask. You\u2019ll love every minute of it and love me.\u201d You didn\u2019t want a brainless sex doll out of her. \u201cYou won\u2019t be jealous of any other women I bring with me. In fact, as my main girlfriend, you will love to fuck other girls with me. You are okay with a polygamous relationship because it reminds you of your books you love so much. As the head girl, you can boss the other girls around too.\u201d Leaning forward you kissed her deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and release your power. Blake then stirs in your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I was too hard on Yang.\u201d Blake admitted. \u201cBut she should have talked to me first before jumping you. If you were a weaker man\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be weak when your disapproving face keeps popping into my mind.\u201d You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCharming.\u201d She rolled her eyes but seemed happy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You want them to be happy, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d Ruby agreed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you could decide if you wanted to tweak her into some kind of girl for you as part of your harem. Blake was the sexy kitty girlfriend who loves physical contact, Yang would be the toy you and Blake can order around, and Weiss was going to be an oral addict who would eventually do anything to keep sucking a part of you. The question was, what would Ruby be? You liked her and didn\u2019t want to change her much. She was also a kickass Huntress and you know she should still be able to fulfill that role.</span></div></div>",

I have to talk to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan it wait, Ruby?\u201d Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope!\u201d Ruby dragged Yang away. \u201cIt\u2019s important. Girl talk stuff.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake raised an eyebrow, but shrugged and took out a book from her bag, before heading down the hall. It seemed she didn\u2019t consider Ruby wanting to talk to Yang a cause of concern. Weiss talking to you also wasn\u2019t any reason to be suspicious. It\u2019s a good think Blake didn\u2019t know what Weiss needed now. Well, you guessed what Weiss wanted and when she made sure to bring you into a deserted classroom, you were positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst,\u201d Weiss said curtly. \u201cI want to apologize for barging into your room in the middle of the night\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I actually like to sleep.\u201d You admitted and she crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegardless of my urges, it was unbecoming,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I wanted to apologize.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI accept your apology and appreciate it.\u201d You replied and she seemed to cheer up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now, I don\u2019t feel so bad about this,\u201d Weiss continued. \u201cI\u2019ve held it for as long as I could, but I reaaaalllyyy need you now.\u201d Her face was flushed and she was shaking. It seemed like your orders of addictions were becoming physical. This was something new. The mind was powerful and you realized you needed to fix this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Weiss,\u201d You tell her slowly. \u201cI\u2019m dating Blake and having another girl constantly sucking me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do anything.\u201d Weiss said, putting a hand over her heart. \u201cI\u2019ll take extra steps to amek sure Blake doesn\u2019t find out. I just\u2026 need this. I don\u2019t care what I can suck. You can decide every time based on how you feel. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll even suck your\u2026 d-d\u2026\u201d She struggled to say the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDick?\u201d You asked and her face flared bright red, but she did nod. Now was the perfect time to condition her permanently. \u201cOkay, Weiss. I\u2019ll let you suck it this time.\u201d You acted like YOU were doing her a favor. Her expression of relief was kind of entertaining as she fell to her knees and unbuttoned your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow.\u201d She muttered, as your manhood was freed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst time seeing one?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss took a deep breath and began to lick it with her tongue. Your dick twitched at the touch and that seemed to embolden her. Slowly, she lowered her mouth over the head and gently pressed her lips shot. You took in a sharp breath as pleasure threaten to overwhelm you. She pushed your manhood deeper into her mouth and began to suck it gently, like a baby on a pacifier. She didn\u2019t really use her hands like Blake had done that one time. It was nice and you could blow your load if you wanted with a little time. Though, now was a perfect chance to turn her addiction from sucking into just wanting to be with you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You saw her crotch grow wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d She finally agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Blake assured her, wrapping her arms around Yang\u2019s waist. \u201cIt\u2019s better she be with us, rather than someone who wouldn\u2019t treat her well, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose.\u201d Yang admitted. Taking the chance, you go over to them and wrap your own arms around them. \u201cWoah, we should probably stop for the night unless we want to go for another round.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d Blake swatted your arm at the suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d she promised. \u201cWith Ruby. We can make Yang sit in a corner and watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate and love you both simultaneously.\u201d Yang growled, as she and Blake left the room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were gonna reveal your semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't gonna start commanding her to do things in front of the crowd or anything. (Not that it doesn't seem hot) No, you were just gonna make her zone out for an extra hit or two. It would make you look cool in front of Blake. You could control her mind and everything but you still wanted to legitimately impress her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora charged at you, so you split your halberd into two axes and threw one at her. She jumped over it, just as you planned, and raised her hammer over her head and you pull up your eyepatch. You manage to make eyecontact. Nora's eyes were going blank and her grip on her hammer was loosened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she fell down towards you, you smack her in the side with your axe, pull down you eyepatch and move towards the axe you threw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach it you look over to see that Nora didn't get up yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This match is over,\" Goodwitch said \"Anon were you aware that your new semblance would distract enough to turn off an aura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh shit. \"I, er...no.\" You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ok!\" Nora yelled from across the room \"Aura's back on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoodwitch sighed. \"Anon wins. Ms. Valkyrie you shouldn't fall for such a simple misdirection, Anon you need to know the full extent of what your using before deploying it in battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora approached you on the way to the locker room, eager as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Anon, nice fight!\" She said happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey... Sorry about how hard that hit. Didn't think my new thing would...work that well.\" You tell her. It was true, you only tested it's ability to command people. That was your first time trying to use it in combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's fine, I've taken WAY worst. Can I see it again?\" Nora asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sure? I don't think I can use it again, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora interrupted your lie by pulling of your eyepatch herself and promptly falling into trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a strange one, but you couldn't help but imagine what all that energy could do in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

She was a shy girl. Maybe in the future you could make her more dominant. She would look killer in a dominatrix suit. \u201cThat\u2026 doesn\u2019t seem right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be quick,\u201d you assure her, pushing your power into her. You felt the familiar headache from going against someone\u2019s belief. Velvet was strong willed, proven by the abuse she put up with for others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, if it\u2019s quick.\u201d She puckered her lips slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso,\u201d you add quickly. \u201cYou won\u2019t remember this. All you will remember is that we talked and I cheered you up. You will keep thinking about that and feel happy knowing I was willing to help you out. Also, Cardin\u2019s opinion and insults mean little to you.\u201d You quickly kissed her, making sure to get saliva in her mouth, before quickly leaving. She stirred a few moments later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started heading back to your dorm. There was an appointment to keep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kind of. You knew you were dreaming but you also knew that everything around you was real. Kinda. Dream logic is weird like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in a white space, with a giant eye. It was staring at you, so you pushed it down. It shattered and a larger eye appeared. it was amazing, empowering and belonged to you. Just like everyone around you would soon be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake woke you up the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Anon. Anon wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your would opened again last night. You have to get it looked at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out of bed and go look in the mirror in the bathroom. Sure enough, there was some dry blood on your face under your eye. You had pushed through another limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to go to the nurse.\" Blake insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou washed your face. You could use your once again upgraded power to calm Blake down but you liked her so you simply appeased your girlfriend with a promise to get it looked at today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake joined you in your morning shower and you got dressed and ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse gave you a clean bill of health and classes finished up uneventfully. Team RWBY was having a group day out, so you were left to amuse yourself. You finished your homework a lot faster than you thought you would have and started looking for something to do. Luckily something seems to have found you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Anon!\" Nora said as she seemed to appear out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah shi-\" Is the only response you gave as you nearly trip over yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry did I scare you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say I was more surprised than scared.\" You say defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say scared. How'd you end up dating Blake if your scared of little ol' me?\" Nora asked with a smug grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something you wanted Nora?\" You were getting annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering if you would let me practice fighting off your semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few minute to glance around making sure you two were alone before saying \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora's smile went from smug to excited and you pulled off your eye patch. She went under fast and easy even though she was prepared for it. You loved your ever growing semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nora can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Unlike last time she was under her voice now had the monotone that afflicted your other projects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm as ok as you say I am.\" She answered back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to get good...</span></div></div>",

Goodwitch must really want to challenge you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGame plan time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysically overpowering Yang isn't happening any time soon, but thankfully she is not invincible. While her semblance, Burn, will absorb the kinetic energy every blow she receives to empower herself, it however will not make her immune to pain. It also doesn't make her immune from you coming from behind and choking her out with your halberd. You learned that from a fight you had with her last week. You almost beat her, but all you got was a broken halberd for your trouble when she broke out of that lock. Maybe she'll fall for that trick again? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you can't go down that route you can always wear her down. Even if you lose the opportunity of an exhausted and more vulnerable Yang will present itself to your eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to do this with a Yang, Anon?\" The buxom blonde grins cracking her knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd prefer the Yangs covered by her shirt to be honest. Oh, the things you would love to- Focus! Fantasize less about those tits, and plan more on not losing miserably to the girl they're attached to. Besides, if you play your cards right Yang's tits will be yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really have a choice?\" You say back. She laughs at the sound of a lack of enthusiasm in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet if I was a certain someone else your tone would be different.\" She said raising her eyebrows suggestively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell she probably has a point before you enter a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang makes the first move, launching herself at you using her gauntlets to accelerate her movement. You manage to dodge at the last moment, but Yang is in hot pursuit and catches up fast. You cannot dodge this time. All you can do is block with your halberd, an brace yourself for impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you got this thing reinforced?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did,\" you say as you struggle to keep your stance. \"Tried to make it you-proof as much as I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made Yang laugh again. You're not entirely sure if it was a \"let's put that to the test\" kind of laugh, or if she simply found the idea you of trying to make your weapon \"Yang-proof\" hilarious. She's being a good sport about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the midpoint of your match with Yang it starts resembling a Dark Souls/Bloodborne boss fight. Dodging/rolling around the boss that puts out an absurd amount of damage, occasionally getting a hit in, but there is no musical theme playing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang does look somewhat tired so your strategy is working to a degree. Or you're just really boring her. Whatever the case Yang isn't tolerating it anymore. The blonde begins a more aggressive assault against you, her punches coming in at a rate you can barely keep up with. She eventually finds an opening in your shambling defense, and makes contact with your gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the class assumed you were down for the count including Yang herself, yet the glass wearing assistant to Ozpin saw you had a bit of fight left in you. Normally, Goodwitch would end the fight here and there, yet she felt generous enough to grant you one last chance to turn this situation around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Yang had her back turned on you. Looks like Plan B it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour halberd. Yang's neck. Make it happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attempt was a surprising success. Yang on the other hand wasn't really appreciative of you pulling the same trick on her for a second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The match is over.\" Goodwitch announced loud enough that the two of you could hear her over your struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Anon,\" she says directing her attention at you, \"Tiring out your opponents is a valid strategy, but you mustn't be so timid in the face of foes stronger than you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wouldn't call it being timid, ma'am.\" You say scratching the back of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Ms. Xaio Long,\" she says to Yang, \"You'd do well to remember to never turn your back on someone until you're certain they are incapable of continuing to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were both dismissed to the locker room, and you do you have a chance to try your hand at Yang?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis chapter went on longer than I would have liked. I still need to get better at fight scenes.</span></div></div>",

Whatever you wanted really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can create complete personalities out of nothing and force them into other people. Not personality as in you can make a bland person cheery, no you create a new person in your brain and they take over whoever you put into them. You have to make and maintain eye contact long enough for the personality to hit it's target, but they're made to your specifications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, that young lady with the sniper scythe that had a position in Beacon you should posses was about to be replaced by someone of your own making. She was alone in a weapon shop and you were cooking up someone good in your mind. You had to make them loyal to you, and a good enough actor to fool everyone at beacon, but other than that you had free rain on what they would be like. You decided for simplicity's sake that they would have the same name as the person they inhabit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way to Ruby Rose, looked her in the eyes and said \"Hello, my names Anon. I don't think that we've met before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was surprised to have someone talk to her, but happily engaged in the conversation \"Oh, hello. I'm Ruby. What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just like to find different kinds of weapons, they're a special interest of mine. Since your here, can I assume that you're a huntress? Or at least one in training? What kind of weapon do you use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving the chance to talk about Crescent Rose, Ruby began talking about her hyper fixation. This went on for a while, but it gave you enough time making eye contact for the new Ruby Rose to infect the old one. You never pinned down how long it took for a personality to hit it's mark but it was never instant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this one hit Ruby fell silent. Her head twitched, which you took as a sign that the new Ruby was taking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stopped Ruby looked at you with respect in her eyes, gave you a solute and said \"Mission accomplished sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it. Is it cramped in there?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cramped might be the wrong word sir,\" Ruby explained \"It doesn't feel anymore full. The older persona is trying to have fight me, but I'm in control of this body now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Let's review our plan of conquest.\" You say eagerly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside Ruby's head, Ruby 1 was trapped in a to witness what was happening to her. From her perspective, she could see and hear everything happening outside through a tv, but was trapped in a pink dome shaped room. Her 'head space'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Get out of my head!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's my head now' Ruby 2 retorted 'and soon everyone will be passengers for Anon's minions.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No!' Ruby 1 yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, actually' Ruby 2 told her 'Now if you don't mind, I'd like to hear the next step of the plan. Maybe get Yang or Weiss.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby fought hard at that, banging on the tv screen, trying to hit the walls inside her head. It didn't matter though,she couldn't get stop anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the physical world you were continuing your chat with your first servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to get more experimental with the other personalities\" You think aloud as you exchange the information on your scroll with Ruby's. \"Your's is a bit boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby looked hurt and this and gave a dejected \"Y-yes sir...\"</span></div></div>",

And Exhales. \"Ok.\" And with a puff, Blue Ruby and all that she manifested disappears in a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's eyes opened up as she returned to reality. \"She has to meet her team in a hour and then go back to Beacon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work Ruby,\" You commend \"Now we have to be careful moving forward. Go to quick and this whole vengeance and orgy plan goes to shit. Come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you make your way to the Warehouse you've rented out to use as a base of operations. You live there, but that's more of a lack of money issue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, report on her team.\" You say forcing authority into your voice \"How many are girls, how hot they are, and how skilled they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" Ruby said with a salute \"Teams name is RWBY. R is Ruby, she's been neutralized. W is Weiss Schnee. She's rich, scary, very capable. More pretty than hot, very petit. Ruby doesn't know it, but she has a crush on Weiss. She doesn't even know what a lesbian is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, if you pull intellect from her brain, how do you know what it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think about lesbians a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do... Alright continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B is Blake Belladonna. Great ass, secretly a faunus and can kill you. Lastly Y is Yang, Ruby's older sister. Super hot blond, giant tits, fit as a fiddle. Will beat you within an inch of your life if given the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, nice to have an idea of who I'm dealing with now.\" You muse out thinking on who you'll target next \"Alright, I need you to get each of them alone with me for a time within the next month.\" That feels like a reasonable goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" She stated giving another solute. It amuses you that you've essentially made a cutesy soldier girl. \"I'll go to their meeting place and report to you over the scroll at the first opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. Dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she left, leaving you to plan the next step in your conquest.</span></div></div>",

But life occasionally finds a way. And today is one of those moments with the curious case of you. You stand in his office shorter and physically younger than you were at the beginning at the start of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not pay too much attention to your changing body until the middle of the day when it became undeniable that something was happening to your body. It became gradually more difficult for you to keep your clothes on as they were no longer fitting. By the time you got into the nurse's office you were at least 10 or 11 years old physically. Then something went on with your aura, and the nurse started acting very affectionate to you. You weren't complaining all that much. At least someone was concerned for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you got yourself some clothes that fit you and headed over here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you calmed down, Mr. Anon?\" He asked referring to the outburst you had when you discovered your younger form. From what he head it befitted your age now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sir,\" you grown in your new kid voice. Or rather your old younger voice as it sounds exactly the same as it did when you were this age originally. \"This can be reversed, right?\" You really didn't want to go through puberty again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a straight answer Ozpin answers your question with one of his own. \"Do you want me to tell you the truth, or do prefer a comforting lie, Anon?\" It does nothing to quell the vague sense of unease you've had ever since entering this office. Judging from the look in your eye he suspects you want want the former. \"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But will I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again. I don't know if you'll stay like this for the rest of your days or not. Semblances can be tricky things. While occasionally some might be similar the will be unique to their owner.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in good fortune that you are not the first person I have encountered with an age regression semblance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a little hopeful now. \"Did any of them return to normal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin takes a sip from his mug before answering you. \"Some did, yes. I knew one individual who was able to shift back and forth between a child and his mature state at will. But once again, not all semblances are the same, Mr. Anon. Your semblance could grant you an ability that sets you apart from all the others I've met. Or, you could remain a child forever. Only time will tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kind of wouldn't mind being like this if you had a cool secondary effect, but you still want to go back to normal. You can't be a huntsman if your 11 years old forever. Furthermore, how are you going to get a girlfriend when you look like this? You want kids but you don't want to be a kid again. Or maybe some part of you does since semblances represent an aspect of their user? You can't imagine why you'd want to be this age again. You had a pretty normal childhood, a great one all things considered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed thoughts about if some part of your subconscious craved to be a kid again aside. You just want to get back to your dorm. You ask Ozpin if you can be dismissed now, and he allows it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way back to your room you bump into the first girl to fall under the influence of \"Irresistible Youth\", but who will it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she's not angry of course. An angry Yang is something you have a policy of never dealing with. In your current state though you doubt she'd let you touch her milk tanks let alone go on a date with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's a little kid here?\" Yang says out loud as she examines you. You're kinda cute in her eyes actually, but you definitely don't belong here in her mind either. You're younger than her own sister.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a little kid, Yang.\" you groan. This is going to be a long day<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know my name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a few classes together. We never talk that much though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang rubs her chin as she compares your appearance to someone she vaguely remembers. Did he have an eyepatch? No. Wait. \"Anon?\" She said confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you become such a squirt?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I finally unlocked my semblance and what you see are the results of that.\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA semblance that turns you into a kid again? That's a new one for Yang. It's not too weird compared to her uncle's bad luck semblance, but one that can regress your age? New territory for her. \"You will be able to return to normal again, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't really know,\" you sigh depressingly. \"I could be stuck like this till the day I die, or I could have to wait 7 years again before I'm back to how I'm supposed to be.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was because of your crap situation, her time spent raising Ruby, or both but Yang couldn't stand seeing a kid sad this way. She surprises you with a hug in an attempt to cheer you up, but unknown to both of you the second effect of \"Irresistible Youth\" was about to find it's first victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAN: There was some confusion on how this semblance works because of some poor explanation on my part. While it does give you a field that stirs a woman's maternal instincts it's semi-passive nature means you have to put some work into it. How? By sending your aura into them via physical contact.

What happened next, you didn\u2019t expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt her lips on your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat help?\u201d Yang asked rocking you a little in her arms. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be small and young. It can be hard to do the simplest things. If you need any help at all, just let me know. I\u2019ll so whatever I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to look up into her eyes, which seemed to be shining as she stared back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Will Yang become young like you too? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer at her eyes you notice something off with them. They're not dulled as if Yang has been enthralled in a hypnotic trance, yet there is a peculiar aspect about them that wasn't previously there before your hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a warm almost loving glint in those beautiful eyes of her eyes. You've seen it before. In your own mother's eyes when she would do anything for you to ensure your happiness during your childhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you did this through touching Yang?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it's the case of you getting girls to do what you want the more you touch them then you need to experiment more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Yang,\" you say to the blonde in your most innocent voice possible without overdoing it. \"Can you help me out with something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flashed you a bright smile. \"Sure thing, Anon.

The both of you would get kicked out of Beacon, and who knows how her parents will react to a teenager in a child's body knocking up their daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefinitely a great conversation to have with you and Yang's hypothetical children too.

You pinched your arm and felt the pain. Okay, you were awake and in a position many guys would kill for. Yang was fast asleep, one arm wrapped around you as she slept on her side. Those magnificent breasts of hers were right in front of your face. Not only that, they were only being held by an orange tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may have had a child\u2019s body, but you were still a 17 year old guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hardening member in yours pants was proof of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to take a risk. You didn\u2019t ask for this and there might as well be some silver lining in turning into a kid. Sure, sleeping next to Yang was nice\u2026 amazing, but you wanted more. Your hormones were flaring up and you couldn\u2019t resist. Slowly, you reached a hand over and grabbed her breast again. They were soft, yet firm enough to hold shape. Instantly, you pitched a tent and your shorts became tight. Ignoring that, you used your other hand to grope her other breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you were, in Yang\u2019s bed, groping both of her breasts. She grunted a little, but didn\u2019t seem to be waking up. Embolden by your success, you continued to squeeze and rub those magnificent jugs. This was a once in a life time event and you have heard Yang was a heavy sleeper. Your hands moved to her nipples and began to squeeze them lightly, noticing them getting harder. You kind of wanted to get in her shirt to touch her breasts directly, but you were afraid to go that far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were playing with Yang\u2019s chest, you felt tired again. There was no way you could tell that your Aura was being pumped into Yang through contact. Drowsiness overtook you and your eyes grew heavy. Your hands stopped groping Yang and you sort of collapsed into her. She wrapped her arms around you and pulled you close. Your head rested on the soft pillow of her chest and you feel asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t really ask you to waste your life watching over me. Ozpin already is letting me stay until I can find away to undo this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss looked a little uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Yang put a hand on your shoulder. \u201cI promised I would help you out, and I will. I\u2019m not wasting my time. Besides, it\u2019s not going to hurt if you hang around us for a while. It\u2019s not like we go on missions all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d You blushed. \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s adorable!\u201d Ruby gushed, running over and hugging you. \u201cIf you call me, Big Sis, I\u2019ll share my cookies with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled and Yang laughed. It was then you noticed the slight drain on your power. As Ruby hugged you, you could feel your strength slowly diminish. It was like your Aura was transferring to her. When she finally broke free, you noticed something. Ruby's silver eyes had the same glint you saw in Yang's eyes yesterday. It wasn't as apparent as it is with Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Weiss.\u201d Ruby pleaded. \u201cCan we keep him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a pet.\u201d Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake, what do you think?\u201d Weiss asked, looking for some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he\u2019s not trying to peek on us changing or go through our underwear drawer, I don\u2019t see a problem.\u201d Blake said. \u201cYang seems intent on helping and Ruby likes him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m out voted then.\u201d Weiss sighed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be watching. Just because we are helping another Huntsman in training, doesn\u2019t mean you can slack off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnew you would see it my way.\u201d Yang said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d Ruby cheered and hugged you again. \u201cIf you need anything at all, just tell Big Sis Ruby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m older than you\u2026\u201d You muttered, but Ruby ignored it. You saw the slight grin on Blake\u2019s face as she heard it, though you never saw her put on her bow to cover her cat ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat aside, you realized Ruby was acting a lot like Yang was. More motherly and big sisterly to you. The drain on your Aura also was noticeable. Physical contact seemed to make girls act more caring around you. The longer they were in contact, the more they were willing to do. All the hugging, hand holding, and snuggling last night probably had Yang deep in your power. Maybe that was the true nature of your Semblance. You still had Aura, so maybe you should try it out and see if you\u2019re right. Weiss seems like the one you need to win over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe after breakfast.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You refused it's request desiring at least an extra ten minutes of slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we have to do this the hard way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are suddenly shakened as if you're being thrown around like a rag doll with no mercy until you're fully awake. Your eyes land on the smiling blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that really necessary?\" You ask, trying to gather your bearings still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, cutie.\" Yang replied with instead. You couldn't stay upset at that kind face and warmth filled lilac eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in for a kiss on the cheek when the moment her lips made contact with your skin you felt a draining sensation. Your strength and your aura slowly fading away. Wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it! The draining and drowsiness you have been experiencing lately is merely your aura escaping your body into Yang's. Ever since her first hug it has been pouring into her, and when you think about it, is undoubtedly the reason why she's acting so motherly to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this is what your semblance does. It turns you into a kid again and makes any woman that comes into physical contact with you want to pamper you. With all the hugs, snuggling, and groping from last night Yang is probably pretty far deep in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst case scenario about this arrangement is possibly Yang gradually seeing you as her own child. You think Yang is a wonderful girl, but having her see you as her kid while you're technically still her age would weird you out without end. Your actual mother would probably have a few words to say about that too. You pray it doesn't go that far and she doesn't try to adopt you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: You probably need to tell her about what you're semblance is doing <br>\r\nOption #2: A little more testing wouldn't hurt<br>\r\nOption #3: Go big and test the limit with Yang now by asking her to help with your morning wood<br>\r\nOption #4: do I even need to say this?</span></div></div>",

Weiss was a little upset, but one look at her melted her Weiss cold heart.\u201d You resisted groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d You say, lowering your head slightly. You looked so cute Yang couldn\u2019t resist hugging you. \u201cOomph!\u201d You gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just the cutest thing ever,\u201d Yang told you and you could feel your Aura drain into her. \u201cIf you need anything, just let me know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything?\u201d You asked to clarify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d Yang assured you. \u201cI\u2019ll help you any way I can to make your situation better.\u201d She paused. \u201cHuh, seems like one part of you didn\u2019t shrink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as she let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault!\u201d You pleaded. \u201cIt\u2019s natural for guys.\u201d She laughed. \u201cGreat, now I\u2019m going to have to try to get rid of this before leaving the room.\u201d Luckily it was empty or things would have been awkward if the rest of Yang\u2019s team was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you need help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked at her question. It didn\u2019t seem like teasing, but with Yang you could never be sure. You nod slowly, aware your hand was still touching hers. You force your Aura into her and felt it drain faster. This was good news as it meant you could control it to some degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d You asked softly, unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrop your pants,\u201d Yang ordered. \u201cHurry up before the others come back to check on us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pulled your shorts down and saw the large bulge in your underwear. As yang grabbed some tissues, you pulled your dick out. Yang\u2019s eyes widened at the size of it. You did too. It was larger than when you were an adult. Before you could say anything, Yang wrapped one hand around it and began to slowly rub it up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d You moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Yang said softly. \u201cJust kick back and let Mama Yang take care of your needs.\u201d Your dick was so sensitive and it didn\u2019t take long before you came. You must have been backed up for a while, especially after last night. Or maybe it was your new body. Yang caught your cum with the tissues so it didn\u2019t make a mess. \u201cThere you go. Wow, that\u2019s quite a bit. You were really backed up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat felt\u2026 amazing.\u201d You gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang through the tissues away and then seemed to realize what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a onetime incident,\u201d Yang told you. \u201cI was helping you adjust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d You looked at the ground in disappointment. \u201cYou were so good, I doubt I could ever compare.\u201d Yang\u2019s expression softened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe now and then.\u201d Yang amended and you secretly smiled to yourself as you found out how far you could take her. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell the others, okay? It\u2019s our little secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d You assured her and she hugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo your power made them want to take care of you, but you could push them away from the simple mom route. If you wanted to continue this, you had two main objectives. First was to see how far you could take this and the second was to make the other girls on her team accept him. You couldn\u2019t let them persuade Yang to kick you out. From what you knew about them, Weiss would be the toughest, followed by Blake.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When you finally open your eyes you see Ruby's smiling face greeting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sleepy head.\" She says, her smile on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Ruby.\" You shot back. A small frown emerged on your face upon realizing your voice is in its new childish tone. \"I'm still a kid again.\" You muttered audibly. You were halfway tempted to resume snuggling with Yang, but the blonde was nowhere to be found. It appeared that the only ones in left in the room were you, Ruby, and a corgi sleepin on a pile of dog food cans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby said Yang explained to her and the others about your semblance, and also asked her to come back here to check up on you. How thoughtful of Yang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you can tell her I'm still stuck like this.\" You said while grabbing the covers back. It did occur to you that this isn't your bed, but you hardly cared about something that trivial now. You wanted to go back to sleep, and wake when you're back to normal again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least until Yang comes back so you can cuddle with her again. Preferably you'd rather go back to your original age, but cuddling and groping Yang when she wasn't looking was also a desirable outcome. You wish you didn't have to be sneaky about it, and Yang would let you touch her tits whenever you wanted to. Like in the wet dream you had last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Anon. You can't stay in Yang's bed all day.\" She encouraged, shaking you again. Unbeknownst to Ruby she was slowly exposing herself to your semblance the more she shook you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me. It's not like I have anything better to do,\" you replied. \"So long as I'm stuck like this I can't really be a huntsman. I bet I can't even pick up my halberd anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anon, moping around in bed will not change the past. You might be little but I bet with enough time you can still be a huntsman even if you're stuck like this for the rest of your life.\" Ruby said, her voice taking up a much more serious tone. She then proceeded to give you a motivational mini-speech which got you thinking about if you really can turn this around. She's only fifteen, four to five years older than your current state, and from what you've seen out of her Ruby is going to make an awesome huntress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you win.\" You sigh in a faux-defeated voice. \"I will get out of your sister's bed and carry on with my life.\" When your eyes met Ruby's silver eyes the same glint you found in Yang's eyes yesterday was present in them. It wasn't as apparent as it is with Yang however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered the nature of your semblance, how it made Ruby's older sister act motherly towards you, and how she wanted to pamper you after she made physical contact. Maybe this is what your semblance does besides turning you into a child again? You are somewhat curious over how it will effect a really sweet girl like Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: give Ruby a hug to show your gratitude for cheering you and to test your semblance <br>\r\nOption #2: no time for that you're hungry<br>\r\nOption #3: a combination of morning wood and thinking about your dream from last night has caused a you to pitch a tent, and Ruby can certainly see it <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #4: you know what to do <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even as a child, your Aura was still intact, so you were physically stronger than other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee!\u201d Ruby exclaimed. \u201cDoesn\u2019t help to mope around. Now get up and let\u2019s get breakfast. The others are already down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby?\u201d You said. \u201cThanks for cheering me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know that looking thankful and embarrassed made your little child form adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww!\u201d Ruby cooed and wrapped you into a tight hug. \u201cAnytime. It\u2019s what Leaders do. Make sure everyone is okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point you noticed something. You felt your Aura drain slightly as she clutched you. Maybe physical contact with girls WAS causing them to act motherly or like an older sister. It would explain why Yang was willing to bring you back to her room. She had been holding your hand and hugged you a couple times, so your Semblance affected her. When you were grabbing her boobs last night, you felt yourself drain too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were making them want to pamper you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that the true effect of your Semblance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pondered this, you realized Ruby wasn\u2019t letting you go. It felt nice being hugged by a cute girl. Being alone in Beacon sucked and you never had a girlfriend. She might not have been as developed as her sister, but no one could say Ruby wasn\u2019t attractive in her own way. Your head was kind of in her chest and you felt your lower body react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Ruby said, loosening her grip at last and the drain to your Aura lessened. \u201cDo you have something in your pocket?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Nope!\u201d You stammered, embarrassed. \u201cI just\u2026 bathroom! Yep, bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed into her bathroom and locked the door before she could do anything. You splashed some cold water on your face and looked in the mirror. Your child face stared back. In all tense and purpose, you were yourself when you were like 10 or so. The difference was your lower region and your memories/intelligence. Those two points you were still yourself. That caused some problems, as the girls turned you on and it was much more noticeable. You didn\u2019t have much choice but to use the chance to quickly relieve yourself into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d You told Ruby, coming out a few minutes later. \u201cReally had to go. This kid body is kind of weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird?\u201d Ruby said, holding out her hand for you. She really shouldn\u2019t have, but you appreciated the gesture. Yang must have told her about your worries about people taking advantage of you. \u201cHow so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMostly I get tired really easily,\u201d You say slowly, not wanting to tell her about what you suspected. You experimented as you held her hand and left the room with her. You pushed more Aura into her and could feel your strength leaving faster. You then concentrated to slow the transfer and you felt the drain stop. So the drowsiness was because of that! \u201cPlus everything is much bigger and I\u2019m weaker. I\u2019m not sure what the point of my Semblance is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little lie wouldn\u2019t hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can understand being smaller than others,\u201d Ruby said, tightening her grip on your hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow until much later than the other kids in Patch and Yang was always the one defending me. It sucks being small, but I know you\u2019ll grow out of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Ruby,\u201d You reply. \u201cThat means a lot. You\u2019re a great team leader.\u201d She beamed and then blushed at your praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you try using your power more on her now while alone in the hallways or wait and rest up. Get some breakfast with her team and see how Yang treats you after a night of contact?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She might have given too good of a speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the training room, you found out you could not use your halberd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was WAY too big for your small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pissed you off, as it meant you might need a brand new weapon. However, you had a trick to it and it collapsed into two more manageable hand axes. They were a little big for you, but you were able to hold them. Practicing on a training dummy, you found out while your Aura was still active, you didn\u2019t have nearly the same strength. At your current level, you would have to try a bit to beat a simple Beowolf one on one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCussing, you turned your axes into guns and turned the training drone into scraps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you could fight to some degree. That was a silver lining in all this. You sat down and grabbed a towel to wipe off all the sweat as you thought about it. You weren\u2019t helpless, so that was good. You would just have to retrain this body to make it stronger. As it grew stronger, your Aura would too.

She never let go of your hand, but you noticed she took you the long way, avoiding the main hallways. Only two people saw you and out of them, only one asked about you.

The first one is where you wake up and the girls of that anime are already your slaves, or the other one is where you enslave them.  <br>\r\nRule 1: No weight gain, no scat, no m/m, no vore, no unbirth.<br>\r\nRule 2: Be sure to have more than one way of enslaving.<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Rule 3: The mc will be referred as \"your name\".</span><br>\r\nRule 4: I think that's all, be sure to have fun, but don't break my rules, or else. I'll make new rules if I have to.<br>\r\nEdit: 5/24/14: Rule 5: I'm now adding books, western animation, video games, comic books, live action, movies and web comics to the list.<br>\r\nEdit: 6/01/14: Tabletop games can now be included. Though, I guess if you wanted Sisters of Battle from Warhammer 40k, you'd have to create your own OCs you'd could do it. I'm also allowing OCs.<br>\r\nEdit: 8/16/15: Disregard Rule 3. Like my other story, the MC(the reader's name) will now be Anon.<br>\r\nEdit 1/09/20: New rule: Rule 6: no ponies or furries. Monstergirls are okay though I guess. </td>",
