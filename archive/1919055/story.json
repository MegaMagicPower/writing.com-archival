You look over to see that someone was with you in bed. You couldn't tell who it was but from the faint outline you could make out that I was a women. You scratch your head and then crack your neck  as you get up from the bed and head to the bathroom. You step inside, feeling the texture of the bathroom tiles as you walk forward and up to the sink. You look into the mirror and see your usual face, your hair was a mess and you needed a trim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...hey where'd you go?\" you heard the woman on your bed mutter. You look back to see her leaning upward, her chest covered with a blanket. You walk out of the bathroom and walk towards the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" you say before letting out a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...what time is it?\" the woman yawns. You look at the alarm and look just in time to see it turn 5am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About 5am. You want anything?\" you reply offering to grab the lady a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5am? Ugh I have to open the shop in an hour.\" the woman replies clearly having hadn't gotten enough sleep last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to wake you up in a half hour?\" you offer and the woman nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks (your name). *yawn*\" soon the woman falls back asleep and you nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet dreams...Ino\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes pass in the blink of an eye as you left of the bedroom and went into the kitchen to fix breakfast for the two of you. You set the table which didn't take long, you lived in a small apartment with only a few rooms, a kitchen/living room, a bathroom with a shower, and a bedroom. Regardless you were happy, especially since you had such nice and beautiful friends. You had several  close friends, all of them women, all of them very beautiful looking, in fact it almost seemed like a harem in a way but you didn't mind. Some of the girls of your 'harem' were older than you some younger than you but age didn't matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you recall a memory from last night, you had received a call from Ino, she had called and asked you if you could help her study for her next exam. She was having a hard time getting down a jutsu and you agreed to help her. You and Ino spent several hours on trying to perfect the jutsu but at around 1am you called it a night. Ino asked if she could sleep in your bed tonight and you didn't see the harm in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm *yawn* morning\" Ino said as she finally woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Awake already? But I thought you were gonna sleep for another twenty minutes?\" you asked as you put a large plate of riceballs on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"{*yawn* I was but *yawn*...\" Ino continued to yawn for another two minutes before continuing \"...sorry. That jutsu really is a pain. I think I used up all my chakra last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense.\" you say with a chuckle \"you've been trying to get that jutsu of yours down for a while now. What was it called again? Mind something jutsu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*ahem* its called the Mind transfer jutsu. And I've already got it mastered. I'm just trying to get it to the point where you can't break out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright, you don't have to yell at me. Besides, you'll wake the neighbors\" you groan before suddenly hearing a knock at the door. \"hmm wonder who that could be?\" You get up from the table and head to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Are you awake in there? I hope it's not too early\" called the voice from outside. You make it ot the door and turn the handle to see none other than ____ standing on the porch.</span></div></div>",

What with the fairy tail guild being the number one guild in the land filled with powerful and sexy mages yet not one of them could stand up to Anon. The new ace of fairy tail who put gladiarts out to dry and even made Laxus back out of battling no one could stand up to him and no female could refuse him and as such whenever he fancied any action all he had to do what make his move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd today would be no different, for this hot spot mage as he wonders into the guild hall greeted by the cheers of his fellow guild mates and eyes of lust from every female he catches eye sight with. It had been another tough mission for Anon and now he needed to unwind the question is how? He banged the hell out of the most chicks in fairy tail heck even doing it on the master desk making the old man leave the room. Still gazing around today all the ladies for fairy tail are here today but did anon fancy any of them to relax with? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr perhaps he'd like to go off to another guild perhaps mermaid heel a guild full of hot women ready for him? But what about others places like the palace where the sexy princess lived or the  prison for all the bad mages which also have devil hot females? He did not know but in the end our hot hero decides too...</span></div></div>",

A simple black tank top which left little to the imagination with very short black shorts to match anon knew this would one work out he would enjoy and so return to his royal room to change himself into a simple loose t-shirt and some loose shorts before going to the palaces gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA private place where only he could be by his orders, Anon quickly makes his way to the gym to see Kallen all ready stretching out for the exercise with her back to Anon.

Such a display of course got Anon's attention, his body warming up from the sigh of such a women and his hands eager to get on the knight he calmly walks over to the stretching Kallen before clamming his hand around her breasts making the knight let out a surprised moan as Anon begins to fondle the cloth cover breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not really surprised are you my red haired love?\" Anon asks in a quiet tone pulling Kallen into him as he continues to knee her large breasts in his hands.

In truth however she had no choice for thought the power of Geass, Anon had made all women his slaves.

He quickly speeds up this action feeling his finger getting hotter and wetter he then begins to talk dirty to his knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that don't you? You like my finger inside you don't you my red hair slave!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting in-between her word Kallen shouts out a chorus of yes, yes i love it making Anon quickly withdraw his forefinger before quickly forcing both his forefinger and middle finger back into her womanhood making Kallen let out a loud moan from the quick penetration. She couldn't control the sounds coming out of her mouth and neither the feeling of pleasure racing though her from his foreplay before suddenly Anon withdraws his fingers and his hand from her breast making her quickly turn around panting and wanting more before she hears him say.              <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is perfectly fine to throw the girls of the other Yugioh series into this, but you must first catch all the 5ds girls first and give a good reason for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Slavery in New Domino: Remember my old original 5ds harem story? Well it's now back as the first option here but with a minor tweak. From any reason to Mega-Ultra Ebola\u00ae\u00a9\u2122 causing wiping out a good chunk of the world because some NWO-types wanted to enact their devious plans but failed halfway, the Earthbound Immortals lashing out and cursing the world they failed to bring devastation to, the Three Pure Nobles/Z-ONE going back in time ending up making some few changes, or all of the above slavery is now in New Domino City to bump up birth rates. Women can now be auctioned off if they commit a crime, or if a boss/loved one/guardian signs a document stating they are to be sold. Slaves can also be won in duels between owners as well. Maybe you feel like being a hero and plan on rescuing the 5ds girls, or you just want them to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to include that old serum from the original story that causes a girl's curves to grow two times their original size, makes them submissive to you and makes their holes eternally virginal tight, and lactate go right ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: Psychic Conqueror: you are a psychic duelist who feels like testing his abilities out to gain a harem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: A Harem for the Future: The android girl Misaki from the World Championship 2011 game is sent back in time to ensure you get a harem to save the world in the future. How the two of you go about this is up to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #4: Gift from the Duel Monsters Spirit World: like Luna you spent some time in the home of duel monsters spirits during your childhood. On one day you remember that time period, and how you received from a spirit that said it would help you to become very popular with the ladies. Time use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #5: Grim darkness of the far future there is only more choices. You ought to know this by now.</span></div></div>",

You never bought into that idea that Duel Monsters Spirit World exists, but yet every now and then you dream about the place you are certain does not exist. Strangely enough a younger version of yourself, no older than five at the least, is walking amongst the spirits generally having fun. This reoccurring dream is normally very short-lived and you can barely remember fragments of it most of the time. Tonight is different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight the dream is completely vivid and feels more like a memory. Almost as if you were actually in the spirit world at one point during your childhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Anon. I have a gift for you back at my home.\" You hear a female spirit say to you. And there she was. The popular for obvious reasons Dark Magician Girl. The female Magician has served as your guide during your stay in this world, and the two of you had an absolute blast together. Your younger self wished you could have spent the rest of your days by her side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit took you by the hand and led you through a green field to her abode. Whoever built it couldn't have made it scream \"wizards live here!\" even if they used a spell to make the building grow a mouth. She later admitted that it wasn't actually her house, Dark Magican and Dark Sage were allowing her to stay until she finished her tutelage under them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought you to a room filled with tomes which were assuredly magical in nature, and drew a symbol on the hand she held on the trip here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There all done! When you get older this will help you with the ladies, Anon.\" She assured you in a sweet voice accompanied by a smile which was betrayed by the devious glint in her eyes. Before you could question her the dreams ends, and you are wide awake to a very unsettling sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour left hand is now on fire. You immediately begin panicking. You put your legs to good use as you rush to your bathroom in hopes that running water will be able to put this flame out. Had you been in a less frantic state you would have noticed the fire around you hand wasn't  hurting earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurried to the bathroom sink, wasting no time to turn turn the water on and to place your burning hand underneath it. After several minutes of this the fire refuses to go away much to your utter confusion. It's not really hurting you for some reason so what gives? To only as more to your confusion the fire's color changes into a dark blue with what appears to pink hearts surrounding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid someone drug you without you noticing it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's finally time for my gift to be used, Anon.\" You heard a voice say coming from the fire. You know that voice. It's the same one you heard from your dream. Soon the image of the Dark Magican Girl manifested in the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't you remember how all those years ago I gave you a gift?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, that time spent when you were a kid in the duel Monsters Spirit World actually happened? It's late at night, your hand is on fire, and a popular monster image is in the fire. You are probably insane, drugged up, or maybe this really is all happening. You're not certain which is preferable to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your gift is making my hand burn?\" You bluntly ask the mage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfff. No. It's for helping you get a girlfriend, Anon.\" DMG replies, adding more to your confusion. \"You just have to throw it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is burning women to death going to get me a girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were more polite when you were a kid, you know that?\" Said an annoyed DMG. \"It's a spell, Anon. Think of it like a love potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I have to throw in the shape of a fireball instead of tricking a girl to drink?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you put it like that, yes,\" says the blonde mage, her smile returning. \"I figured since we had so much fun together during your last trip here I ought to give you something to help you out later in life. Judging from your apartment I can say you needed it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the Dark Magican Girl failed to mention is she also gave you that spell because she was bored, and you liked the type who could give her some amusement down the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only temporary until I can afford an actual house.\" You say rather defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes. \"That's what they all say.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided you are probably going crazy. The Dark Magican Girl just insulted your apartment and is telling you to throw fireballs at women to make them want to be your girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you let out slowly, \"How is this going to work when everyone can see the fire coming?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think I wouldn't have that planned out? The only person who can see it is you, Anon. I have you covered since your childhood.\" You then ask her what if you hit someone more than once with it, and a mischievous smirk emerged on her face. \"Find out for yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire goes out with her image and you return to bed to sleep on what has transpired. If all of that truly did happen you'll probably be the luckiest guy in the city. The next morning you learn you can call upon the fire af will. Nice to know it wasn't a drugs or a dream. You set out to find a girl to test this gift out on. Who do you run into?</span></div></div>",

Your deck for this will be the Tag Force 5 starter deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption#4: Driven by Lust: You are so determined to getting a harem that you have built the means for you to enter all yugioh eras, and multiple means of enslavement from mind control to serums.

The mission in question was to search for an abandoned hideout of the late Toad Sage Jiyara. The Hokage recently found some research notes that belonged to the old man that caught her interest. She said it had something to do with an experimental Jutsu that she wanted to try out. You made a joke about it being some sort of age reversal Jutsu durning the briefing. She didn't think it was funny.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were grateful that she didn't feel like beating your end, but that was probably because she wanted to relax now that the Great Ninja War was over.  You heard that Naruto guy, the one that defeated Pain, defeated Madara freaking Uchiha! And that the past four Hokage came back from beyond the grave to help! But more importantly, Madara's dead, again, and no one will live in a fake imaginary world created by a crazy old coot! You made a note to do something nice for the guy when you get the chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the village, things are looking up now. Ever since the survivors of the war came back, the village's reconstruction has been accelerating, and so far no other village has tried to pull anything funny. Maybe there'll be peace in the Ninja world after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut peace for you? Not lately. You've been following a map to Jiraya's hideout, and you came to the conclusion that the old man made this map to drive people insane. The first stop had you dig under the hot springs to find the next piece of the map. When you found it, you weaken the ground underneath a certain Hokage that decided to take some time to relax, and made her fall into your tunnel. To say Lady Tsunade was angry was an understatement. How you aren't in the hospital is something only the Sage of the Six Paths could know. The next couple of stops involved Jiraya's favorite places, more hot springs. Though you might be banned from a good majority of those places, it wasn't all bad. You got to see Tsunade's chest, that has got to count for something. Another stop had you got to this forest where you found this triple bladed scythe that you took a likening to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have finally found the place you've been looking for the past two weeks, and you have the hope that you could be in the Hokage's good graces again. The Sage had the place hidden away in a swamp. Seemed fitting enough that he would build the place in an area filled with frogs. </span></div></div>",

One landed on the back of your neck and jammed its proboscis into your neck, breaking the skin an beginning its meal. <i>Smack!</i> Your hand made that sound when it made contact with the back of your neck, and the mosquito as well. Another one landed on your face and quickly started its meal of your blood. You brought your hand to it, but the insect got off before you killed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mosquito flew to a near by pond, only to be caught by a tongue of a toad, and to become a snack of the amphibian. The toad then released a loud croak before jumping off the lilly pad it was on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued on your way to the building, swatting any mosquito that attempted to make a meal out of you. You propped yourself on a near by tree to take a break, because it has been that long. You released a large sigh, and took out the map. You looked over it to review your mission. Your first stop, the first sign that this mission was going to be a long one, could of went better than you wanted it to. To see Lady Tsunade so furious, and yet at the same time so arousing was something else, you thought. You don't care how old she is, she's still hot. Now only if you could stop going back to when her chest started to jiggle would help. You started imagine those massive mounds of flesh going up and down on something else, and a scenario where they're jiggling in your face.... You shook your head to being yourself back to reality. Maybe reviewing your other stops, the ones that did not involve naked women, would help you out with tightness in your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This one,</i> you groaned mentally. One of the ones that got you into legal trouble. The second stop had you technically trespass on Hyuga property, and then how you escaped became full trespassing. They didn't even give you time to explain. Thankfully any legal trouble stops were short in number. The best one was the one where you got the scythe. It gives you the feeling that it has been used religiously in more ways than one for some odd reason. There were a lot of deer staring at you with these strange eyes when you dug up the next piece of the map. Yet the feeling that you were trespassing lingered on as left the forest with your prizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your eyes off the map, and looked up at the sky. \"Lord Jiraya, I hope you're watching,\" you say, thinking the Sage was watching your mission from beyond the grave. \"It would only be fitting that you would be a perv in death, as you were in life.\" You sighed one more time while putting the map away. You killed a mosquito that was having a time with your face. The sooner you got out of this swamp, the sooner you could put this business behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraya's hideout was half size of a two story house, and the years in the swamp hasn't been too bad to it. It looked like it was still in good condition, aside from the grime and filth it gained. You opened the door and felt something fly by near your face. Some blood trickled down your face as you saw what looked like a shurekin hit the tree you previously propped yourself on. You then realized the old man had the place booby trapped, and that might of been a warning shot. You dropped to the ground as more shrukiens hit the tree.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the last shurekin hit the tree, a mosquito flew near the blood on your face and positioned itself to drink your blood. You smacked it, killing it, and leaving a mess on your hand. You were not going to let this stop you. \"Lord Jiraya, if your traps kill me, get ready. I'm coming after you!\" You yell in a fit of anger resulting from all the dead man has put you through. The swamp became quiet, aside from the croaking of toads and frogs, and the buzzing of insects. You got up and dusted yourself off when your heard what sounded like growling. You turned your head and saw in the hazy swamp fog, a pair of two glowing, piercing, yellow eyes. Eyes that looked at your very soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No, no, no...\" You say staring straight back at the eyes. \"I've been chased by a naked woman that posses strength that can crush a boulder, and have gotten in trouble with the Hyugas. There's no way I'm going to let a genjutsu, or a summoning creature mess with me.\" You said as you tried to test if this was a genjutsu. No luck. \"So, Lord Jiraya has a summoning creature guarding this place,\" you say as whatever you're giving a look of rage at growls at you more. \"But that wouldn't make sense. Shouldn't it be a toad, or a frog?\" You ask yourself when you came to a conclusion. \"No. Swamp monsters? I am not dealing with swamp monsters.\" You grabbed a kunai, and pulled an explosive tag out. You threw the kunai with the explosive tag now attached to it at the source of the eyes, and then fired off a fire ball Jutsu at it. It could of been the Jutsu, it could of been the tag, but you could care less. Whatever it was, it was most likely dead. If not, the scythe could finish the job. Just as you were about to enter the building, you say what looked like more eyes appear out of the fog, with intense growling followed afterwards. You then proceed to use the Jutsu once more, firing at all of the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Jiraya wasn't good at genjutsu, was he?\" You asked as you shut the door behind you. \"And if those were his toads, shouldn't they introduced themselves or something?\" You shrugged it off as a genjutsu or something. Wanted you wanted to know is if you'd get a vacation after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came across a hallway, and had the feeling that this has to be a trap. You placed your back on the corner, and used the scythe to spring any traps. Sure enough, the scythe did its job. You watched as shurekins flew by hitting the wall. You weren't going to let an old man be death of you when another old man almost trapped the world into a genjutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found a room that contained scrolls, and felt like you found what you were looking for. You entered the room cautiously, using your scythe as a minesweeper on the floor as you approached a desk. You saw a journal on the desk, and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the past couple of weeks the \"growling\" has become more frequent than usual, and with increased intensity,\" you read out loud from the journal, \"And what appears to be eyes show up more than they used to.\" You continued to read from the journal, dismissing this as a trick made by Jiraya. It's better than the other. Swamp monsters aren't real. That's the stuff of legends and folk lore. Things that parents tell their children to stay out of swamps, and for older ninjas to tell genin to make them not leave the comrades behind during swamp missions. Tailed Beasts? A man with unique eyes fighting a god, sealing it inside of him, and creating the moon? That's believable. Especially the latter, because that makes so much sense why there's nine demons made up of chakra. To you at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a kunai that the Fourth Hokage used to help him out with that teleportation Jutsu of his on the desk. \"This would be a great souvenir,\" you said putting it in your pocket. You wondered if this counts as stealing, but you decided Jiyara owes you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had past since you found the room, and it was getting to you. Whatever journal or scroll you found was either old book ideas, or rough drafts. Not that the mission itself was helping as well. You created a clone to take over while you rest up. Every now and then, you would doze off and dream about the hot spring stops before the clone would wake you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Lady Hokage, not there,\" you mumbled as you dreamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, slacker,\" your clone said knocking you on the head with the scythe's handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bad,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Lady Tsunade heard you, she'd beat you into next week,\" the clone replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it my fault I'm dreaming about what you're reading?\" You asked the clone. \"Why are you even reading the old man's smut anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm bored.\" The clone answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes. \"Where are we now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just finished reading the story where the guy's girlfriend became an idiot, and the one where this leaf shinobi and hidden mist ANBU black ops operative fall in love. It's actually a pretty good story,\" the clone answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much more do we lack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty five more journals, and fifty seven more scrolls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrific.\" You sighed. \"Am I going insane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, you're lazy. I'm probably going to go insane here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read smut makes you lose sanity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not all smut. Some stories have nothing smutty at all.\" Insisted the clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Do you think this is all an elaborate test made by the Hokage to see if I'm worthy enough to be a jonin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would she let you see her naked then?\" The clone asked. \"Unless that's a part of her plan I don't see that happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this point I'm willing to believe anything,\" you reply. \"Note to self, head to home when I get done here. The Hokage can wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours, many scrolls and and eleven journals later, the clone and you had read most of the scrolls here, and only one journal was left. Your eyes were tired from reading, and you could really go for hitting one of those hot springs you're still allowed at, and forgetting this mission altogether. The clone wasn't faring much better. The clone leaned to far back in the chair it was sitting in, and with a quick cloud of smoke, it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slacker.\" You said as you grabbed the last journal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting old,\" you read out loud, \"and I can't always get a young beauty like I could when I was younger. So, I decided what if I could reverse the age process to look and be young again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to read the journal and found out that Tsunade's information was wrong. Jiraya didn't just create one experimental Jutsu. He created a couple that only a perverted mind like his could only produce. And one was an age reversal that actually could regress a person's age. A few of them was based on some information he plundered from a base of Orchimaru's. You read that the justu the Sage had created were the following: a mind control Jutsu, two similar Jutsu that could make a woman's chest or butt bigger; one that involved hormones, and one that could turn a woman into a bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got to be kidding me. This has got to be fake,\" you say to yourself. You read downward on the page and saw that the old man did have some success with these Jutsu. At this point like you said earlier, you're willing to believe anything. You're willing to believe that the journal's telling the truth, and Tsunade's testing your loyalty based on if you use them or not. Heck, you're even willing to believe she wants you to use the bimbo Jutsu on her because she wants to become a brain dead bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what to do with these scrolls?</span></div></div>",

They look relatively easy, but you need more time and rest to fully understand them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could start up my own harem with these Jutsu.

Seems like you skipped taking a bath, and went straight to bed when you got home. You just rubbed your eyes and took off your forehead protector. \"Bath time,\" you said heading for the shower. A nice, warm shower is what you need. As the water washed over you, its warmth remind you of the hot springs, and seeing Tsunade's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower, you found something to wear and searched for something to eat. You really need to go grocery shopping soon. The milk in the refrigerator is almost spoiled, and the only thing you can eat for breakfast is an almost empty box of cereal. But it'll do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This smells better than that swamp,\" you said taking a whiff of the milk. \"But then again, almost anything will,\" you say as you poured the milk into a bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, you decided you should now that a better look at those scrolls. A well rested mind should do you wonders to help learn new Jutsu. You placed the scrolls and the journals you brought back on the table, and grabbed the journal that you read the last time. You wanted to make sure of that you didn't miss anything. You didn't miss anything. You went for the remaining journals to see if they had any hints and tips on the jutsu. Most of them were unfortunately just stories Jiraiya didn't go through with. Only two journals had anything on the jutsu, but they'll help. You looked at the scrolls, and saw they were easy, but some required a good amount of chakra to use. The mind control Jutsu gave you the impression that you could use it only once a day. You could probably use it on multiple targets, but that would leave you pretty drained. The age regression one took the most, no question. The bimbo Jutsu would work best together with the mind control, you noted. The expansion Jutsu and the hormone Jutsu required the less amount of chakra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what are you going to do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is what you were going to test out first. \"Hinata, get ready for the first one.\" You said. You got her in front of you, and proceed to use the Jutsu on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Hinata asked with a headache. \"What was that.... Ow...\" She said rubbing her head. You told her just to sit down while you got her something for her head. Hinata found it hard to concentrate as a pink fog rolled into her mind. \"Wow, it feels like my thoughts are slowing down,\" Hinata giggled. \"Why did I find that funny?\" She asked herself as she clumsily fell down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" You called out from the other room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Your floor tripped me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did my floor trip you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. I don't know what I was thinking. I just need to be less clumsy.\" She replied. \"Stupid floor,\" she said as if the floor could be held accountable. \"You shouldn't make Hinata fall. Hinata could get hurt.\" Hinata shook her head, trying to regain focus. The fog began to cloud her mind even more. She started to feel funny in her lips, breast, and butt, but ignored that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brought her a glass of water and some medicine for her head. You thought her lips look a little bit fuller and bigger, you took it as a sign that the Jutsu was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Anon.\" Hinata said taking the glass. Anonis so nice to Hinata- me.<i> She thought swallowing the water and medicine. </i>I wish he'd give me something else to swallow.<i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice something different about her. It looked like her breast looked slightly bigger, and the same for her butt. You were sure she didn't notice you looking at her like that. You always had a problem with eyes of the Hyugas. You always thought they were slightly blind or color blind. You would ask Hinata, but you think that would offend her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, she did notice you looking at her assets. For some reason, she couldn't think way she should get angry at you. \"Thank you, Anon. I'll take this back to the kitchen.\" She said getting off the couch with the glass. As she got up, you noticed her rear end looked like it was getting bigger. Hinata placed the glass in the sink without an incident, and came to the living room. For some reason, her seat felt different than before. As if it was somebody's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Hinata?\" You say getting her attention. She jumped off your lap, and started to apologize with a blush on her face. \"That's okay, Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fog in her mind was starting to become much worse. She started to forget basic things like the skill needed to be a ninja, and trivial things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long would it take for the Jutsu to come full circle?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Within a couple of minutes, Hinata would be a complete bimbo, and you'd have the first member of your harem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Hinata, mind if I ask you some questions?\" You asked, wanting to see how much of a bimbo she is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, sure,\" She replied. That was a good sign, for you at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was something the First Hokage famous for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, her big boobies?\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"That's Lady Tsunade, Hinata. An she's not famous just for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Give me another question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from that, what else is she famous for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, uh,\" Hinata says, scratching her head. \"For having big boobies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least her intelligence was starting to reach the proper bimbo levels, and shouldn't she have some to by now? You decided her expansion was taking too long. \"Hinata, I'm going to use the Jutsu again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did it do again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't remember?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think you never told me what it did in the first place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should of remembered,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think maybe you did.\" She said. With that you used the Jutsu on her, again. This time, it looked her growth was catching up to her draining intellect. Her chest started to enlarge, making her feel hot. \"Is it me, or is it getting hot in here?\" She asked fanning herself. She took off her coat, and it looked like in a while her breast would probably burst out soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her lips started to look bigger, you wondered how she was doing in the brain department. While the Jutsu should make the fog in her mind worse, her intellect shouldn't be be too bright. So, you decided to test it out. \"Hinata, I think you're doing it wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What am I doing wrong? Am I sitting wrong?\" She asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I think you're wearing it wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata still had some brains in her, but still less than enough to not believe you. \"How am I wearing it wrong? Is it on backwards?\" She asked looking at the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I mean you're wearing it wrong, because you're wearing it.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She still had enough sense to see the error in your logic. Thankfully for you, the fog in her mind would get worse, and she'd become a bimbo faster the more she had to think about something. So, all you had to do is say things that don't make sense, and her lack of intelligence would make her try to understand it would make her a bimbo faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For some reason, I can't help but think the rule had been changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What rules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rules that say you need to wear a shirt over your bra. For the life of me, I can't help but think a bra counts as a shirt, and a shirt counts as bra.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can use my bra as a shirt, and wear it over my shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and no. All you need is your bra, and no shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But people would see my boobies then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you want them to, and if you wear your bra. You don't have to wear your shirt, like your bra, but you can though. You don't want to break the rules do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" The near bimbo said taking off her shirt. \"Hinata's, like, a good girl who follows the rules!\" You'd give her maybe four minutes before she's an airhead. And you couldn't believe your eyes. Her tits were now bigger than Tsunade's! You could wait to see how big her's would be when you turn her into a bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hinata, I'm thinking about getting my name changed to Master, what do you think about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that's totes cool, Master!\" She said in a higher pitch voice. \"Can I call you that from now on?\" She says in her regular voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Master,\" she says, \"Something feels wrong with my boobies. They feel bigger than they used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could feel them for you to check,\" you say moving your hands towards them. Hinata covered her breasts with her hands, but then dropped them, not seeing why she shouldn't let.</span></div></div>",

You licked your lips when you saw your soon to be bimbo slave's tits bounce a little when her struggling bra was ripped off, and her simi-erect nipples. Your fingers sunk deeply into her expanded flesh getting a small moan out of her. The heavy orbs of flesh had a warm feeling to them making your squeeze them more. Carnal thoughts had no trouble entering your mind, and Hinata's moans were becoming more audible. You took your hands off and said, \"They feel fine to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Hinata whispered in a begging tone. \"Please keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it when I grope you, Hinata?\" You ask as you twisted her nipples. You wanted to suck on them so badly, but decided to wait until she was a full bimbo before you did that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master,\" she said, \"please grab my boobies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I want to, I think I need to check your butt,\" you said taking your left hand away from a nipple and squeezed her butt, \"It feels like it could use some checking too.\" Hinata took off her pants, and whatever her panties were before, they were stretched into a thong now. You ripped it off just like her bra too. Your hardon became harder as you had Hinata in her naked glory in your house, and her blush was also nice. You guessed she was trying to resist her transformation to a degree and regaining some of her normal sensibilities. That needed to go. Now. You grabbed one of her boobs with your right hand, and grabbed one of her buttocks with your left. You then moved your over to her other breast, and started sucking on her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Master, squeeze harder!\" She moaned as you pleasured her more to get her back on track to bimbohood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shook her head and pulled away from you. \"Master, do you have, lik- a bathroom?\" You pointed down the hall, and smiled as you got a good look of her behind. It was still growing but it looked like it was getting close to stopping. \"Come on, stupid door, open,\" she said to the door. She pouted as the door didn't open, \"Stupid mean door, Hinata- I need to get in.\" She got on her knees and begged to the door, \"Pretty please, Mr. Door? Like, I forget how to open you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having trouble?\" You say as you walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. This door is totes mean!\" She replied. She gasped as you turned the door knob, and opened the door for her. She hugged you tightly and said, \"Like, Master, you're a really smarty pants and a hero!\" before regaining some of her senses and entered the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned on the sink, and splashed water in her face. \"Get a grip on yourself, Hinata,\" she mumbled. \"Look at yourself!\" She saw the changes to her in the mirror and wondered what was happening to her. \"Master! He's doing this to me! I need to- like thank him for making me turn into such a hottie!\" She said in a high pitched sultry voice. \"Like, I bet if I sucked his cock, he'd let me suck it any time I wanted to!\" She giggled. Her transformation was complete now.</span></div></div>",

Her tits were bigger than Tsunade's, and was fatter than the Lady Hokage's. The same was for her rear, now two fat mounds of flesh that jiggled still after they expanded. Her lips became puffer and looked like it wouldn't have trouble sucking anything. In her head was nothing but a thick pink fog, and the love of sex. You figured Hinata would be smarter, but you guessed that the Jutsu was very effective. You imagined how Lady Tsunade would look after you hit her with it. If it was possible, the hardness in your pants became harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata let out a giggle first and then said in a stupid, high pitch voice, \"Like, what did you do me? My boobies are soooo big now!\" She squeezed them and moaned loudly. Hinata started to bounce up and down, watching what should be called udders now hit her in face sometimes. \"Heheh. Big and bouncy boobies! Bouncy boobies! Heheheh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I turned you into a bimbo, Hinata,\" you explained while getting her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's, like, a bimbo, and why did *your name* turn Hinata into one?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bimbo is a girl that has a big chest and butt, but really isn't smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like Hinata!\" She gasped. \"Why did you make Hinata's boobies and booty bigger, and take away her smarticles?\" The bimbo demanded in a way that made you feel bad. \"Like, are bimbos the girls that get to have a lot of hawt sexy with guys with super cocks and tasty cum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned at this. \"Yes, Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata squealed loudly at this. \"Now, like, Hinata can have hawt sex with tons of guys with super cocks! Thanks, *your name*, but Hinata has to leave now and find a bunch of manly guys.\" The bimbo said heading for the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! You can't leave! You're my bimbo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why can't Hinata have hawt sex with other manly guys?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I said so,\" you answered. Hinata had a look that was the closet she could manage to deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, okay, but Hinata wants super cocks now!\" She said like a bratty kid being denied her way. She stomped her foot down and made her tits and butt jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give you that Hinata, but it'd have to be mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I turned you into a bimbo,\" you replied. \"And I think that would be breaking the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What rules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rules that say you have to be the bimbo slave of the person that turns you into one. I think you'd be in so much trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata's a good bimbo that doesn't break the rules!\" She said falling for your trick. \"But can Hinata sometimes, like, suck other super cocks besides yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not many people like bimbos, Hinata. People would probably make fun of you for having those assets of yours, and for not being smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata pouted. \"People would make fun of Hinata for having big boobies and a big booty, and like, not being a smarty pants?\" You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't worry, Hinata. I like bimbos, big boobies and big booties. I might make fun of you for being a bimbo, but I would do in a way that's not mean.\" You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thanks *your name*! Your so nice, can I be your bimbo slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can, you bimbo.\" You said.</span></div></div>",

You ordered her too move more freely and to dance sexier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotura moved a few feet away from you, and walked back to you swaying her hips. She slowly stripped down to nothing, and twirled like a slutty ballerina. She was completely under your control! You had no doubts now, but wanted to see her dance more. She stopped twirling and had her backside towards your face. Hotura started to twerk for you, and positioned her butt in your face to give you a better view. \"Master, is this pleasing to you?\" She asked smacking her right buttock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and gave her a light spank.

You motioned her to come closer to you and gave her the next order. She crawled on her hands and knees, and placed herself in a way her chest was in your face.  \"I want to know a little about you. Did you plan on going somewhere?\" You asked staring at your mind controlled slave's bust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was heading to the Leaf Village to find someone I know if they've seen my master.\" Her answer caused you to grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that you accomplished that!\" You replied grabbing her behind. \"I'm your master now, and I think I'll change a few things as I go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Master, but what about me do you want to change?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For starters your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't told you my name yet, Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou liked how she called you \"Sir\". \"I know but you don't need it.

I've been walking for too long, and I need something to drink.\" You groped her breasts, \"These better have milk in them. If they do I'm going to need them to double as pillows when I'm finished.

Second thing is that all Soul Reapers get Mayuri related hazard pay and insurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did that man do to? Who knows? You bet he didn't even know. All you remember is that you saw your life flash before eyes, and evil scientist laughter. You think maybe it was to do something with your Zanpakut\u014d, and Reiryoku? Maybe it something about using mind control? Maybe it was something about using your Zanpakut\u014d to alter minds and bodies? Or was it something about making it more likely that a Soul Reaper could be born in the Soul Society? Or was somethin that involved using your Zanpakut\u014d to leech strength from victims and put them under your control? You weren't entirely sure what Mayuri was doing. You felt like he was just doing it to be a sadistic jerk. You just want to forget about it, just like a good portion of everything you learned at the Spiritual Arts Acadmey.

Of coarse having a dream and making it a reality are two separate things. I was only until you found a rare item that it became possible to pursue your goal. you discovered an old Hypno pendent like the pokemon used. It was generally believed that only Hypno could use it seeing as how they get it when they evolve, but holding it in your hand seemed to awaken psychic powers within you. you first used it to easily catch pokemon you wanted and they gave you little trouble. you even used to convince some of the more difficult ones to obey you. Now that you've started your journey officially you decided that it was time to test it on people.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You've been traveling for a while now when you finally arrive at Cerulean City. Actually perhaps 'finally' isn't the word you're looking for. You can travel pretty quickly from city to city since you've hypnotized a Fearow a while back. you decided to spend a day planning your capture and watch Misty's show and how she battles before deciding what the best way to approach this is. After seeing her in her mermaid outfit you decide that you want - no - you need to have her for yourself as soon as you can. But later when watching her battle other trainers you find a lot of pride and a strong determination for getting things done. A strong personality like that would take a long time to control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your plan into motion the next day as you approach her sisters first. 'Time to put it to the test.' you think to yourself eager to see if you can in fact control other people. Her sisters didn't want to give you the time of day at first but with enough persuasion and the right bait you can get anyone. You simply advertised as a new age hypno-therapist who could solve most people's problems with just an hour of there time. they hooked on and you found yourself hypnotizing them. You watched as their eyes went blank watching your stop watch swing back and forth. you rejoiced at the fact that you can in fact control human-beings. <br>\r\n\"Can you hear me?\" You ask calmly despite your growing 'excitement'.<br>\r\n\"Yes we can hear you.\" the three replied simultaneously. Your excitement continues to grow.<br>\r\n\"I am your master. repeat it.\" To your surprise they didn't completely follow this as your pokemon did. <br>\r\nWhile Lily immediately said \"You are our master\"  the other two stumbled with the words trying to resist.<br>\r\nYou grumble increasing the out put of your psychic powers. it took a different amount of time for each of them but eventually you managed to break all of them.<br>\r\nYou felt exhausted. \"Okay.\" You said having finally been satisfied with your hold on all of them. \"When you wake up remember your programming and be thankful that I took the time to make you slaves.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Master. We love being your bitch slaves.\" They said eyes glazed over smiling happily as they were programmed to do.<br>\r\nWith a snap of your fingers they all blinked awake and bowed to you. \"Thank you for our new lives master!\" Lily said happy as a clam that she was now an obedient tool. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, we don't know what we would be doing if it weren't for you!\" Violet said<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes I'm great I know.\" you respond \"Now onto more pressing maters, controlling your sister.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know if even you're great enough for that master.\" Daisy said \"Misty is really stubborn, she'll try her hardest to reject your gift of obedience.\"<br>\r\n\"Worry not my sexy slave.\" You say with an evil grin on your face \"I know just what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you arrive at the gym knowing that your slaves have told Misty all about how this guy used hypnosis and how great it felt. Then when you arrived they acted surprised and excited that their favorite hypnotist just decided to show up for a gym battle.<br>\r\n\"Now, now. Lets not get overly excited.\" You say knowing full well that your ploy is working \"I'm just here to see if I can win a gym badge. Although it would be okay if you wanted me to give you a session after the match.\"<br>\r\n\"How about this,\" Misty said curious to see if she could be hypnotized without becoming a pokemon again \"If I win you'll hypnotize me for free. It would be nice to have a good experience with hypnosis for once.\"<br>\r\n\"You drive a hard bargain.\" you try not to smile as this was your plan the whole time. \"But I don't see why I can't. It will be interesting to try and put you under.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was swift and Misty won just as you planned. Not that you couldn't win, you had plenty of absolutely loyal pokemon with more than enough power to crush her but the plan was to make her think that the hypnosis would be earned and enjoyable so her defenses would be as low as possible.<br>\r\n\"Well a deals a deal. Prepare to be mesmerized.\" You said in a somewhat joking manor.<br>\r\nMisty was quick to under, quicker than you expected even if she was trying to be hypnotized. The hard part was breaking and reshaping that strong will of hers. Her sisters were right she was stubborn but with a combination of your efforts and her sisters helping relax her she eventually fell.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" You asked after a couple hours of relentlessly rewriting of her mind.<br>\r\n\"I am your loyal and obedient slave Misty master.\" A smile spreads across your face as you wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much \"Misty\" did you leave in Misty?</span></div></div>",

Eventually, as he grew older, as he entered his teens, he figured out why; he had a talent for a unique and unknown form of bending, one that he'd been subconsciously using every day.  Now that he knew about it, he dubbed it Pimpbending, and refined it so that he could use it intentionally and with more power, altering a girl's mind and body to be more pleasing to him.  So, with this power came opportunities; as always, reshaping Azula into a more docile and fun babe would probably please Zuko to no end, but then again wouldn't it be fun to go after the decidedly unattached Ty-Lee?

Just call me Anon, Nami,\" you replied.

The heat of the water and your hands were causing her to have enough pleasure to let out a few quiet moans every few seconds. This was good. The more pleasure your target was feeling, the more likely they'll succumb to your ero-ero powers. You let a small perverted grin form on your face, and started your second phase to your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nami, I'm going to start rubbing a little harder if that's okay with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it, Anon!\" I haven't felt like this in ages!\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ero-Ero growth,\" you whispered to yourself. Your hands started to emit a very dim glow as your rubbed them together and placed them on Nami's shoulders. You leaned your head over Nami's shoulders, and took a look at her breasts. At first it was barely noticeable but there was a slight growth. Next the growth was more noticeable. It was getting harder for Nami's towel to cover her expanding breasts, and you could only thank the fact that Nami's zoning out right now to notice. You had caused Nami's breasts to increase two sizes, and you were thinking that it was enough for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami's towel could no longer conceal her newly expanded  flesh, and Nami now felt the added weight to her chest. This might be bad for you, and you might have to kick things up a notch with your ero-ero powers. \"What has happened to me?\" She asked.</span></div></div>",

I got to distracted now I'll have to step up my game.' You angrily think to yourself as you too quickly get out the hot spring and make a dash for the changing rooms.

You on the other hand quickly turn into Mr. Nice guy, explaining to her that this is all your fault. That you forgot to tell her about your devil fruit power and now feel so bad that you just want to help make thing right between you both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glare from Nami told you she didn't believe a word you said but what choice did she have? She couldn't walk around like this and so with a sigh she agrees to your help with warning that should any more funny stuff happen that you'll be swimming with the fishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you Nami.\" You say in the wimpiest voice you could muster. I promise I can fix this, but well I can't do it in public perhaps we could step back into the ladies dressing room to sort this out?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this Nami agrees reluctantly ordering you in first before following shortly after still trying to keep her decency. Once inside the dressing room you quickly put your new plan in motion by telling Nami you will have to massage her shoulders again to make the power work making the busty navigator turn around where she stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well get on with it.\" Nami ordered making you quickly put your hands on her shoulders.

You later use that spell for your own advantage.

The twist? You want it to be you and a whole bunch of babes. Thankfully you find a new spell to help out with that endeavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: Perverted Alchemist: You are a wizard independent of any guild that specializes in potions that alter the mind and body. You're also a pervert as big as Happy is blue. One day you lose to temptation and start enslaving with your potions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #4: Exiled Royal: You are a member of the royal family of the Pergrande Kingdom who got exiled to Fiore on bumped up charges. While you plot your way to clearing your name you come across something to give you a harem. It can be anything from magical artificial, potion recipe, or spell.

Now you can go back to trying to gain control of that girl with big tits, which you realize is much more problematic now that you think about it. Now that you know that one of the people in the class is invisible you have to keep an eye on her very closely to see when she could be seeing you editing. Fortunately she seems to be a good student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally form the book for big tits over there making sure that no one is watching and begin to read before putting in your personal touches. You learn her name is Momo Yaoyorozu and she is apparently a brilliant student. You don't need that but given how her Quirk worked. So you needed to change her quirk. Luckily you knew what would be much more fitting for her new personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou erase her IQ and write in 90, lower but still smart. Certainly smarter that all the other girls you'll be taking control of. Then you go to work on her quirk, it was very powerful but not sexy enough for you to enjoy in someway. Then you write in a Quirk you made up; Pretty- Anyone who finds her attractive must obey simple commands she gives. It could come back to haunt you a little given your love of her boobs but hey, it's fun to make her identity more dependent on her looks. Then you write her to be bi-sexual and give her a strong attraction to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you close the book and disperse the book. It's always a weird feeling when reality morphs around you, like sitting in the middle of silly putty that's swirling around you. When it dies down you go back to focusing on class and enjoy the occasional glance she gave you. It feels good to have the pretty girl be the one to nervously look at you for a change. When class was over you happily waited for her to come and try to talk to you, maybe use her 'new' Quirk to make you kiss her or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

Being in another castle, being kidnaped, getting her kingdom taken over, and then being rescued by Mario (and occasionally Lugi). The toads don't even defend themselves. Her guards coward in fear when Bowser comes knocking. It makes you think that Peach is rather willing, doesn't it? Is Bowser really that good at stealing princesses? Did some witch, demon, or dark god(s) put a curse on her? Does Bowser call in advance to tell he's coming to kidnap her? Point is, it's like anything can kidnap her. <b>Anything.</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm almost willing to wager that if someone else kidnapped her, besides Bowser or the rare new villain if the big turtle isn't around, there's four outcomes. A) It would disrupt the cosmic balance of the universe. B) Mario and Bowser's reactions would be priceless. C) One of them would fight the other so the loser doesn't get to the princess first. Or D) They would both team up to get their princess back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where you come in. You are a non-toad resident of the Mushroom Kingdom that dabbles in science from time to time, and you're fed up!

Something has to be done.  It's time for a change in leadership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have what I need now,\" you said putting what you need for your plan. \"If Bowser can kidnap the Princess, so can I,\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to use?</span></div></div>",

The ability to breathe fire, some black magic, and an army.  And an undying desire to kidnap the Princess. That's one thing you like about Bowser. He can actually lead, his people doesn't cower when some enemy kingdom comes knocking on the door, and he has determination. But it makes no sense about how he won't give up. Is he really that obsessed with Peach? What does he see in her? He he in love with her? They're not even the same species (you're not entirely sure if Peach is a human, or just another Toad), but you wouldn't judge. If he didn't always bring his boys with him to wreck things up. You have heard that Peach does have some magic powers, so that makes sense. Bowser's a wizard, he'd probably like to make himself stronger. Or is this just something to keep Mario in shape if something worse than Bowser arrives? You don't know, but you'll just have to go on the assumption that the turtle crafted the rumor that's he's in love with Peach to gain sympathy and supporters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood outside Princess Peach's throne room, and got ready to enter it.

With the war over, you find your reputation spreading across the galaxy. Now, as a hero of the war, you find women of all races throwing themselves at you. Building a harem should be an easy task when they are practically begging for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSole Survivor: You were a top Cerberus agent, with the Illusive Man himself praising your ability to dominate and torture information from captives. You were working at Cerberus HQ on the day Commander Shepard attacked. Finding an escape pod, you managed to slip away during the battle and escape into the galaxy at large to hide until the Reaper War was over. Now with your training and skills, the women of the galaxy are yours for the taking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthless: You were a scavenger after that battle of Earth. You needed something to make it big in the galaxy. Then, inside the body of a destroyed Reaper, you find something interesting. You didn't know what it was at first, but after touching it, it seemed to... absorb into you. Only later did you figure out that this was actually the Reaper indoctrination ability, and you body was able to absorb it through your omni-tool.

Let's talk about how you'll add the ladies of Homestuck into your harem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: The Lord of Heart + a juju: Once upon a time in a universe different from the Trolls and kids' you and a few friends played the game Sburb, and by some odd chance you were among the few in Paradox Space destined for one of the master classes, and your aspect was heart. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">As the choice title says.</span> As all Lords must endure to progress your personal journey was filled with extreme suffering which required a Herculean effort to overcome. Which you did by the way. Yay you. You are also the only survivor from your session. Through the incredibly questionable and downright reckless choices made in prototyping an especially powerful Black King was waiting for you and your friends at the end, standing between you and The Ultimate Reward. To make a long story short he was an ungodly motherfugger that gave even you, a God Tier Lord of Heart, a mind numbingly difficult time, and it was nothing short of a <span class=\"cgrape\">miracle</span> that you killed him let alone lived to tell the tale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix years after entering the universe created by that session you have grown bored, and there's a lust filled hole in your heart only a harem can fill. By a stroke of luck, you come across the Treasure juju John and the MSPA Reader use to gain their zapping around time and space power. You can see where I'm going here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what can a Lord of Heart do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe don't have a lot of examples of Lords in canon, let alone a Lord of Heart(emotions/soul/inner self), since the only one being Caliborn/Lord English who is presumably stronger than your \"average\" Lord due to being a cherub, absorbed the energy of his God Tier clock, and became a fusion of five different people with different classes and aspects. To make this chapter was less wordy just go with this analysis of it<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://god-tier-analyzer.tumblr.com/post/81984586573/oh-oh-i-noticed-you-have-done-a-few-analysis-of\" target=\"_blank\">https://god-tier-analyzer.tumblr.com/pos...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTD:R : \"-He can manipulate emotions on a cosmic scale, which can range from making people fall in love forever, or causing the most painful heartbreak in the universe, a feeling no one ever wants to feel. He can also manifest his soul into a powerful cosmic weapon, as well as manipulate, steal and destroy others souls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you've payed attention long enough for this that's how you're going to enslave them. By manipulation of their hearts and souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: Some other method: Continue going through any other ideas you might have if the first one isn't to your liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: The Wake Up with the harem option: So you don't like the idea of enslaving and just want to wake up with a harem like some dude waking up and being served on butler island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And located on that planet in one of the more remote areas is a large Victorian style green and dark pink mansion that is empty save for one occupant. Who is it? Why it's you, Anon, the Lord of Heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are currently in the master bedroom, aka your room, dressed in a bathrobe that matches the color of your aspect, in your desk chair using your GIBSONTOP, a laptop that bears the visage of Mel Gibson much like John's Crosbytop did for Bill Crosby. To the right of you is a red cane with a heart ornament on top. It is your HEARTCANE, one of your most powerful weapons, and perfect for someone of your class. You have recently returned from exploring some of the universe created by you and your friends, but whatever you were looking for you were unable to find. What will you do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinue to click \"refresh\" on your favorite website, and hope see if maybe the hiatus of the creator of your favorite webcomic is over. You irritably click on \"Refresh\" over and over, knowing that the result will be the same as the last attempt. It does occur to you maybe it won't ever get updated considering everyone on your version of Earth died when the meteors came crashing down, but knowing the weird time shenanigans of Paradox Space you still have a little hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose patience with the site, exiting the tab, and begin contemplating whether or not to watch one of the perverted HAREM ANIMES you have downloaded on your laptop. How you love anime and the idea of being a lord of a harem of beauties dedicated to catering to your every whim and carnal craving. One of your favorite animes was one where the main character started out as a young prince who became king of a war ravaged kingdom, and ended up as a conqueror of the opposing empire full of witches led by an empress who were hot as they were evil. You loved how he put them all in their place as he made them his harem girls. That show helped the six years younger you through puberty, and proved to be therapeutic for stress you gained during the path to godhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to hold off on watching anime, you have a far more important task than watching anime at the moment. Figuring out where the flying heck your gang of leprechauns are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all other Lords you gained a group of leprechauns to serve you with powers or own jujus that possess powers based the aspect of the Lord they serve. In your case, Heart, their abilities revolve around emotions, souls, and a one's inner self. Or their items do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not entirely sure where they are, but you have a suspicion they're off getting into fights with the local Carapacians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you think about the chess people fighting with your green men you catch the sight of a Prospitian dressed in a mailman's uniform in the corner of your right eye heading towards your humble abode. Looks like it's fairly heavy judging by the the way he's struggling. You probably ought to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delivery man collapses on the steps of your manor exhausted after days of lugging around parcel. He doesn't even hear you open the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I need to sign anything?\" You say, receiving no reply. He's out like a light. Wow. This guy busted his back carrying a treasure chest covered in an excessive amount of locks and chains for you, and didn't even get down in time to help him out. You feel like a total dick now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring the chest and mailman inside, putting the latter on a couch in the living room, and then proceeded to cut off the chains with a cutter stored away in the tool room. Once the box was less covered  you found a folded note on top of it which might be useful in determining the nature of the contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Boss, we struck gold when you were away. We have no idea what this bad boy can do, but we know a juju when we see one. Signed, Eros.\" You read off. Eros is one of your leprechauns, and one of the ones you trust the most.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If there is a lesson about touching strange objects of great and unknown power you definitely learned it the hard way. All you remember was a brief moment of pain and flashing light before you're zapped around various unknown places that you've never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first location was above a balcony where man without lips covered in grey paint with fake looking horns, and a white wig wearing a green suit fearfully clutching a wand defensively against the Jolly Green Giant staring him down with a massive golden rifle. If the Jolly Green Giant stopped being jolly, took up the usage of steroids, and had a skull for a face with pool ball eyes. Oh, and a golden peg leg that was doing the same rainbow glow the oversized coat and gun of his were doing. Talk about tacky. Even if you wanted to you cannot save the lipless man from being shot to death by the hulking monster as the same force that brought you here drags you away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour next location was a room that is clearly at Derse, Kingdom of Darkness judging by the architecture and the extreme amount of purple all over the place. It probably isn't the one from your session as this place is far too intact compared to the way your Derse was left. You turn your head over the sounds of a struggle to see something that only confuses you more, but answers one question. This definitely isn't at any point in time your Derse. It was easy to deduce that on account of a winged one arm Black Queen dressed in harlequin clothes with a mangled hat, a slashed eye, and tentacles was trying to force a Jack Noir into silly outfits. It actually makes you miss the Jack Noir from your session. Sure he was a stab happy jerk, but he was on the level. Things take a violent turn, you watch the archagent place the murdered monarch's ring on his own finger, and ascend until you're zapped out of here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are then taken to more random places after that. From the rooftop on an apartment being used as a training ground for apparently rapping roof ninjas, a jail cell on a Prospit where another Jack Noir was currently bashing the head of an already dead knife ridden burly Prospitian into the the cell door, and then the Skaian battlefield where the Black King from the first session you poofed into commands his army in massive prototyped form. This King actually looks less intimidating than the way yours did with the harlequin clothes and one arm and all. You certainly wouldn't mind taking a crack at another version of him, but it seems a coalition of soldiers from both armies led by a purple cloth wearing Dersite carrying a makeshift red banner march towards the black tyrant want the first crack at him. More power to them. They look like they have an extensive list of grievances with them the King was not prepared for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these lists shall be undelivered and unheard as the first Jack Noir you saw in this zapping trip across canon descends from the sky, destroying the King's specter and beheading him in his depowered state. Something tells you this is going to end poorly. Before you're dragged away to another location you see that feeling to be correct. You witness indiscriminate destruction at the hand of Noir, and not even his fellow Dersites are spared from his rampage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you believe you have learned to control this newfound ability of yours. You close your eyes, and end up in a mostly snow covered forest that is slowly becoming greener as the snow melts. It's still too cold for you given you are still in your bathroom. But thankfully a perk of reaching the god tier is the ability to swap your current outfit for your god tier clothes. That's much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the menacing growl of a dog moments from attacking behind you, and guess what? It's that same Jack Noir from earlier. Only this time he lost the hat and tentacles, but became a dog man with green lightning powers? What's with this guy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he can presumably stab you to death with his blade a girl who is at least six years younger than you wearing a green dress that surely can't be suitable for the cold quickly steps in between you and Jack.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Bad Jack! Bad boy!\" She chastises the murderous Carapacian as if he was a disobedient pet. What's hilariously shocking is that it actually works! Noir stands down, his ears lowered as if he was a dog knowing he's in trouble with his owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around to face you wearing a relieved expression. She's kinda cute with those green eyes of hers hiding behind her glasses and her long black hair. \"Sorry about that. He can be a handful to deal with.\" She says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally a chance to interact with another human being after six long years! You're not going to let this go to waste. Or so you think until you feel that another zapping coming along. You try to stop it, but fail to control this power much to your growing frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Hell no! You are the freaking LORD of Heart, act like it and tell this power to fall in line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Fail! Enjoy the continuing trip<br>\r\nOption #2: You successfully zap back to Jade, but an older one with dog ears on a golden battleship<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your mother isn't around and you miss her. One day you get your own fairy godparent, and who knows where that will lead. But since you know the title of this story, you shouldn't have to use your imagination. <br>\r\nSo here's the information you need to know about the sister, and your fairy godmother. <br>\r\nYour godmother's name is Cietro, she is one of those fairies that have a body like the Tooth Fairy. She wears an outfit like the one Jessica Rabbit wears, but does not have the body of Mrs. Rabbit. She has black hair.  She has a DD chest, and a butt that isn't that impressive, but still could be worthy of the \"Dat a$$\" meme. Personality: She has a thing for young boys, and is a bit of a seductress like Blair from Soul Eater and Rangiku from Bleach. Meaning she'd put her boobs in people's faces, mainly her god child. She has a fetish about serving people, but also likes to be pampered. She also never had sex before, and is a bit nervous to. She might be a seductress, but she's a bit scared to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister: Her name is Candice. She is a she's a geeky gamer girl nerd. She has c-cup breasts, but has a nice, big fat jiggly butt that she is proud of and likkes it being messed with. She would like a bigger chest, but is okay with her's. She's a bit mild mannered, and has a will to match. She might be smart, but she'd fall under mind control pretty easy. She tries to be a mother figure for the RC, since she's not around, while still being his sister. She is a bit of a sex-postive feminist too, and cannot handle pressure too well. So if the RC had some sort of enslavement pheromones, it would not take long for her to crack. Wears white jeans, and a blue top. She loves to play video games and likes to play with mods, and maybe make her own. Her friends call her a bimbo shoutacon as a joke due to one bad mishap that gets on her nerves. She claims to still be a virgin, and on her word, even though she has never had sex before she would love to hotdog a guy.  You get to decide if she still is a virgin, and what previously bad mishap was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here's your choices to meet Cietro:<br>\r\nDuring the day after you get back from school.<br>\r\nOr the second option where you meet her during the night while Candice is taking a bath. </span></div></div>",

This option will take place before the Fall of Beacon, but you can take some liberties and go about a storyline that is completely different. 2nd option can be anything you want. You could be the kang of all hobos who got into some dust that will give you mind control powers or a magic book for all I care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeapon for the Student at Beacon storyline: a halberd with an attached gun that can transform into an ax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSemblance: M\u00e1ti kai Fil\u00ed(Eye and Kiss). Much like how a vampire has the ability to put people under a trance, you too can do this so long as only as it's a woman and she looks into your left eye. To avoid many problems you normally cover the eye with an eyepatch. To seal the deal on your target you must engage in a deep kiss, exchanging your saliva with them. Once that is done, the girl will become fanatically devoted to you while retaining her original personality. <br>\r\nExtras: 1: you can change your target's personality so long as you offer some suggestions before the kiss.<br>\r\n2: It doesn't work instantaneously in some cases. It all depends on how your target feels about you beforehand, how strong their will is, and their current state. One kiss will not work on Weiss, Blake, Glynda, or Cinder for example. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGot it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>New changes</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #3: The straight shouta storyline. Similar to the first option and Zone(who's been a great help for this story) background you are a student at Beacon who lost two of your teammates during the breach while the other one got taken home by their parents? The difference between this one and the first option? You are a kid again. Your semblance \"Irresistible Youth\" awakens, putting you in the 10-11 year old range physically. \"But how does that help me get a harem?\" Your semblance gives you an irresistible aura that awakens maternal instincts in women, making them want to pamper you with affection and do anything you say till you're happy. It is semi-passive so you will have to work hard on certain <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Cinder</span> ladies who aren't that affectionate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Didn't know why I failed to do this with the last update here here I go.</span><br>\r\nOption #4: Atlasian Changer of Flesh: you are a student at the Atlas Academy that signed onto an experiment by the military designed to unlock and enchance semblances. To your surprise it was a success. Here's what your semblance does: Changer of Flesh: allows you to tinker with the bodies through your aura. You can toy with someone's hormones to make them horny when they see you. Or you could maybe make a girl curvier once your semblance matures and you pump them with enough aura. Set before the Fall of Beacon for convenience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #5: You are marked by dark fates. You crave nothing but more choices. This will never end<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only one useable eye to look out of.\" You point to where your eyepatch ought to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tills her head quizzically and looks into your eyes. Both of them look fine to her what are you talking about? Especially the left one which is very hard to not look at in Ruby's mind. It's just so entrancing and making her light headed. She can't turn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just occurred to you that you can see the out of both your eyes, and all you see now is a Ruby Rose who's silver eyes are dulled and seems completely out of touch of the world around her save for you. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust great. You kneel down to pick up your eyepatch off the ground where you discovered it had been cut, and somehow stayed on long enough before Ruby bumped into you. It must have happened during your training session, and how Crescent Rose managed to only cut your eyepatch is nothing short of luck. You take a good look at Ruby, really studying her. who is remains enthralled by you even if it was accidental. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby is at least a year or two younger than you. You can see the resemblance to her older sister Yang, a girl with a body you cannot deny in good faith your desire to explore for yourself, but it's not entirely there. Ruby and Yang must be only half-sisters and you can only guess which parent is the one they share. She's still cute to you. Maybe she can be a cute guinea pig for you too. After all learning the limits of your semblance is something you've been curious about lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ruby,\" you say as you move a finger in front of her face to see if her heavy eyes will follow. Then don't by the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" She slowly asks in a monotone voice, sounding more like a mindless drone than someone with free will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go back to my room? I mean, if you're free at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have time to spare,\" said your test subject of questionable willingness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you leave the hallway before anyone else can get an eyeful the way Ruby did to prevent any possible headaches. And you debate over which path to take with Ruby. The trance's strength varies from person to person right down to how they feel about you and how strong their will is. You wouldn't say Ruby is weak willed, but it's obvious she's a simple soul which isn't a bad thing of course. And judging on from what you've seen she's sort of socially awkward which may or may not help you in the long run. But you will certainly keep it in mind when figuring out what you can and can't do with Ruby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe some suggestive conditioning will be a good start with her. Or you could figure out just how devoted Ruby will be to you if you go full force with the final part of your semblance. Share a few minutes long French kiss full of saliva exchanging with her. You can always put her under a trance again if you feel like changing her personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Go easy and try giving her suggestions<br>\r\nOption #2: Go full force and ensnare her </span></div></div>",

Sure enough she moved her head, and her eyes landed directly on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang examines you before letting off a small grin and whispering something in Ruby's ear that caused her to look more embarrassed.

Why go through a tedious process where you'll have to slowly influence Ruby over time you tell yourself. Especially when she is in your room right now, and you can cut to the chase with just one salvia swapping session. Not worrying about anyone catching you having a mind control session with her out in the middle of a hallway or room is also something you can avoid as well. Forget being labeled as a creep or being expelled from Beacon if that happens. What Ruby's older sister will do to you makes fighting a Nevermore barehanded seem more preferable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ruby,\" you say to the mostly unwilling guest to your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you reply to her you take another good look at her. You are more into girls with bigger curves like Yang or Goodwitch, but Ruby's body isn't necessarily unattractive. Maybe in a few years she'll develop more similarly into Yang's body type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does occur to you that you are about to throw a Beowulf sized wrench into this girl's life if you go through with this. You have talked to Ruby before a few times. All she aspires to be in life is a huntress, and here you are moments away from potentially turning her into a slave. Your slave. Will you even stop at her? Will you turn your mesmerizing gaze on her friends and teammates?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute. There's no need for you to be mulling over this. Just create yourself a battle-harem full of huntresses. Maintaining world peace and casting down the forces of evil by day, servicing you by night. Yes. Hell motherfugging yes. And with one sexy and awesome thought you just got rid of all your fomenting internal conflict. Pat yourself on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever. you probably need to be more strategic about this, and plan ahead. Start your harem out small. Four to five girls. The rest of Team RWBY will do just fine. And you especially need to be careful in regards of certain activities. Getting your girls pregnant while you're still a student at Beacon is a very stupid idea. Angry parents and Professor Ozpin will presumably not enjoy your explanation as to why their daughters and his faculty members are now pregnant, kicked out of school, and calling you \"Master.\" You want kids but you also want to get your Huntsman license. You also want to avoid birth control pills. You've recently read an article about how those things end up messing with women's hormones quite negatively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll think of something when you cross that bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever kissed a guy before? No, giving your dad a peck on the cheek doesn't count.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. These lips have never made contact with anyone else's before.\" She answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's about to change. I'm going to give you a nice-\" as you say that Ruby starts to shake meaning you found something she's going to be uncomfortable with. Nice going doing this with a socially awkward girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Ruby an eyeful and attempt to reassure the enthralled girl she has nothing to worry about. The both of you will enjoy this. You probably ought take it slow with her just to be safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby trembles as her lips pucker up and you take your time to press your own upon hers. So far so good. Your tongue creeps out and passes through into her mouth, the shaking intensifies some. As your salvia begins to enter her mouth you finally find her tongue. Might as well make this special for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minute your tongues wrap around the others the scythe wielding girl shakes hard enough you start to worry this is going to end very poorly for you. Goodbye Beacon and hello Yang's fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to break the kiss, but to your surprise Ruby pulls you back in. You heard a cute little moan out of her too. She's enjoying it more than you imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally chuckle. By the time you're done Ruby Rose is going to be all yours. Heart, body and soul. She probably is at this point. The two of you break apart for a breather, and her eyes slowly regain their color. You turn around to get a spare eyepatch to cover your eye. You're out of aura now so no more hypno sessions until you grow stronger at using your semblance. Ruby still has that out of it look, and you wonder if you fried her brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat prospect flew out of the window upon you asking her about the mechanics of Crescent Rose, and Ruby returns to her usual self when weapons are involved. You're going to love spending the rest of your life with this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: Talk with your new devoted slave. Give her the reason why your room is so barebones and why you're team-less. Or go play video games with her. Whatever comes first.<br>\r\nOption #2: It sure would be bad if someone barraged into your room after looking for Ruby and saw her enter your room. Especially since if you can't use your semblance on them now. But you're a smart guy right? You can totally talk your way out of this hypothetical situation, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

First thing: help me out on finding certain girls to use my semblance on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tilts her head quizzically. \"Why would you want to do that, Master? What does your semblance do exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call it \"M\u00e1ti kai Fil\u00ed\". It's why I need these eyepatches on,\" you point to the eyepatch you're currently wearing. \"Anyone who sees my left eye is placed under a hypnotized state where I can give them little suggestions that affect their personalities if I so choose to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your semblance is mind control? Not really much of a good guy ability, but still kinda cool.\" Said Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me. I wish it was regular hypnosis and not this. Getting used to these patches drove me crazy,\" you grumbled. \"But that's not all it does.\" You finish explaining to your slave how you can make your target devoted to you if you can place some of your saliva into their mouth, and how it really depends on the strength of their will power and how they feel about you beforehand. Ruby can see why you preferred regular mind control over all that work now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also doesn't show any particular signs of enjoying the prospect of joining you on this endeavor; however, what choice does she have now that she's devoted to you? Ruby might still be Ruby but she will follow you anywhere now. You tell her since she is the first member of your soon to be expanding harem she gets to be the head girl which confuses her to a degree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be to me what Professor Goodwitch is to Professor Ozpin. You get it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I get it.\" She coughs before doing her best Goodwitch impression she can manage getting a laugh out of you. Not too bad you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second thing I need help with. Mind helping me out?\" You asked. \"If I don't improve my skills I won't be able to stay at Beacon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you ask your team about this?\" Come to think of it your dorm seems to posses more than enough space to suit more than a mere one person. All that's in here are a few beds, books, and just you. Really activates her almonds when she thinks about it more. \"You do have a team right, Master?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mood turns quite dour, and you fall over onto a nearby bed. \"I lost two of them in that crazy breach. Grimm just started pouring out on the streets, and it's an absolute miracle we had our weapons with us. Not that it helped all that much. We got overrun, and two of us went down before Professor Port and Professor Goodwitch bailed out what was left us.\" You explained, the hopeless battle replaying in vivid detail all over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby  brings you back into reality, expressing her condolences and apologizes for asking about topic you hate thinking about. You sigh and finish your tale. \"The parents of my surviving teammate and friend came by and took him back home. As you can see, Team A isn't really effective when there's only one person as the \"A\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you tried getting into a new team, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've tried, but there aren't many openings at the moment. I can get moved to a team if I impress Professor Ozpin enough though. So there's that.\" You rise off the bed with a less down in the dumps look. \"I just want to know what happened that day, you know? It really feels like someone was behind it.\" You turn to her, and it almost looks like Ruby knows more about the breach than you think. Maybe she and her gang got trapped in that too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby starts telling you of how her went on a trip with Oobleck a few days ago, ending up in a fight with the militant faunus group called the White Fang and a criminal named Torchwick who they've been dealing with for a some time now. While her story is certainly fascinating you were going to stop and ask in the middle of what this had to do with your predicament. Until Ruby placed the blame for the breach upon the Fang and Torchwick. That got you really interested and really in the mood for some payback. She then tells you last saw Torchwick being taken into custody. Time for you to get more creative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, this Torchwick guy didn't happen to have any girls as cute as you hanging around him did he?\" You ask with some evil intent in your visible eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was that one,\" Ruby says, trying to remember the name of Roman's sidekick that aided him during one bout they had. \"I think he called her \"Neo\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neo, huh? Can't wait to meet her.\" You lost two of your friends because this guy did so you're going to take his Neo. Ruby advised you to be cautious in that regards. Something about this Neo girl gave Yang a hard time during that train brawl. That will require some more planning out now that you think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevenge plots aside what will you do now?<br>\r\nOption 1: Do something nice for Ruby since she's the first member of your harem. Might as well since you're now stuck with her<br>\r\nOption #2: Skip to the next day</span></div></div>",

Lousy semblance. You made a mental note as you hastily dressed yourself this morning to take it easier with any potential targets of yours in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, you are writing down anything you deem important from Professor Goodwitch's mouth on your notebook as the lecture continues. It's not that difficult anymore since you read books on becoming a better note taker. At least you think so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou definitely will not try your hand at using your semblance on the instructor any time soon. Glynda might be very attractive for her age, but you prefer not receiving the boot out of Beacon. Still, the idea of using her riding crop on her one day is quite tantalizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used your uncovered eye to look around the room and it landed on the first member of your harem. Busy writing down her own notes like a good student Ruby fails to notice your attention. You wonder if she has any ideas on who to use your eye on next, or if she'll leave that in your purview. Most likely she will. You do not believe Ruby has a knack for that. You do however believe today might be a good day for you to hone your skills through a training session with her. Taking notes in class does not help in thinning the horde of grimm in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou divert your eye to the individual next to Ruby, a girl with an air of elegance you find very alluring. Even the scarred left eye of Weiss Schnee adds to her charm. You don't really know too much about Weiss herself beyond the fact she's the granddaughter of the founder of the SDC, Nicholas Schnee, and she's a talented student at this academy. You are curious about who Weiss really is, and what kind of possibilities your touch can have with her. The Schnee Dust Company's website provided you very little information on her when you did a report on her grandfather for one of your classes. You swear a company as wealthy as her family's could clearly afford better website designers too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" Your thoughts regarding Weiss and poor website designs are interrupted by an expecting Goodwitch who noticed you may have stopped paying attention to the lecture. \"Mr. Anon, could you possibly tell the class what the semblance of the most notorious war criminal of the Great War was?\" She asked, putting you on the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well,\" you mutter trying to remember the answer without looking at your notes. \"His semblance allowed him to create wings out of his aura?\" You answered unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the class you paid attention on her lecture and focused less on what you're going to do afterwards. Which by the way, your time here is done. What will you do now?    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I apparently now have an upgraded account there will be five options. <br>\r\nOption #1: go practice with Ruby.

Whenever you daydream or are bored, you\u2019re going to think of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhenever bored, will think of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, think of me.\u201d You pressed on. It was important to keep him in her thoughts to weaken any resistance. \u201cEvery day, you think of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery day I think of you.\u201d Blake repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt night, you might even have erotic dreams.\u201d You pushed. This was a risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt night\u2026 I\u2019ll have\u2026 what?\u201d her tone started to gain a little of her own personality back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax,\u201d You tell her and you saw her shoulders slack a little. \u201cit\u2019s only natural to imagine Ninja of Love scenes.

Well besides Blake breaking out of her trance, beating you up, and telling everyone you're a creep who tries to mind control people. Other than that no harm at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to know more about you, Blake.\" You say to the enthralled girl. You think getting her to talk about the more private details of her life would be a great start before you attempt more risque ideas. \"But let's take this to somewhere more private, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly nods her head before giving you a less than lively \"Sure\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you leave the more crowded area, and head for a better place for you to get a girl under a trance to spill her guts to you. If such a place really existed. You decide to grab Blake's left hand to see how she reacts, and it appears she doesn't seem poised to return to normal. What would happen if you get more physical than mere hand holding?   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou use your other hand to wrap around Blake's waist and she stops in her tracks. She shakes slightly, her eyes slowly become less dull with life returning to them. Yep. That's a tell tale sign you found something to make Blake uncomfortable enough for the trance to show fracturing. You give her another dose of M\u00e1ti kai Fil\u00ed to stop the shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright, Blake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes return the dullness they previously were earlier. Maybe a little duller, and she starts mouthing words without actually saying anything. You certainly hope you don't end up frying Blake's brain until she's a drooling vegetable for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... fine.\" She replies to your relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you find an empty classroom that was left unlocked to provide you with your private place. How thoughtful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Blake. Is there anything you're embarrassed about?\" You asked the dull eyed girl. \"That wasn't really a good way of phrasing it. Is there anything you don't want most people outside your little group of friends and family to know about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes her a while to answer you, the shaking returns, and color begins to return to her eyes before going back to their entranced state. But you get something out of her. \"I'm a faunus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really you? I'm not seeing it. Mind sharing with the class your proof?\" Blake reaches for her hair ribbon, taking it off to reveal a pair of black cat ears that were previously hidden by the bow. \"I think they're kinda nice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask her if there's anything else she has any other secrets under wraps that she will gladly share with the rest of the class again. What you got was a story of her time in the White Fang, what you've heard and were led to believe is a terrorist organization full of faunus who decided that militant violence is the only way to get their kind respected. You're not entirely sure what to say about that. Blake doesn't really give off that kind of vibe to you, and she also did say she left because of the Fang's gradual increase of violence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, you move on to another push. Playing with Blake's cat ears. She gives off some shaking but it also looks like she's enjoying it. Time to bust out the big guns. Your hands move further south, towards Blake's chest, and you cup her breasts. She shakes harder than before causing you to end your short lived groping session but not before you give her another eyefull of your left eye. On one hand you found your limit with Blake, something she clearly enjoyed as much as you playing with her ears if not a little more. Now what will you do?</span></div></div>",

You got to play with her cat ears, tried to feel her up, and gained more understanding about this girl's life. Fairly successful if you had to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake is going to be your kitty and nothing is going to stop that. But you are going to need to slow walk her into that. Her will is a tad bit too strong for you to enslave outright and making her your number one fangirl, plus doing so might actually fry her brain as you're worried about. However, you will give your kitty a touch of conditioning to make it easier for you to finish the job. Something simple and not overtly drastic the way making her a sex fiend or a yandere as those would raise some questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake, listen to me. From now on you're going to enjoy my company more, and want to hang out with me more. Got it?\" You were halfway tempted to add she will be more brave about exposing her faunus heritage, but you thought at the last minute that's something Blake needs to do on her own eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods her head affirmatively. Excellent. You surprise the enthralled girl with a quick kiss planted in her lips, sending enough of your saliva is placed in her mouth to get the conditioning to work. She predictably shakes but that subsided rather quickly. You play with the ears of your new kitty one last time before you have her hide them away with her bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you are in the hallway where you put your eyepatch back on, and Blake returns to normal mildly confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't where-\" Blake clutched at her head in pain. You sure do hope she didn't get brain damage because of you. Another highlight of today: if Blake is going to be the standard for most strong willed girls three usages of your semblance is completely unnecessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to take you to the nurse's office?\" You ask with concern in your voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake smiles. \"Yeah, that would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your kitty to the vet, you mean nurse's office and say goodbye for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day wasn't too eventful. Boring classes, did a little sparring with other students, and watched one of your favorite persons here at  tussle in the ring after you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora Valkyrie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora certainly is an interesting girl you have to say. You could watch her just be herself for hours, you often wonder what you could do if you had some of her energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough what happened in the ring ought to have been against the rules of Beacon. Though it would be hard to make ignorance against the rules you think. The poor sap who sparred with her had a Lightning semblance and used it on her with no prior knowledge about what electricity does to Nora. And kept using it on her and she fell on the ground laughing and saying his lightning tickled. You wonder when he's going to be able to regret his decision. After he's able to walk properly again no doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do now?<br>\r\nOption #1: Try your hand at Nora<br>\r\nOption #2: Turn in for the day, get a surprise visit from your kitty at three in the morning <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There wasn\u2019t any shaking this time, but you noticed there was a little shivering from excitement. Then you heard a sound coming from her throat. It was a purr. She was purring. Maybe the cat traits in her were a little stronger than normal. For whatever reason, you found it cute. You had to have her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake, I\u2019m going to kiss you.\u201d You tell her and you saw her body begin to stiffen. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be afraid. It\u2019s going to feel good, just like me playing with your ears. You want it. Trust me.\u201d You gave her another dose of your Semblence.

When she puckered up her own lips, you froze. There was one other thing you wanted to add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome other girls may need my help overcoming troubles too,\u201d you tell her. \u201cSo there\u2019s no need to get jealous if you see me with another girl. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes.\u201d Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You laughed internally and finally kissed her. Your lips and hers melded together. She tasted fruity, but you couldn\u2019t tell what kind. Working your tongue forward, you separated her lips so you could get your saliva in her mouth. Making sure to put plenty in there, it took time to break the kiss. You took a step back and let her stand there, seemingly stuck in the kissing pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap.\u201d You were worried you might have overloaded her brain. However, you notice her slowly going back to normal. Now that you had kissed her, she should be devoted to you. If her will was to strong, it probably wasn\u2019t a good idea to stick around. You decided to head out and if it worked, she would find you. \u201cBye, Blake. I hope to see you soon.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You got to class early and sat down. Other people began to stumble in and you saw Blake enter. She met your eyes, smiled, and waved. You gave a small wave back and then saw Blake\u2019s partner, a blonde named Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat girl was hot and had some of the biggest breasts in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe obviously notice your and Blake\u2019s actions so when she sat down, she was whispering excitedly to Blake. Blake tried to ignore her and focus on her book. You snickered and waited for class to begin. Glynda started off with a fight that seemed to happen frantically. Jaune versus Cardin. Jaune was a nice guy, though his combat skills were really subpar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin was just an asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bullied Faunus and anyone he thought weaker than him.

You were often surprised Jaune could block it as much as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the fight, while most people\u2019s eyes were on the fight, you noticed Blake glancing back at you. When you caught her eyes once, you smiled and swore you saw her normal stoic face blush. That was good news for you. It meant your power stuck and Blake was probably thinking of their conversation and the desire she had of him touching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJob well done for one short session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight ended and then Glynda called you up as Jaune and Cardin went back to the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour opponent was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Weiss was a skilled Dust Mage and had physical abilities to boost, PLUS her glyphs which could alter the field in unpredictable ways. This wasn\u2019t going to be good for you, but maybe Glynda was putting you against superior opponents on purpose just to pus you. That thought kept you going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight began and Weiss jabbed forward. You jumped back, putting distance between you and striking back with your halberd. She parried it easily enough and send a wave of ice at you. Ice Dust she kept stock in her weapon. You jumped to the side and fired a bullet at her. She jumped to the side and used the ice to block you. Suddenly, a torrent of fire erupted from a space in between and you just managed to avoid being cooked alive. You turned your weapon into a pair of axes, the nice thing about having a large weapon it could break down into more, and charged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped over the ice and delivered a swipe down at Weiss. She used the rapier to block it, a bored look on her face. Your second axe came down with determination to make her at least try, when a glyph appeared between you. It turned black and blew your back. Landing on your back, Weiss pelted forward and continued to jab you while you were defenseless. You shot a bullet at her leg, which temporarily unbalanced her and the slashed at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled away and sent another wave of ice at you.

It was like she was a porcelain doll. She was also quite talented. However, her attitude could use some work. The problem was you didn\u2019t have much time until Glynda questioned where you were.

You wish you could hurry her up without potentially ending the trance, and before someone, mainly Goodwitch, comes in and sees this little show you're conducting. The second phase of your plan greatly depends on this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is to say you are going to put her underwear some place very public where she will eventually find them.

If we make this a meeting spot, we could start a book club or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVelvet?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a rabbit Faunus in our history class,\u201d Blake reminded him. \u201cKind of quiet, but belongs to a second year team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d You suddenly remembered that quiet girl who didn\u2019t like to draw attention to herself. She was kind of cute and you made a mental note to see if you could get her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have an impressive selection,\u201d Blake complimented. \u201cI\u2019ve read these two series and started this one. Haven\u2019t heard of this one. Is it any good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d You squatted down next to her. \u201cOh yeah. Since you liked The Man with Two Souls I think you would like this. It goes into questions of the mind, though there are some rather\u2026 descriptive sections in there when they try to find out if pleasure of the body can surpass pleasures of the mind.\u201d You reached out to show her the book at the same time she reached out to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands touched and she looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news was she didn\u2019t draw them away immediately. Her cheeks even turned slightly red. It seems your previous commands that she enjoyed physical contact were solidly implanted. That mean you could progress to the next stage. The trick was to get Blake to trust you. It lowered her mental barriers. You were the one who removed your hand and handed her the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can barrow it and if you like it, feel free to borrow the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Blake said, clutching it to her chest. \u201cI\u2019ll take good care of it. Though, I think I\u2019m going to finish this book first. I just got to the climax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel free to use any of those three beds.\u201d You offer. \u201cNo one\u2019s used them for weeks.\u201d Blake accepted your offer and sat down to begin reading. You took one of your books and began reading too. An hour passed before you looked up when Blake moved. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy backs been bothering me,\u201d Blake answered. \u201cI\u2019ve been taking it easy, but I can\u2019t avoid training for too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant me to try massaging it?\u201d You asked. \u201cI\u2019m not a professional, but my sister says I\u2019m pretty good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake raised an eyebrow at you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blake looked contemplated for a second and she rubbed her arm with one hand a little nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d She finally said to your surprise. Maybe your power affected her more deeply than you thought. \u201cShould I just lie on the bed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah.\u201d You stammered slightly. \u201cJust relax and I\u2019ll give you a massage.

Slowly, you lowered your hands down and began feeling around her shoulders. It was standard to find where the knots were. You found a couple of them and began to work your hands down. When you hit a particularly big one, Blake jerked slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to stay still,\u201d you advised. \u201cOr I can\u2019t get at the problem areas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Blake mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued the massage, you noticed her shivering at your touch. Your previous orders about her feeling good when you touched her ran through your mind. This massage was probably making her incredibly aroused. Not only that, it was making her trust you, which would lower her resistance to your ability. You continued until you found a really big knot in her back. That was probably where she had the problems. You positioned yourself, and began to push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNyaaahh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze at the sound and Blake slammed a hand over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was-\u2026?\u201d You started to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing!\u201d Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOookay.\u201d You went back to work and you could swear you heard Blake purring happily. Not pushing that issues was the right thing to do. You worked the large knot out and stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDone.\u201d You stated. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sat up and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally good actually.\u201d She smiled at you and your felt your face blush. Blake was really beautiful. She hugged you before you could answer her. \u201cThe pains been bothering me for a while and I feel so much better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should still be careful.\u201d You tell her, noticing she hasn\u2019t stopped hugging you. She was actually rubbing against you a little. \u201cMassages aren\u2019t cure alls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will.\u201d Blake promised and finally let go. She actually seemed to be a little disappointed in doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was your chance. If you hit her now, you could probably turn her into your pet cat in heat. She would be yours forever.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You figured it was time to get the rest of their team under your control. Weiss\u2019 addiction was not solidified, so all you had to do now was transfer it from anything to just you. She would become addicted to you. Ruby was a little more difficult to decide on. She was one of the nicest girls at Beacon. Never swore, never insulted people unless they were really mean, and even then it was like dummy. Maybe you could make it so she loved her entire team being part of your harem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you have enough girls, it would be easy to rotate Huntress duties and sexual fun. You were not going to make them give up their dreams. Instead, those dreams would just include you. Stretching and feeling much better, you head down to the cafeteria to get some lunch. After that, you started roaming around Beacon, looking to run into either Weiss or Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, you caught Weiss leaving Glynda\u2019s office. She probably wanted to ask something about homework or a test. It was to risky to immediately enslave her here, You had to wait until she was away from others before calling out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss!\u201d You greeted, already having you eyepatch down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain?\u201d She sighed and turned around.

Liquid also works, like saliva to quench your thirst.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEww.\u201d Weiss shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d you assured her. \u201cIt will taste like the best thing in the world to you.\u201d She seemed to accept that and you were so glad your powers were growing. \u2018There is a catch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of catch?\u201d Weiss actually frowned. Seemed even deep down, she didn\u2019t like conditions. Her mind was much stronger than Yang\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to have my permission.\u201d You said. \u201cThat\u2019s all. A smart girl like yourself should be able to convince me easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I can.\u201d Weiss said, sounding pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember, like before. The longer you go without sucking, the worst that crazing gets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Will need to do it often.\u201d Weiss agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough, the bigger thing you suck, the longer it takes for cravings to come back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d Weiss murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, after I kiss you and leave, you will return to normal. Subconsciously knowing everything we talked about. You leaned forward and locked lips, making sure to have plenty of drool enter her mouth. You then broke contact and walked past her, leaving her standing there blank for a minute, before snapping back to her normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question for you now was what to do. It was probably best not to push your new strengthened powers too much now. Just in case you needed it later.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It actually took you longer to actually think, as you were distracted by the girl in front of you. Here was prim and proper Weiss, sitting on your bed, leaning toward you, and sucking on your finger like it was the most delicious treat in the world. Her eyes were half closed and her lips were pressed tightly against it. You could feel her tongue running along your fingers. Shameful as it was, you were getting turned on by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Least she wasn\u2019t biting this time. If you wanted to continue in the future, that was super important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 Weiss?\u201d You said, after several minutes of this. Her eyes opened and she looked at you. \u201cHow long do you need to do this? Won\u2019t others be worried about you?\u201d She blinked and looked thoughtful, though her sucking never stopped. Eventually, she opened her mouth and pulled back. Taking a handkerchief and daintily wiping her mouth, she finally responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may be right.\u201d She agreed. \u201cThank you for indulging me.\u201d She stood up. \u201cI expect I will return to do this again at some point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWeiss.\u201d You say again. \u201cYou do know I\u2019m dating Blake, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d Weiss sighed. \u201cI\u2026 may have to talk to her about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI can\u2019t keep doing this all the time,\u201d you add. \u201cI have my own life to live too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI will think of a way to reward you for taking time out to help me.\u2019 Weiss assured him. \u201cFor now, I will try not to interfere with your relationship with Blake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed before you realized what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dFor now?\u201d You murmured. \u201cHuh.

Guess turning her into an oral addict for Blake and I will be finished sooner than I thought.\u201d You suddenly remembered Yang. \u201cRight, have to find her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave your room and look around for Yang. However, you didn\u2019t have to look far. Yang was already heading toward your dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d she greeted. \u201cI saw Weiss leave. You free for a minute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSure. Come on in.\u201d You stepped back and let Yang into your room. Without asking, she sat down on the bed and leaned back. \u201cWhat did you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou and Blake,\u201d she started off. \u201cHow\u2019s that going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGood.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe mentioned she told you she\u2019s a Faunus.\u201d Yang continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah? I didn\u2019t really see it as a big deal. She\u2019s still Blake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cPhew\u2026 everyone was a little worried about when she would tell you and your reaction.\u201d Yang smiled. \u201cSoooooo,\u201d her eyes grew mischievous. \u201cHow far have you two gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cT-that\u2019s not really your business.\u201d You stammered, a little embarrassed. You were glad your early commands made her ignore seeing you mind control her friends. She seemed back to her normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang, and here I thought I would get to learn Blake\u2019s secret fetish.\u201d Yang sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me you fetish?\u201d You challenged, jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally want to know?\u201d Yang teased.</span></div></div>",

You needed to make sure Weiss and Ruby wouldn\u2019t freak out over Blake and Yang\u2019s antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be fun.\u201d Ruby pushed. \u201cWe have like, all of Sunday to do homework anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould a team leader be procrastinating?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you sound like Weiss!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both laughed and you took the chance to remove your eyepatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat-\u2026?\u201d Ruby trailed off as you made eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby,\u201d You said slowly. \u201cIf any of your team mates are acting weird that involves each other or me, you won\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just everyone being comfortable with each other to be themselves. That\u2019s a good thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d Ruby agreed. This was easy as long as you made it seem like it would help people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if they want to\u2026 let\u2019s say, suck fingers or be bossed around by each other, it\u2019s okay,\u201d You continued. \u201cIt makes everyone happy. You want them to be happy, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do.\u201d Ruby agreed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you could decide if you wanted to tweak her into some kind of girl for you as part of your harem. Blake was the sexy kitty girlfriend who loves physical contact, Yang would be the toy you and Blake can order around, and Weiss was going to be an oral addict who would eventually do anything to keep sucking a part of you. The question was, what would Ruby be? You liked her and didn\u2019t want to change her much. She was also a kickass Huntress and you know she should still be able to fulfill that role.</span></div></div>",

You dropped your eyepatch and waited until she snapped back to attention. Instead, you thought about her relationship with Jaune Arc. Everyone in their mother knew she had a thing for that guy. You actually felt kind of bad for Jaune, as it was obvious he couldn\u2019t see the signs. It was time to be a bro. The hallway was clear of people, so you had a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to be more honest with your feelings toward Jaune.\u201d You tell her. \u201cOr someone will take him away.

It took less than two seconds for Ruby to answer the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Anon!\u201d She said cheerfully. \u201cCome on in!\u201d She pulled you into the room before you had a chance to say anything. In the middle of the room, a small ground table where you can sit in the floor was set up with a couple games, along with some bags of chips and drinks. \u201cI assumed you wanted to sit next to Blake,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that would be fine.\u201d You replied, and sat down between Blake and Weiss.

Each person takes a kingdom or Menagerie and we build up, while fighting Grimm and each other.

Beacon students breaking them was a common enough occurrence the guy at the store was able to give you exactly what you needed. Only a screwdriver was needed when you got back.

It was late and you really should put the lock on your door. However, you didn\u2019t know how and Blake was supposed to help, but she must have forgot. Or was punishing you. Thinking how you could force her to do what you want by telling her, you didn\u2019t want to. It ruined the fun. Though, having a three way with her and Yang someday was something to look forward too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend some time researching how to put the lock on. A simple ten minute video showed you how and you actually got started removing the broken one. You were too tired and a little bit too lazy to put the new one on. It could wait until tomorrow morning. Everyone already came and go as they pleased, so it didn\u2019t matter. You weren\u2019t getting any that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging, you plopped down into bed, cursing the fact it was a Sunday night. Maybe if you hadn\u2019t seen that movie, you might have had a shot. In all honesty, it was you trying to be funny and mentioned tuna breath. You made a mental note to stop doing that. How else were you going to get that sexy kitty in your bed? Sighing, you set your alarm for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda Goodwitch did not accept people skipping her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were falling asleep, you did feel a sense of pride about getting Jaune and Pyrrha together.

It seemed like your orders of addictions were becoming physical. This was something new. The mind was powerful and you realized you needed to fix this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Weiss,\u201d You tell her slowly. \u201cI\u2019m dating Blake and having another girl constantly sucking me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do anything.\u201d Weiss said, putting a hand over her heart. \u201cI\u2019ll take extra steps to amek sure Blake doesn\u2019t find out.

Now was the perfect time to condition her permanently. \u201cOkay, Weiss. I\u2019ll let you suck it this time.\u201d You acted like YOU were doing her a favor.

Your dick twitched at the touch and that seemed to embolden her. Slowly, she lowered her mouth over the head and gently pressed her lips shot. You took in a sharp breath as pleasure threaten to overwhelm you. She pushed your manhood deeper into her mouth and began to suck it gently, like a baby on a pacifier. She didn\u2019t really use her hands like Blake had done that one time. It was nice and you could blow your load if you wanted with a little time. Though, now was a perfect chance to turn her addiction from sucking into just wanting to be with you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When class finally finished, you pulled Blake aside to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Anon?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuick question,\u201d You replied and pulled the patch off your eye. She immediately went into a trance. \u201cListen, in the coming days, you may have girls come up to you with varying problems or issues that revolve them doing things with you and me, sexual and non sexual. You will be open to it. I don\u2019t want your personality to change, but you will be open to them joining us. Gaining a harem for me actually excites you, as long as you are the Alpha girl in charge.\u201d You finished the command with a deep kiss, one which Blake returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Sorry, I dozed off there for a moment.\u201d Blake told you, once you hit your eye away. \u201cWhat did you need?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanted to know if you were free tonight to hang out.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You weren\u2019t using your power. She was already yours. \u201cI you slack off in training, there\u2019s a chance you could gt injured on a mission. If you die, where will we be? Me, your team, your sister?\u201d Ruby looked at the ground. \u201cI lost my team once, I\u2019m not going to lose more people close to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Ruby said, lowering her head. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to be serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a time and place for everything.\u201d You say, before swatting her hard on the ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Ruby exclaimed, redding. \u201cThat felt nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike this?\u201d You reached up and pulled her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d Ruby moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight have some fun later with Blake,\u201d You tell her. \u201cShe\u2019s good at this kind of stuff.\u201d The two of you left the locker room and sat down with the others. Yang began whispering to Ruby and she was whispering back. Yang eventually looked at you and gave you a thumbs up.  Yang knew Ruby was going easy on you and Ruby must have told her you got mad at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass finally ended and you headed out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They are all supportive, but I wanted to tell you myself. Dating you, having someone like me regardless of my race, gave me that courage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt conflicted.

There was stiff some talking to be done. Though, being able to sleep with her every night was going to be great. Ruby was already up for the idea as in her words you all do \u2018sex stuff.\u2019 Yang was literally your toy and would do whatever you told her. Plus, living there meant you could play with her tits all the time. Then there was Weiss, who was addicted to sucking you off and no just being able to taste you in any way possible. If you were in the same room, she would naturally try to get you to let her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t wait to abuse that and make her do all sorts of things for the chance to give you a blowjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this power corrupting you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick shake of your head snapped you out of it. All guys wanted harems. You just had the best way to do it. There were other girls you had to work on too. Velvet, Coco, and Nora to name a few. Velvet would be the perfect pet, though you could change her personality around 180 and make her a foul mouthed outgoing girl who loved you. Coco had to be subservient to you, like a maid. Having a strong willed girl like her serve you was too good to pass out. Nora\u2026 you\u2019ll think of something with Nora once you tame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, at some point, you had to get Glynda. She would catch on eventually. There were also so many other hot girls in the school you would want to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned a corner into a deserted hall in your quest to find Blake, you saw something that caused you to quickly step back and hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was against the wall with Pyrrha on top kissing him fervently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, Jaune\u2019s the bottom and Pyrrha\u2019s the top.\u201d You chuckled to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to leave and let those two love birds have some fun, but you thought about something. Yes, you helped those two get to together, so maybe a little fun was in order. Pyrrha was a sexy goddess in her own right. While you weren\u2019t going to play to add her to your harem, as you didn\u2019t need EVERY girl, what if you just had a taste? Maybe make it so you and Jaune could tag team her in a fun fuck fest? Really take the champion down with team work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, finding Blake about your new living accommodations was important.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yang and Weiss were eyeing it hungrily too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was blindfolded, but she could still hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, want a taste?\u201d You asked your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d She raised an eyebrow amused. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d As she sat up and leaned forward, she whispered. \u201cWe brought some toys so the others can have some fun too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like it.\u201d You whispered back as she took your shaft in her mouth. After a momentary pause of enjoying Blake\u2019s skill and rough tongue, you turned o the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang, how about a nice cheer for me?\u201d You asked, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnon, Anon he\u2019s the best!\u201d Yang cried, shaking her pompoms. \u201cHe fucks better than the rest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, generic but not bad.\u201d You laughed and turned to Weiss. \u201cHow\u2019s Ruby\u2019s punishment going?\u201d You moaned a bit as Blake continued to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe enjoys it a little too much.\u201d Weiss admitted, reaching over and twisting one of Ruby\u2019s nipples. The girl squirmed and let out a soft moan, as she got noticeably wetter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, maybe use one of Blake\u2019s toys and abuse her a little bit,\u201d You suggested. \u201cDo a good job and I\u2019ll make sure you get a reward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss looked excited and pulled Ruby after her to Blake\u2019s \u2018toy\u2019 box. Yang bit her lips as she watched and then turned to you and Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter hurry,\u201d she suggested. \u201cKitty\u2019s going to want her milk soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake glared at her and you knew she hated those kind of cat jokes. She barely put up with you. Deciding to help her out, you turned to Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet Blake\u2019s biggest toy she brought over and ravage your ass with it,\u201d You tell her. \u201cAt the same time, repeat, \u2018I will not tell bad jokes\u2019 until I\u2019m ready for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d Yang protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow!\u201d You ordered and she couldn\u2019t do anything. She was conditioned to do what you and Blake told her too. She went over to the box and pulled out a giant purple dildo before removing her skimpy cheerleader panties. Her eyes bulged as she rammed it up her ass and began to repeat her mantra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will not tell bad jokes. I will not tell bad jokes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Weiss was running a vibrating dildo inside Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh,\u201d You snickered and then pulled out of Blake\u2019s mouth. The girl looked surprised and disappointed. \u201cLay down, I want to make you feel good.\u201d Her eyes widened and sparkled at she did so and you positioned yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNyyaaaahh\u2026\u201d Blake moaned as you slipped inside of her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still tight and warm, just perfect for your dick as you thrusted in and out of her. Slowly, you picked up speed and continued. THe slap of skin against skin could be heard and she wrapped her legs around your back, not wanting you to go. You could feel yourself getting close, but you wanted to get Blake off too, so you focused on holding back the tides. Suddenly, her womb tightened down on your shaft and you knew what time it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two nearly came in perfect sync.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped as you pained her insides white and she collapsed back on the bed. Smiling, you intertwined your fingers with hers as you looked down. She was panting and looking up at you, a goofy smile on her face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Heh, and her own ass when the time came, so she had to be last. That left Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Ruby\u2019s going to be next.\u201d You decided. Ruby\u2019s head raised and she tried to cheer through her gag. \u201cThough, let\u2019s set something fun up.\u201d You take the leash from Weiss and sit down on Weiss\u2019 bed and put Ruby on your lap. You removed the gag and she took a couple of breaths of fresh air. \u201cYou ready for your fun, Ruby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes!\u201d She bounced on your lap. \u201cWhat are we going to do? Spanking? Hair pulling? S-sex stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have an idea, but I want it to be a surprise, so I\u2019m going to block your ears,\u201d You tell her. \u201cSo while I talk with the others, you need to behave. If you stay silent, I\u2019ll do a little bit while we talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d Ruby shut her mouth as you took some noises canceling headphones from Weiss and put them on Ruby. The girl was shivering in excitement, so you reached forward and tweak her nipples a bit, causing her to moan happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I want you to bind Yang to your bed, hands and feel to the board spread out in an X.\u201d You noticed Yang reaching for her crotch as you played with Ruby\u2019s breasts. \u201cShe needs to learn my orders are absolute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree.\u201d Blake quickly did as she was told and Yang found herself helpless. It was such a turn on to see a powerful girl like this as nothing more than a plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave you an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss, plug Yang\u2019s mouth with some dirty panties.\u201d You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, why?!\u201d Yang cried out as Weiss cackled and went to the laundry basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have you make noise.\u201d You inform her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go!\u201d Weiss said, holding up some red panties. \u201cIt\u2019s ruby\u2019s from the gym yesterday, so they are sweaty. I\u2019m sure Yang\u2019s going to hate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, you two Ice Queen?!\u201d Yang blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose nicknames are why I\u2019m so happy to do this.\u201d Weiss shoved the dirty panties in Yang\u2019s mouth, deep enough so she couldn\u2019t spit out. She tried to say something, but it was impossible to make anything out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d Blake asked, eyeing the situation with interest as she sat down enxt to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you and Weiss to be absolutely quiet,\u201d You tell them. \u201cFor stage 2.\u201d They nodded and you removed Ruby\u2019s headphones. \u201cRuby, I\u2019m going to fuck you, but there\u2019s a catch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of catch?\u2019 She asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Blake\u2019s the Alpha, right?\u201d Ruby nodded at your words. \u201cGood. As part of the game, you need to eat her out while I fuck you.\u201d The other girls\u2019 eyes widened. It wasn\u2019t going to be Blake. Yang struggled, but the real Blake cut her off with a gesture. \u201cOnce you start, you don\u2019t stop. No matter if she cums, you keep eating her out, making her feel good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right.\u2019 Ruby agreed, nodding again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you stop, I stop fucking you, if you do well, I\u2019ll throw in some spankings.\u201d You chuckled as she bounced up and down, still bound and sitting on your lap. \u201cOf course, even after I cum, I would still like you to try to keep eating her out as long as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d Ruby declared. \u201cI won\u2019t stop until Blake is one hundred percent satisfied.\u201d Blake and Weiss were stifling their laughter as Yang\u2019s eyes were wide with horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lead Ruby over to Yang\u2019s bound form and had her crouch down, sticking her face into Yang\u2019s pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead and start while I get in position.\u201d You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s tongue went to work, digging into Yang\u2019s already wet slit. Yang tugged at her bindings, but you and Blake made her freeze with another gesture. She knew you two were in charge. However, her eyes betrayed the feelings of disgust that it was her sister eating her out. Of course, those feelings were being replaced by pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo keep your end of the promise, you stood behind Ruby and positioned your dick against her asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was going to have a tasty cock to suck when this was over.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She really wanted to suck your cock and your commands would make her do whatever you wanted to get that. This gave you an idea. Blake was the only one free, as Yang was still strapped to the bed and gagged, while Ruby was laying on the floor, bound and blindfolded. Weiss walked up to you as you sat on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you want to do it?\u201d She asked. \u201cWhat position?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit on my lap,\u201d You ordered. \u201cFace your team as I fuck your tight ass.\u201d Yang tried to say something to this, but her panty gagged prevented her from doing so.

She turned around and lowered her butt into your lap, where you positioned your dick right at her hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d Weiss cried out softly, as if got pushed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit, you are tight here,\u201d You gasped. \u201cEven tighter than your royal pussy I deflowered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 a princess.\u201d Weiss gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClose enough,\u201d You laugh. \u201cBlake, can you get my scroll and record this. I\u2019m going to have some fun with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Blake agreed and grabbed your scroll. While she was setting up, you reached down and wrapped your arms around Weiss\u2019 thigh and pulled her legs up. Her pussy was no on full display to Blake and the others, while all of her weight was pushing her ass down on your dick. She was really light, so this position wasn\u2019t too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d You tell Weiss. \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck your ass and whisper what I want you to say. If you don\u2019t say it, you don\u2019t get to suck my dick afterwards.\u201d For fun, you buckled your hips into Weiss and she cried out in pain in pleasure. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes.\u201d Weiss moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady.\u201d Blake told you, holding up your device. You began to whisper into Weiss\u2019 ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hello all,\u201d Weiss said, tyring to keep her voice steady while your rammed you dick into her tight rectum. God, it squeezed your dick so much it was hard not to release immediately. \u201cI\u2019m W-Weiss Schnee and you\u2019re watching Fuck the Ice Q-queen\u2026 mmmm. I\u2019m a huge slut that loves a stallion to f-fuck me. After he cums inside, I l-like it\u2026 ah\u2026 the best, I-I\u2019m going to suck off his dirty c-cock. I\u2019m such a s-slut and a d-dirty whore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was capturing her entire front, from her soaking pussy to her tiny breasts, to her reddening face. You were focused on pleasure as you kept Weiss\u2019 legs up so only her ass was touching your lap. Ovr and over again you pounded away until you finally were brought to the edge. You slammed Weiss down on your lap and sprayed your seed as deep as it could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHH!\u201d Weiss screamed, as she orgasmed too. A line of liquid shot out of her pussy all over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Blake commented. \u201cShe\u2019s a squirter. Who knew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll my technique,\u201d You laughed as Weiss collapsed. \u201cShe\u2019s so wound up, she needed this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant me to record her blow job?\u201d Blake asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but first, can I get a kiss?\u201d You replied. \u201cGet\u2019s me in the mood.\u201d As you pushed Weiss unceremoniously on the floor, Blake sat down next to you and wrapped her arms around your neck before kissing you deeply. Her tongue invading her mouth. Your dick stood up at full attention by the time she broke contact. \u201cMmmm, that\u2019s the good stuff.\u201d You sighed and she giggled. Your eyes then fell on Weiss, who was slowly pushing herself up off the floor. \u201cGet on your knees.\u201d You tell her. It\u2019s time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally.\u201d Weiss gasped, getting up anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned as you looked down at your dick. It was covered in remains of cum, pussy juices, and some brown spots. Either Ruby or Weiss weren\u2019t as clean as they should have been. Oh well, Weiss\u2019 mouth was going to clean you up. The moment she opened her mouth, you shoved your dirty dick inside. Blake was still sitting beside you, recording the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss gagged a bit on the taste, but her programming held firm. She needed your cock and began to suck away like a vacuum. Trying to get you to cum again as her ass leaked out your previous shot.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who knew that imposing power on someone was more fun when you did it with help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later you came, grunting and sighing after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is.\" Blake said with a smile. You look at her. \"Whenever your done for the day you always make the same... sounds of relief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have we already fucked enough for you to know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blushed \"Well... I may have watched you relieve yourself a few times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked \"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not always watching you, I just like to get off from you getting off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou love this woman. You kiss Blake, use a little tongue and say \"Yea, I guess I am tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Ruby a pillow and a Blanket, leaving he to sleep on your floor. Weiss went back to the team RWBY dorm so someone could take zwei out in the morning and feed him. You and Blake slept on top of Yang, using her tits as pillows. She squirmed having not been allowed any release tonight. You smile deviously at the thought as you spoon your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

You can always sleep at your own room if needed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what Blake\u2019s parents come over this weekend?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 it\u2019s probably best for them to know you have your own room.\u201d Blake admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Blake.\u201d Ruby looked hesitant. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d She looked up at Blake\u2019s ears, where a bow wasn\u2019t covering them anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t do it, I\u2019m going to lose the nerve to do so.\u201d Blake sighed.

You had to do something quickly, or someone else would show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, you wanted to punish her for planning to blackmail you. You were the only one who was going to make people do things. Not her.  Your thoughts traveled to Velvet, who was going around having sex with different people each day. You thought about making Neo a prostitute, someone to go out and have sex with people and give you the money. This would make you a pimp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Neo was a strong fighter and her illusions would be pretty powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive yourself a maid uniform.\u201d You tell her. Neo shimmered and wore a white and black maid outfit. She looked pretty hot and her chest was a lot bigger than she let on. \u201cHuh, having one of those combat maids could be handy. Plus, serving me would be good revenge for that blackmail attempt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do? What to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to keep the eye patch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily almost getting brain damage got you out of the rest of your classes today and you got to go back to Team RWBY's dorm. When you got there you saw Yang tied up to the bed post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please let me cum! I've had to taste test <i>so much</i> food!\" She cried<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo made sign language calling Yang fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neo You're force feeding her, calling her fat is unnecessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHE CALLED ME WHAT?\" Yang shouted, ropes straining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only have one rope Yang! Don't break it, I wanna be tied up again!\" Ruby said pouting like a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo, with a surprised look on her face signed to you \"You know sign language?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my sister is deaf.\" You explain. Neo hugs you. It's not sexual, like you were expecting contact with Neo to be it was...nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake however still felt possessive after everything with Neon today. \"Nope.\" She said, physically pulling her off of you \"He's only mine tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Weiss shrieked \"Easy for you to say! You aren't physically addicted to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was getting out of hand.</span></div></div>",

You were actually going to pay, with the money you acquired from Neo. Kali would here none of that and insisted she was going to pay for intruding on you two. You chose this place because it had good seafood, which you knew Blake liked. Ilia also got fish, but Kali got chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh, maybe liking fish wasn\u2019t attributed to being a cat Faunus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d Kali asked. \u201cHow did you two meet? Blake was very vague on her answers.\u201d Blake was suddenly very interested in her food. You figured you could make something up and she\u2019ll agree with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it starts off kind of depressing, but in a way, meeting Blake actually helped me out of a bad point in my life,\u201d You tell her. \u201cDuring one of our missions, my team lost to a Grimm and I was the only one still able to continue education at beacon.\u201d Kali held a hand up to her mouth and Ilia froze. \u201cIt\u2019s why I wear this eye patch, an old wound. After that incident, I became withdrawn and sort of just read all the time to pass the days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI met Blake in the library that way. I noticed she was reading some novels that most people wouldn\u2019t be seen with in public.\u201d Blake flushed. \u201cWe talked about it and, while she wasn\u2019t very open at first, we gradually talked more and more. Eventually, we just decided dating was the next step. She helped me out a lot and I made a lot of friends now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe told me something similar about you,\u201d she replied. \u201cHow being with you gave her the courage to call. She made some mistakes, yes, but it\u2019s important to learn from them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince she left, I did too,\u201d Ilia told you. \u201cIt was hard, but Kali allowed me to stay with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali had been very adamant about calling her by her first name. Mrs. Belladonna made her feel old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Ilia had been part of the White Fang? That made sense. They of course weren\u2019t using the organization\u2019s name, but since they believed you were a Faunus, they were willing to mention it in passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, we\u2019ve been asking all the questions,\u201d Kali laughed. \u201cDo you want to know anything? Maybe about Blake when she was younger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom!\u201d Blake gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, yes.\u201d You said, ignoring your girlfriend\u2019s glare. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have any baby pictures, would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t leave home without them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a thud as Blake\u2019s head hit the table.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m happy for the both of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you replied. \u201cI was debating adding you to my harem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you wouldn\u2019t want an old woman like me.\u201d She told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs your husband keeping you satisfied?\u201d You questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s been really busy with work and hasn\u2019t touched me for ages,\u201d Kali answered. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time we had sex and I\u2019m not getting any younger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re still really hot and sexy.\u201d You tell her and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat makes me feel special.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put her under again because something came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Kali.\u201d You said. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you some triggers. Everything we just discussed and your acceptance, you will forget we talked about. We just had normal discussions about me, Blake, our backgrounds, normal things. When I say the phrase, \u2018Mom welcomes the harem,\u2019 you will go back to this state, happy with everything that\u2019s going on. Of course, you\u2019ll want to join too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured that could be a fun trigger to show Blake. Speaking of triggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I say, \u2018Sexy Young MILF,\u2019 you will believe you regressed mentally and physically back to twenty,\u201d You continued. \u201cAt that point, you will see me as the sexiest man alive and want me to fuck your brains out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali repeated the triggers and you debated adding more. Blake would be back soon with at least Ilia. You could put some funny triggers to mess with them without them knowing. It would be funny to see how long it would take for Blake to release what was happening.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So believing she was Weiss, Ilia was trying to suck you like a pro. Obviously, she wasn\u2019t as good as the real Weiss, but she tried. Ilia was into girls, so a dick was new territory. The lizard tongue was a pleasant change of pace though and you enjoyed it while watching Ruby. Kali was watching Blake abuse Neo a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Ilia?\u201d Ruby begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Weiss, who believed she was Ilia, muttered. \u201cI\u2019m not really use to that and you\u2019re really nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d You told Ilia. \u201cRuby is a pain slut and loves to be beaten like a dog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Ruby cried out indignantly. \u201cI\u2019m not a slut!\u201d Weiss snorted when she didn\u2019t deny anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but don\u2019t come crying to me.\u201d Weiss sighed, pulling back her hand and slapping Ruby across the face. Her head jerked and her cheek was slightly red, but Ruby looked happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah\u2026\u201d She moaned. \u201cHarder!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss looked surprised and backhanded her. Ruby was leaking between her legs. It was a good thing she got naked with Weiss earlier. Now \u2018Ilia\u2019 was just slapping Ruby\u2019s cheeks over and over. You laughed to yourself as you imagined Weiss\u2019 reaction if she found out what she was doing. Looking down, you ran a hand through Ilia\u2019s brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow you like sucking my dick with another girl\u2019s mouth, \u2018Weiss\u2019?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmph, gof!\u201d Ilia replied, slurping loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came a bit already, so you have to work at it, or we\u2019ll do something else.\u201d You warned. Ilia shrugged. Weiss just liked to suck. She didn\u2019t care about cum. Also, focusing on you meant she didn\u2019t have to watch \u2018herself\u2019 slap Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Anon?\u201d Blake asked, turning to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d You turned to face her, letting Ilia continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a new animal to play with, what do you think?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d Neon complained. \u201cMy breasts hurt. Didn\u2019t I do enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPet\u2019s don\u2019t talk!\u201d Blake snapped, slapping her ass. \u201cCan you take away her ability to talk too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a better idea.\u201d You pulled your patch down and gazed into Neon\u2019s eyes. \u201cFirst, let\u2019s remove your old trigger. You won\u2019t blurt out embarrassing things when you cum anymore. We can force you to tell us those things later.\u201d Blake laughed. \u201cWhenever Blake says \u2018Animal Time\u2019 followed by an animal, you will believe you are that animal. Of course, you have to listen to Blake and not attack people if that animal might.\u201d You gestured for her to come over and kiss you, as you didn\u2019t want to interrupt Ilia(Weiss?).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo just me?\u201d Blake asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww.\u201d Kali cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to try it out!\u201d Blake rubbed her hands together. You looked at her for a moment and debated adding more triggers to her. Maybe the body swap one.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She started tidying up as the rest of you talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can sleep over there too,\u201d Kali offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, just sleep with me and Blake,\u201d You tell her. \u201cBed\u2019s big enough for all of us if we cuddle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Blake asked and pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re okay with me.\u201d Kali replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re hot, so of course I am.\u201d You assure her, groping her Bellabooty. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t like to sleep with two sexy kitties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust this once.\u201d Blake mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou debated using the Playback option on her right now in front of everyone, but decided to wait. You could play with her more later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about us?\u201d Weiss asked, looking disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026 I guess tomorrow I can sleep with you Weiss,\u201d You admit. \u201cThen maybe Ruby or Yang. I\u2019ll try to spend time with each of you, but Blake\u2019s the top girl.\u201d You felt up her ass this time, earning a happy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s acceptable.\u201d Weiss agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you can be rough with me.\u201d Ruby adds with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can do whatever you want,\u201d Yang whispered. \u201cCan\u2019t wait for some orders.\u201d She was really getting into the Mind Control/Obedience thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb into Blake\u2019s bed and are soon join on each side by a naked Blake and Kali. It was a little snug, but that just meant both of the sexy Faunus were wrapped around you tightly. This was the life. You wished you could keep Kali, but she would have to return home eventually. As you filled asleep, you remembered Velvet and Coco still had jobs, along with finding out how Cinder is progressing. Well, that can be dealt with tomorrow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was known for being strict and domineering, maybe change that? You kind of already have a bunch of subs and Blake\u2019s more than enough domineering for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe alternate her personality or add fun triggers for you to use before adding her.

While she was under, you decided to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you so strange?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am an android and my social protocols are not fully integrated due to limit contact with people.\u201d Penny answered in a monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe it when Penny told you about herself. She was an android with Aura from Atlas. Did that make her alive? You were surprise your eye worked on her, but you weren\u2019t going to question it. Instead, you through about how fun it would be to have a cute android harem girl. Maybe she could be your maid like Ilia was for Blake? Or something else. She was kind of na\u00efve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you being monitored by Atlas?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as I stay in Beacon, I have free movement as long as I avoid revealing my secret.\u201d Penny recited. \u201cIf I wish to leave, I will be escorted to Vale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you could have fun with her in Beacon. Interesting.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s a good suggestion for someone else I have in mind.\u201d You turned to Winter. She would be good for this. You looked over at Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll add her to my sub harem,\u201d Blake replied. \u201cYou still get access to all of them, but I just like the fact they adore me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s cute, I\u2019m going to keep her,\u201d You tell her and Penny grinned happily that she was wanted. \u201cSpeaking of, I\u2019m going to take Neon too.\u201d Neon looked up in surprise as you petted her head. You were going to turn her into so many animal pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, why?\u201d Blake pouted. She loved bullying Neon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get you some twins or something to replace her.\u201d Blake blinked at your words and grinned, understanding your meaning. \u201cAnyone okay with Penny taking over Yang\u2019s spot as Neo\u2019s helper? Or keep her doing that because it drives her nuts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one supported Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re all terrible!\u201d Yang cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of feel like Ruby\u2019s option of a dominatrix Penny is the only option left,\u201d You chuckled. \u201cMan, who would have seen that coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t really fit the part though.\u201d Weiss pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, let her try.\u201d Velvet said. \u201cShe might surprise us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you seen any dominatrix stuff, Penny?\u201d Kali asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have wi-fi capabilities, so I could look up information.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she was part of their harem, they all knew she was an android.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo anything you become, you can look up online to learn how to act like that subconsciously?\u201d Kali pushed and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like she would be very versatile for you, Anon.\u201d Cinder pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got an idea then.\u201d You looked into Penny\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhenever I say \u2018Personality Program\u2019: Followed bya new personality, you will adopt that persona perfectly. So if I tell you to become a dominatrix, you will become one. If I tell you to become someone else, you will act like them. Of course, you will always obey me in your personas. Oh, and you\u2019ll remember how you acted under each one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny repeated the instructions and then you kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, sorry about the Programming,\u201d You tell her. \u201cBut It\u2019s how we always said it. Blake has a program in her head too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no issues with it,\u201d Penny assured you. \u201cIt feels sensational to be a part of this with everyone.\u201d She touched your hand. \u201cI hope I get to experience everything with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwwww.\u201d Kali, Ruby, Velvet, and Ilia cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, what personality should we give Penny first?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDominatrix!\u201d Ruby blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you want that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not someone fowl mouthed and mean?\u201d Cinder suggested. \u201cOpposite of her personality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight as well make her act like Ice Queen.\u201d Yang chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey!\u201d Weiss spluttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more discussion, you decided on\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Naked girls were all over the room and the fun you had was a blur. At least you were on the bed. To your right, was Blake, in her full naked glory. You smiled as you remembered the Record option you left in her last night. Hearing her say those words was hilarious and sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck my mom so hard, I get another sibling!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered abusing Kali\u2019s pussy constantly.

She loved being an animal now. You pulled your self out of the catgirl pile and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was on the floor, with a huge wet stained on the floor.

While the others were slowly getting up, you reminisced about Penny kneeling before you as your peed into her like a common toilet. That power trip turned you on. She was so happy to be of use when you did that. You might have to make that a normal routine for her. She was an android so it wasn\u2019t like she would get sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn artificial intelligence toilet, heh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Anon.\u201d Kali yawned sitting up. \u201cPhew, you gave me a workout last night.\u201d She rubbed her sore crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just had to full explore where Blake came from.\u201d You replied, sitting down next to her and kissing her lips. She returned the gesture and then you spend some time playing with her breasts. Her eyes traveled down onto your hardening dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone has a bad case of morning wood,\u201d Kali commented. \u201cDidn\u2019t Blake take care of that for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a lot of plans today, so she\u2019s got to get ready,\u201d You answered. \u201cI was going to use someone else to help with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still full from last night down there, but I\u2019ll be more than happy to use my mouth.\u201d She  volunteered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, as much as I love using your Kali, there\u2019s a few other girls who haven\u2019t had a lot of chances.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand.\u201d Kali kissed you again and then got up to find her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeon looked up from her ball and stared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, pet.\u201d You chuckled. \u201cCouldn\u2019t remember what I had you be. Animal Time: Human.\u201d Neon blinked and sat up, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll night?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeast you were a nice pet, could have been a slug or something.\u201d You tell her, the you kicked Yang in the side to wake her up. \u201cGet up, Yang. You need to clean up and let Ilia clean up your mess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMess?\u201d She looked down. \u201cGross! Forgot Neo made me do that.\u201d Neo laughed silently. She rushed into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang!\u201d Came Blake\u2019s indignant voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Anon?\u201d Neon asked, purring a little. \u201cI see you have some trouble down there? Mind if I help out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d You replied. \u201cPut your mouth to work, but when I cum, it\u2019s on your face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine!\u201d Neon dived down into your lap and began to suck hungrily. Her lips wrapped tightly around your member as her tongue worked your head. Your felt her as a bit and ran your fingers along her soft tail as you watched the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder and Velvet were awake and talking. Weiss had waken Ruby up and Ruby was chatting away while Weiss pretended to look bored, but you could see the small smile on her lips. Coco was the only one who seemed distant, due to being shy and bookworm. While you made her a little more relaxed around the others, it only helped so little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoco,\u201d You said. \u201cCome here.\u201d She looked happy to be able to focus on you and quickly came to your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something I can do for you?\u201d She asked, her eyes flickering down to where Neon was happily making sloppy sucking sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I want to go shopping for the new clothes you picked out,\u201d You tell her. \u201cI\u2019m taking Blake and Yang with me, since we have other stuff to do in town, but you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-me?\u201d Coco stammered. \u201cB-But I\u2019m not good in crowds. I\u2019ll just be in the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need your expertise,\u201d You pushed. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you need me.\u201d She put her fingers together. You sighed and reached a hand up, cupping one of her breasts. Her eyes widened and her face got red as her breathing grew labored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want, I could give you a shot of confidence.\u201d You offered. Though, not really. You were going to make her body and mouth move on its own while the bookworm personality would feel like it\u2019s trapped and watching from inside her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Coco could decide, Blake and Yang come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d Blake told you, a sadistic gleam in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we grab breakfast first?\u201d Yang asked, stifling a yawn.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Heh, you still couldn\u2019t get over how much you changed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGO ahead and take my old clothes back to Beacon with you,\u201d You tell her. \u201cBlake, Yang, and I have some business to finish.

Nice.\u201d Yang high fived you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d Blake asked. \u201cThe club won\u2019t open for a while, so we won\u2019t know where those bitches are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoing to make them your servants?\u201d Yang asked curiously. \u201cNot that they don\u2019t deserve it.

You still couldn\u2019t figure out what kind of magic she had to turn you on so fast. \u201cStill, you didn\u2019t answer my question. What now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLunch?\u201d You suggested. \u201cThen you two can try on some swimsuits while I watch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPervert.\u201d Blake teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose we can put on a show.\u201d Yang teased. The three of you grabbed some lunch, talked and made plans to tease Weiss, before heading to a store that sold swimsuits. It was big and not crowded, so you had most of it to yourself. You had the helpers \u2018decide\u2019 not to bother you. All it took was a glare and a quick kiss to the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an idea came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch this.\u201d You whispered to Yang and walked up to Blake. \u201cRecord Action.\u201d Blake froze and waited for an order. \u201cYou will find a swimsuit you normally would hate. Kiddy, colors you don\u2019t like, anything that you would find embarrassing and try it on and show it to me and Yang thinking it\u2019s great. After you show it off, you\u2019ll realize what kind of suit it really is. Stop Recording Action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blinked and went back to peruse the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice.\u201d Yang whispered, picking up a yellow bikini and slipping into the locker room. \u201cLet me try this on before you use the trigger, unless you want to join me in a minute.

We could do SOOOO much stuff to them and they would deserve it. You may not know this, but Junior\u2019s gang is actually pretty well known. These two bitches have probably killed before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake struggled on your lap and you held her tightly. She eventually gave up and slumped against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you doing this?\u201d Miltia asked, trying to leave but unable to leave without you letting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll regret this.\u201d Melanie threatened. \u201cWe\u2019ll kick all three of your asses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes at her stupidity, and she wasn\u2019t even a bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWet yourselves.\u201d You tell them and the next moment both girls gasped as they pissed standing up fully clothed. Liquids dripped from their soaked panties and legs under their dresses. Both of them cried out and you decided you didn\u2019t want to listen to it now. \u201cShut up and only speak when I let you or carrying out an order requires it.\u201d Both girls shut their mouths instantly. \u201cHere\u2019s how this works. You are both controlled by me to be our toy. You will do anything I or Yang tells you to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe?\u201d Yang asked surprised as Blake fidgeted in your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil Blake gets her secret axe murderer personality under control,\u201d you replied. \u201cNow, ideas?\u201d Blake mumbled something into your hand and you removed it so she could tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like what you just did,\u201d Blake told him. \u201cLet\u2019s bring them back for the harem toilet. Everyone uses them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou covered her mouth again. Her idea wasn\u2019t awful, in a sense of it being better then stabbing themselves, but if you wanted to do that, you had Penny. She loved being your toilet and was willing to drink your pee every day. It was an idea, but not one you would probably do. The look in the twin\u2019s eyes were in horror and it was actually a punishment they would hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould always make them prostitutes or something,\u201d Yang pointed out. \u201cHave them earn money selling their bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey might like that, but the downside to that is they might not be clean if I want to use them.\u201d You pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right.\u201d Yang nodded. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind a go with them too sometime.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cAlways embarrassing stuff to do with them. Streaking, make them pets for Blake, since you took Neon away from her. Could stop at a pet store and get pet food and toys they had to play with. Really just depends how FAR you want to go. If you\u2019re really serious, you could bring them back with us to Cinder or Neo. Those girls is evil.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, not bad ideas,\u201d You agreed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to kill them or cause serious injuries.\u201d You tell Blake. \u201cIf you have any other ideas, now\u2019s the time. But if you keep up this current trend, I\u2019m going to have to do something with you, my little kitty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pet name calmed her down a little.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once she was gone, you held Blake on your lap, rubbing her breast with one hand, while watching Melanie dry hump her sister like a pig, both of them oinking and squealing. They knew what was happening, but any order they were given they had to do. Finally, you addressed Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, what\u2019s the deal?\u201d You asked. \u201cAre you normally this protective of yoru friends? You let Cardin harass people without planning his death, but when Yang gets teased a bit by these two, you go psycho?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Blake didn\u2019t want to tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake\u2026\u201d You whispered into her ears. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot and no matter what you tell me, I\u2019m not going to let you go. I just need to know why you feel you have to kill people like this.\u201d Blake went silent for a moment, but slowly trembled in your arms. You tightened the hug slightly and she calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I was a kid,\u201d Blake muttered. \u201cI had friends who were bullied by humans. They didn\u2019t do anything wrong, some people are just bad. I couldn\u2019t defend them and a prank went too far. One of them went blind and the other can\u2019t walk. It was just an accident and the culprits were arrested, but I realized if I had stepped in earlier to prevent it, they wouldn\u2019t have been hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate when people bully my friends and if it\u2019s not stopped, I might lose them. Yang\u2019s been an amazing partner and put up with all of my shit. I want her to be happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink she\u2019d be happy if you are responsible for hurting someone seriously?\u201d You asked. \u201cYang fights, sure, but the people she fights recover. You actively want to get them killed or seriously maimed. You need to avoid that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could always hypnotize me to do so.\u201d Blake commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could, but I would prefer the girl I love change for the better on her own.\u201d You counter. Her face blushed and she looked away. \u201cSo, can you promise me, Blake? Really promise. You won\u2019t do anything to seriously hurt them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about mental trauma?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRun it by me first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay with them as toilets?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust for our harem if needed,\u201d You tell her. \u201cNo strangers. We don\u2019t know where they\u2019ve been.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake laughed and kissed you. Both of you decided to continue that and hands slipped under clothes as you made out. You were in public, deserted area sure, but public, so clothes stayed on. Meanwhile, the twins were still humping each other, completely forgotten. Until Yang returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot what you wanted\u2026 oh, I see what this is boss.\u201d Yang grinned as Blake hopped off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Yang.\u201d You told her, grabbing the bag and looking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you have Yang get?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese things.\u201d Her eyes widened as you pulled out stuff. A strap on for girls to wear to fuck another girl. Random pet food, some metal trays, and a few other things. \u201cSince they are your pets, I figured they needed some pet food, trays to throw the slop on and a few other toys. Though, making them eat until they become fat, avoid that for a while. Maybe when we get tired of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We need them to act normal until we get back to the dorm.\u201d You turned to the twins. \u201cBoth of you, remove your soaked underwear and throw it away.\u201d You didn\u2019t need piss stained clothes.

The twins did not look happy as their eyes betrayed their fear and hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back to the dorm and find Ruby, and Weiss still spooning with Penny sitting on a chair and waving. Neo was there along with Neon, who was sleeping on your/Blake\u2019s bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d You asked teasingly. \u201cRuby and Weiss huh? Making the relationship official.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cit\u2019s cool,\u201d You assured them. \u201cIf you want to have a relationship with someone else in the harem, it\u2019s fine.

If they are pets, have to serve you sexually, you get required to use them, anything. It will be normal among us.\u201d You kissed them all to seal the deal and everyone snapped to it. \u201cThanks for the video, Penny.\u201d You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my pleasure, master.\u201d Penny told you. \u201cIf you need my services in anyways, I am happy to assist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight have some ideas for you,\u201d You admit, eyeing Blake. If she did what she wanted to, Penny would be your private use one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo served the food and because there were limited seats, you and Blake sat on the twins after forcing them to be chairs. Neon came over and sat in your lap, cuddling against you. Weirdly, Blake wasn\u2019t jealous this time, already planning what to do with the twins.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll let you make your girlfriend orgasm.\u201d Weiss blinked and then grinned, nodding slowly. You turned to Penny and eyed her up and down for a moment. She was still completely naked. \u201cAfter I\u2019m done with Ruby, I want you to record her expression when Weiss makes her orgasm. I want a picture of Ruby\u2019s expression right when she does so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to get a picture of each of their orgasming faces eventually for their backgrounds on your scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood!\u201d Penny saluted and grabbed her scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady when you are,\u201d Ruby told you brightly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be rough.

Then backhanded the other side of her face. The expression of Ruby\u2019s face was ecstatic. You pulled you fist and delivered it into her stomach. She gasped and spit flew out of her mouth. You then grabbed her head and slammed her on the ground. Out of the corner of your eye, you saw Yang look over worriedly, but then turned back to watch Blake. You kicked Ruby while she was on the ground a couple of time and then slapped her ass until it was red. She was getting close by the sound of her pleasure cries so you grabbed her hair and pulled her up. You didn\u2019t let her stand up completely, so she was feeling pain as you held her up by the clumps of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a pervert, Ruby.\u201d You chuckled, throwing her on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No I\u2019m not!\u201d She protested, as she gasped. \u201cI just like pain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, pervert.\u201d You turned to Weiss. \u201cGo ahead and eat her out and make her cum hard. Really get in there. Shove your fingers in her ass for extra stimulation.\u201d You actually didn\u2019t fuck Ruby very often, but this was fun in its own right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss rushed forward and crouched down on the bed. Without hesitation, she stuck her head between Ruby\u2019s legs and began to very unladylike slurp at Ruby\u2019s pussy. You then started using her fingers to pleasure Ruby\u2019s butthole, sticking two of them inside. Ruby cried out and jerked, as Weiss was bringing her to full release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Penny was standing over them, her scroll fixed on Ruby\u2019s face, ready to record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be left out of the fun, you got behind Weiss and prepared to do what you loved doing. Fucking her ass. You spat on your fingers and lubed up her asshole before slipping in your cock. Weiss\u2019 body let out a small spasm, but she focused on the task at hand. Looking at her ponytail, you un did it her, so her long hair was now sprawled out over her back. Next you started fucking her ass, enjoying how it wasn\u2019t quite as tight as the first few times. Soon, it would be shaped specifically for your cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh!\u201d Ruby moaned out and her lower body shot up, pressing against Weiss\u2019 mouth as she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it, master!\u201d Penny said eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d You laughed and then grunted. \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to keep fucking Weiss. I want to get her facial expression too when she orgasms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood!\u201d Penny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed Weiss\u2019 hair and separated into two makeshift pigtails and pulled her up by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Weiss gasped, as you pulled her back with her hair. Not enough to hurt her, but enough to spice it up with a little pain. Ruby was smirking as she watched Weiss enjoy the same thing she did. You continued to pump in her ass, really shaping it. Since you have cum in Penny not to long ago, you weren\u2019t about to release yourself, but Weiss was going to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take her long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m cummmiinnng!\u201d Weiss cried out, as liquid squirted from her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my little slut,\u201d You tell her, letting her hair go so she fell on Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got both pictures, master.\u201d Penny told you and you patted her head. That small action was like you gave her everything in the world based on her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job,\u201d You tell her and then looked at your dick. \u201cDamn it, Weiss. Clean your ass better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got an idea and smirked as you walked around toward where Weiss and Ruby\u2019s heads were. Weiss looked up, her expression tired and you pushed your dirty cock into her mouth. By reflex, she began to suck off her dirty asshole remains from your dick.

Ruby was already up and you had someone to punish. Yang was in the bathroom, as she took the longest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo fell out of Yang\u2019s bed with a crash, waking everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs punishment for being careless with my food,\u201d You tell her. \u201cNo masturbating for the rest of the week and you can\u2019t have anyone else pleasure you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo gaped at you and begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, and you need to spend more time learning to cook and watching for the signs of possible food poisoning.\u201d Neo hung her head and shuffled out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of harsh, huh?\u201d Yang asked. \u201cIt was an accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo\u2026 hours.\u201d You replied. \u201cI\u2019ll probably let her go early and have you or Sex Bunny Velvet pleasure as an apology.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s cool I guess.\u201d Yang shrugged. She preferred pleasuring you. \u201cWe got like 2 hours until class, breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you and Ruby grab us some?\u201d You asked. \u201cRest of us need to shower and get changed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d Ruby agreed and leaned over Weiss, who was awake due to the noise. \u201cUsual?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Weiss groaned, not wanting to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters left as you sat with Blake. Neon had left and you felt bad for neglecting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of breakfast,\u201d Blake yawned. She got up and pulled a can of dog food from a bag by her desk. \u201cThis should do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake?\u201d You were worried about her sanity. \u201cYou\u2019re going to eat\u2026 that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, they are.\u201d Blake pointed to the open closet door. On the floor, naked and laying on their dresses, were the twins. Blake cleaned out part of the closet and let them sleep there while you had been on the toilet last night. \u201cThey need breakfast. I\u2019m not a monster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked. \u201cThe food is edible for humans and it\u2019s actually nutritious. Just tastes bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re weird, but it\u2019s part of what I love about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing from you and Penny,\u201d Blake replied. \u201cWhat are you going to do with her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always wanted a cool robot maid,\u201d You chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll get her a maid uniform and have her serve me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, sounds useful, if you can get Atlas to not hunt you down.\u201d Blake poured the dog food on the tray and passed it to the twins. \u201cEat up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins looked at you for help, their eyes pleading as Blake tormented them. You glanced back in the room and only saw Weiss left. You could ignore their plight as have some fun with Weiss before class. Maybe install all purpose triggers like the ones you had in Blake. Could be fun to use them throughout the day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t get much opportunity to decide, as Yang returned with several trays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFood\u2019s here!\u201d She called out, passing over one to everyone. \u201cGot what you normally get, hope that\u2019s okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks fine, Yang.\u201d Blake assured her, sitting down and digging in right in fornt of the twins to torture them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d Ruby agreed and then knelt down in front of you.

Their hands weren\u2019t enough, so Weiss started sucking on your cock and Ruby gentle sucked your balls. They had good teamwork. You didn\u2019t try to hold back and quickly were brought to the edge. Your dick fell out of Weiss\u2019 mouth with a plop and the girls held up their food. You squirted cum over both plates, trying to even if out, and then when you were done, pulled up your own pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the best,\u201d Ruby sighed, shoveling her cum covered eggs into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA good way to start the day,\u201d Weiss agreed, as the cum covered fruit salad passed her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to eat your food, debating what to do next. You still had like an hour before class. You could watch Weiss and Ruby trigger each other, have fun with Blake and her pets, or program Yang.

That was a Ruby trigger. \u201cBesides, Emerald would mostly attend to me.

You quickly texted Cinder and got a response to stop by after classes. You let them know and Weiss seemed satisfied. \u201cThat should give you time to plan what you want to do with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what about your sister?\u201d You asked. \u201cAny word?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be here at the end of the week,\u201d Weiss answered. \u201cBlake\u2019s mom should be gone by then, so if you want to do anything with her, it should be soon. DO you know how you want to capture her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you told her about you and Ruby yet?\u201d She shook her head no at your question. \u201cTell her I\u2019m your boyfriend and you wanted to introduce us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Ruby gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTemporarily,\u201d You assured her. \u201cThen I\u2019ll take Winter away and you two can have fun.\u201d Ruby seemed happy.

Have her body act automatically or something. You can do that, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a devious little bugger, maybe you could lead after Blake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss pouted and you gave her a kiss to make her feel better when no one was looking.

Goodwitch must really want to challenge you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGame plan time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysically overpowering Yang isn't happening any time soon, but thankfully she is not invincible. While her semblance, Burn, will absorb the kinetic energy every blow she receives to empower herself, it however will not make her immune to pain. It also doesn't make her immune from you coming from behind and choking her out with your halberd. You learned that from a fight you had with her last week. You almost beat her, but all you got was a broken halberd for your trouble when she broke out of that lock. Maybe she'll fall for that trick again? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you can't go down that route you can always wear her down. Even if you lose the opportunity of an exhausted and more vulnerable Yang will present itself to your eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to do this with a Yang, Anon?\" The buxom blonde grins cracking her knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd prefer the Yangs covered by her shirt to be honest. Oh, the things you would love to- Focus! Fantasize less about those tits, and plan more on not losing miserably to the girl they're attached to. Besides, if you play your cards right Yang's tits will be yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really have a choice?\" You say back. She laughs at the sound of a lack of enthusiasm in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet if I was a certain someone else your tone would be different.\" She said raising her eyebrows suggestively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell she probably has a point before you enter a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang makes the first move, launching herself at you using her gauntlets to accelerate her movement. You manage to dodge at the last moment, but Yang is in hot pursuit and catches up fast. You cannot dodge this time. All you can do is block with your halberd, an brace yourself for impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you got this thing reinforced?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did,\" you say as you struggle to keep your stance. \"Tried to make it you-proof as much as I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made Yang laugh again. You're not entirely sure if it was a \"let's put that to the test\" kind of laugh, or if she simply found the idea you of trying to make your weapon \"Yang-proof\" hilarious. She's being a good sport about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the midpoint of your match with Yang it starts resembling a Dark Souls/Bloodborne boss fight. Dodging/rolling around the boss that puts out an absurd amount of damage, occasionally getting a hit in, but there is no musical theme playing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang does look somewhat tired so your strategy is working to a degree. Or you're just really boring her. Whatever the case Yang isn't tolerating it anymore. The blonde begins a more aggressive assault against you, her punches coming in at a rate you can barely keep up with. She eventually finds an opening in your shambling defense, and makes contact with your gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the class assumed you were down for the count including Yang herself, yet the glass wearing assistant to Ozpin saw you had a bit of fight left in you. Normally, Goodwitch would end the fight here and there, yet she felt generous enough to grant you one last chance to turn this situation around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Yang had her back turned on you. Looks like Plan B it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour halberd. Yang's neck. Make it happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attempt was a surprising success. Yang on the other hand wasn't really appreciative of you pulling the same trick on her for a second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The match is over.\" Goodwitch announced loud enough that the two of you could hear her over your struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Anon,\" she says directing her attention at you, \"Tiring out your opponents is a valid strategy, but you mustn't be so timid in the face of foes stronger than you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wouldn't call it being timid, ma'am.\" You say scratching the back of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Ms. Xaio Long,\" she says to Yang, \"You'd do well to remember to never turn your back on someone until you're certain they are incapable of continuing to fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were both dismissed to the locker room, and you do you have a chance to try your hand at Yang?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis chapter went on longer than I would have liked. I still need to get better at fight scenes.</span></div></div>",

Whatever you wanted really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can create complete personalities out of nothing and force them into other people. Not personality as in you can make a bland person cheery, no you create a new person in your brain and they take over whoever you put into them. You have to make and maintain eye contact long enough for the personality to hit it's target, but they're made to your specifications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, that young lady with the sniper scythe that had a position in Beacon you should posses was about to be replaced by someone of your own making. She was alone in a weapon shop and you were cooking up someone good in your mind. You had to make them loyal to you, and a good enough actor to fool everyone at beacon, but other than that you had free rain on what they would be like. You decided for simplicity's sake that they would have the same name as the person they inhabit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way to Ruby Rose, looked her in the eyes and said \"Hello, my names Anon. I don't think that we've met before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was surprised to have someone talk to her, but happily engaged in the conversation \"Oh, hello. I'm Ruby. What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just like to find different kinds of weapons, they're a special interest of mine. Since your here, can I assume that you're a huntress? Or at least one in training? What kind of weapon do you use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving the chance to talk about Crescent Rose, Ruby began talking about her hyper fixation. This went on for a while, but it gave you enough time making eye contact for the new Ruby Rose to infect the old one. You never pinned down how long it took for a personality to hit it's mark but it was never instant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this one hit Ruby fell silent. Her head twitched, which you took as a sign that the new Ruby was taking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stopped Ruby looked at you with respect in her eyes, gave you a solute and said \"Mission accomplished sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it. Is it cramped in there?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cramped might be the wrong word sir,\" Ruby explained \"It doesn't feel anymore full. The older persona is trying to have fight me, but I'm in control of this body now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Let's review our plan of conquest.\" You say eagerly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside Ruby's head, Ruby 1 was trapped in a to witness what was happening to her. From her perspective, she could see and hear everything happening outside through a tv, but was trapped in a pink dome shaped room. Her 'head space'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Get out of my head!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's my head now' Ruby 2 retorted 'and soon everyone will be passengers for Anon's minions.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No!' Ruby 1 yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, actually' Ruby 2 told her 'Now if you don't mind, I'd like to hear the next step of the plan. Maybe get Yang or Weiss.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby fought hard at that, banging on the tv screen, trying to hit the walls inside her head.

But life occasionally finds a way. And today is one of those moments with the curious case of you. You stand in his office shorter and physically younger than you were at the beginning at the start of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not pay too much attention to your changing body until the middle of the day when it became undeniable that something was happening to your body. It became gradually more difficult for you to keep your clothes on as they were no longer fitting. By the time you got into the nurse's office you were at least 10 or 11 years old physically. Then something went on with your aura, and the nurse started acting very affectionate to you. You weren't complaining all that much. At least someone was concerned for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you got yourself some clothes that fit you and headed over here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you calmed down, Mr. Anon?\" He asked referring to the outburst you had when you discovered your younger form. From what he head it befitted your age now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sir,\" you groan in your new kid voice. Or rather your old younger voice as it sounds exactly the same as it did when you were this age originally. \"This can be reversed, right?\" You really didn't want to go through puberty again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a straight answer Ozpin answers your question with one of his own. \"Do you want me to tell you the truth, or do prefer a comforting lie, Anon?\" It does nothing to quell the vague sense of unease you've had ever since entering this office. Judging from the look in your eye he suspects you want want the former. \"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But will I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again. I don't know if you'll stay like this for the rest of your days or not. Semblances can be tricky things. While occasionally some might be similar the will be unique to their owner.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in good fortune that you are not the first person I have encountered with an age regression semblance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a little hopeful now. \"Did any of them return to normal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin takes a sip from his mug before answering you. \"Some did, yes. I knew one individual who was able to shift back and forth between a child and his mature state at will. But once again, not all semblances are the same, Mr. Anon. Your semblance could grant you an ability that sets you apart from all the others I've met. Or, you could remain a child forever. Only time will tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kind of wouldn't mind being like this if you had a cool secondary effect, but you still want to go back to normal. You can't be a huntsman if your 11 years old forever. Furthermore, how are you going to get a girlfriend when you look like this? You want kids but you don't want to be a kid again. Or maybe some part of you does since semblances represent an aspect of their user? You can't imagine why you'd want to be this age again. You had a pretty normal childhood, a great one all things considered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed thoughts about if some part of your subconscious craved to be a kid again aside. You just want to get back to your dorm. You ask Ozpin if you can be dismissed now, and he allows it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way back to your room you bump into the first girl to fall under the influence of \"Irresistible Youth\", but who will it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We never talk that much though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang rubs her chin as she compares your appearance to someone she vaguely remembers. Did he have an eyepatch? No. Wait. \"Anon?\" She said confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you become such a squirt?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I finally unlocked my semblance and what you see are the results of that.\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA semblance that turns you into a kid again? That's a new one for Yang. It's not too weird compared to her uncle's bad luck semblance, but one that can regress your age? New territory for her. \"You will be able to return to normal again, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't really know,\" you sigh depressingly. \"I could be stuck like this till the day I die, or I could have to wait 7 years again before I'm back to how I'm supposed to be.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was because of your crap situation, her time spent raising Ruby, or both but Yang couldn't stand seeing a kid sad this way. She surprises you with a hug in an attempt to cheer you up, but unknown to both of you the second effect of \"Irresistible Youth\" was about to find it's first victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAN: There was some confusion on how this semblance works because of some poor explanation on my part. While it does give you a field that stirs a woman's maternal instincts it's semi-passive nature means you have to put some work into it. How? By sending your aura into them via physical contact.

Your hormones were flaring up and you couldn\u2019t resist. Slowly, you reached a hand over and grabbed her breast again. They were soft, yet firm enough to hold shape.

She grunted a little, but didn\u2019t seem to be waking up. Embolden by your success, you continued to squeeze and rub those magnificent jugs. This was a once in a life time event and you have heard Yang was a heavy sleeper. Your hands moved to her nipples and began to squeeze them lightly, noticing them getting harder. You kind of wanted to get in her shirt to touch her breasts directly, but you were afraid to go that far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were playing with Yang\u2019s chest, you felt tired again. There was no way you could tell that your Aura was being pumped into Yang through contact. Drowsiness overtook you and your eyes grew heavy.

Just because we are helping another Huntsman in training, doesn\u2019t mean you can slack off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnew you would see it my way.\u201d Yang said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d Ruby cheered and hugged you again. \u201cIf you need anything at all, just tell Big Sis Ruby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m older than you\u2026\u201d You muttered, but Ruby ignored it. You saw the slight grin on Blake\u2019s face as she heard it, though you never saw her put on her bow to cover her cat ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat aside, you realized Ruby was acting a lot like Yang was. More motherly and big sisterly to you. The drain on your Aura also was noticeable. Physical contact seemed to make girls act more caring around you. The longer they were in contact, the more they were willing to do. All the hugging, hand holding, and snuggling last night probably had Yang deep in your power. Maybe that was the true nature of your Semblance. You still had Aura, so maybe you should try it out and see if you\u2019re right. Weiss seems like the one you need to win over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe after breakfast.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You couldn't stay upset at that kind face and warmth filled lilac eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in for a kiss on the cheek when the moment her lips made contact with your skin you felt a draining sensation. Your strength and your aura slowly fading away. Wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it! The draining and drowsiness you have been experiencing lately is merely your aura escaping your body into Yang's. Ever since her first hug it has been pouring into her, and when you think about it, is undoubtedly the reason why she's acting so motherly to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this is what your semblance does.

You think Yang is a wonderful girl, but having her see you as her kid while you're technically still her age would weird you out without end.

It didn\u2019t seem like teasing, but with Yang you could never be sure. You nod slowly, aware your hand was still touching hers. You force your Aura into her and felt it drain faster. This was good news as it meant you could control it to some degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d You asked softly, unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrop your pants,\u201d Yang ordered. \u201cHurry up before the others come back to check on us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pulled your shorts down and saw the large bulge in your underwear. As yang grabbed some tissues, you pulled your dick out. Yang\u2019s eyes widened at the size of it. You did too. It was larger than when you were an adult. Before you could say anything, Yang wrapped one hand around it and began to slowly rub it up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh!\u201d You moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Yang said softly. \u201cJust kick back and let Mama Yang take care of your needs.\u201d Your dick was so sensitive and it didn\u2019t take long before you came. You must have been backed up for a while, especially after last night. Or maybe it was your new body. Yang caught your cum with the tissues so it didn\u2019t make a mess. \u201cThere you go. Wow, that\u2019s quite a bit. You were really backed up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat felt\u2026 amazing.\u201d You gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang through the tissues away and then seemed to realize what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a onetime incident,\u201d Yang told you. \u201cI was helping you adjust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d You looked at the ground in disappointment. \u201cYou were so good, I doubt I could ever compare.\u201d Yang\u2019s expression softened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe now and then.\u201d Yang amended and you secretly smiled to yourself as you found out how far you could take her. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell the others, okay? It\u2019s our little secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lips are sealed.\u201d You assured her and she hugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo your power made them want to take care of you, but you could push them away from the simple mom route. If you wanted to continue this, you had two main objectives. First was to see how far you could take this and the second was to make the other girls on her team accept him. You couldn\u2019t let them persuade Yang to kick you out. From what you knew about them, Weiss would be the toughest, followed by Blake.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A small frown emerged on your face upon realizing your voice is in its new childish tone. \"I'm still a kid again.\" You muttered audibly. You were halfway tempted to resume snuggling with Yang, but the blonde was nowhere to be found. It appeared that the only ones in left in the room were you, Ruby, and a corgi sleepin on a pile of dog food cans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby said Yang explained to her and the others about your semblance, and also asked her to come back here to check up on you. How thoughtful of Yang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you can tell her I'm still stuck like this.\" You said while grabbing the covers back. It did occur to you that this isn't your bed, but you hardly cared about something that trivial now. You wanted to go back to sleep, and wake when you're back to normal again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least until Yang comes back so you can cuddle with her again. Preferably you'd rather go back to your original age, but cuddling and groping Yang when she wasn't looking was also a desirable outcome. You wish you didn't have to be sneaky about it, and Yang would let you touch her tits whenever you wanted to. Like in the wet dream you had last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Anon. You can't stay in Yang's bed all day.\" She encouraged, shaking you again. Unbeknownst to Ruby she was slowly exposing herself to your semblance the more she shook you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me. It's not like I have anything better to do,\" you replied. \"So long as I'm stuck like this I can't really be a huntsman. I bet I can't even pick up my halberd anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anon, moping around in bed will not change the past. You might be little but I bet with enough time you can still be a huntsman even if you're stuck like this for the rest of your life.\" Ruby said, her voice taking up a much more serious tone. She then proceeded to give you a motivational mini-speech which got you thinking about if you really can turn this around. She's only fifteen, four to five years older than your current state, and from what you've seen out of her Ruby is going to make an awesome huntress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you win.\" You sigh in a faux-defeated voice. \"I will get out of your sister's bed and carry on with my life.\" When your eyes met Ruby's silver eyes the same glint you found in Yang's eyes yesterday was present in them. It wasn't as apparent as it is with Yang however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered the nature of your semblance, how it made Ruby's older sister act motherly towards you, and how she wanted to pamper you after she made physical contact. Maybe this is what your semblance does besides turning you into a child again? You are somewhat curious over how it will effect a really sweet girl like Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: give Ruby a hug to show your gratitude for cheering you and to test your semblance <br>\r\nOption #2: no time for that you're hungry<br>\r\nOption #3: a combination of morning wood and thinking about your dream from last night has caused a you to pitch a tent, and Ruby can certainly see it <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #4: you know what to do <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even as a child, your Aura was still intact, so you were physically stronger than other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee!\u201d Ruby exclaimed. \u201cDoesn\u2019t help to mope around. Now get up and let\u2019s get breakfast. The others are already down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby?\u201d You said. \u201cThanks for cheering me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know that looking thankful and embarrassed made your little child form adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww!\u201d Ruby cooed and wrapped you into a tight hug. \u201cAnytime. It\u2019s what Leaders do. Make sure everyone is okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point you noticed something. You felt your Aura drain slightly as she clutched you. Maybe physical contact with girls WAS causing them to act motherly or like an older sister. It would explain why Yang was willing to bring you back to her room. She had been holding your hand and hugged you a couple times, so your Semblance affected her. When you were grabbing her boobs last night, you felt yourself drain too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were making them want to pamper you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that the true effect of your Semblance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pondered this, you realized Ruby wasn\u2019t letting you go. It felt nice being hugged by a cute girl. Being alone in Beacon sucked and you never had a girlfriend. She might not have been as developed as her sister, but no one could say Ruby wasn\u2019t attractive in her own way. Your head was kind of in her chest and you felt your lower body react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Ruby said, loosening her grip at last and the drain to your Aura lessened. \u201cDo you have something in your pocket?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Nope!\u201d You stammered, embarrassed. \u201cI just\u2026 bathroom! Yep, bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed into her bathroom and locked the door before she could do anything. You splashed some cold water on your face and looked in the mirror. Your child face stared back. In all tense and purpose, you were yourself when you were like 10 or so. The difference was your lower region and your memories/intelligence. Those two points you were still yourself. That caused some problems, as the girls turned you on and it was much more noticeable. You didn\u2019t have much choice but to use the chance to quickly relieve yourself into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d You told Ruby, coming out a few minutes later. \u201cReally had to go. This kid body is kind of weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird?\u201d Ruby said, holding out her hand for you. She really shouldn\u2019t have, but you appreciated the gesture. Yang must have told her about your worries about people taking advantage of you. \u201cHow so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMostly I get tired really easily,\u201d You say slowly, not wanting to tell her about what you suspected. You experimented as you held her hand and left the room with her. You pushed more Aura into her and could feel your strength leaving faster. You then concentrated to slow the transfer and you felt the drain stop. So the drowsiness was because of that! \u201cPlus everything is much bigger and I\u2019m weaker. I\u2019m not sure what the point of my Semblance is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little lie wouldn\u2019t hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can understand being smaller than others,\u201d Ruby said, tightening her grip on your hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow until much later than the other kids in Patch and Yang was always the one defending me. It sucks being small, but I know you\u2019ll grow out of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Ruby,\u201d You reply. \u201cThat means a lot. You\u2019re a great team leader.\u201d She beamed and then blushed at your praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you try using your power more on her now while alone in the hallways or wait and rest up. Get some breakfast with her team and see how Yang treats you after a night of contact?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Glad you're finally awake.\" She didn't have to point out the obvious, but it was clear she was sadden to a degree over your current status. She motions you to come sit by her and you happily obliged the boxer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake, Weiss, this is Anon,\" Yang introduced you, \"Anon, this is Blake and Weiss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already knew them, well you knew who they were, but you still exchanged greetings with the other two members of Yang's team. \"I wasn't too much of a problem last night was I?\" You asked the four.

It was very unusual to have someone who looks like a child sleep in the same room with us I will admit.\" Weiss answered as the passive field made her think momentarily about how cute you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew. That's nice.

You ate a lot more than you expected with your body, but maybe it was because your Semblance was always active. Part of you wanted to experiment more with your power, but Ruby\u2019s speech from earlier came to mind. You always wanted to be a Huntsman and you be damned if you let it end because your Semblance is stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you off too, Anon?\u201d Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taking Ruby\u2019s advice to heart.\u201d You replied. \u201cI\u2019ll see you all later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d Blake asked, her eyes watching you leave. She was able to keep calm while your Passive Field affected her, but she still found you cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told him not to give up on his dreams,\u201d Ruby said, puffing out her chest proudly. \u201cEven if his body changed, it didn\u2019t change who he is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, impressive.\u201d Weiss complimented. \u201cMaybe we can trust you to be around him.\u201d She twirled the fork in her hand around. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of cute like thought though.

However, you had a trick to it and it collapsed into two more manageable hand axes. They were a little big for you, but you were able to hold them. Practicing on a training dummy, you found out while your Aura was still active, you didn\u2019t have nearly the same strength. At your current level, you would have to try a bit to beat a simple Beowolf one on one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCussing, you turned your axes into guns and turned the training drone into scraps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you could fight to some degree. That was a silver lining in all this. You sat down and grabbed a towel to wipe off all the sweat as you thought about it. You weren\u2019t helpless, so that was good. You would just have to retrain this body to make it stronger. As it grew stronger, your Aura would too. Maybe you could gain better control of it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long shot, but you were hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the way girls acted around you. Now that you had plenty of time to think, you realize that their strange behavior only started when they were near you. Those that came into physical contact with you were more susceptible. Yang would be the one under your influence the most, followed by Ruby. If you were interested in trying to do more with them, you would have to make sure all four girls were under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad, Anon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped and turned around to see\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or leave them with no mind. For example you can possess Glynda, turn off her mind, and treat her like a living sex doll until you possess her again and turn her mind back on. Or you could possess Ruby, leave a mental note for her to dress up in gothic clothes, or give her the need to strip naked when you and her are alone. Another example would be possessing Weiss and leave her with a changed memory where she thinks she has a date with you later that day.<br>\r\n2: Once you reach a certain strength you can possess multiple girls at once. Max # is six.<br>\r\n3: Much like the above you can later use this offensively by turning a limb into a liquid blade.<br>\r\n4: You can sneak around easily. You could crawl up a wall, go through a vent, and eavesdrop as if it's no one's business but your own. <br>\r\n5: If a girl willingly lets you possess her, you can pool your auras together.<br>\r\n6: You can be creative with more pros. Use your head.<br>\r\n<b>Cons:</b><br>\r\n1: This is obviously going to be an aura intensive semblance. Thankfully, you will not be stuck in slime form or stuck as a girl forever when the aura runs out. You'll go back to normal, or be ejected and then turned back to normal. <br>\r\n2: This also depends on the strength of the victim's will. You can't just turn into a puddle of slime, shoot up Raven's vagoo and not expect her to fight back. If she didn't see it happening or was asleep then you would have an easier time. <br>\r\n3: Surprising no one, if you possess Yang and she gets hit you will feel the pain too. Also, if you're in liquid form and someone steps on you you will feel that when you go back to normal.<br>\r\n4: If you get hit hard enough you can be knocked out of a girl. For example, if you're possessing Pyrrha and you get hit by a speeding rhino grimm she's going to cough you up. <br>\r\n5: Guys will hit on you. Such is the fate of those who take over the bodies of cute fictional girls. Girls will probably hit on you too. The experts still haven't come to a conclusion if having sex with a girl while possessing a girl yourself is gay. <br>\r\n6: You read all of this rambling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Neutral:</b> Unlike in the story that inspired this idea you cannot alter your victims' bodies. If this is a negative or a positive is up to you. </span></div></div>",

You aren't all that divine to be honest. You're basically stuck between a demigod and minor deity, but you aren't a mortal anymore at least. Using your newfound powers you travel to Remnant to have fun since the Grimm Brothers left it. Maybe once you convert enough women to the worship of you, you can become a full fledged god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: Aliens? Is such a thing possible? Yes: You're a motherfugging ayy lmao. You belong to a race of aliens that might as well be humans with bizzare powers. You are also what amounts to an alien freshman college student who came to Remnant to collect data for a report when the moment your ship was about to take off Grimm attack, and you're now stranded. It's not so bad as there are a lot of cuties on this planet. Your ability is being able to manipulate the aura of humans to manipulate them physically and mentally. You could leave Blake with an addiction to your cum, or drastically alter Ruby's body where she's now a lamia. If you're into snekgirls that is. You could also just make Yang's tits twice their usual size. However, using this ability will give your target a feeling of unease. They will feel unseen hands touching them, and become nauseated.  </span></div></div>",

Good luck with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\">3: Werewolves of Vale AWOO!:</span> This one will not be a semblance, but an extra ability. You know the usual bit about you being a student at Beacon who lost his team due to the breach? Yeah we're still doing that. But this time you don't gain a semblance that will let you enslave the girls, your semblance is telepathy and you had when you became a student. No. Feeling bummed about losing your friends, you go to the Emerald Forest to let loose some steam, where you find a part of the ancient ruins not previously found before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter curiosity getting the better of you, you find an ancient totem dating back to original humanity's era embedded with an ancient power. You touch it, and suddenly you're transforming into a werewolf that looks like a Skyrim one because reasons. Any girl you bite or scratch will also be able to turn you into a werewolf, and will have an imprint in their mind that you are their alpha. You are the packmaster who must be obeyed. You and them will be able to turn into your wolf forms at least 3 times a day.  </span></div></div>",

Ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started your hunt with Yang Xiao Long. In a move never before seen or repeated you go for her boobs. Instead of certain death that should have resulted from this, you instead got to hold onto her tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the first piece of your new girlfriend obtained, you target another member of team Rwby next. Blake Belladonna's Bella booty was now yours. You had it in your hands anyway, but you would consider putting some girl parts on you in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha was nicer than you thought she'd be but your new girlfriend would need legs. So once you snatched up all of Niko's lower body from the ass down you went on your way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to her to have Neo's hair, but as it turned out, if you take off someone's head, that was the part of them that was considered a person, not the rest of the body. Luckily you changed that by putting her eyes and mouth on her body, above her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, your girlfriend would have a head but she didn't have eyes or a mouth. Luckily, after some testing you found that some one only needed one of those things to have their conscience. So you took Ruby's eyes and Weiss's mouth when they were at lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you had tits, an ass, legs, a head with cool hair, some eyes, and a mouth. Checking the list of what makes a human a human, you still needed a torso, and a pair of arms. Anything else would be small and less important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora swings around a big hammer, so her arms <i>must</i> be good. You grab them when she digs into some pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to take the torso of this weird red head named Penny but your semblance didn't work on her for some reason. So instead, you took the torso of the women next to her. You think her name was Fall or something? She kinda looked like Weiss, but whatever. It was silly to see her tits attached to her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you had all the body parts you needed, you went about creating your perfect girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you tried to put Pyrrha's legs onto Blake's ass...and it worked. <br>\r\nExcitement filled your body as you began to put the girl together more and more. You put Winters upper body on the hips and slapped Yang's tits onto there. You finished the body by putting on Nora's strong arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked exquisite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time to admire your work yet, you're not done. You put the head atop the shoulders. Just two more things, you put Weiss's mouth under the nose and then<br>\r\nOne after the other. The eyes go in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bolt of lighting outside punctuating your projects completion, she woke up. She was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello? Maker?\" She asked \"What am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken aback by the beauty you created. The best parts of all girls with Weiss's angelic voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my girlfriend.\" You tell her, appreciating your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am?\" She asked a blush illuminating her custom face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You tell her \"Your name is Francine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francine...I like it.\" She smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a perfect name for a perfect girl.\" You tell her \"How much do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Know general things.\" She said \"I know you made me, I know what words are. I have basic knowledge but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay to need to learn.\" You tell her \"We're at a school right now. Beacon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beacon? The hunter place?\" She asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'm a student here, but my team is kinda...dead and gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh..\" She said \"Could I join your team?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe? If you get in? But a team needs four people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't you just make yourself more girlfriends?\" Francine looks at the empty beds \"I'd like to not be the only one of me.\"</span></div></div>",
