Not to mention that she had to try her best not to stare at the various people they walked past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff was enjoying this so far, once at the beach, he could deepen his all-body tan, and see if any girls his age would mind hanging out with him.  He may have to ditch or find a guy for his sister, but he was sure that's he'd be able to cross that bridge once he got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking it to the beach without incident, Jeff took off for the ocean, leaving Danni behind to decide what to do while here.</span></div></div>",

Jeff looked at the aliens walking around, they looked like the classic greys, but aside from some sort of hi-tech looking collar and a belt with a holster, the aliens were naked.  And they had a few with classic looking ray guns, weird discs and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff,\" Danni asked, getting Jeff's attention, \"What do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the aliens, Jeff took a deep breath before answering, trying not to freak her out, \"We need to alert the rest of the resort, and let the authorities handle this.  Two kids and the hotel manager won't really be good first contact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni nodded and they scooted down the rocks, intent on getting someone important quickly when Jeff slipped, sending some rocks tumbling down the side of the boulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>AHGDB VUINMU</i>!\" They heard a dual-toned voice yell over the rocks.  Looking at each other, the siblings hopped down and started sprinting away to the resort, not wanting to get caught by potentially hostile aliens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the resort, they saw the various naked beachgoers start panicking just as they heard a humming noise behind them.  Danni peaked over her shoulder and saw the UFO flying quickly after them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get inside!\"  Jeff yelled, grabbing his sisters hand and they watched as the UFO opened fire, cars turned to dust and the various resort visitors and employees disappeared.  Then the ship landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aliens began zapping everyone that hadn't been zapped by their ship, and they started loading them up onto the ship.  Jeff saw that their parents were among the captured people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad.\"  He muttered to himself, \"Really bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni slapped him, \"You don't think I know that?  Now what're we gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the aliens, he saw they were primarily using robots to load up the humans, if they'd wanted to, they could, maybe, sneak aboard and try to save everybody.  Otherwise they'd just have to hide and hope they wouldn't be taken too. </span></div></div>",

This is the only way we have a chance at winning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni didn't like it, but her brother was right, and she nodded her head, crouching low, and got ready to follow her brother aboard the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce and opening showed itself, Jeff and Danni took off running, managing to get to the ramp unhindered by alien or machine, and followed the drones carrying the captured humans to what looked like a storage room.  Looking around at all their fellow resort patrons, each suspended in an orange, jello-like substance, the two siblings looked for their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni shivered as they walked between the pods, the room was colder than it was outside, and being naked, she didn't have much for insulation.  \"See them yet?\"  She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff shook his head, \"Not yet.  Might be up ahead here.\"  He pointed around a corner, where more pods could be seen suspended from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two siblings continued, they suddenly fell to the ground as the ship lurched upwards, the two siblings looked at each other with grim realization: the ship took off.  The momentum was so great, the two were practically stuck laying on the ground until the ship left atmosphere, when they started to drift in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird.\"  Jeff said as he grabbed onto a railing on the ceiling, trying not to look at his sisters floating breasts, which were fairly obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Danni said, also trying to avoid looking at her brothers floating penis.  The two siblings bobbed around a bit more before getting the hang of zero-g maneuvering and continued to look for their parents, but saw no sign of them in the storage room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure you saw them getting taken aboard?\"  Danni asked nervously, tears threatening to spill from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff nodded looking at the only door in the room, the one that led to the rest of the ship, \"I'm positive.  They must be in another storage room.\"  He didn't want to consider the possibility that he was wrong, but he didn't need his sister to see his fear.</span></div></div>",

After all, it wasn't my first time at a nudist resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuberty had been reasonably kind to me so far.  I wasn't uncomfortable about my shape, and I didn't get covered in zits like some kids.  It was just the whole sex thing.  I was fourteen years old and couldn't help having a hormonal reaction to seeing people naked and being seen naked.  In the normal, textile world, this was an adolescent boy's fantasy and I was either a dream or a nightmare.  Either way, it felt weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe here too.  I could see that, despite being more comfortable with nudism than I was, Jeff wasn't having any more luck controlling the hormones.  He was trying to hide an erection by staying close to the counter.  Come to that, even Dad wasn't exactly limp.  I shuddered involuntarily and looked away.  It least for me it wasn't so obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMum and Dad checked us in and we went up to our suite.  It consisted of three bedrooms, a big bathroom with a bath and a shower, and an open-plan lounge and kitchenette that opened out onto a semi-private balcony overlooking the pool.  Beyond the pool were tennis courts, and beyond them the beach.  Off to the left was a golf course and to the right a lush forest with trails for hiking, biking and even - it said in the brochure - horseback riding, every other day.  That was the one thing I was most looking forward to, but I didn't see any horses today.  Perhaps tomorrow, then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time we were unpacked, I was feeling more normal.  The initial burst of hormones and anxiety had worn off and I was ready to go and enjoy the sun and the breeze on my skin.  Jeff came out of his room, his boner deflated.  It looked like he had acclimatized too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you kids going to do first?\" asked Mum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swim,\" we both said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.  Stick together, you two,\" she said. \"At least until we all know our way around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff and I grabbed towels and ran downstairs.  We stepped out onto the patio and considered our options.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pool was right here, but there were already lots of people in and around it.  Little kids splashing and making noise, adults lounging in and out of the water and old people doing slow laps.  But it was right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beach was a few hundred yards away beyond the tennis courts.  Out there we could probably find some space to ourselves, and once in the water our nakedness wouldn't be so obvious, but it was much further to go... past the busy tennis courts... in the nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you want to go?\" asked Jeff.</span></div></div>",

He gave me the creeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the beach might not be comfortable either, but I was confident I'd feel better on the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beach,\" I said, and started toward the tennis courts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's what I was thinking too,\" said Jeff, falling in beside me.  \"Did you see that creepy guy at the end of the pool.  He looked like a Mafia guy or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly.  I'm sure he's a perfectly nice man.  But yeah, a bit creepy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked quickly past the tennis courts.  Neither of us wanted to take too long about it, but we didn't want to look uncomfortable about it either, much less jiggle our jiggly bits by running past.  That didn't seem to be troubling the tennis players though.  They were quite happily throwing themselves around the court after their balls - balls and other jiggly bits jiggling like mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got past the tennis courts we made the mistake of glancing at each other, and both burst out laughing.  Alright, we're here now.  That's probably the worst of the tension gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe mounted the dunes and surveyed the beach.  Right in front were two beach volleyball nets where older teenagers and twenty-somethings were leaping and diving for a different kind of ball.  They all looked so relaxed about being naked together.  I was feeling less self-conscious, but was still envious that they could feel that comfortable, while I couldn't.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo either side and down the beach, naked people of all ages, shapes and sizes were clustered in small groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about over there?\"  Jeff said, pointing along the beach to the right, toward an area close to the rocks at the end of the beach where there were fewer people.  It would also take us past a veritable smorgasbord of sunbathing teenage and twenty-something girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perv,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not...\" he stammered, \"I just thought you'd like somewhere a bit quieter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, boner boy,\" I said.  And then, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe made our way down the beach, Jeff trying to pretend he wasn't trying to look at the girls, but also wasn't trying not to look, and failing on both counts.  By the time we got to the end of the beach, he was stiff as a board again, and bright red.  He dropped his towel and ran into the sea to cool off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spread my towel on the sand and took a moment to take in my surroundings.  The sea certainly looked inviting.  The sun was warm, the breeze was light and the rocks were just begging to be explored too.  What to do?</span></div></div>",

We toweled off and sat bare-assed on the sand, the towels around our shoulders to fend off the stiffening breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" said Jeff, pointing out to sea.  There was a big launch sitting off shore.  We could just make out the white-clad crew and scantily-clad (but clad) passengers on board.  Some sort of party boat, or executive play-thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you suppose they've come to gawk at the nudists?\" I said, all anxiety long-since washed away by the exercise and sea air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, probably,\" said Jeff.  Wanna give 'em a show?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.  No point making it easy for them, it'll just encourage them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now, then,\" he said, laying back on the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't -\" I stopped.  There had been big a splash behind the boat and then its engines suddenly roared into life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff, look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe propped himself up on his elbows, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something went into the sea behind the launch - something big - and now it's taking off.\"  The launch swung around in a wide semi-circle and roared away to our right.  Soon it would disappear beyond the rocky headland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I think the something was a person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff jumped to his feet, leaving his towel in a damp clump on the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up too, brushing the sand from my bottom, towel still around my shoulders.  Sure enough, there was an arm waving from the wake of the launch.  I couldn't make out anything about the person it was attached to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\"  Jeff took off down the beach toward the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff!  What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's got to go in after them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...!\"  There was no point arguing.  He was diving full-length into the first of the breakers.  He was a strong swimmer - best in his class - but it was a long way out there.  Not to mention that he was naked, and we had no idea who it was that had been shoved into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked along the beach toward the resort.  There was almost no one left on the beach, now.  Just a few of the volleyball bunnies, packing up their stuff.  The sunbathers and assorted others had all already gone in to get \"dressed\" for dinner.  Some of them would be back after dark, no doubt, for now there was nobody around to help.  I looked out to sea again, checking Jeff's progress.  He was past the breakers, swimming strongly.  I needed to make a decision...</span></div></div>",

I stopped to check Jeff's progress again.  He had slowed his pace a bit, but was still swimming strongly, about half way between me and the castaway.  I struck out after him, pacing myself so that I would have some energy left for the swim back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had reached about where Jeff had been when I heard the throaty growl of a marine engine coming closer.  I stopped again, treading low in the water to see who or what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the launch.  It had come back!  I looked quickly around for Jeff.  He had reached the man, for a man it was, who had been thrown overboard.  The man waved frantically in the direction of the beach and the two of them turned and starting swimming toward me.  It was clear that the man wasn't keen on being picked up again by the launch.  He wasn't a strong swimmer - too much splash and not enough pull.  Jeff was easily outpacing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he couldn't outpace the launch.  It swooped in, planting itself between me and Jeff.  I was still low in the water, barely moving.   I cast an eye along the length of the boat, but it appeared that nobody had noticed me.  I started swimming cautiously toward the boat, breast stroke so that I could keep my eye on it and minimize noise and splash.  I couldn't see Jeff, or the man, or any of the people on the launch, clustered as they were on the other side of the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got closer though, I could hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up here, kid,\" came a harsh male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, I can swim back by myself,\" said Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wouldn't dream of letting you do that, would we Precious?\" came the harsh voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Charlie, we couldn't do that.\"  A female voice.  Simpering, like the gun molls in old movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a splash, then the dull splatty thump of flesh hitting the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's naked,\" came another male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bunch o' nudists on this beach.\"  Mr. Harsh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, look at his little winkie.\"  The simpering Miss Precious again.  I winced on Jeff's behalf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take him below and get him a robe, Precious,\" said Mr Harsh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Charlie.  Come on, Winkie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel Jeff's cheeks going red from where I was, by then holding onto a rail on the tailgate of the launch.  I heard a door creak and then the irregular thumping of two pairs of feet going downstairs.  The door closed with a creak, a thump and a click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you got him?\" asked Mr. Harsh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there, boss.\"  Another new voice.  He pronounced it \"bawss\".  These gangsters were so cliche!  Next thing you know they'll be doing double-tap assassinations with silenced pistols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwip! Swip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit!  Oh my God, I didn't mean it!  Shit!!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head started pounding and I started shaking.  Did they really just shoot that guy?  It certainly sounded like it - just like the silencers in the movies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brother has been kidnapped by murdering gangsters, I'm hanging off the back of their boat hundreds of yards off-shore in my birthday suit, and nobody knows we're here.  Shit!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a shuffling and clattering of feet on the deck.  The engine sputtered, then roared.  What do I do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

An old man walked by, shook his head understandingly, and laughed. As she looked around, she realized that she was being a bit silly, because everyone else around her was nude too and nobody was ogling. She started to let down her guard, as the security personnel, basically they were a bunch of armed naked people, checked their bags for contraband. They were looking for stuff like cameras, camcorders, drugs, weapons etc. The whole process was pretty quick. Then the assistant camp director, an elderly woman named Carol greeted them. Carol informed them of all the rules and regulations. She then told them of all the fun stuff that they could do around the camp. She informed them that this was no ordinary naturist camp; this camp had everything you could want and more. Danni smiled, she couldn\u2019t wait to have some fun, but it was now getting close 10:00 pm and the fatigue of this long trip was starting to overcome her. She could barley keep her eyes open.

She peeked out her window and saw a medium sized boat, docking near by. The boat wasn\u2019t strange, since the camp was located next to the ocean, but what was on board intrigued her. She saw several men, wearing military style clothes on board. She then saw some of the camp security guards who were also fully clothed in military style clothes, walking up to them and shacking hands. She then saw several metal boxes being offloaded and transported by truck to an old barn. She watched them for about a half hour, and then the mysteries boat sailed away.

The twins looked around, feeling around for the ship just in case it had a cloaking device, but nothing.  It wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's their engine scorch mark.\"  Jeff pointed at the dark, ashy spot in the center of the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni tried to hold it together, she really did, but the fact that the only aliens who took them, and could more than likely get them home, and had that lady they were going to sell, were gone was just too much.  She dropped to her knees and started crying, she wanted to go home!  She would never complain about going to the nudist resort again if she could just see their house, heck even their basement, again!  She felt Jeff wrapping his arms around her in a somewhat awkward hug considering their state of undress.  She just leaned into his shoulder and cried herself dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was done, she looked up at Jeff, \"What're we gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff shrugged, looking just as sad, but holding back tears to stat brave for her, \"I'm not sure, but we'll figure it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two!\"  They heard someone call them.  Looking behind themselves, they saw an alien that looked like an English bulldog centaur, \"You two gotta problem with the Kukoo?\"  At their nod, he waved them over, \"C'mere, I gotta job for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Just to set the tone for what follows: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_WvP4bVKs\" target=\"_blank\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oM_WvP4bVK...</a>)</span></div></div>",

Danni whimpered, pulling her legs up to her chest and trying to stay as small as she could, she could feel the room gentle swaying, meaning that they were on a spaceship.  Wait, a spaceship?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering that they were going to transport that woman off world, she decided to check and see if she was here with her.  The storage room they were in was massive, she counted at least thirty unique aliens all confused and panicky, or almost comatose, and almost all of them were trying to hide one or more parts of their bodies.  She'd tried asking around if anyone saw the woman, but while she could understand everyone, no one could understand her, she was the only one with the translator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Makes sense,' Danni said to herself, 'everyone here is supposed to be from a primitive world like Earth.'

As he slid into the water, he noticed how warm it was, not too hot, but hot enough that's there was a faint layer of steam, adding to the natural beauty of the area.  Of course, once Kree jumped in and splashed him with water, any response in his mind died when he saw how her wet fur clung to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she said as she walked over to him, the water was only waist deep, \"where were we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff gulped, \"Uhh, taking s bath?\"  He held up a bar of soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKree chuckled, \"Well, yes.\"  She walked two of her fingers up his chest, \"But I was talking about earlier...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Jeff nodded dumbly, \"right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKree smiled and grabbed the bar of soap, \"I clean your back, you clean mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff nodded mutely, and after a very tense and somewhat awkward cleaning by both of them, they were rinsing themselves off when Kree grabbed Jeff's hand.  \"Jeff, you're the first male that I've ever found attractive.\"  She looked into his eyes, \"Tell me if I'm right in how you feel about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff blushed, and stammered for a bit, but just when Kree looked absolutely crestfallen, he took a gamble, grabbed her shoulders, and kissed her good and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth their minds went blank at the sensations of their first kisses, and they enjoyed the moment.  Which was ruined of course when Jeff got out and Kree started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Jeff couldn't help but feel lost at her amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shrank!\"  She giggled, pointing at his hips, which caused him to look down and immediately cover himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That- that happens!\"  He stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKree climbed out and took his hands, \"I think it's cute.\"  She kissed him on the cheek again before leading him forward, \"Now, let's dry ourselves off, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff blushed agin so hard he was afraid it'd be permanent as he followed her to where the towels were stored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi, Danni, and Roune were all high-fiving at the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you worried about them?\"  Roune asked Chi, gesturing to the two lovebirds, er, bats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi shook he head, \"Nah.

Danni pulls a level and liquid starts to leak. \"Quickly, Jeff, grab her!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear something?\" One of the soldiers asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No man, you must be imagining things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman falls and Jeff stops her, he noticed that he was grabbing one of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you get a boner I'll kick your butt.\" Danni warns her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you give me a hand instead of threatening me?\" Jeff can't hold the woman any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni and Jeff are carrying the woman through the barn, suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, here\u00b4s a spot without tape.\" One of the soldiers observes. \"And is this water?\" He peeks. \"Who's there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! We need to get out of here!\" said Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins were scared, they knew they were trapped, so they closed their eyes, waiting for the worst, however, all went silent.</span></div></div>",
