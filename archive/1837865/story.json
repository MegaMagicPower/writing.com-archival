He already knew how to do all these things, why did he have to go to kindergarten? He was glad when he spotted Nancy, ready to take him and Kimmy home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy walked the two little kindergartners out of the classroom. Kimmy talked ecstaticly about how much she enjoyed having her Daddy in her class, the latter remaining silent all the way to the car. Nancy lifted each of them into their respective car seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimmy looked at her kidified Daddy. \"I'm happy that we go to class together now Daddy\" she tells him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was boring\" Tim bluntly replies, \"Today has been so strange\".

Nancy helped the two of the out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house, Nancy had the two watch TV while she unloaded some things from the car. Tim knew that these were probably items she had bought for him in this regressed state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he saw that Nancy had finished unloading, he darted towards her. He didn't know why, but he clung his arms around his wife, buring his head in her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy knelt down to hug the little boy back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was surprised to find himself tearing up, since he hadn't cried in years. \"I don't know how I'm gonna live like this\" he tells Nancy.

Mommy was lost in thought\" Nancy felt funny referring to herself as Tim's \"Mommy\", she knew she couldn't call Tim her husband out in public since it would now cause a lot of confusion.  Nevertheless she was relieved that her earlier observations was just paranoia about Tim becoming a girl.  For now her little Timmy was still a little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon her little Timmy lets out a yawn.  \"Im tiwed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go home then sweetheart\" Nancy soothes her little Timmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim allows his wife to pick him up.

As she looked through the fridge and freezer, the 14 year old was having a hard time focusing with her tot-father still screaming in her arms.  Growing more and more frustrated, Kelly just grabs the first thing she sees, making a plain PJ sandwhich for her father - she had to set Tim down at his table seat (usually meant for Kimmy), but even then her father's whining for \"Mommy\" proved very tiresome for the teenage daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fixing the plate, Kelly places in in front of Tim, who then throws his lunch at his daughter.  \"HEY!\" yells Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zatz not ha Mommy makes it!\" Tim screams at his daughter.

She looks in dread at her crying father, the sight was breaking her heart.  Without a second thought, the 14 year old grabs her toddler father and hugs him tightly.  \"Don't cry Daddy.  It's ok.  It's ok.  I wasn't trying to be mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toddler looks up to his daughter.  \"You hate me nah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad no!!! Don't say that.

Being reduced to a mere 4 year old must have triggered and brought out the more childish parts of her father, which he had otherwise grown out of.  Kelly shifts her father in her arms so that he'd be looking directly at her.  \"Daddy I know this must all be very hard for you to deal with.  I'd probably be doing the same if I was in your shoes.  But try to see the positives of this\"  Kelly says to her father<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wik wat?\" asks Tim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I could be carrying a baby in my arms instead\" replies Kelly.  \"Although I bet you would make a cute baby Daddy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim abruptly shakes his head \"No.  Me no babi.  Me wike 4 bettah\" he insists.  Kelly giggles at her father's childish reaction.  Tim looks up at her again.  \"Do yu fohgif me Kewi?\"  Tim asks shyly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I forgive you.\"  Kelly replies before kissing her father on the forehead.  \"I love you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wuf ya too\" says Tim, hugging Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still hungry?\" asks Kelly.  Tim nods.  \"I'll clean this up afterwards\" she adds.  So lunch went more smoothly this time around.

Since then Nancy has been attending the support group, making friends with the other members.  She brings Tim along to play with the other AR'ed children.  At first she was anxious in front of thr group but with some help from Sarah she opened up to her fellow support group friends.  She and Sarah also got more comfortable with one another - both Brad and Kelly suspect that Sarah might be flirting with their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tim, as Nancy thought would happen, showed more and more signs of mental regression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy?\" asks Tim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sweety?\" says Nancy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kimi wunt weev me awon\" says Tim. He was strapped firmly in his booster seat, stuck between Brad and an all too eager Kimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanna play Daddy\" replies Kimmy, still tugging on her daddy-turned-baby-brother's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh iz hutz\" whines Tim. Even the former father could only take so much of his youngest daughter - though he wasn't really mentally an adult anymore. \"Mommy, plez tew Kimi ta zop!\" The toddler whines to his former wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kimmy\" Nancy says, her voice firm and authoritive. Kimmy stopped what she was doing upon hearing her mother's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Daddy\" Kimmy apologizes. She was the only one who still called Tim by \"Daddy\"; everyone else just called him \"Timmy\" or some cutesy nickname like \"sweety\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iz owkwa Kimi. I fowgif ya\" Tim replies, smiling at Kimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toddler wanted to reached out (as far as the booster seat allowed) to hug Kimmy, but out of nowhere a flash of light hits him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, you two look so adorable\" comments Kelly from the front, phone in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kewi, twat waz ta bwite!\" whines Tim, who was still rubbing his eyes from the camera flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're always so cute I can't help it. Just look at you!\" Kelly says before bringing her phone up to her siblings faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim looked at the photo of him and Kimmy. \"Im zo tinwee\" comments Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, you are quite the little bundle, 'BABY BROTHER'\" Kelly says while pinching her former father's cheeks. The latter never liked it when the former pinched his cheeks like that. He preferred Brad rubbing his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, wha we gowing?\" Tim asks curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, why are you calling Mommy 'Mommy' too?\" Kimmy hijacks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becuz shez my Mommy\" Tim replies with glee. Ever since the regression Tim would address Nancy as \"Mommy\". This was mostly for when out in public- although sometimes his family wondered if he was forgotting that his \"Mommy\" used to be his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's my Mommy and you're my Daddy\" Kimmy insists<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And ya my big sistah Kimi\" Tim tells Kimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy chuckles at their little exchange. \"Well Mommy's taking you all somewhere special\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wike wat?\" Tim asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw... we ...de yed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be a few hours before we arrive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha not naw!\" shouts Tim. He was now kicking his feet back in forth, impatient about when they will be wherever it was they were going. \"Go quickah Mommy!\" he kepted yelling. This annoyed not just Brad or Kelly, who was trying to listen to her music, but Nancy too; it was becoming very difficult for her to focus on the road while hearing her former husband's tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweety we will ge there when we get there\" Nancy firmly responds. She was trying very hard to not get agitated at her former husband, but he proved to be quite a handful ever since his regression. Fortunately the tone of her voice was enough to make the little boy quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sowwieee\" Tim sheepishly apologizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgive you sweety.\" Nancy replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wuv ya Mommy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too sweety\". Nancy missed being able to love her husband in a \"special\" way, however little Timmy was still her special little sweetheart. Sometimes she wondered if the man-turned-tot ever recalled the \"special ways\" in which they would love eachother, or if his regressed mind was now too innocent to remember, or understood, such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I azo wuv cawwing ya Mommy\" Tim adds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy chuckles. \"I know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim, not wanting to upset his \"Mommy\", waited patiently for this suprise \"Mommy\" had for him. However as he sat idly, it became more and more difficult for him to stay awake. The vibrations of the car speeding through the highway were very soothing to his small body. Before long, the man-turned-tot was sound asleep, strapped firmly into his booster seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly quietly takes a picture of her sleeping father (turning off the flash so that he wouldn't wake up). After cueing over the photo, Kelly turns to her mother. \"Mom, do you think Dad will ever change back to his proper age?\" She asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What makes you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because every little boy grows up\" Nancy jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess that means Dad is stuck like this?\" Kelly comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid so.\" Nancy answers \"but this isn't neccesarily a bad thing.  Just a big change that's all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going exactly?\" Kelly asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy replies \"well since Tim is asleep, I'm taking us to -\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The man-turned-tot sat in his wife-turned-mother's lap as she rubbed the sunblock on his back.  He eyed both Brad and Kelly, who were already enjoying themselves, and grew impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huwwi upp!\" Tim yells<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your tone\" Nancy replies sternly.  She had just finished applying the sunblock on and she was moving on to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh ewi wons out tah!\" whines Tim.  He shut his eyes as the sticky sunblock was applied to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here and so is Kimmy\" says Nancy, Kimmy was sitting right next to her building sandcastles.  Nancy finishes the face and says \"just one more spot\" and rubs a little sunblock on Tim's legs - and then lightly tickles the tot's feet.  She liked making Tim giggle, and it always put him in a good mood.  \"There all done.  Stay close to Kelly, ok?\" Nancy tells Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the tot just stands in front of Nancy.  \"Yah wook pwetti Mommy\" Tim comments, looking at the light-blue one-piece swimsuit Nancy was wearing.  Even considering his regression, he was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, thank you sweety\" replies Nancy, who places a big kiss on Tim's forehead.  The toddler still stood there, looking timid and lost in thought.  Nancy knew quickly what her Timmy was probably thinking.  Even though he had mentally regressed into a 4 year old too, Tim still very clearly remembered when Nancy had been his wife and hoe much he loved her - loved her in such a way that was impossible for him now.  Leaning forward to Tim, Nancy says \"you can still kiss me here if you want\", turning her cheek towards Tim.  The tot's eyes widened so Nancy simply nodded, her cheek waiting for Tim's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 4 year old Tim was a little nervous, but taking a good look at Nancy in her swimsuit allowed him to muster up his courage.  4 year old Tim leaned in and kiss Nancy on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww thanks handsome\" teases Nancy who pulls Tim for a hug.  The latter was giggling again.  \"So you wanna play in the ocean?\" asks Nancy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim shakes his head and says \"I wanna stah here fah naw\", snuggling up against Nancy, sitting in her lap as her embrace tightened a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok sweet\" Nancy says as she watches the waves with her little Timmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour had passed, Kelly and Brad were still in the water while Nancy watched Kimmy and Timmy build sandcastles.  Nancy kept the two under her supervision.  When it looked like Kimmy's castle had fallen, which upsetted Timmy, Nancy decided to join in the help build a better sandcastle.  The mother was able to show her youngest daughter and former husband how to make a strong sand castle, afterwards Kimmy and Timmy did whatever they wanted with it as Nancy watched.  Both Kimmy and Timmy were having fun, Nancy smiled at the two.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy always loved children.  Perhaps part of it was that her own children reminded her of her own days as a youthful child.  Days she sometimes wished she could relive, had it not been for the responsibilities she had as a mother (and especially the added responsibility of raising her tot husband).  She didn't mind being an adult - though she honestly wouldn't mind being a young adult again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the distance she notices a group of men flirting with women.  She starts wondering, now that Tim is more of a son to her than husband, about dating again - which was the actual reason she decided to take the kids to the beach.  She knew there would a lot of young handsome men out about.  There was one concern she had however, a concern she was reminded of as her looks down at her own body.  \"I'm getting old\" she thinks to herself; she had become rather insecure about her age for a while now.  Sure she wasn't like old old, but she was getting old nevertheless.  While she could have looked for middle-aged men as potential partners, Nancy had become attracted to younger men - \"or I could always try dating younger women too\" Nancy thinks to herself, Sarah coming to mind.  She looks at herself again.  \"Does Sarah think I'm old?\" Nancy thinks to herself, \"maybe she'd like me more if I was younger - heck if I was as young as those young girls in their 20s over their I'd be able to pick one of those men\" she thinks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy then realizes that both Kelly and Brad are returning to their spot at the beach.  She knew she could always leave Kelly in charge if she decided to pick up a date here - given that they stay at their cabin considering she was only 14 (as much as Kelly wanted to pretend she was an adult).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waves at Kelly and Brad when...</span></div></div>",

Her family surrounded her, speechless and in shock.  \"Mommy am I sick?\" Kimmy asks, only to cover her mouth right after.  Her voice sounded funny.  And that was when she realized that her body felt different, and everything looked smaller too.  There was also something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to my swimsuit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire family made it back to their hotel room without causing much disturbance.  Now that they had privacy, the entire family, save for Tim who was taking a nap, sat at the table.  \"Sweety, how do you feel?\" Nancy asks, staring anxiously alongside Brad and Kelly at Kimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My tummy don't hurt anymore\" Kimmy replies, oblivious to the shock on her mom's and siblings' faces.  Kimmy stretches her arms back, noticing how long her arms were now.  \"Look at how big I've grown\" she says.  The 5 year old was a 5 year old no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You literally a grown up now!\" shouts Brad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably around 18 now sweety\" explains Nancy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair!  I can't believe my little sister's an adult before me!\" complains Kelly, who was particularly jealous of Kimmy's now fully developed body.  \"She's even bigger than me!\" she adds, looking enviously at Kimmy's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am silly\" laughs Kimmy, oblivious to her ... assets...  Kimmy gets up from the table to look at herself in the mirror.  \"I'm so pretty, just like Mommy\" Kimmy says while looking at her reflection.  She really did look almost like a younger version of Nancy, give or take some of her father's traits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we should probably find somewhere to get you some new clothes so that you don't have to keep borrowing mine\" comments Nancy.  She had given Kimmy the white sundress she had packed for this trip.  \"I didn't exactly bring enough clothes for the two of use to share for long\" Nancy adds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimmy looks back at her mother and says \"but can I keep this one.  It's so pretty\", twirling around as she looks at her reflection again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but only for this trip\" Nancy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was still upset over her little sister being older than her now.  \"This is so not fair!\" she complains<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't cry baby sister, one day you'll grow up into a beautiful young lady\" replies Kimmy, patting Kelly on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby sister???\" shrieks Kelly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause now that I'm the oldest that makes you my baby sister\" Kimmy proclaims.  Kelly runs off to her designated bedroom, slamming the door.  \"What did I do?\" asks Kimmy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly turns to Brad \"why don't you go play that little game system of your's.  Kimmy and I need to have... a private talk between us ladies\".  Brad simply nods and heads to one of the bedrooms to play his Nintendo Switch.  Nancy sets Kimmy down on the couch beside her to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do I get to do grown up things Mommy?\" Kimmy asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, maybe you should start calling me 'Mom' instead of 'Mommy'.  People would think it's weird for an 18 year old to still call her mother 'Mommy'\" says Nancy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ok I guess\" Kimmy replies gloomy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, there are some basics I need to go over with you now that you're... an adult...\" Nancy says before pausing.  \"Jesus, I can't believe you're already a grown woman.  It was literally only yesterday when you were my little girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are rules, but I thought grown ups could do whatever they wanted!\" whines Kimmy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Kimmy, there are responsibilities that come with being an adult.  And there are still laws that adults have to follow too.  And you literally leaped straight from childhood to adulthood so there's a lot of maturing you've missed out on.  Which is why I am going to help you transition into your adulthood\" Nancy explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ok\" was all Kimmy replied with<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kimmy, you're not a child anymore, please be more respectful\" Nancy says sternly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Mommy - I mean Mom\" Kimmy replies.  She chuckles, realizing how tricky this \"adulting\" is.  \"Ok, I'm ready Mom\" Kimmy says more respectfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  Now first I'm going to lay out a few rules before I start going over the basics of adulthood.  Rule 1, until you've mastered 'adulting' you will need to be under my supervision or ask for my permission before you do anything.  Rule 2, it would would be useful for you to do some homeschool when we return home from this trip \" Nancy says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home school?  But I already go to school\" Kimmy replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kindergarten is for 5 year olds dear.  You are 18 now, you would typically be in your last year of high school or entering college..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I get to go to college now?!\" Kimmy asks, her face lit up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure to be honest sweety.  You can't really go to school anymore so entering college might be out of the question.  But that doesn't mean you can't find a good job that doesn't require college\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to work!!!\" whines Kimmy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your tone young lady.  And that is rule 3, you should start trying to work now that you are an adult.  Obviously you will still be living with us - after all I would never abandon my baby out in the lonely world\" Nancy says, pinching Kimmy's cheeks.  \"Sorry sweety, still not used to seeing you so grown up.  Anyway those are the three rules.  Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that her mother would not take no for an answer, Kimmy nods and says \"Yes ma'am.  I am ready for your wisdom\".  She covers her mouth \"I never heard that word before. wisdom.  I even know what it means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy replies \"strange, but it could be that if your father experienced mental regression along with his physical regression then maybe your brain has developed too.  You probably have a expanded vocabulary now that you're grown up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"cool\" Kimmy says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, now let's start\" says Nancy, who begins explaining to Kimmy everything about adulthood...  yes including \"the birds and the bees\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken Nancy several hours to explain to Kimmy all the basics of adulthood.  Kimmy felt a little nauseous over some.. certain details.  \"Gross Mom\" Kimmy whines<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry dear, you'll get used to it quickly\" replies Nancy.  Nancy then helps Kimmy up from the couch, holding both hands and just looking at the 18 year old image of her daughter - her daughter who had only been a 5 year old mere hours ago but was now becoming a woman.  They really do grow up so fast.  \"So Kimmy, what would you like to do on your first night as an adult?\" Nancy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimmy has some trouble thinking of something so Nancy decides to help suggest something.  They end up deciding on....</span></div></div>",

The former man was rather shy in his current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And preK is a good opportunity to help you adjust to being 4 sweety\" replies Nancy.

Taking Nancy's hand, Tim follows his \"Mommy\" into the school.  It took a while before Tim could enter the preK class since Nancy had to register him and fill out some documents for the time being.  Once he was dropped off at the preK, Tim was left alone amongst the other preschoolers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evwi onz zo big na\" Tim remarks shyly, it was very surreal to be at eye level with all these preschoolers who were staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class, we have a newcomer.  His name's Timmy\" the preK teacher says, addressing Tim to the entire class<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hie...\" Tim says sheepishly.  To everyone else he came off as a very shy 4 year old.  Even when several preschoolers surrounded him with welcoming faces he felt very intimidated.  Sure they were friendly enough but the former man knew that he did not belong here, in this environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the teacher somewhat forced Tim to play with the other children, so here he was playing duplos with some preschoolers.  The more time he spent in the classroom, the more and more Tim began to feel hopeless about getting his former age back.  As the day went on, more and more was it harder to separate himself from his peers.  Even the teacher seemed above him now.  And it didn't help that he had already gotten back a toddler lisp from the regression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was rather relieved when Nancy returned to pick him up.  Even if that meant meeting Brad and Kimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Dad!

Kelly though she tried not to show it was amused that her father could now wear her hand-me downs though Tim would not have known if not for the fact that when everyone else was looking for the phone book Kelly whispered to Tim that she would let her sit on her lap. Kimmy was bursting with happiness and unlike Kelly made no attempt to hide it, she went on about the games she would play with her little sister, about how pretty Tia would look in one of her dresses. After breakfast Tim was forced to go keep Kimmy busy by playing with her while Nancy talked to Brad and Kelly.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately the only other thing he could focus on was the fact that he was now sitting in Kimmy's spare feeding seat while being spoon fed cereal by his wife.  Nancy even made him wear a bib.  His focus though was shifted once again when Kimmy, who was sitting right next to him, asked ,\"Mommy, does this mean that Daddy will going to kindergarten with me?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy's much too young even for kindergarten now sweety\" Nancy responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimmy, out of innocent curiosity, asked, \"how old is Daddy now?\", not realizing that merely bringing light of the situation made her regressed father feel all the more humiliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"probably around 4 years old dear\" Nancy answered, \"he's even a little bit smaller than you now Kimmy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"can we not talk about this\" Tim asked gently, though in his petite form, which was blushing a little, rather than project authority, it ended up making his teenage daughter's eyes lit up, who then began to cue over how cute her Daddy looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone was finished with their breakfast, the family gathered in the living room to discuss the situation.  Everyone's attention was on Tim, who was being held in Kelly's lap (he was probably going to be held in his wife's lap but Kelly pleaded her mother to let her hold her tot Daddy).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy was the first one to speak on the matter, \"so we are going to have to make a quick visit to the doctor so that they can check up on your father and make sure the virus won't regress him further\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"are the doctors going to be able... to change Dad back\" Brad asked his mother<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy forced a smile before answering that question, \"while they can make sure that the virus won't regress your father any further, there is no known way to reverse the virus.  So it's very likely that your father will probably just have to grow up all over again\".  When Nancy said this, everyone's attention was directed towards Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean Daddy can't be Daddy anymore\" Kimmy asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be little but I'm still your father you know\" Tim retorted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Daddy, as if you can still be called our father\" Kelly pointed out while looking down at her father, \"you might as well be our new baby brother now that you're even younger than Kimmy.  You're even wearing Brad's old clothes now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim, while you are still my husband and the father of our children, Kelly does have a point\" Nancy said.  While Tim did not like where this was going, he had to admit that Nancy was right.  Like who would take a 4 year old seriously - especially out in public.  Nancy continued, \"first we will all head to the hospital to make sure your father isn't going to regress more.  After that, we will talk more about the changes that will be happening in the household\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"changes?\" Tim asked in an unintentionally cute manner that almost made Kelly squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"don't worry honey, I'm not going to make you call me 'Mommy' or anything like that.  But I suggest you should start thinking of me as your 'surrogate mother' rather than as your wife from now on.  Same with our children; you'll essentially be treated as though you were their baby brother.  Also keep in mind that you'll be treated no differently than any other little boy, with a set bedtime and everything.\" Nancy explained.  As much as he didn't want this, Tim knew this was the only logical decision to make in lite of his regression, simply letting out a soft \"ok\" to his wife.  Nancy then proceeded to tell the family to get in the car.  Tim was about to jump off his teenage daughter's lap, however Kelly stopped him, proceeding to carry him in her arms as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Kelly, I'm still old enough to walk by myself\" Tim protested.  His teenage daughter however insisted that since he would have had to be lifted up again to be placed in the spare booster car seat that she might as well save the trouble and carry him the way there.  \"Besides Daddy, you're so cute!\" Kelly added as she strapped and buckled her father-turned-surrogate baby brother into the booster seat.  Once Tim was strapped firmly in his seat, Kelly proceeding to claim the booster seat now that she was the only one old enough to ride in front with Nancy.  Brad was sitting in the back seat of the car, while Kimmy was strapped in her booster seat in the middle of the car, next to Tim's seat.  Kelly had a big smile on her face at the image of her father strapped in a booster seat alongside Kimmy as Nacny began to start the car.  Kimmy was expressing joy at being able to sit next to her Daddy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim on the other hand felt almost trapped in the booster seat, as his mobility was extremely limited to his head, arms and legs while his body as a whole was held tight by the straps and buckle.  He tried not to think too much about it, since he knew he was going to have to get used to this and since it was a 35 minute drive to the hospital.  Instead he just sat idly as the car exited the neighborhood.  Once they were on the highway, Tim noticed that he was feeling tired, likely because of the vibration of the moving car soothing his tiny body.  It was only 5 minutes later when he finally succumbed to slumber....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By the time Nancy had turned off the car, Brad had already been complaining about being cooped up in the back, impatient to get out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, go ahead and unbuckle Kimmy so that Brad can get out the car\" Nancy told her oldest daughter.  Kelly however complained that she wanted to unbuckle her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I really wanted to unbuckle Daddy - or should I be calling him Timmy now since.. you know\" Kelly protested while bringing the sleeping form of the father-turned-toddler to Nancy's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well 1) he is still your father... for the time being  2) Don't you think you had enough fun humiliating your father.\" Nancy retorted her oldest.  She then added with a little grin \" and 3) I want to have some fun too\".  Nancy seemed to have convinced her oldest who proceeded to unbuckle the still awake Kimmy.  Grabbing her purse, Nancy got out of the car and opened the car door next to Tim, who was still asleep in his booster seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy paused to look at her sleeping husband (or soon-to-be-son in lite of the situation), and she couldn't help but smile at the little boy.  Even though he had just had his life turned upside down, being reduced from a loving husband and father of 3 kids to a 4 year old little boy.  While she had teased about being Tim's new mother, Nancy understood how hard this must all be for Tim to process and accept.  And yet in spite of that, he looked so peaceful in his sleeping form.  Nancy began to wonder what the little boy had been dreaming of as she unbuckled him.  Whatever he had been dreaming about, Tim was now slowly waking up to his wife unbuckling him from his car seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up Tim, we've arrived at the hospital\" Nancy softly said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took so long?\" Tim yawned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fell asleep silly\" Nancy told Tim as she lifted him out of the car seat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I please walk on my own now?\" Tim said in Nancy's arms while rubbing his eyes <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still look a little tired sweety, and we are a little bit far from the closest elevator.  So how about I carry you until we get to the waiting room dear?  And then you can be free to walk all you want... just stay within my view and hold my hand when we walk together.  That sound good?\" Nancy said to Tim.  Tim though knew this was not a request; Nancy was not asking for his permission but rather telling him.  And because he was still a little drowsy from the nap, he simply nodded to his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the Hospital<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy was able to get an appointment set rather quickly (since it was a rather urgent matter and the hospital was instructed to keep the virus a secret).  She then joined the rest of the family in the waiting room.  Everyone was sitting, including Tim; he wasn't that much into the idea of playing with the kids' toys present in the waiting room so he was willingly sitting in Kelly's lap once again, her left arm holding him in place while her right hand was twirling his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minute they were called in by the doctors, who guided them to the check up room.  Keeping with her promise, Nancy held her regressed husband's hand while they walked to the check up room before lifting him up to the check up room's table.  Tim's doctor greeted them before coming to Tim.  The doctor started with the usual check up on Tim, checking his ears and heart pulse and all that other stuff.  Afterwards the doctor said, \"Well Tim, it looks like everything about your body is exactly that of a perfectly healthy young little boy such as yourse..\" the doctor stopped himself on the last part and apologized<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it's fine\" Tim responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for the regression virus, we've been able to observe from the virus more closely with your dna sample from your normal adult body\" the doctor told Tim, \"we will just need one more sample from your current body so that we can determine if there will be anymore effects from the virus.  a blood sample should do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile any other 4 year old would have panicked, Tim sat calmly as the doctor got a little blood sample from him (it did hurt a but though).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 30 minutes of waiting, the doctor returned, with certain papers in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... is the virus going to make him get even younger?\" Nancy nervously asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor replied with...</span></div></div>",

Back to his senses, the baby Tim had a completely blank look on his face.  He was also feeling full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... all done.. I guess\" Nancy shyly said to the baby before setting him down on the changing platform - only this time positioning him so that he would be looking away as she buttoned up her shirt.  Tim just stared at the wall trying to make sense of what the hell had just happened the last few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"please don't tell me I will have to be doing this again\" was all Tim could think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Nancy picked the baby back up, and exited the changing room to meet up with the rest of the family, who were now waiting in the checkout line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Instead he was wondering several things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wondering how he was going to adjust to this change.  Being a baby, he couldn't really act as a father figure for his kids or as a husband for Nancy; he might as well be the baby of the family.  And he didn't know if he could bear another breast feeding another time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also wondering whether he would be able to remember everything about his old life, or if his regressed brain will slowly make him forget everything.  And if the latter, would that make him a baby in body AND mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also wondering whether or not the virus was truly gone now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, eventually he grew tired of Kimmy making faces in front of him.

For one, sitting in one's own \"little messes\" was not all that amusing for the former man.  Then there was having to be taken care of by his own children, who were beginning to treat him more as a baby sibling than a father figure.  Not to mention his \"meals\" just boiled down to baby milk (every day he dreaded having to do that ever again) - or making a mess of himself with whatever baby food.  He missed being an independent adult and responsible father figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several weeks as a baby however, Tim began to realize just how much easier his life had become.  Yes he did lose the independence of adulthood, but now he could spend his days just sitting around, maybe crawl to some places, and play with the baby toys Nancy bought for him.  He no longer needed to worry about providing for his family, especially since they were given a a life-worth of savings by the government to cover for the damage caused by the virus.  He didn't even have to worry about what was going to be for dinner anymore, now that everything was provided for him.  And while he could never love Nancy as a spouse ever again, he had to admit that Nancy was making for a good mother; he loved listening to her lovely voice sing him lullabies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like he was mentally regressing or anything, he still had the mind of an adult.  It's just that the former man decided that life was much easier as a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could just grow up all over again anyway.</span></div></div>",

As confused as Nancy was at the situation, she was for certain that this young girl was in fact her son, Brad.  For one she basically looked like a female version of Brad, albeit with longer hair, especially when wearing those Buzz Lightyear pajamas.  Also mother's instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweety,... come here\" Nancy told the new girl who was starting to tear up.  Not knowing what else to do, Brad darted towards Nancy, burying her face in her mother's midwasit, her hands clinging onto her mother's sweater and crying violently.  Nancy gently wrapped her arms around the crying girl, doing the best she could to comfort her \"daughter\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what's goin- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious as to the source of the voice, Brad looked from her mother's embrace, spotting Kelly standing there, holding Tim in her arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fucking way\" Kelly said out aloud much to Brad's annoyance.  It was made worse when baby Tim started laughing.  Immediately Brad buried herself back in her mother's embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy drove the female Brad up to the doctor, having placed Kelly in charge of watching over Tim and Kimmy.  The receptionist, recognizing Nancy, asked who the \"little girl was\", when Nancy whispered to the receptionist, the receptionist stood still for a few seconds before calling their doctor from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sat down next to her mother in the waiting room, nervous about being out in public.... like this.  Her mother made her wear some of Kelly's old clothes, so she was stuck in a mini-skirt for the time being.  She was still allowed to wear her favorite light jacket though, at least some semblance of her former \"boyhood\" left.  Though even then she still felt out of place in this girlier clothes.  And it didn't help that she noticed some boy across the waiting room trying to tease her with a bunch of mean faces.  Despite trying to ignore the rude boy, the waiting room bully persisted.  \"I hope my friends aren't the same way....\" Brad thought to herself, afraid that her friends from school would want to stop being friends with her now that she was no longer a boy.  The boys and girls in his class never really got along with each other very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon a nurse called their names, directing them out of the waiting room.  Seeing that they would be passing the rude boy, Brad decided to take the opportunity to stick her tongue out at the boy.  However a few seconds later Brad processed at what he had just done.  \"Oh my gosh, I'm already acting like a girl\" she thought to herself while following her mother and the nurse to the doctor's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some tests, and a quick blood sample, the doctor came to the confusion that Brad's sudden gender change was the result of one cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"but I thought the virus only regresses physical age\" a confused Nancy asked the doctor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this, this is a bit of a shock to us too, but considering that we have been seeing other occurrences of similar cases in some subjects, it may be possible that the virus has been able to evolve and become even more unpredictable in how it changes the body and dna.  So gender change is no longer out of the question\" the doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and I take it that this change is... permanent?\" asked Nancy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"for the time being, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT I DON'T TO BE A GIRL!\" whined Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look at it this way, from the looks of your blood samples it doesn't seem like the virus is strong enough anymore to cause anymore transformations to your body - likely\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad started to tear up again.  \"What am I going to do\".  Nancy knelt down to Brad, wrapping her arms around the crying girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure this out sweety\" Nancy assured her \"daughter\", \"It's fortunate that only your gender changed though; we won't have to have you switch grades with Kimmy or anyone\" this was Nancy's attempt to lighten up the situation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But will friends will hate me now\" Brad whined<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they won't hate you, sweety\" Nancy assured<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and what if they do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well even if they do leave you over your gender, that just means that they didn't deserve your friendship anyway\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"not helping mom\" brad whined<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will figure this out sweety.  Just put your trust in me, ok?  I've lived though girlhood, so I can help you adjust to your new gender.  Sound like a plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once upon hearing her mother's words, Brad looked up and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were back at the car, Nancy let Brad sit in the shotgun seat to try to cheer her up.<br>\r\n\"I don't have to go to school.. .like this yet, do I\" Brad asked her mother<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Nancy muses before answering</span></div></div>",

It didn't help that her Mom made her wear some of Kelly's old clothes, and it especially did not help that it felt really really weird walking around in the skirt.  \"How can anyone walk in this?\" Bradley thinks to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Bradley was not willing to present herself to the class, the teacher proceed with the news.  \"I'm sure some of you have heard about some people getting sick and transforming.  Well...  Bradley here, he got sick recently.   Well actually he is now a she...\"  Once the teacher was done, Bradley walking towards her desk as quietly as possible.  Even as she sat in her seat, everyone was just staring at her.  She couldn't concentrate on what the teacher was writing on the board because it always felt as though someone was just staring at her, that all anyone could focus on was her.  The last thing she needed right now was to be the center of attention.  She couldn't deal with all this pressure.  She couldn't take it anymore.  She wanted to cry out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout so much of a \"excuse me Mrs Ellie\" or without even raising her hand for a hall pass, Bradley darted out the classroom for the nearest restroom she could find.  Finding a restroom, she wasted no time to lock herself in one of the stalls.  She then wasted no time folding her arms, burying her head into them as she wailed out tears.  Locking herself in the restroom, she also remembered that something was missing between her legs.  She started to cry even harder.  This was all too much for her to take in all at once.  She never asked to be a girl, she was perfectly happy withing being a boy.  And she also never asked to have a baby as a father either.  It was all because of that damned virus that her life has been turning upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew not how much time had passed by the time her tears stopped, all she knew was that she was too worn out to cry another tear right now.  Unlocking the stall door, she steadily walked out - and froze at the sight of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit\" Bradley cursed in her head.  She realized that there were several urinals right beside her.  She had entered the boys room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad?

There was one more concern however.  \"and the bad news?\" Nancy asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor took a sec to clean his glasses before answering her question, \"Well for one, we don't have any known means to reverse the damage done by the virus.\"  That sentence alone was enough to seal Tim's fate, but there was still more.  The doctor continued \"and while the body is functioning normally again, since the virus is still in him there is a slight chance that there will also be some mental regression as well.  We aren't too sure about that detail, but just be prepared for if this young boy starts acting more like a young boy anytime soon\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs scary as the last part was to Tim, all he was thinking about was that he can no longer his kids' father and he would have to relive childhood in the care of his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you all some time alone to discuss this matter while I get you the required documents\" the doctor said, closing the door behind him as he exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess we won't be calling you Dad anymore\" Brad stated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't look that way\" Tim replied as Kelly brought him down to the floor.  Kimmy, was a good few inches taller than him now, went up to Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise to be like a good big sister for you\" Kimmy said.  Tim was still not amused that his own kids were treating him like he was their baby brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy knelt down to Tim, telling him that everything was going to be alright.  It was however not alright to Tim who began to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great... now I'm crying like a baby\" Tim cried.  Seeing her husband succumb to his regressed body's sensations, Nancy pulled Tim in for a hug, holding him tightly and giving him emotional support as he buried his face in under her head.  The rest of the family joined in on the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards the doctor had Tim sign some documents the best he could, said documents essentially serving the purpose forfeiting his adult life, marriage and job included, all the while agreeing to be legally recognized as a minor.  After he had signed the documents, Nancy was given some documents to sign as well which included completing the \"divorce\" and becoming Tim's new legal guardian.  Once all the papers were signed, the doctor told the family to expect the documents to be sent to the government and filed in within a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, now that Tim was no longer her husband, instead now her \"newly adopted son\", Nancy contemplated on what to do next as she buckled her former husband in his booster seat.  Tim didn't fall asleep on the car ride home, instead just staring at the faint reflection of his regressed toddler body in the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were home, the family began to have the leftover steak and mac&amp;cheese for lunch at the table.  Tim, sitting in what was now his feeding seat, was obviously given a smaller plate than before - with the meat cut up in little bite size pieces as knifes were too dangerous for toddlers - and a little sippy cut of water.  Lunch was rather slow as the kids spent more time watching their former father struggle to use his small fork pick up the meat to eat than they did eating.  It was especially intriguing for the kids to watch their former father turned little brother make a mess of himself as he tried to eat the mac&amp;cheese, getting it all over the seat and himself.  When lunch was finally over, Nancy cleaned Tim and the seat with wipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it just about the same story at dinner time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter which Tim was directed towards Brad's room for bedtime.  Brad didn't mind sleeping on a sleeping bag on the floor for one night, while Tim slept on the bed.  While it took no time for Brad to fall asleep, Tim struggled to fall asleep at first, still trying to process what had happened this day.  Though eventually he dozed off....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are the plans for tomorrow?</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for him, one of the caretakers at the daycare came over to persuade him to go play with the other children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim, remember that your mother said to try interact with other kids\" the caretaker softly but firmly instructed him, \"your mother\" referring to Nancy which Tim was still not used to, nor was he sure that he ever wanted to get used to.  <br>\r\nNot wanting to be bothered further by the caretaker, Tim forced himself to a spot where several kids were at.  After he sat down, he took note of what the kids around him were playing with: building blocks, figures, duplo, or whatever it was kids played with these days.  Of course, none of these interested the former grown man, regardless however he forced himself to grab some building blocks to build a tower or something.  While randomly stacking the blocks, Tim recalled the events of the morning that led up to this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim sat idle in the booster seat as Nancy dropped Brad and Kimmy off at school - Nancy walked Kimmy to the class to make sure she was safe, so Tim was under the watchful eye of Kelly, who was still teasing him about \"how cute he was\", during the duration of that time.  Once Nancy returned, they were headed off to drop Kelly off at high school.  After she got her things, before heading to the school, Kelly made sure to say goodbye to Tim - by giving him a little kiss on the forehead while telling him \"Have fun little buddy\", the \"little buddy\" part especially making Tim want to scold Kelly for patronizing him.  However now that he was no longer an authority figure in Kelly's life, there was not much he could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the kids at school, Tim had expected his former wife, now surrogate mother, to drive him back home. however after several minutes more of riding in the car, Tim realized that they were not going the way back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh. ..  Nan.... I mean..... mmMommy...\" Tim asked while struggling to refer to his former wife as mother, even more with addressing her as \"mommy\" specifically, \"where exactly are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can't have you sleeping in Brad's bed forever dear, so I'm going to run a few errands to get you some new things for this new life of yours\" Nancy answered.  \"However\", she continued, \"I'm going to be dropping you off at a daycare first\".  It took Tim a few seconds to process that last part Nancy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why........\" Tim complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I think you need to get used to being around other kids your 'age' dear\" Nancy answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I really don't want to be out in public... like this\" Tim pouted in an admittedly childish manner fitting for an actual 4 year old<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing I can do about that dear.  As far as everyone else, including the government, is concerned you're a 4 year old little boy.  And with no way to change you back, you're going to stay like that until you grow up along with every other child.  Therefore you need to get used to being with other children your 'age' dear\" Nancy retorted.  \"Also, daycare might help you accept your new life\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim didn't bother to continue arguing with Nancy, instead just sitting back in the booster seat until they had arrived at the daycare.  Once Tim was unbuckled and lifted out of the car seat, he and Nancy walked towards the daycare, with Nancy holding his hand along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they met the instructors of the daycare, Nancy had a little talk with one of the caretakers while Tim waited by her.  After a little talk from Nancy urging him to play with the other children and maybe try to make some friends, Tim was left at the daycare while Nancy headed off to run errands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to present...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim continued to \"play\" with the building blocks, being as uncreative about it as possible, putting in the minimum effort needed to satisfy the caretakers.  Just stack, knock over, repeat.  He kept cycling through this pattern until he heard another voice - talking to him. \"Can I play with you\" was what Tim heard, realizing that one of the other children had gone up to him.  He turned his head to look at the child who wanted to play with him, seeing that the child was a</span></div></div>",

Tim tried to see if he could ignore the boy some more.  It didn't work however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok if you don't have one\" the little boy said, clearly in reference to his transformer figure, \"we can just play with the blocks if you want\".  Tim looked at the boy in front of him again.  Even though he was sitting, Tim could tell that this boy was probably bigger than him by a few inches in height.  The former man found it rather surreal and uncomfortable how technically this 6 year old boy was now technically his \"elder\", along with probably a good amount of the children in this daycare.  Another thing he was going to have to get used to whether he liked it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was going to try to ignore the boy again, but unfortunately for him the caretaker from earlier came by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go play with Matthew, Tim\" the caretaker said to Tim; so the little boy had a name.  Knowing that the caretaker wasn't going to leave him alone if he refused, Tim hesitantly invited Matthew to play with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you build a tower if you like\" Matthew kindly said.  Again, Tim hesitantly played along, even tho he didn't have any real interest in the blocks.  Though he admittedly soon found that playing with the blocks was a little bit more enjoyable.  Soon they had a decent sized tower, and Tim got an idea when he remembered the transformer toy Matthew had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm.. you know, giant robots like to destroy buildings\" Tim said to Matthew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about you?\" Matthew replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh..\" Tim uttered, looking around himself for anything.  Eyeing an extra block, he said, \"I'll just pretend that this is a giant robot\", grabbing onto the extra block<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew smiled.  \"Ok\" he said.  In no time soon, the two were smashing the block tower down with their \"giant robots\", making sure to leave as much impact as possible (or what they could imagine at least).  With the tower gone, Matthew got an idea of his own.  \"Wanna fight me\" he suggested.  Tim nodded as he proceeded to bump the block in his hand against the transformer (though making sure not to be to break the transformer toy).  So for the next several minutes the two fought with their \"giant robots\".  However, soon it was clear that the block was no match for the transformer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won\" Matthew exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. well...\" Tim stuttered, for he realized that for some reason he was feeling something foreign yet recognizable to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" Matthew asked as Tim started to tear up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair\" Tim whined, \"My robot died\".  Tim had no idea why he, a grown man (in a toddler's body granted) was crying over having lost in a make believe giant robot fight.  But all he knew was that he was an upset little boy sad that he lost.  However before he could really start crying, he saw Matthew come in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't trying to hurt your feelings\" Matthew said to try to comfort the crying Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... my.. robot iz... dead..\" Tim whined<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, little buddy.  We can fix your robot\" Matthew replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Tim retorted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this\".  Before Tim could say anything else, Matthew picked up the block and started doing something with his hand around the block, almost as though he was trying to mime a mechanic with a wrench.  \"See, all better\" Matthew said as he handed the block back to Tim's hands.  Now Tim, still a grown man on the inside, knew that this was just a block and Matthew's little hand gestures did not change the block in any way.  At the same time however, Tim couldn't help but get cheerful, in a rather childish, gleeful way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay, my robot is alive\" Tim exclaimed, happy that his \"giant robot\" was \"fixed\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna play some more\" Matthew asked.  With that Tim nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more rounds, where Tim won some but Matthew admittedly won more (though it was ok because Matthew would always repair Tim's giant robot for him), Tim started to warm up to Matthew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old are you\" Matthew suddenly asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ummm... fourt - I mean four\" Tim say, making sure to correct himself before he said his technically real age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four, uhh?  I have a little brother your age who's a bit of a pest\" Matthew responded.  Tim got scared all of a suddent.  \"But you're cool for a four year old\" Matthew added, much to Tim's relief.  \"i'm 6 years old myself, almost done with kindergarten and entering 1st grade next\" Matthew explained to Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think I turn 5 in the summer\" Tim said, remembering that his birthday was always during summer time and that he would probably be going to school afterwards.  Something else popped into Tim's mind, \"What school do you go to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anderson Hill Elementary\" Matthew answered.  So he goes to the same school that Brad and Kimmy attend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, I have two older siblings who go to that school\" Tim replies.  All of a sudden, Matthew lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that probably means you will be going to the same school as me\" Matthew said, \"and if I recall kindergarten and 1st grade have the same recess period\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that's cool\" Tim said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so that means we can still play together later on\" Matthew said, \"in fact you could even come up to me for if you need any help with kindergarten, since I would have the proper experience\".  For some reason, Tim really liked the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you defend me if anyone is being mean to me\" Tim threw out, at which Matthew nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe think of me as a big brother type figure - only a friend instead of another family member\" Matthew offered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once Tim nodded.  And all of a sudden, for some reason he couldn't explain, he got up and hugged Matthew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owie, you're squeezing me little buddy\" Matthew playfully said, hugging you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at the moment that Nancy had come back.  \"Made a friend already Tim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim nodded while blushing, for he was sort of embarrassed that Nancy saw him like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exchanging farewells with Matthew, Tim followed Nancy back to the car where he was hoisted up back into his booster seat.  While he could not get a good look, he could tell that the back of the car was now filled with all sorts of things Nancy bought for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a little old you know\" Nancy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only by one year\" Tim whined, \"and how do you even know how old he is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, he's more like a year and a half old\" Nancy teased, \"two, I happen to be friends with his mom, Rebecca.  Don'y you remember honey?\".  Tim might have recalled something about Nancy having a friend named Rebecca, but he admittedly never really payed attention to his former wife's conversations.  \"point is\" Nancy said, leaning closer to Tim as she finished buckling him up.  \"Close enough I guess\" She finished her point as she gently kissed Tim's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Nancy started the car, Tim decided to ask, \"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going who exactly\" Nancy responded.  Tim knew exactly what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean.. where are we going now... mommy\" Tim shyly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's mommy's good boy\" Nancy chuckled, \"anyway, right now we are heading ...\"</span></div></div>",

His former wife then began to talk about some of the things she bought for him, some new clothes so that he wouldn't have to keep wearing Brad's old clothes, a small little bed for him which she commented that he and Brad would still be sharing rooms, and some other things Tim couldn't remember, for he had begun to daydream about when he would get to play with Matthew again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally arrived back home, Tim readied himself as Nancy unbuckled him from the booster seat.  \"Ok, 3... 2... 1...\" Nancy counted down before lifting Tim out of the booster seat.  \"Blast Off!\" She said in a playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim didn't seem all that amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ah, Mommy thought you'd like that\" Nancy remarks.  Tim was rather annoyed by how much Nancy seemed to be treating him as though he had always been a little boy rather than her husband before.  He was especially still a little bothered by how Nancy seemed to be enforcing this \"Mommy\" thing onto him, as though she wasn't even thinking about how he had been her husband before all this had happened.  This was made all the more obvious when she pinched his cheeks as she carried him into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor lunch Nancy made Tim a simple PJ sandwich meal, however she made it with a \"special toddler's sized\" bread she got from her errands, along with some \"pee-wee\" carrots.  As Tim tried to eat the lunch the best he could, he kept making some kind of mess with the PJ no matter how hard he tried.  Tim grumbles a bit about how uncoordinated his motor skills had become in this body as Nancy cleans him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, sweety, it's time for a nap\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's only 12\" Tim retorts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.  All little boys like you need an afternoon nap so that they can grow up big\" Nancy says as she lifts Tim into her arms, carrying him towards Brad's room.  \"I'll have Kelly help me put together your bed when she returns from school, but in the meantime you will nap in Brad's bed\" She tells Tim as she tucks him into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not tired\" Tim insists, \"I'm not really 4, I'm a grown man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>were</i> a grown man dear.  But now as far as anyone else is concerned you're a 4 year old little boy who needs his nap\" Nancy replies.  Tim knew better than to argue with his wife turned surrogate mother, knowing that he would probably be punished for disobeying her, so he just plays along as Nancy finishes tucking him into the bed.  \"Rest, little one\" Nancy speaks softly, placing a gentle kiss on Tim's forehead before turning off the lights and leaving the room, the door closed behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Tim didn't expect that he would actually fall into slumber, but soon he found that his regressed body's instincts were telling him otherwise.  Tim tried to resist his body's instincts, telling himself that he was a grown man, not a little boy.  However no matter how much he fought in his head, his body's instincts only fought back harder as he started to get drowsy.  Even he knew it, Tim was dozing off into sleep in Brad's bed, taking his from then on scheduled afternoon nap.</span></div></div>",

The reality of the situation creeping in, the man turned little boy decided to do what any little boy would do, hide under the covers while ignoring his now \"big sister\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds however, Kelly removed the covers, exposing Tim.  \"Come on little buddy, everybody else is already up and ready\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop calling me little buddy\" whined Tim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are my little buddy\"  Kelly pointed out.  As if she hadn't already gotten her point across, she lifted her former father out of the bed, carrying him towards the bathroom.  \"Whether you like it or not, I'm you big sister now, little buddy.  And besides, Mom told me to wake you up and give you a nice bath\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"as in you begged her to let you patronize me so\" Tim complained, though the teenage girl paid no attention to her former father's comment as she turned on the water to fill the bath.  It was almost a struggle for the teenage girl to undress her father turned \"baby brother\" out of his pajamas, the latter resisting the best he could.  But alas, the teenage girl finally undressed her father, placing him into the bathtub filled with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kelly was very enthused about cleaning her little father, the latter was constantly whining about having to be bathed by his own daughter.   \"No father should have to be bathed by his own daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for someone whose supposed to be my Dad, you sure are acting like a misbehaving child\" Kelly pointed out.  \"Come to think of it, I think I was better behaved at your age than you are right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, I'm not 4, I just..... look like it\" Tim awkwardly responded.  That did not come out as well as he would of liked.  Regardless he continued, \"second, girls mature faster so it's not fair to make comparisons\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize that implies that even when ignoring you current state that you're basically less mature than your own daughter\" Kelly pointed out.  Just as Tim was about to respond he stopped himself, realizing that what his daughter said was indeed correct.  Defeated, Tim stared down at the water as his daughter scrubbed his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did this have to happen to me...\" uttered Tim, the sadness expressed in the words catching Kelly's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to see her father so down, Kelly decided to try to cheer him.  \"it's going to be ok little buddy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"stop calling me little buddy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"but you are my little buddy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"but I'm supposed to be your father... And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and what?\" Kelly asked curiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I can't see you become the woman I raised you to become\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you're still here last time I checked\" Kelly responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like that.  I mean as a father\"  Tim admitted  \"they day you were born was one of the happiest days of my life, and for 14 years I have been eager to help you become a strong grown woman.  But no I won't be able see you go off into adulthood as your father.  I won't be able to know what it's like to get nervous about you having a boyfriend, or to help you get to a good college, and I especially won't be able to walk you down the isle... on your wedding day...\" Tim actually began to tear up as he spoke this.  These weren't little kid tears though, they were the tears of a father who might as well have lost everything.  However the tears began to stop once Tim felt a warm hand wipe them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to cry\" Kelly said to her father<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"but..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.  But I want you to know that you were a great father for me, and I wouldn't be the person I am today if it weren't for you.\"  Kelly continued, \"so let me repay the favor by being a good .... big sister for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that doesn't help much\" Tim uttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"but even then, in my heart, you will always be my Dad who stuck by me for all my 14 years of life thus far.\"  Kelly responded.  That last comment helped Tim feel a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still not used to this\" Tim thought to himself, though he was a little less bothered by being clean, dried, then dressed by his daughter.  Once he was all dressed up, Tim followed Kelly towards the kitchen, where Nancy hoisted him up into his table seat as the family was having pancakes for breakfast.  \"At least I won't have to be spoon fed today\" Tim thought to himself as he struggled to eat the bit sized cut peaces of pancake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy then told Tim that she was going to be running some errands to get him the necessities (new clothes, a bed, etc) for his new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to go with you?\" Tim asked his former wife, now \"mother\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Nancy's answer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Take Tim along with her for shopping while the children either tag along or stay at home<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Nancy goes to the store alone since Brad's old clothes fit Tim quite well so she already has an idea of what size to get Tim.  So instead, Kelly will watch over him and the other kids while Nancy goes shopping, in which Kelly decides to take her siblings, including Tim, to the neighborhood playground</span></div></div>",

Even when he got back on his feet, Kimmy was still a head and a half taller than her now 2 year old daddy.  Oblivious to her father\u2019s feelings on the situation, Kimmy was eager to play with her regressed daddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that Kelly\u2019s done changing you, can we go play now?\u201d she asks her father.  After the embarrassment Kelly subjected him to, Tim did not feel like putting up with more humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather play with your toys Kimmy\u201d Tim asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do want to play with my toys, with you Daddy\u201d Kimmy gleefully replied, \u201cNow that I am older than you, I get to teach you how to play!\u201d.  As annoyed as he was, Tim understood that Kimmy wasn\u2019t trying to patronize him.  Being only 5, Kimmy was just curious about her father\u2019s regressed form, and was also excited about being a big sister.  He still wished he wasn\u2019t the one in the role of little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, knowing that Kimmy was very sensitive, he didn\u2019t want to upset his little girl.  So he simply nodded and told his daughter, \u201cSure Kimmy, let\u2019s go play\u201d, pretending to be as eager as Kimmy was.  Before he could act, Kimmy picked him up the best she could, carrying him to her room.  Tim found it rather surreal how big Kimmy\u2019s room seemed now; before the regression it was fairly small, but now it seemed huge.  Kimmy set him down in what appeared to be a baby seat, which began to rock back and forth a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you stay there Daddy while I get some things from my closet\u201d Kimmy instructed Tim, who just sat idly in the baby rocking chair as she pulled out some dolls and other toys for girls her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Tim had to ask, \u201cSo what do you want to play Kimmy?\u201d<br>\r\nBefore long, Kimmy lifted Tim out of the seat as she said, \u201cTea party of course Daddy.

He was so focused on getting away from Kelly that he paid no attention where he was running towards until he suddenly bumped into someone, falling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK, dear?\" a concerned Nancy said, as she knelt down to make sure her regressed husband wasn't hurt.  Once the man-turned-tot nodded and got back on his feet, Nancy proceeded to scold him for not watching where he was going.  \"You could have gotten seriously hurt, dear\" she said firmly to Tim, as though she was addressing a child rather than her own husband much to Tim's annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I was trying to get far away from Kelly so that she wouldn't embarrass me anymore than she already has\" whined Tim, pouting and stomping his feet at his now towering wife.  However, once Tim realized what he had just done, his confrontational demeanor vanished, replaced with that of a little boy looking down in shame.  Having watched her husband act like an actual 2 year old throwing a tantrum made Nancy chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, OK, if you say so dear\" said Nancy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so humiliating\" Tim whimpered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her husband in for comforting hug, Nancy simply replied \"I know dear, I know\".  She kissed Tim's forehead, which made Tim feel a little better.  Then he felt something else, namely Nancy's fingers tickling him under the arms.<br>\r\n\"Nann--cy, wha - ar- you - doing???\" Tim tried to ask, his words being cut off with laughter.<br>\r\n\"I'm not Nancy, I'm the tickle monster!\" Nancy exclaimed excitingly as she tickled her regressed baby husband. who was trying very hard to hold in his laughter.  \"My my, your body is much more ticklish now that you're 2\" Nancy added while her husband pleaded her to stop.  He tried to cover up his weak spots, however Nancy was right in her assertion that his regressed 2 year old body was much more ticklish than his adult body. Soon Tim fully succumbed to his wife's tickling, no longer able to hold in his laughter or resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what had felt like forever (in actuality just a few minutes) he began to feel hungry, his tummy rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's hungry\" said Nancy.  She carefully lifted Tim up into her arms, holding the baby husband.  Of course Nancy decided to tickle Tim a little bit more before heading to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop... it.. it's.. not.. funny.. \" Tim try to say to his wife, his words being interrupted by bursts of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry honey.  You know how much I love little kids.  You're so cute I just couldn't resist\" said Nancy, who gave Tim one last tickle under his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was finally relieved of the tickling, Tim gave his wife a light hug, whispering to her that he was having fun anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the kitchen, Tim noticed that there was one of Kimmy's old table boost seats, from when she was a baby, strapped onto his usual spot at the table.  For him to sit in obviously.  As much as Tim did not like this, at least it was less embarrassing than Kelly changing him.  Sitting in what was for the time being his seat, Tim waiting anxiously for his wife, who was preparing a small bowl of cereal for him.  Watching her place and stir a spoon in his cereal, Tim knew that Nancy was going to be spoon feeding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of the family and I have already eaten our breakfast.. before we found you like this\" explained Nancy.  Taking her place at the table, she turned Tim's seat towards her, placing the bowl of cereal in front of him.  Preparing a spoon of cereal for him, Nancy noticed Tim looking away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, dear,\" she said, \"but you are just going to have to get used to this until we can get you back to normal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can go back to normal\" Tim retorted, still looking away from his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be so doom and gloom dear\" Nancy replied.  She gently turned her husband's head towards her with one hand, the spoon of cereal in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now open wide\" Nancy added, feeding the spoon of cereal towards Tim.  Knowing that keeping his mouth closed was pointless and because he was hungry, Tim opened his mouth, allowing the spoon to enter and exit as he chewed and swallowed the cereal.  Satisfied, Nancy prepared another spoonful of cereal as Tim readied his mouth for another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the last bite of cereal, Tim began to think about what he was going to do.  In his regressed form, he had no means to act as an authority figure to his children nor could he provide for his family.  While he was hoping that there was a way to reverse this change, Tim recognized that he was more likely than not stuck like this; that he would have to grow up all over again.  Instead of being the father of his children, he would have to live as their new baby brother, with Nancy as his mother.  That was a thought Tim did not want to spend a lot of time pondering.  So he asked Nancy what the plans were for today, to which she responded:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He is looking down with red cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok little buddy, I can get you changed real quick\"  Kelly says.  Apparently she was carrying Nancy's purse, which contained some extra diapers in case Tim had an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly is able to find the restroom, taking her father in before placing him on the changing table.  After disposing of the wet diaper, she places her former father into a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Tim was strapped into the stroller again as Kelly headed back to the rest of the family.  From his stroller, Tim thought hard about his circumstances and how his life could never be the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be the Daddy anymore\" thinks Tim, \"and even Kimmy's bigger than me\".  As much as he wanted to return to his manhood, there seemed to be little hope for the 2 year old.  \"Am I just gonna have to be the baby now?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim looks up and spots Nancy and the other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, thank you for tending to your baby brother\" Nancy says to Kelly.  While the teenage girl appreciated the praise, Tim was caught off guard by said words.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven his wife was dismissing him as a child.  Though it's not like they can really stay married anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tim could respond, Nancy unbuckles him.  \"I'll take things from here.  You go look after Brad and Kimmy now\" Nancy tells her oldest while carrying Tim in her arms.  Once Kelly hesitantly obeyed, Nancy turns to the 2 year old in her arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling any better?\" Nancy asks Tim.  She was checking to see if how her husband was handling this change well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of brief silence, Tim...</span></div></div>",

In truth, while he was going to miss adulthood and would have to readjust to being a kid again, he saw this as the perfect opportunity to bond with his only son Brad.  As a father, he never really got to spend a lot of quality time with his son due to work and attending to his oldest teenage daughter and youngest daughter.  Being stuck as a kid meant he couldn't really continue to work at his job anymore and father responsibilities were basically lifted off his shoulders now, which left him with more time to hang out with Brad.  Although he would also be lying to say that he wasn't a tiny bit curious about reliving his childhood years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dad - \" before Brad can finish, Tim interrupts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok to call me just Tim now, son.

Brad and Kimmy start heading out the door, Kelly staying since Mom typically drive her to high school.  Tim was about to follow his kids but then Nancy grabbed his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, honey you forgot something\" Nancy says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Tim whines, not wanting to fall behind, \"there wasn't anytime to get me a backpack just yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean that dear.  I haven't given you a goodbye kiss yet\" Nancy corrects him, bending downwards to place a quick kiss on Tim's now child-like cheek.  It didn't take long for the cheek to turn red.  \"Now since when did you get embarrassed from me kissing you, young man?\" Nancy remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not 42 anymore Nancy...\" Tim shyly remarks before heading off to follow Brad and Kimmy to the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her grades were average, and even though she had relatively few friends, she was very close to them. However, she always wanted to become an adult, as she was envious of the freedom they had compared to her. Sure, school allowed her to see her friends more easily, but it was still torturously boring. Also, grown-ups could go wherever they wanted whenever they wanted, while she had to stick to just wandering around her neighborhood, which was rather small. She also envied adult women for looking so attractive, and hated her own more childish features. She always sighed whenever she thought about how awesome it must be to be an adult, and was not too happy about the fact that she had to wait a few more years to actually become one. She had long forgotten how great being young was in its own right, but she was soon going to remember it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, while playing volleyball during her PE class, the girl she was partnered with accidentally hit her square in the face with the ball. After apologizing, she grabbed her hand to help her get back up, which was enough for the age virus she was unknowingly infected with to spread to Kelly. Neither of the girls paid much more attention to it than that, and went on like normal, until the next day. Their breakfast routine was interrupted by their father shouting a rather loud \"What the ?!\" upon seeing the newspapers' headline. Naturally, the rest of the family was surprised, and asked him what was wrong : <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look here ! On the front page ! A young 13-year old girl transformed into a baby !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's wife and children's jaws dropped to the floor, before they shouted in surprise in unison. Tim summed up the newspaper article to his family : <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr and Mrs Jansen had the shock of their lives when their thirteen-year old daughter Emily suddenly transformed into an infant yesterday evening. According to them, Emily started to feel weird shortly after she came home from school, but shrugged it off as just fatigue, and went to her room. About an hour later, she went to see her parents, telling them that her head hurt and she felt dizzy. Her parents went to the kitchen to fetch her some medication, only to see her clothes piled up on the floor when they got back to the living-room. After pushing them out of the way, they saw that they daughter had somehow transformed into a helpless infant. The doctor's analysis revealed that the young girl had caught an extremely rare and unpredictable disease known as the \"age virus\", which causes its victims to get older or younger at varying speeds. This disease is known to spread extremely fast and be very hard to detect without proper medical equipment until it transforms its victim's age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was surprised enough, but her blood froze when she recognized the girl mentioned in the newspaper as the girl who she played volleyball with in PE the day before. She instantly told her parents about it, and they decided to bring her to their own family doctor, Dr. Ledgewood. Nancy stayed home to take care of Brad and Kimmy, while Tim drove Kelly to the doctor as fast as he could. When they got there, Dr. Ledgewood analyzed Kelly, and discovered that she had indeed caught the virus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh... Am I going to get older or younger, Mr. Ledgewood ?<br>\r\n-Well, my dear, it seems the virus is going to rejuvenate you. I cannot tell yet how fast you will get younger, however.<br>\r\n-That can't be real... Is there anything we can do to stop this disea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kelly could finish her sentence, the virus already started to take effect.

Kelly noticed there were five chairs around the table, enough for herself, Kimmy, and three guests. \"This, \" Kimmy announced, holding up a Barbie doll wearing a pink glittered dress which it seemed Kimmy had modified herself, \"is Lady Barbie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" Kelly noted, \"she's wearing a very chick outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chick?\" Kimmy repeated, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly blushed bright pink, \"she looks very pretty\" she substituted she had meant to say the doll looked chic but had forgotten about her new limited vocabulary.

Tim sat down at the table, across little Kelly, with Nancy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly simply asked, \"Daddy, what's going to happen to me\", only to then blush in embarrassment at having called her father \"Daddy\" instead of simply \"Dad\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim said, \"I see the pills have already affected you a little bit\".

I don't wanna be a little girl again\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim responded,\"I'm sorry, sweety, but there is no known way to reverse the effects of the age regression disease.\" he continued \"we called your school about your condition and they have already transferred you to the elementary school Brad and Kimmy go to.  You will be attending the same Kindergarten class as Kimmy.  The school already knows about your condition as well as does your new teacher, whom we will be meeting with tomorrow\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly pouted, \"But DADDY!!!\", tearing up at what she had just heard.  Nancy came over to Kelly and picked up the crying teen-turned-tot.  Kelly felt a little better in her mother's arms, even though it should only be reminding her of her situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know that this is a lot to take in sweety, but everything is going to be fine.\"  Kelly began to calm down upon hearing her mother's voice.  She then asked if she can say goodbye to her friends from high school before she returns to Kindergarten.  Nancy nods at the little girl, who looks at her father and says \"I guess I will give this a try.  It's gonna be really weird though\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim comes over to Kelly and rubs his hand through her hair as he tells his little girl, \"I know sweetheart.

But these students were not her peers from high school, they were the children who attended Kimmy's Kindergarten class.  From behind the door Kelly could here the other children talking about the \"new transfer student\".  Curious, even tho she knew whom they were likely referring to, Kelly took a little peek from the door, spotting several students surrounding Kimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard that your big sister will be joining our class\"  \"but isn't she a grown up?\"  \"Actually, my mommy told me that she got sick and turned into a kid just like the rest of us!\"  \"Is it true Kimmy\"  \"When do we get to meet her?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly hid back behind the door, her face blushing violently.  Now she was even more scared of presenting this new her in front of everyone.  It wasn't fair.  She didn't ask to be turned back into a little girl, or to be put all the way back into Kindergarten.  Right now all she wanted was to meet up with her high school friends, talk about boys and their plans for life, maybe even gossip a little.  But now that life was over for Kelly.  Now she was being forced to attend the same Kindergarten class as her little sister Kimmy, to wear her clothes (for the time being), and grow up all over again.  Kelly was thinking of sneaking away and maybe try to leave school entirely, but as she was turning around, she bumped into someone.  Someone who was clearly an adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong?\" asked the figure in front of her.  Kelly looked up and saw the face of a young woman who looked to be in her late 20s or early 30s.  Before she could respond, the woman spoke again, \"Ah you must be Kelly, Kimmy's sister\", kneeling down to Kelly's eye level.  Kelly quickly realized that the woman in front of her was in fact Kimmy's, and effectively now her, teacher - Miss Swanson if she recalled was her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uh.. no..\" Kelly denied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well \"not Kelly\" how come your name tag says 'Kelly Aran'?\", Ms Swanson softly asked, as Kelly then remembered the name tag the school, and her mom, had her put on since she was a new student.  Kelly knew she couldn't talk her way out of this - especially since it might get in her trouble now that she thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"y..yes...\" Kelly sheepishly admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that this is a sudden change for you\" Ms Swanson softly consoled Kelly, \"I know that it's hard for you to go from a teenage girl in high school to a little girl again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you?\" Kelly rudely retorted.  Ms Swanson, in spite of the resistance, tried to be understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, I may have not gotten infected with a virus - but I was once your age - a teenage girl that is.  I know what it's like to be a teenage girl who just can't wait to grow up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly tried to retort, but before she could finish<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I also know what it's like to be a little girl\" Ms Swanson added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked down in shame.  \"But everyone is going to make fun of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobodies going to make fun of your sweety\" Ms Swanson gently assured.  \"how about we go in together and I help introduce you to the rest of the class, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was too familiar with this tactic; the teacher wasn't asking.  Kelly didn't want to stand in front of all those children, having them eye her in wonderment, or tease her for being \"a baby again\".  However Kelly also knew that if she tried to escape, the school will just call Mom and Dad and then she'll probably be punished no differently than if Kimmy had done the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can even hide behind my legs until introduction if that makes you feel a little better\" the teacher suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the 5 year old Kelly decides to....</span></div></div>",

At once, all the children's immediate attention was on their teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning class\" Ms Swanson greeted, the children greeted her back as a class.  Kelly had forgotten that younger elementary school kids tended to greet their teacher at the beginning of each class, someone else she will probably have to force her self to do.  \"As some of you have heard, we have a new transfer student\" Ms Swanson announced<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly buried her face into the teacher's legs, now even more scared to present herself as the newest member of the kindergarten class.  She felt Ms Swanson's hand gently caress her head, almost as if the young woman was telling her that everything was going to be ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, you can come out now\" Ms Swanson whispered to Kelly.  Knowing that she couldn't back out anyway, Kelly sheepishly revealed herself from behind the young woman, standing right in front of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"umm... hi...\" Kelly struggled to put words out of her mouth, like a stage frighten little child, \"I... I'm Kelly Aran....\"  As she finishes her sentence, she immediately notices all the stares coming all the children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you Kimmy's big sister??\" a random girl shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be, how old are you?\" another voice shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly sheepishly uttered \"I'm...  fourteen years old...\", her right hand counting to 1 and her left hand counting to 4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look fourteen!\" the same voice from before shouted.  Kelly blushed in embarrassment, running to hide behind Ms Swanson again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, dear\" the young woman gently said as she gently brought Kelly back in sight.  \"Students, remember the rules, no shouting in class and to raise your hand and wait before asking a question.  Right, Mary and Toby\" she says, addressing the two who shouted earlier.  The two kids apologized to the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now class, while Kelly is in fact Kimmy's big sister and technically actually older than each of you, she got diagnosed with a recent sickness that turned her into a little girl.  The school she used to go to doesn't accept any little girls or boys, so she will be joining our class now\" Ms Swanson explained the class.  For some reason Kelly felt a little better, but was still a little shy.  The children in front of her however seemed friendly enough at least.  Ms Swanson knelt down to Kelly, directing her attention to the empty desk next to Kimmy.  \"We reserved a desk for you next to your sister Kimmy\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,, do I have to sit right next to my sister\" Kelly whispered, not wanting to sit next to Kimmy.  It wasn't like she hated Kimmy, she was her sister after all, it's just that Kelly wanted as little reminders of what she had become as possible.  However when the teacher explained that they felt that it would help her ease into class if she sat next to someone she already knows, Kelly knew there was no point in arguing.  She proceeded to her desk, taking her spot next to Kimmy.  Kimmy seemed rather happy about her formerly big sister sitting next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you're going to kindergarten with me now\" Kimmy innocently said to Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess...\" Kelly whimpered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you all the ins and outs of this class, sis.  I'll even help you make so many new friends too!\" Kimmy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want to be with my old friends\" Kelly whimpered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well Ms Swanson once told us that life is all about making new friends, sis\" Kimmy remarked, \"Besides you'll have so much more fun here than at your other class\" Kimmy said, of course not knowing that high school students take several classes a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you think\" Kelly thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthroughout the class, Kelly starred at the whiteboard, watching Ms Swanson teach the class about Math.  These were rather simplistic addition and subtraction problems, stuff Kelly herself already knew so she couldn't help but get bored.  However she then remembered the doctor pills her parents were having her take to \"adjust\" to her regression, how the pills were going to cause her gradual mental regression over time (or make cause her to think more like her physical age).  \"I'm already saying 'Mommy' and 'Daddy' instead of mom and dad\" thought Kelly, \"... what if they make me forgot stuff too?\".  Kelly began to fear that the pills would also make her less and less intelligent, making her forget everything she knew until she was reduced to kindergarten level.  She looked back at the Math problems on the board.  She realized that even though she knew the answers to the problems that for some reason it was taking her a little longer than before to process each problem in her head.  This worried her.  \"I don't wanna be little\" she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later Kelly followed the rest of the classroom to the cafeteria.  Ms Swanson had the class line up, placing Kelly behind Kimmy so that \"Kelly wouldn't get lost\".  As patronizing as this was to Kelly, she figured it kind of made sense since she didn't know anyone else in this class thus she could easily get mixed up with another class by mistake.  Basically for now she just had to stick with Kimmy during school hours for now.  On the way to the cafeteria, Kelly recalled how each class would have some recess time after their scheduled lunch periods.  This kind of made Kelly a little happy, since she remembered enjoying recess as a kid and she thought it would be fun to play some more in this body (might as well use this body for something).</span></div></div>",

She then brought her attention back to the pouting Kelly.  \"Now Kelly, why don't you go play with your brother?\" she suggested to her regressed daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna\" pouted Kelly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case, I am not asking you to go play with your brother, I am telling you\" Nancy said as she picked up the regressed teen while directing Brad to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mom, I said it was an accident\" Brad insisted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a punishment dear\" Nancy replied,\"I just need you to keep Kelly occupied while I contact her school... and Kimmy's school\", putting Kelly down beside her formerly younger brother, who was now around a foot and a half taller than her.<br>\r\nAs their mother headed to the kitchen area to make the phone calls, Brad looked down at his now younger sister.<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do\" Brad asked Kelly<br>\r\nKelly did not want to be treated like an actual little girl while her parents were possibly arranging to have her attend Kindergarten again, however she knew that throwing a tantrum would only cause her parents to punish her in some way, so she forced herself to think of something to play with Brad.</span></div></div>",

However, as pleased as he was with his life, he still wished that it was a little more exciting at times. Little did he know that his wish would be granted soon, beyond all that he had hoped... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new, mysterious disease started spreading across the world. It was a fragile, yet very unpredictable virus, that caused whoever was infected to age faster than normal; or regress in age. There was no way to predict how a person infected by the virus could change : they could age twice as fast as normal, or even faster. Some could regress in age at the same rate they would age normally, or, once again, faster, and some unfortunate infectees could even outright transform into old folk or infants in mere seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus had only started to spread very recently, so information about it was still scarce, to the point that many believed that it was only a silly rumor, not knowing that it was a real threat. The next victim in line happened to be Kimmy, who caught it from a young woman who was working at the preschool the little girl was attending. While Tim was watching TV with his wife and eldest daughter, he heard tiny footsteps coming their way. He turned his head, and saw his youngest daughter walking towards them. However, she had trouble standing up, and didn't look so good. Tim got worried and asked her :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kimmy, what's wrong ? Are you OK ?<br>\r\n-Daddy, I don't feel so well... My tummy hurts and my head is spinning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim and Nancy feared that their daughter had caught a pretty nasty illness, and decided to go to the doctor to see what it was. After examining the little girl, the doctor came to the following conclusion :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your daughter has been infected by the age virus.<br>\r\n-The... age virus ? What's that ?<br>\r\n-Well, it's a recently-discovered disease that causes people to either age much faster than normal or regress in age. From what little we know of it, we can tell that it is very unpredictable. Some infectees can transform into old folk over months, but I've heard that some could be reverted to foetuses in mere hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim and Nancy's blood froze. They tried to hide it so as to not worry Kimmy any more than she already was, but anyone could tell that they were incredibly scared. After a moment, they asked : <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what's going to happen to our daughter ? Is she going to get older or younger, and at which speed ?<br>\r\n-Well, by the looks of it, it seems she will get...\"</span></div></div>",

Well, is there anything we can do ?<br>\r\n-Well, we haven't found a cure yet, but I've heard that a medicine that stops the virus from spreading is almost complete, so the best solution for now is to keep her away from populated areas until then. And as for Kimmy herself, I'm afraid that we have no solution for now, so we can only hope that the disease will not make her de-age too fast or spread too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim and Nancy were crushed. They could not believe what was happening. Their little girl was going to get even younger, and there was nothing they could do but pray that she didn't regress past birth. After some point, the doctor examined them to see if they were infected, but fortunately, they hadn't caught the virus yet. He did tell them though to bring Kelly and Brad to the hospital ASAP so he could check on them as well. Tim and Nancy left and drove back home, still pondering about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what about Kelly and Brad ? Were they infected by the virus as well, and got younger or older while their parents were away, or is everything OK (for now, at least) ?</span></div></div>",

With her husband Tim at work, and both Kelly and Brad hanging out with their respective friends, it was just her and Kimmy in the house right now.  Kimmy played with her dolls, dressing them up in all sorts of doll clothing, as Nancy watched from the couch.  Normally Nancy would have been running some errands, but Kimmy wanted her mother with her while she played with the dolls.  Nancy always loved little kids and watching her youngest daughter play warmed her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Kimmy came up to her mother, holding up a doll to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna play with me, Mommy?\" the little girl asked.  Nancy chuckled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure I'm not too old\" Nancy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna play with you though Mommy\" Kimmy responded, \"besides you always seem to be working, now you can have a break\".  That last part actually made Nancy consider playing with the dolls.  She always loved little kids, partly because of having been a mother of 3 children.  Though that was not the only reason, for Nancy found childhood innocence rather pure, with little children being able to live out carefree lives before they grow up in order to live in a more demanding world.  If anything she somewhat yearned for those days when she herself was just a little girl around Kimmy's age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, Nancy smiled at her daughter and said, \"I guess there's no harm in having a little fun\".  Kimmy jumped for joy and hugged her before going back to her dolls, with Nancy following from behind.  As soon as Nancy sat down near the dolls, Kimmy handed her mother a doll with long light brown hair, just like her mother's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks pretty\" Nancy said as she held the doll, \"though I think she would look even prettier in a cute dress\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know just what to give you!\" Kimmy excitedly replied as she handed her mother a yellow doll-sized sun dress, alongside some doll-sized heels, sunglasses, hat, and purse of the same color.  Even though she was an adult, Nancy found herself smiling gleefully as she undressed the doll to put her in the doll clothing her daughter gave her.  Once the doll was all dressed up, Nancy realized something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her hair seems a little messy\" she said, \"look like it needs to be brushed\".  Kimmy handed her mother a small doll-brush, while getting herself another doll-brush.  Soon the two ladies, mother and daughter, were brushing their respective doll's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now she looks ready\" Nancy said once she was done brushing the doll's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does mine look, Mommy?\" Kimmy asked, holding up a redhead doll, hair tied up in a pony tail, wearing a magenta blouse and black shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks pretty\" Nancy responded, laughing happily alongside her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you are playing with me, Mommy\" Kimmy said to her mother, \"Kelly never wants to play with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy responded with, \"Well your big sister may be so eager to be an adult now that she's 'grown up', but when she was just around your age she would always want me to play dolls with her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you ever play with her\" Kimmy asked innocently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes,\" Nancy said, \"though most of the time she would try to force her baby brother into playing dress up with her\", chuckling as she said this.  Soon her daughter chuckled as well, until the two of them were both happily laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Kimmy innocently said, \"Well even then, I hope I can be a grown up just like Kelly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...... if you ask me I would rather remain a child than be an adult\" Nancy playfully responded, \"that way I can always play with you.\"  After she said this, her youngest daughter leaned closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you go to the same kindergarten class as me if you become my age?\" the little girl innocently asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" Nancy said, a smile in her face as her daughter squealed in joy.  Then Kimmy had another thought, and thus another question to ask her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's say for some reason you had become my age and I had become your age?  That way you would be the daughter and I'd be the Mommy!\" she said gleefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now why would you want to be the mother, sweetheart?  After all, being a mother is a very hard job\" Nancy playfully asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that you can have a break and have fun, silly\" Kimmy answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy found the gesture adorable, although Kimmy was nowhere near mature enough to understand how hard it is to be a mother, and just how much responsibility comes with being an adult.  But then again, that's what Nancy found precious about childhood innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she responded to her daughter, \"Nah....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued, \"besides, I'm not ready to have you have grow up just yet\".  Kimmy, of course, innocently insisted that she would make a great mother.  The two began to let out some laughter at the remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"even then you would probably be wishing to be a child again.\" Nancy thought to herself, \"I know I do\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn honesty, Nancy was actually serious about the discussion she had with Kimmy.  She really did want to be a little girl again, so that she could escape from the pressures of adulthood.  Being an adult was hard for Nancy, not just as a mother.  Virtually every day in her life has been keeping track of finances, making sure the house was clean, making dinner for the family, and other errands.  Even when there were the few moments where she would spend time with some friends or neighbors, they would mostly talk about certain responsibilities they have as adults.  To add to that, she also felt very self-conscious about how others viewed her, even her own husband.  She never really talked to anyone about how stressed she would feel at times, instead choosing to ignore it and put on a good face for the sake of everybody else.  <br>\r\nKimmy on the other hand didn't have to worry about that.  Unlike Nancy, Kimmy was oblivious to the stress of adulthood; the only things she had to worry about was when it was time to eat or go to bed.  Even school wasn't very demanding for children her age.  Instead most of her days could be spent playing and having fun.  Nancy missed the days of when she could just be a kid, and while she was playing with Kimmy's dolls she had felt like a kid for the first time in forever.  Memories of her childhood were flooding her mind until she remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimmy noticed her mother putting down the doll.  Curious as to what was going on, she asked her mother what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just gonna get something real quick dear\" Nancy replied, \"I'll be back in a sec\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimmy let out a simple \"ok\" before playing with the dolls again as her mother headed into the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Kimmy realized her mother came back, only she was holding something in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that Mommy?\" Kimmy asked, pointing at what appeared to be an old doll in her mother's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was my favorite doll when I was your age dear\" Nancy answered, \"since I was having so much fun playing with you, I was recalling the days I was your age.  So I thought I'd bring this out again.\"  Kimmy leaned in close, observing the old doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks very old\" Kimmy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know dear,\" Nancy said, \"just holding this makes me feel like a little girl again\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy then whispered to herself, \"I wish I could be a little girl again\".  Something began to glow.  She looked down to see that it was the doll that was glowing.  Only soon the glowing aura seemed to exit the doll... and enter her.   Kimmy confusingly stared at her now glowing mother, who seemed to becoming enveloped in light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on Mommy?\" Kimmy said before suddenly a flash of light blinded the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

Where her mother had been, Kimmy saw a little girl around her age, standing in a pile of what was her mother's clothes, with the shirt acting as a dress.  The little girl was also holding on to the same old doll her mother was holding.  In fact this little girl shared the same features as her mother did, with blue eyes and long brown hair.  That was when Kimmy realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that you Mommy?\" Kimmy asked the little girl, for the little girl in front of her was in fact her mother, Nancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the regressed Nancy respond to her daughter?</span></div></div>",

However, Kimmy does not seem to agree and beams at her excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it, mommy!\" She cheers. \"You're a little girl like me now. We can play and share everything together.\" Nancy wants to insist that she turn back to normal, but she pauses, recalling that it was her wish, and thus her fault, that made her like this. She figures that she should play along until she can find a way to get back her adult body. After taking a deep breath, she finally speaks and asks Kimmy...</span></div></div>",

To Nancy's slight discomfort, Kimmy starts tugging on her shrunken arm, pulling her up the stairs towards her room.  With her body shrunken into a child's, not only were the stairs now massive for the little Nancy, they also proved to be more difficult to climb especially with her daughter pulling on her arm.  However soon they were up the stairs and in Kimmy's room.  \"Wait here while I get you something cute to wear mommy\" Kimmy instructed her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her daughter gathered some stuff from her dresser, Nancy jumped onto the bed and observed her surroundings.  \"Your room feels a lot bigger than before, Kimmy\" Nancy notes out loud, still astonished by how small she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now it can be<i> our</i> room if you want\" Kimmy responds.  Nancy didn't really have the heart to tell her daughter that she wanted to change back into an adult ASAP.  She also had no idea just how she was going to break the news to the rest of the family; she was hoping to find a way back before anyone else sees her like this.  But for right now, she knew all she could do was put on the clothes her daughter has just given to her.  Dressing herself proved to be more difficult in the body, but she managed.  Once she was all dress, Nancy went up to Kimmy's little body mirror to observe herself.  She had to admit she looked really cute, especially in the yellow little sundress and light brown flip flops her daughter gave her to wear.  Her hair no longer reached mid-back as before, instead being shoulder-length with a little pigtail on the side for the yellow ribbon she borrowed from the dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to play mommy?\" Kimmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy knew that she needed to find a way to turn back, but she also felt that turning back now would break her daughter's heart.<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of thought, Nancy tells Kimmy that...</span></div></div>",

She knew that nobody would believe her if she told them that she was actually a middle aged mother of 3 who only looks 5; they needed to have some real adult supervision in the mean time if they wanted to go the the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well why don't you call one of your grown-up friends - or maybe even the babysitter - to take us to the park\" Kimmy suggests, though her mother knew that was easier said than done.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the first weekend of summer vacation and Stanley was well on his way into slacking off again. The 40 year old man worked as a professor at the local university and thus had a lot of free time between semesters that he wasted away doing nothing for the upkeep of the house or for the well-being of his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan meanwhile labored long hours cleaning the house and making meals for the family on top of her part-time job as a lab technician. Stanley, a lovable sweet guy that he was, made a terrible husband. Megan sometimes considered separating from him to give him the reality check he desperately needed on being a man, but that would only ruin her precious boys' childhood. She wasn't interested in cheating on Stanley though, that would go against her Christian values. But she desperately wished there was a way to straighten him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime and time again, she found herself chiding him just like one of the boys....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stan's just an overgrown boy isn't he?</i> Megan asked herself, already knowing the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was always gushing at old childhood photos of Stanley whenever they vised his parents house, which usually prompted her mother-in-law to tell her how much Jeremy and Billy were carbon copies of Stanley growing up. Now that she thought about it, Stanley was always gazing fondly at his boyhood photos right along side her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her laptop and brought up her mother-in-law's social media page and found the photo album dedicated to little Stanley's upbringing. She spent hours gushing and cooing at the young blond hair boy that was now a grown ass man downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan occasionally imagined herself as a little girl right alongside the young boy that was to be her husband. She wondered what that would have been that had been like, but the 39 year old woman knew that was a whimsical thought. Megan had a wonderful childhood herself but she didn't miss it by any means, she was an adult woman now and a mother to boot. She had responsibilities to her boys now which she realized now included her lovely husband. <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nSometimes, people just need restart their lives. We can help with that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond Chance Clinic </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ad had been right there all along. She felt silly that she only just now recognized it.  The ad featured two depressed looking women, one clearly the aging mother to the younger adult woman in her late 20's. Even for Megan's standards this young woman looked a mess, a drug addict by the look of it, but when Megan hovered her mouse over the ad the two females transformed in a bright flash of heavenly light. What came after mesmerized Megan to her core, the older woman looked years younger than Megan now. All signs of ages and wrinkles had been wiped away from the woman's happy and vibrant face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger woman wasn't even a woman anymore, but rather like a cute little girl that looked ready to attend Sunday school all over again. Megan cooed at the thought that this girl had once been that sad drugged up woman seconds ago. Without hesitation she clicked the ad and was linked to the Second Chance Clinic's website. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe easily found the application page and started one immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Are you looking for a Second Chance\u2122 or are you looking to help a loved one?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan obviously clicked the second option.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nAre you interested in attending a counseling session? </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clicked yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Is your loved one aware of the SCC and its mission?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she clicked no.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nPlease fill out your loved one's personal details to the best of your ability in order to receive consideration.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan worked away at the application for the rest of the day, only stopping to make dinner for the boys and the soon-to-be-a-boy. She had prepared spaghetti tonight and she couldn't help but giggle at how childish Stanley seemed now as he slurped up the pasta noodles which caused Billy to laugh and Jeremy to roll his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stan dear,\" Megan asked her husband, \"Can you please act your age for once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy laughed which caused her silly husband to frown a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the breadwinner honey,\" Stanley retorted, \"I can do whatever I please. You're their mother not mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smiled, \"Yet you only respond to my nagging when I treat you like a lazy boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley looked defensive, \"I pay the bills Megan, I think I'm damn well entitled to act like a lazy boy whenever I please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan agreed with all her heart. Stanley deserved to be a carefree little boy again under her thumb. She would raise him, play with him, and nurture him alongside his own sons. He would be happier being a kid again and Megan would be far happier having another growing boy in the household rather than a lazy manchild she had now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley had a man's pride though, how was she going to coax his inner child out of him? Megan considered her options.</span></div></div>",

Megan allowed her husband to drive their car for what may be his very last time for many years to come. She would sooner see him playing with Hotwheels and racing games with his new brothers than behind the wheel again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond Chance Clinic looked no more mundane than any other doctor's office. For a place that was going to turn a 40 year old man into a child again, she figured it would look the part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second Chance Clinic?\" Stanley asked, \"What, did they fuck up the first one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Language honey.\" Megan chided him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering she saw a waiting room filled with everyday types. No oddities among the small group of people waiting for appointments, though the pastoral floor design brought with it hints of childhood nostalgia. She could almost picture herself a little schoolgirl again playing with the unused toys in the corner. Stanley's coveting eyes suggested he was imaging the same thing for himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both approached the reception desk and were greeted by a young woman in her mid twenties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there!\" Do you have an appointment?\" She chirped?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Megan Wellington and I made an appointment here for my hubby here Stanley Wellington.\" Megan told the receptionist with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled, \"Oh well I'll be your lovely wife was nice enough to fill out all your information for you. Stanley if you can be good and wait for just a bit we can give a quick check-up and then have a nice little counseling session.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" Stanley replied before turning to his wife. \"Don't you want to get some shopping done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll wait for the doctor with you first Stan.\" Megan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Stan was brought into the backrooms by a young nurse. Not long after that, a female doctor waved her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Doctor Fairings.\" The red headed woman of a similar age to Megan greeted her, \"You are Mrs. Wellington correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Doctor.\" Megan answered, \"Can you help me with my husband?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I can. Come with me Mrs. Wellington, we can chat about specifics in my office.\" She motioned Megan into the backrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was getting pretty excited, she was so desperate for details she nearly jumped into the chair offered to her by Dr. Fairings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seemed excited, you sure you don't want to be a little girl again yourself?' Dr. Fairings teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you. It's my husband that needs the second childhood not me.\" Megan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're already plugging away at Stanley with some simple tests and he's responsive so far. I think we can definitely give him a Second Chance. Depending on what you want done with him.\" The doctor told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan explained her plight with her lazy husband and how she wanted to give him a summer vacation from adulthood in order to instill some sense into him. If he lost his adult privileges, Megan reasoned he'd be willing to be a better husband and father to her sons. Being a peer among his sons could even help with the latter role. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the process reversible?\" Megan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly,\" Dr. Fairings confirmed, \"but I've rarely have clients that want to go back to how they were. They are happily content growing back up again the old fashion way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Fairings elaborated, \"Physical regressing an adult into a child is one thing but this clinic specializes in mentally readjusting a client for a proper Second Chance. Sometimes that means completely wiping away their adult knowledge, maturity, and even memories to set them on the right path. But most like to keep their memories so they have a sense they are improving upon their old lives as they grow up all over again. Others though just get the get their maturity wiped so they can fit in with their new peers while having their adult minds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you recommend?\" Megan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your goal is to teach your husband a lesson than you certainly need to keep his memories.\" Dr. Fairings reinforced. \"But I think you should wipe his adult knowledge and maturity. It's my favorite option personally, Stanley will know he was your grown-up husband and why he was regressed but he'll be a boy of his new age through and through. Speaking of which, have you decided what age you want to make Stanley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan had been considering this all week. She wanted Stanley's Second Chance to really impact him and she had been thinking about all the new family dynamics her rejuvenated husband would create in the Wellington family. </span></div></div>",

The brunette hair woman made his heart flutter, he hadn't expected her to see him like this in this awkward position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan, honey.\" Stanley spurred, \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was talking with the doctor sweetheart.\" Megan told him as she handed him a sheet of paper, \"There's some last minute paperwork you need to sign before you can be cured from this lazy, lethargic state you're constantly in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I read it?\" Stanley asked, \"It's just some mumbo jumble right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should Stanley, but I know my husband well enough to know he won't bother.' Megan stated not unkindly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Stanley said with a snide, \"I know my wife well enough to know she'll take care of me no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked like he was holding back a wave of emotion as he signed the paperwork. He didn't have time to even review what he had just done, as Dr. Fairings entered the room with a large shot already prepared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Stanley.\" the doctor said rather teasingly, \"Are you tired of being a big lazy man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Stanley asked as he instinctively raised his arm for the woman despite her mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan coughed abruptly, \"Stanley I love you so, so much. But you're just not a good husband to me nor are you a good father to your own sons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you talking about!\" Stanley yelled as Dr. Fairings injected the needle into his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it's done, there's no going back now Mrs. Wellington. You can tell him.\" The doctor informed his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stanley, I think you need some fresh perspective on what adulthood is. It's not just about working hard and paying bills and I think the only way you can learn this is by losing what you never appreciated.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm a grown man Megan-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long big boy.\" Dr. Fairings interjected, \"The chemicals in that shot are preparing your body to undergo a rapid de-aging process on the physical and mental level. However, the first thing to go in adults is their maturity level which should kick in soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, no no.\" Stanley whined, \"Megan I'm your husband! Why would you do this to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to love being a kid again so much Stan\" Megan claimed. You're going to have a whole new relationship with Jeremy and Billy and me as your mom. No more work, no more responsibilities, no more adult worries. You're going to get the perfect carefree summer childhood you always wanted. Isn't that amazing? Just designated bathtimes and bedtimes for little Stanley with his brothers going forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley was about explode with rage when the chemicals pounded him all at once. In an instant he felt his masculine self-image and manly strength give way. Allowing the little immature boy he always knew was deep inside him to come back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be my mom?!?!!?\" Stanley childishly complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chemicals are taking effect let's get him to the chamber,\" Dr. Fairings explained before adding, \"he'll respond positively to mothering from you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Stanley.\" Megan nudged him gently off the clinical table. \"Let's get you down to your rightful size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley walked awkwardly in his adult body which tightly held Megan's hand. It didn't feel right being so big and he wanted to stop feeling weird to all the giggling nurses looking at him and yet he knew he was normal right now. He was a big grown man. Megan was his wife, not his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a good boy Stanley,\" Megan praised him as they reached the chamber room that was to initiate the physical and mental regression process <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley felt proud in that moment despite himself, Megan was so good to him. Maybe this was for the best...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big boy climb into the chamber and laid down flat on his back. With both Dr. Fairings and his mom.....Megan present. The chamber activated and Stanley felt his adult knowledge being sucked out of him. Soon he felt his body physically rewind itself through puberty, his legs and arms shortened as the muscles disappeared entirely. It felt so good to Stanley, it felt right. He then felt a sudden shock to crotch as his manhood shaped itself back into innocent boyhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe knew it was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally gaining some control over his emotional state, Stanley crawled out of the chamber when it unlocked. Megan seized him into his arms almost immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stanley!\" Megan exclaimed, \"You are so <b>ADORABLE</b>!!!! Look at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right little boy.\" Dr. Fairings teased as he held up a small mirror to his face. \"You make a cuter kid than a lazy man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond hair boy staring back at Stanley looked like the little boy that he gazed nostalgically at in his 5th grade year book. His bright green eyes held genuine curiosity again while his cherubic nose was complimented by freckles. The cute frown the boy's face made was almost immediately corrected into a bucktooth smile when he saw how adorable the dimples made him look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was him now. Gone was the grown up man he had been minutes ago. Now Stanley was just a 10 year old kid all over again. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Little Stanley marveled at his prepubescent form that was barely covered by an adult's medical robes that was at risk of slipping off him. He never once imagined that he would find himself occupies his little boy's body once again, and yet Mom (Megan Stanley reminded himself) had just done so to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley smiled and kissed his new Mom on the check, \"Thank you Mom! I feel so much better being a boy than being as a man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know sweetheart, I know.\" his Mom said with jubilation as she released him from her grasp. \"But you need to thank Dr. Fairings here too Stanley you should still know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Little Stanley stammered, \"Dr. Fairings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Fairings knelt before him and gave him a smooch on his boyish lips. \"You're welcome Stanley, I know it's difficult for a big burly man like you to admit he's happier being a little kid again. But that's just one step of the process of getting a Second Chance. You're going to have to learn how to be a 10 year old kid again: that means accepting that your wife is your new mom now and that you have to obey her, that mean accepting that you can't boss Jeremy around anymore as a dad but play and listen to him as a little brother, and that means accepting that you can't protect Billy as a man anymore but look out for him as his big brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Stanley hadn't even thought about any of that, he was younger than Jeremy now. Unreal, Jeremy was just a big silly middle school kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Fairings administrated a second check-up in the room whilst he rummaged through his new childish reality. He scared noticed when she cupped his boyhood in her large womanly hands to check its length and stimulation. The sensation of which made him giggle a high pitch that made his mom laugh. Stanley still had his memories of his adult life, which included his sexual encounters with Megan before she became his mom. That said, 40 year old man turned 10 year old boy was also fully innocent from sexual knowledge as well as his pubescent development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley liked the way Dr. Fairings touched him with a teasing tone to his former masculinity but he had no bodily recourse to reciprocate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding naked in the hallway before group of mischievous nurses, that he realized had witnessed his last moments as a grown man, Stanley stood perfect still on a weight and height measuring device before Dr. Fairings and Mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your little Stanley is approximately 4 and half feet and 78 pounds.\" Dr. Fairings informed Stanley's new mom, \"That's average height for a boy his age though he is a little overweight. That's to be expected though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked at him inquisitively, \"What do you mean by that? Isn't this supposed to be Stanley exactly as he was 30 years ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't time travel Mrs. Wellington.\" Dr. Fairings explained, \"We didn't pull your former husband's childhood self from the past here, we literally turned a man into a child. That means Stanley's body type was simply translated into an appropriate childhood variant. That includes the extra bit of baby fat he has now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I fat Mom?\" Stanley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, you look fine Stanley, you're not even chubby.\" Mom reassured him. \"You're just out of shape compared to how I see your brothers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A carefree boyhood summer playing with your new brothers should do the tick I imagine.\" Dr. Fairings said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley and his new mom were then led to the dressing room where Stanley's old clothes from his adult life were returned to his mom. The Second Chance Clinic provided age appropriate clothes for their transformed patients gratis, but they were all branded with the company and its logo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill getting used to even walking at a decent pace in his preteen boy, little Stanley didn't complain when his wife turned mother helped him slip a pair of boy's briefs up his short legs and around his newfound boyhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a good boy Stanley.\" Mom praised him to his guilty pleasure. \"Why don't you pick some clothes out for yourself. I shouldn't have to do everything for you after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe choose out a pair of stylish red Bermuda shorts that he put on by himself in front of the two grown women at his side, he then proceeded to scan the T-shirts but they all had something embarrassing referencing the patient's former adulthood on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey honey, I this this cute don't you?\" His mom held out a cyan T-Shirt with a dark blue font that read: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Formerly A Man, <br>\r\nNow Just A Boy</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley liked the color and there weren't any embarrassing images on it so he took from his new mom and snaked his arms and head through the fresh fabric. It fit him the man turned boy like a glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Stanley soon found himself exiting the clinic with his mom and waving goodbye to Dr. Fairings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your Second Chance Stanley!' Dr. Fairings cheered as they drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just drove the car here didn't I?' Stanley asked from the backseat of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did Stanley, I almost wanted to tell you to savor it since you're not going to be anywhere near this front seat for a long time.\" Mom told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm not dreaming? I'm really 10 years old again.\" Stanley asked himself, the implications of his boyish fantasy finally dawning on him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the summer Stanley.\" Mom reminded him, \"Think of this as a vacation from adulthood. If you're a good boy this summer for your mommy, I'll bring you back here and make you my husband again. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do the boys know about this?\" Stanley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those boys are your brothers now.\" Mom reminded him, \"And no, Jeremy and Billy will find out about you when we get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I sleeping with one of them now?\" Stanley asked, \"I can't....I can't do...... grown-up things with you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stanley you can come cuddle with me anytime like Billy does occasionally. There's nothing wrong with a boy wanting to find confront in a woman's embrace.\" Mom said as she paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley still knew that tone from his former wife, \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom continued, \"But you're a young boy now and you guys love kicking your legs around energetically. You can sleep with me if have a bad dream or something but we should start you off with one of your brothers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Share a bed with Bill or Jeremy? Are you crazy?\" Stanley whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a big deal Stanley you're barely a preteen.\" Mom said, \"Think of it like having a sleepover every night, doesn't that sound fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Stanley considered his options. Jeremy had bigger bed, video games, and a computer in his room; but he was also a bully. Stanley wasn't sure if Jeremy would be cool letting him share any of it. On the other hand Billy had a smaller bed, a lot of toys, and a tablet in his room; but he was a scaredy-cat and afraid of everything. Stanley thought that could get annoying but at least he could boss Billy around if he needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Stanley's first real big kid choice in his Second Chance as a little kid. He pondered it well. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stanley lazily kicked his feet, which now hung above the car's floor, as he wondered which of his sons would take him in. The paternal love he held for both boys as a man was long gone, replaced now with a boy's folly on which of his brothers was cooler to hang out with. With his adult memories little Stanley thought back to how both boys acted and knew that Billy was a crybaby that loved to whine about everything. Still, newly regressed 10 year old felt a bit nervous about meeting Jeremy in his state. He couldn't imagine how Jeremy would look from his new perspective and it kept him on guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Fairings words came back to him in that moment,  <i>\"that mean accepting that you can't boss Jeremy around anymore as a dad but play and listen to him as a little brother.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simplicity of the doctor's words seemed like a tall order to the middle aged professor turned rising 5th grader. He deeply rejoiced in the newfound youth his wife turned mom had given him, but there was also potential for deep embarrassment as well. If Jeremy laughed at him and bullied him or even worse, if his students at college ever saw him as a tween boy, Stanley wouldn't be able to handle the shame of returning to his old adult life and facing them again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of this though, Stanley was still boyishly enthralled at having the prospect of having a big brother. He giggled in his carseat of the long hours he would spend playing videoegames with Jeremy that he had often restricted him from before. He totally thought he was stupid for doing that as a man but that wasn't the case anymore. The two would have a blast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sleep with Jeremy!\" Stanley blurted out with enthusiasm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smiled, \"I figured that you want to share his room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I?\" Stanley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course my sweetie.\" Megan responded before continuing, \"But you know that Jeremy is being a bit weird with puberty right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puberty?\" Stanley asked, \"That's like when a kid.... grows up.... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Stanley, I'm proud you still know that baby.\" Megan praised him, \"He's becoming a teenager, growing up into a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I was.\" Stanley said, \"But what does that have to do with me sleeping with him? I did it when I was a grownup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you did Stanley but you're a boy now, you're both just preteens still, but Jeremy might feel a little weird shacking up so close against you. I'll probably have to get you two a bunk bed, so he can have some personal space to himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deeper meaning of the words flew over Stanley's innocent mind, \"A bunk bed?!?!?! That's awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan laughed, \"Who knew all my little husband needed was a bunkbed to be happy with his life, but Jeremy gets to choose top or bottom since it's his room after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley moaned in disappointment knowing the older kid would surely pick the top bunk, setting a pace for Stanley's Second Chance at a boyhood summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan made it clear she was more interested in reintroducing Stanley back into the family pack as a child than procuring anything else today. Jeremy and Billy had been home long enough at their age and procuring any clothes, toys, and supplies for the 10 year old boy's summer would have to wait until tomorrow. The starter pack of clothes and supplies provided by Second Chance Clinic would be enough for now. The pack included a child's toothbrush with a bubble gum flavored toothpaste, a special boy's shampoo and bodywash that would help clean little Stanley of the remaining adult skin and hair particles that survived his age regression, a pair of blue jammies for the first bedtime of his second childhood, and a pair of children's socks and briefs for him to slip into when he woke back up into his childish new reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Megan pulled into the Wellington's household in summertime suburbia, little Stanley's thoughts of wanting pizza or Chinese for dinner were replaced with the foreboding worry of meeting his own sons as a 10 year old boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis new brothers were awaiting their mother and father; not the lioness bringing back a new cub to the pride, and this cub had just been a mighty lion.</span></div></div>",

So I think it would only make sense to bring my husband down to an age that fits that gap.  I can't really have him be 16 since that's still close to adulthood, so I think it would be a good idea to bring my husband back all the way down to the age of 4; he would be nothing more than a little toddler\" Megan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4 years old, huh.  Is that your ideal choice?\" Dr. Fairings asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded.  \"Having Stanley be younger than the boys would make it easier for them to accept him as their new brother.  Also in such a state my soon-to-be-little Stanley would need the constant attention of a mother such as myself, thereby taking away all the privileges he enjoyed as a man, which of course is the point in all this.

Megan nodded once more as Dr Fairings gave her the necessary paper work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go schedule Stanley up for an appointment immediately if you like, though if I recall correctly, your husband is still in the dark about this\" Dr Fairings asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Dr.  I prefer that he not know about this until the appointment\" Megan answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we usually need a signature of consent from the patient before he proceed with the Second Chance\" Dr Fairings said.  \"However,\" He added, \"nobody really ever reads the fine print, so I wouldn't worry too much about your husband finding out about this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you doctor\" Megan said as she signed her portion of the paperwork (meant to make her Stanley's caretaker in his regressed state).  \"Can we go ahead and do this tomorrow Dr?  I want to do this as soon as possible\" Megan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" answered the doctor.

Stanely headed to the clinic without question, knowing his wife would be too stubborn.  Once Tim was far enough away, Megan opened the back trunk to pull out a special toddler's booster seat.  She quickly got the booster seat set up in the car, all the while thinking about how her husband Stanly would be riding home in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished setting the car seat in place, she quickly grabbed the papers for Stanley to sign before heading off to the clinic.

I'll be waiting her in case they need me\" Megan tells her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright...\" Stanely says as he follows the nurse.  Megan smiles to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley takes a seat in the room where he meets the doctor.

Then to Stanley's shock, the doctor places a mask over his face - the kind for making you breathe the sleeping gas.  Stanley tries to resist, but realizes that his arms and legs are strapped.

His vision is still a little too blurry with the lights shining straight in his eyes. <br>\r\n As he tries to sit up and run his eyes, he realizes that he feels kind of funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision cleared up, he takes a good luck at his surroundings.  He is in bed in a hospital room.  Only there was one strange detail - everything looked very big.  Even the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" He says, only to cup his hands over his mouth.  Something wasn't right.  Those words had clearly come out of his mouth, but that was not his voice.  It sounded higher pitched and a lot - younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he thought about it, his hands seemed smaller.  And from taking a peak under the covers, so were his legs - and privates...  He runs his hands across his face which does not feel as tired and wrinkly - instead it feels rather soft and plunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't real\" Stanley said to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, he heard someone enter the room.  He was expecting a nurse to greet him but instead he spotted his wife Megan - she too looked a lot taller than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confused?\" Megan asks as she takes a seat next to the bed, facing a rather nervous Stanley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't what I think it is, is it?\" Stanley asks, sheepishly with his new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is dear.\" Megan replies, \"you are now a 4 year old\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes several seconds for that to process in Stanley's mind.  He could not believe what he heard.  \"I don't understand.  What went wrong\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing went wrong dear.  The Second Chance Clinic is a age regression facility.  People come here to relive their youthful days temporarily - unless circumstances dictate otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I love you very much, but let's face it you are not a very good husband or father for our kids.  All you do at home is nap in your chair.\"  Megan explains<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is this to punish me then?\" Stanley asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way yes.\" Megan remarks \"for the rest of the summer you will be a 4 year old boy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't what I signed up for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, this is exactly what you signed up for remember?\"  Meghan's words put a look of horror and realization on Stanley's face \"you had signed a legally binding contract that you cannot be restored into an adult till the end of summer.  Maybe this will teach you to read the fine print from now on too\"  Megan told her shrunken husband<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Megan -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another thing, while you are in this regressed state, I will not be your wife.  Instead I will be your mother and our kids will be your older brothers.  So call me Mom - or Mommy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley is not sure how to take all this.  As far as he knew, his wife had tricked him into becoming a little kid again.</span></div></div>",

He tries to slip out of  bed trying to not wake his wife.  He guides her arm softly to the bed as he makes his way to the bathroom.  Gerald hears his wife stir as he shuts the door and turns on the light in the bathroom.  Gerald quickly peals the bandages from his hand as the tingling spreads through his whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy calls out, \"Are you okay honey?  Your hand isn't bothering you is it?  I can throw on some clothes and take you to the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerald says, \"I think the bandages were a little tight and are itching.\"  He hopes to allay some of her fears as the hair on hand begins to disappear.  Tammy opens the door to make sure everything is okay and finds herself eye to eye with Gerald who is now her height maybe a little shorter.  Gerald stares bewildered at his wife as he shrinks to barely above Tammy's waist.  Hair began to pour from his head passing his shoulders forming a hood around his head.  Gerald pulled back the hair so he could see.  When he pulled back the hair the face of a little girl revealed itself.  Tammy stared in horror at what had become of her once manly husband.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe timidly asked the little girl before her, \"What just happened?\"  Tammy grabbed a scrunchie from a drawer in the bathroom cabinet she quickly grabbed up Gerald's long hair and fixed it into a pony tail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know honey, I am just as lost as you are.  I have never heard of anything like this before.  I know a doctor can't help me though.  I guess we should check online and see if anyone has heard of this.\"  Gerald spoke in a little girls voice which sounded natural coming from the child's body.  The disturbing part knowing that it should be an adult man speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend Maxine dabbles who does some occult stuff.  I can try to get a hold of her.  I just worry that it will be hard to convince someone.  I think we should start fresh in the morning.  I can pick up some clothes for you tomorrow because nothing we have will fit.  Your t-shirt now fits like a night shirt now.  You know you do look cute though.\"  Tammy pulled you in for a hug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for that, I have been worried about that.  I kind of want to jump on the computer but I understand what you mean I am exhausted.  A fresh start sounds best we'll get started in the morning, I hope I don't have any further changes though.  You aren't ready to take of a baby.  I am not prepared for you to be my mommy.  I will love you through anything though beautiful.\"  Gerald spoke with a smile.  He wanted to reassure his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy returned Gerald's smile, \"I would be a great mother and I think you would make an adorable baby.

He stumbled slightly unused to his shorter stature.  He brushed a few stray long blond hairs from his face.  He had hoped the transformation was a strange dream in the night.  But it felt more real looking upon a room that now looked oversized.  He imagined himself Alice from Alice in Wonderland.   He probably looked like her with golden hair and blue eyes.  He shuffled his small feet to the bathroom the cool floor caused him to shiver shaking his hair about.  Afterwards he stretched to wash his hands awkwardly in the sink.  Splashing some water on his face he felt fully awake and made his way to the kitchen.  Gerald walked in on his wife as she waited for the waffle maker to beep.  He said, \"Good morning beautiful thank you for breakfast.\"  He lifted himself up on to a chair at the table his feet dangling a few inches from the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy turned and smiles at Gerald, \"Your welcome and how is my sweet little girl this morning?  I figure I can call my friend Maxine after breakfast.\"  Tammy turned away hearing the beep of the waffle maker.  She fixed his plate up and set it in front of him, she down with her own and began eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerald looked up at Tammy with a smirk, \"Mommy why didn't you cut my waffle into little pieces?\"  He made a pouty face to his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy finished chewing and swallowed analyzing her husband.  \"I'm so sorry sweety I forgot.  I am glad I married someone that even in bad times can have a good time.\"  She got up and kissed you on the cheek hugging you close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try to roll with the punches.  I can also imagine a lot of worse things to happen to me than turning into an apparently healthy young child.  Well, let's finish up breakfast and call up Maxine and see if we can fix this.\"  Gerald gave a reassuring smile to Tammy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right let's hope it doesn't get any worse though.  What'll you do about work on Monday if we can't fix this during the weekend?\"  Tammy asked while returning to her eating her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can work from home really.  I will shoot out an email to let them know.  I just go into the office to get out of the house so I don't seem like such a hermit.\"  Gerald said returning to eating after.  After they both finished up Gerald grabbed the dishes and put them in the dishwasher while Tammy made a call to her friend Maxine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy came back with a chagrined look and said, \"I caught Maxine off guard but she believed me.  She said she knew I wouldn't joke about something as crazy as this.  Maxine said to come over when were ready.  She sounded excited about helping.  I don't know what we have that will really fit you though.  Oh, I know I will run out and grab you some clothes after I measure you.\"  Tammy ran and grabbed her tape and sized Gerald up before running to the store.   Gerald threw on the television while he waited for Tammy's return.  He found the news harder to follow so he turned to cartoons instead.   He only looked up when Tammy came in the front door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy helped him get dressed and he joked about how he never thought she would help him get into another girls panties.  Tammy had bought him a cute sky blue dress because she said a pull over dress would be easiest.  Gerald suspected Tammy just thought he would look adorable in it.  Gerald hopped into the car before she could ask about taking a picture.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driving to Maxine's remote home took an hour.  The rural area made Gerald feel like he was entering a horror each time.  Still, Maxine had modernized the old farm house and out building and it looked pleasant enough.  They pulled up the driveway and made their way to the door.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She smiled at them with a little worry on her face she called to them, \u201cWelcome Tammy and I am going to assume that you are Gerald.  I can\u2019t believe I am going to examine a full body transformation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy asked, \u201cHi Maxine thank you for seeing us.  Do you think you can help Gerald?\u201d  She walked in the house with Gerald\u2019s small hand in hers out of instinct.  She sat down on a soft couch with Gerald next to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine responded, \u201cI am not sure it depends what the source of the transformation is.  I am really an amateur at this really.  I will do my best of course.  I need some of Gerald\u2019s blood, hair, and saliva to run some tests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerald\u2019s normal confidence alluded him remaining silently nervous his legs swinging impatiently.  Tammy spoke up again, \u201cWhatever it takes as adorable as he is right now I want my handsome husband back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine proceeds to collect a sample by swabbing Gerald\u2019s mouth and brushing the long golden hair taking a few stray hairs.  Maxine uses a lancet needle normally used by diabetics to test their blood.  With a yelp from Gerald she gets three smears of blood on glass slides.  Gerald sucked on her sore finger.  Maxine said, \u201cI will be a while so make yourself at home.  I got snacks in the kitchen with juice in the fridge.  Tea if you want to make some.  Oh, I have some movies Gerald can pick from in the cabinet.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine then leaned up to Tammy whispering, \u201cLet Gerald pick the movie I wish to see his choice.\u201d  She stood up walking out of the room excited to examine the items with her tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerald forgot the ache in his finger excitedly rushing to the cabinet.  Opening it to reveal a wide array of genres.  He normally liked action movies but right now he seized Frozen rushing to the dvd player to get it started.  Tammy watched shocked by her formally masculine husband\u2019s choice.  Tammy kept silent as her husband hopped up on the snuggling next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine came out halfway into the movie gesturing for Tammy to come talk with her in the kitchen.  She glanced at the television frowning at the screen.  Tammy hurried to the kitchen leaving Gerald entranced by the movie.  Maxine proceeds to tell Tammy, \u201cI think I know the type of curse Gerald is under.  The curse has an enticement bag involved in it.  The bag holds personal items of the victim and some items that drive the course of the curse.  My guess the items are turning him into a cute little girl.  The good news is if we get the bag I can cure him.  The bad news is that you have to find where it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy replied, \u201cThank goodness that he can be cured.  I will try to think of who would do this to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine said, \u201cI can watch Gerald while you investigate.  She will begin to act more like the little girl he appears.  He will forget himself as time progresses.  I don\u2019t think he will be much help to you.  I am sorry I couldn\u2019t be more help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have been an immense help at least I know what is going on.  I also have a direction to go in.  I will take you up on your kind offer.  I will start now so it doesn\u2019t get much worse for Gerald.  It might take a few days I hope that is okay?  Thank you so much for all of this.\u201d  Tammy hugged Maxine before going out to Gerald to say goodbye as she headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine called after Tammy, \u201cTake your time it will be fun playing mommy.\u201c  Tammy shook her head at Maxine\u2019s attempt at humor or comfort not knowing which.      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gerald never spoke of any bad break up but one never knew how an ex truly felt about the matter.  Gerald\u2019s best friend Joe might know the mystery enemy.  She decided to drive and question Joe.  She dialed Joe\u2019s number while stopped at a light.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey beautiful what can I do for you?  Is Gerald with you?  We need to set up a golf outing soon.\u201d  Joe asked.  Tammy smiled at his usual casual flirting it let her imagine everything was normal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy responded, \u201cI wondered if I could come over?  Gerald is in a jam and I thought you would know who wants to harm him.\u201d  She listened intently as she drove the car.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe said, \u201cOf course you can come over.  I don\u2019t know anyone he could hate that silly lug Gerald.  What is the matter?  If someone is threatening him you should go to the police.\u201d  Joe sounded worried.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks I will explain more when I get there.  Talk to you soon bye.\u201d  Tammy said not wanting to try to explain on the phone.  She hung up after Joe said goodbye.  Now, left with her thoughts she wondered how Gerald fared with Maxine taking care of him.  She hesitated on making a call.  Maxine will call if anything bad happens Tammy reassured herself.  She decided that right now she needed to focus on finding the culprit.  It might be related to his job.  Joe worked a the same company so he would know any work beefs.  But she couldn\u2019t see why Gerald wouldn\u2019t mention anything to her.  Wait he mentioned that something in the company books didn\u2019t add up.  He thought that someone screwed up some figures.  Perhaps there might be more to it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at Joe\u2019s place brought the apprehension of wondering how to explain all of this.  Probably best to be vague with him.  Who would believe her without witnessing it.  Joe opened the front door waving a greeting.  She waved back after getting out of the car.  She asked, \u201cLet me use your bathroom quick and then we will talk.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoe nodded, \u201cSure I got a pot of coffee on if you want some.\u201d Tammy followed him inside making her way to the bathroom.  She needed a minute to think over what she would say to him.  Inside the bathroom she immediately checked the toilet paper roll.  She previously got burned by Joe forgetting to replace it.  Sure enough it was empty again.  She opened the cabinet under the sink to find a roll.  Tammy found a large cloth bag underneath.  Tammy felt energy exuding from the bag as she reached for it.  </span></div></div>",

Come on, Alicia, let's go.\" Melanie said to her sleeping friend.<br>\r\nMelanie, who had drank five beers that night and didn't have much of an alcohol tolerance, did her best to walk Alicia out to her car, staggering the whole time. Gracelessly, Melanie put in her keys, stumbling the whole time, and started driving home. Her judgment totally impaired, she took the freeway home as a shortcut, but got on the wrong entrance ramp, and went the wrong way. She didn't notice what she had done until it was too late.<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" Melanie said, seeing an oncoming car.<br>\r\nShe tried to swerve, but it was too late. Melanie caused a head-on collision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParamedics were quickly called to the scene. They tried their best, but Melanie and Alicia were broken up pretty badly. The driver of the other car was killed instantly. Before long, Melanie was in a hospital bed, her ribcage shattered, her legs bot broken, her spine shattered. She was paralyzed from the waist down. Alicia got it worse, her lungs had collapsed so she required a breathing tube in her throat, and her skull fractured, leaving her brain damaged. Both girls were badly burned in the ensuing fire that broke out after the collision. Both were asleep in a coma. The two of them were together in an ICU room at the hospital in two adjacent beds. Melanie's mom called. Once she arrived she burst into tears seeing her daughter covered in dressing and smelling of burnt flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, things aren't looking good for her. She's been burned over 60% of her body and she'll probably never walk again. We did all we could.\" The Doctor said, solemnly.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Doctor, is there anything you can do? Anything at all?\" Melanie's Mom said.<br>\r\nThe doctor sighed.<br>\r\n\"Well, there is one thing. We have this experimental rejuvenation chamber the engineers have been working with. We're not sure if it's safe, though.\" The doctor said.<br>\r\n\"I don't care, just save my baby!\" Mom shouted, tears in her eyes.<br>\r\nShe was given some consent forms, stating that if the procedure killed Melanie she couldn't sue. Melanie's bed was wheeled off by the nurses to the rejuvenation chamber.<br>\r\n\"All right, first customer. Let's see what we can do!\" The engineer who ran the chamber said.<br>\r\nMelanie would be among the first patients tested in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rejuvenation chamber was turned on and Melanie's body began to change. Her burns quickly went away and her legs soon healed.<br>\r\n\"Hey! It's working!\" The engineer said.<br>\r\n\"Sweet Christmas it's working! You're a miracle!\" The doctor said, patting his engineer friend on the back.<br>\r\nThe rejuvenation chamber wasn't done, though. Melanie quickly began to lose height. Her breasts shrank she regressed into a more childlike form.<br>\r\n\"What's going on? Why's she shrinking? Turn it off!\" The doctor said.<br>\r\n\"I'm trying!\" The engineer said.<br>\r\nThe machine was shut off but the damage was done. Melanie was regressed into the body of a small child, one that appeared no older than four. Her hospital gown was far too large for her now, and lie over her in a crumple heap. Her dressings for her wounds sat uselessly on her now-pristine fully-healed body.<br>\r\n\"Ooh, how are we gonna explain this one?\" The engineer said.<br>\r\n\"Well, it was an experiment. The mom signed the release forms, this is what she gets.\" The doctor said, shrugging his shoulders.<br>\r\nThey sent in a nurse to take her back to the experimental observation unit for monitoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie woke up some time later with a terrible headache. The room seemed to be spinning.<br>\r\n\"Ooh... what happened?\" She groaned.<br>\r\nShe sat up feeling somewhat off, although she wasn't sure why. Last thing she remembered was getting wasted at the party. Then the little girl looked around.<br>\r\n\"Oh... Oh no, I'm in a hospital.\" She said.<br>\r\nThen she looked down at her body.<br>\r\n\"Eek! I'm naked!\" Melanie cried out.<br>\r\nHer body was completely bare. An IV line was in her arm and a catheter tube was in her crotch to collect her urine output. Then, Melanie noticed how her body had changed.<br>\r\n\"Oh... Oh no! What happened to by legs They're so short! And my boobs? They're gone!\" The girl said.<br>\r\nMelanie began to panic. A nurse quickly noticed and came in.<br>\r\n\"Mel! Mel! Calm down.\" The nurse said.<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?\" Melanie asked.<br>\r\n\"You were in a car accident, a really bad one. We only saved you because we tried an experimental procedure. Only thing is, you got turned into a little kid as a side effect. We're monitoring you right now to see if anything else happens.\" The nurse said.<br>\r\nMelanie scratched at her crotch.<br>\r\n\"Well, can you get this... whatever it is out of me. It's really uncomfortable and itchy.\" Melanie said.<br>\r\nThe nurse smiled.<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, sweet pea.\" She said.<br>\r\nThe nurse carefully removed the catheter and put little Melanie in a diaper. The urine collected was sent to the labs to be studied.<br>\r\n\"So... my best friend, Alicia. I was with her. Is she okay?\" Melanie asked.</span></div></div>",

What is your response to that?\" The screen cut to video of the emergency hospital. National guards were looking out over a fenced square where dozens of people huddled together. Some where children with very loose fitting clothing, some where elderly, but there were not many middle aged people. The whole scene looked like a refugee camp, and didn't look very appealing to Jennifer. \"Oh hell no, I'm not going there.\" She shot out at the television. \"Shh, I'm listening!\" Micheal hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man continued \"Well, euh, look. Although not all aspects of the effects are known to us at this moment, we want to assure you the measures taken are strictly precautionary.

I forgot.\" She hit her forehead with the palm of her hand. \"Eugh, so what do you do to get from A to B?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal shrugged. \"There's three options. One: I call you, two: I take a bike and three: I take public transport.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer spine shivered at the mention of public transport.

Can I take your bike?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure. I've got friends coming over anyway, so I'm not going anywhere. It's a men's bike, though, so be careful when you get on or off.\" Micheal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the car-keys back on the shelve and got the bike from the garage. After a few tries she managed to get into the saddle and rode off. This wasn't the most elegant way of transportation, not when she was doing it anyway, but it beat walking. Pretty soon she was getting the hang of it again and felt like she had cycled her whole life.</span></div></div>",

She dumped the shopping bags in the hallway and yelled \"I'm back!\" Michael was probably in his room, playing games or something. No matter, before anything else she needed to change anyway. She could hardly wait to get out of these old clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all the bags were moved to her bedroom she started picking out clothes to wear. Inspecting herself in new underwear, she was pleased to see that despite her height being a little smaller, her breasts seemed to be a little bit bigger than they used to be when she was a teenager. The thing she was most pleased about was her skin. When she was 40 some serious wrinkles were starting to show on her face, but as a teenager she had a perfect, practically unblemished skin. It was smooth, soft, and devoid of any unwanted hair. She picked a simple black pair of tight jeans, which nicely accentuated her butt, and a purple blouse. She couldn't resist to put om a few slight touches of make-up, just to see how it would look on herself now she was younger. A dash of eye shadow, a little bit of red lipstick and just a smidge of mascara. Perfect. Looking at herself in the mirror she was starting to feel more comfortable with her new body, accepting it as her own. She had to resist the urge to try on some of the more skimpy outfits she had bought, those were for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the bathroom, closed the door, and realized too late that it was already occupied. \"Excuse me?\" One of Micheal's friends was standing in front of the toilet, dick hanging loose. It was Arthur, he and Jennifer had met before put never really talked. Jennifer looked from his face, to his cock, back to his face. She couldn't help but giggle, and could feel a blush forming on her cheeks. \"Oh excuse me, I didn't realize it was occupied.\" The guy quickly zipped up his member and wiped off his hands. \"No, it's OK. Really, I was just done anyway.\" But before he was done talking, Jennifer had quickly left. She was leaning against the wal and buried her face in her hands. A mix of emotions rushing through her mind. <i>Oh, he must think I'm an idiot. Why didn't he just lock the door. Oh my god, my first dick in months. It was pretty big...</i> \"Hi, I'm Arthur. You must be Gwen?\" She lowered her hands. He was standing in front of her, hand outstretched and waiting for a reaction. She cautiously grabbed the hand. \"Yeah, that's right. But how do you know?\" He had a firm grip, and a dreamy pair of eyes... \"Micheal told me you're staying over here for the summer.Hey, do you like video games?\" She wanted to say no thanks, since she never really got the point of staring at a screen for hours on end without really accomplishing anything, but something in his smile made her say \"Yeah, sure. What game?\" They walked over to Micheal's room. \"It's a racing game, called Need for Speed. I'm afraid there's only two controllers, so we have to take turns.\" \"That's OK, I'll just watch and see what happens the first couple of games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicheal's room was the same old mess as ever, but somehow it didn't bother her as much as it usually would. He was sitting on the bed, playing a solo game. \"Scootch over, mate. We've got a guest.\" Arthur said as he let himself fall on the bed next to Micheal.He pushed away the ruffled blankets to make some extra room. Micheal paused the game as soon as she entered. \"Hey Gwen. You look... better.\" He said, letting his eyes linger on her body a little bit too long for comfort. \"She's hardly a guest, mate. She practically lives here.\" Jennifer sat down next to Arthur. His smell made her nostrils flare, it was... strange, a little bit arousing. She made an effort not to think too much of his obviously athletic body, and completely failed. What was happening to her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
