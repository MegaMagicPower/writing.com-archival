            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now, if I'm right, the village should be just over this hill.\" Said Hansel, trying his best to sound confident as he strode up the rocky slope. Just behind him, Gretel was trying her best to keep up with her older brother, stumbling along in his wake despite her exhaustion. Finally, the two reached the top of the hill to see... more forest. An endless green expanse stretched out as far as the eye could see, with not a human settlement in sight. Despairingly, Gretel collapsed at the foot of a mighty oak tree.<br>\r\n\"Oh, why did we have to get lost? We were only picking mushrooms!\" The young girl said, as tears began to wend their way down her face. \"I just want to go home!\"<br>\r\nHansel hurried over to her and put an arm around her skinny shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Gret, we'll find the way back. We've still got a couple of hours of daylight. Come on, we'll be fine.\" He tried to comfort her, but despite his best attempts she merely buried her face in his shoulder and began to sob. Desperately, he looked around for anything that could help them, and suddenly...<br>\r\n\"Look! Gretel, there's a light down there, I'm sure of it!\" He exclaimed, and his sister looked up with red eyes.<br>\r\n\"I don't see it...\" She said uncertainly, but Hansel was adamant.<br>\r\n\"Let's go see who it is!\" He said excitedly, grabbing her by the hand and half-leading, half-dragging her down the hill, skidding on the rough stones. They quickly reached the bottom, and now both of them were running, kicking aside branches and leaves as they sprinted through the forest, before emerging unexpectedly into a large clearing. They slowed to a stop in front of a modest house in the clearing center, light shining through its windows and the most delicious scent they had ever smelled curling out from its walls like waves of liquid sugar. <br>\r\nBoth of them stood transfixed for a second, before suddenly they realized; the house itself was made out of candy! Without another thought, the two children rushed forwards and began grabbing great handfuls of gingerbread and sugar glazing, stuffing them into their starving mouths. Never in their combined 17 years on the planet had either of them ever tasted something anywhere near as delicious, or eaten so much in so short a space of time. Their family were surfs; poor laborers who worked the land for a lord, and more than decent meal a day was only for special occasions like Christmas.<br>\r\nSoon, Gretel was more full than she could ever remember being, her stomach swollen and straining the belt worn over her dress, but Hansel was looking strained, one eye twitching. A voice in the back of his mind had spoken, some half-forgotten memory from years ago, urging him to remember about... about something. The sugary sweet smell was addling his mind, and it was taking all his willpower not to continue stuffing himself like his sister was doing.<br>\r\nWitches! In a sudden revelation, he remembered the tales his father had told him when he was young, tales of old magic women who lived in remote houses, plotting to tempt and lure children so she could eat them. In an instant, he grabbed his sister and began trying to drag her away, back into the woods.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Get off me!\" She shouted, and suddenly footsteps could be heard from within the cottage as someone began moving towards the front door. As his sister began struggling desperately for him to drop her, he glanced around desperately. He could drop Gretel and get away, but then he'd be leaving his sister to the mercy of the witch, at least until he could sneak back. Alternatively, he could try to drag her away, but with the way she was clawing and shouting, it didn't seem likely he could drag her away before they were found.<br>\r\nThe footsteps were getting close; it was time to make a choice. </span></div></div>",

It would do them no good if the both of them had gotten caught, and he figured if at least <i>he</i> could get away, he could think of a plan to free his sister and return. Her struggling would definitely hinder their escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the footsteps nearing the door, he gently lowered his sister back down to the ground.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll come back for you,\" he whispered in her ear and dashed for the trees, though he had a suspicion she hadn't listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd gotten away just in time. Just as he ducked behind a tree, he heard the creaking of an opening door, followed by the voice of an older woman. She couldn't make out her words from this distance, but she sounded...kindly, not malicious whatsoever.<br>\r\nThough that was probably one of her tricks; his father always talked about witches being tricksters, to get kids' trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft closing of a door sounded. He peeked around the tree trunk and saw neither the witch, or Gretel. He was on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed, and sat back behind the tree. Time to plan...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The most remarkable thing about the age of industry was not the revolutionary tactics that businessmen employed to increase production, neither was it the new technological marvels that would weave one man's dream into reality, nor was it the improvement of the way of life for higher society. No the most remarkable thing about this industrial era was how quickly fairy tales and magic could be stricken from the minds and hearts of children. Yes, all those wondrous, cautionary tales about the dark forests, hungry wolves, and spinning wheels with dire consequences were eaten by the machines of industry, pumping out smog to darken the streets, create wolfish grins on neighbors and friends alike, and spun wheels which had dire consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, we retell a tale with two young orphans named Hansel and Gretel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel stood outside the factory where he and his sister worked for pennies a day to make ends meet. He stood a head taller than most boys, though was still short enough to slip through the vents of the big blast furnaces in the factory, and yet strong enough to heft the buckets of coal needed to keep them running hot. Most importantly, Hansel was clever. Hi sharp-wit had gotten himself out of many whippings from the foreman who adopted him and his sister. He had already been paid by the foreman, and was waiting for his only family in the world, Gretel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a simple-minded girl, and thin almost down to the bone. She was so small and tiny that she was easily able to crawl around the running textile machines and grab up bits of cloth and thread that would fall out. Her own simple-mindedness might have come from being exposed to heady, thick-scented chemicals for which cloth and thread alike were dyed and treated with, but most - including her own brother - simply attributed it to her childish nature. She was soon scampering out of the textile mill, her dirty rag of a dress bouncing about like a feather in the breeze carrying her own payment in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Late again, Gretel... You kept me waiting for ten whole minutes!\" Hansel gently scolded whilst trundling along the cobbled road. \"Did you at least remembered to get paid?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\" she said, showing off her wage to her brother. \"Mr. Foreman said that I got a bonus today too! See? Look! Five more pieces!\" Her childish grin was proud despite Hansel's shrewdness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... At least there's that...\" he relented, taking the money and hurrying along. He wanted to get to the bakers before they closed to get their loaf of hard-bread and find a place to settle down in the slums for the night. Such is the life for a pair of orphaned children of the time. In fact, they may have been luckier than most orphans. When losing their parents, most simply die on the streets or are kicked out of orphanages to make room for younger, cuter, charges. The truly lucky were taken in by rich families, but those with less luck were taken by foremen and factory-owners to be put to work and paid even less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two made their way down the dirty streets in the dark of night, the lamp-lighters were making their rounds to illuminate them. But most dark corners were  simply shadows dancing bout, especially to children. Hansel would often hold Gretel tighter to his side, not wanting to lose her too. Gretel, meanwhile would stumble and slow, much to her brother's chagrin. She would be looking up at the sky, trying to find a star in the blackened skies above, or even the moon. After some time, they arrived at the bakers. Hansel slipped into the bakers shop, having grown tired of dragging his sister about, and quickly bought a loaf of hard-bread. There were even a few pennies left over to  save for a rainy day. Hansel hid the money in his good shoe and went outside to find his sister at the end of the scarce street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gretel, what are you doing?\" he called out to her. From the looks of it, she was talking to someone, around the corner. Gretel did look to Hansel briefly, but a pale hand, as bright and faultless as a white diamond, turned the simple child's gaze away. Hansel grew nervous, and dashed to his sister. He knew that all kinds of ill-folk were out at night, but Gretel... She was sometimes to simple to be afraid. <br>\r\nAs Hansel bore down on them, the hand patted her head, put something in her hand, and slipped away from view. Hansel barreled down and skidded to a stop in front of Gretel, yanking her over to him. \"GRETEL! What are you doing? I told you... huff...\" Hansel admonished wile breathing  heavily. \"Don't... Don't talk to strangers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel stammered and mumbled out a meek and confused reply, to which Hansel replied, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel simply held up a glazed sweet-cake, colored varying shades of sweet pinks and reds. Hansel looked at the treasure she held, and salivated at the sight. His better judgment, however, tickled the back of his mind. Dark and twisted folk always hung around at night, doing unspeakable things like making children disappear, or murdering them in cold-blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it wonderful, brother?\" she asked with an innocent look. \"She said there's more at her house!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gretel, throw that... away...\" he said begrudgingly. \"It's not safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But brother...\" she whined. \"It... it smells so yummy! Just a bite-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Gretel!\" he snapped, growing too weary for the nonsense from his sister. He slapped the cake onto the streets and out of her hands. He stood for a moment, watching his sister tear up. \"I'm sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel looked down at the dirty streets where the cake lay, and childishly stuck her dirty thumb in her mouth. She sniffled at the taste. Some of the sweet, sugary confection stuck to it, making her belly growl at it's absence. She looked up at street sign, gears turning and clicking in her head. Just as Hansel reached for her hand, Gretel turned and ran off into the night, leaving Hansel behind...</span></div></div>",

He watched her dress bob and flutter behind her, as if he were chasing down a wild animal rather than his own sister. \"Gretel! I'm sorry! Come back!\" He pleaded with a hoarse voice, but it would fall on deaf ears. Gretel was spurred on by something else. It wasn't like Hansel, who didn't want to lose his only family in the world. No, this was something more primal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't hungry in the sense of having skipped lunch and was getting seconds for dinner. Gretel was starving, malnourished, and was truly skin and bones. She had always been hungry growing up, and while Hansel did try to give her a fair share of the meager bread-a-day meal, she never experienced fullness. What that kindly stranger told her awakened something primal in Gretel. It was an instinct. A dire need to act now. You may be wondering what the stranger told Gretel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You shall never know hunger again... If you come to me at my home...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one phrase alone made was the fire in Gretel's pace. Hansel could only just keep up. Eventually, he lost her at a street corner, and was left trailing after her through alley, after alley, after alley. Hansel may have been short, but he was not nearly as small as Gretel, who dipped and squeezed through mouse-holes, or so it seemed to Hansel. By the time Hansel finally caught up, he caught a glimpse of his sister before a door shielded her from his sights. Hansel hurried as fast as he could, but it was far too late... The door closed and the locking of the bolt behind it sealed Gretel within. Tired, out of breath, and filled with Dread, Hansel collapsed under the window of Gretel's kidnapper...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was not down and out yet. He saw a light flicker on the ground from the window above and desperately tried to see through the window. After dragging over a wooden crate, hed peeked over the window and gasped at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood. An entire banquet of food laid out on a table, filled to the brim with sweetmeats, desserts, and even a full pitcher of milk. standing on a chair at the had of it was Gretel, feasting away like a rabid animal. The young child feasted, and feasted, and feasted, making Hansel's own belly growl at the sight. He helped himself to a piece of hard-bread for the time being, and watched on, fearing the worst but growing steadily jealous...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, a figure passed in front of the window, making Hansel duck out of sight. When he looked back inside, he saw a kindly, extravagantly dressed woman. She set at the table a platter of cakes like the one Gretel had before. She took a large bite from one and quickly stuffed the rest down her greedy gullet. Hansel simply watched his sister as the woman disappeared from the room. Hansel assumed that she had to get full at some point... Yet, she did not skip a single portion. When the last drop of milk dropped into her gullet, Gretel fell back into her chair. Hansel was amazed at the sight... Gretel's middle was stuffed full and round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the kindly woman returned, she seemed almost happy that Gretel was full. It made Hansel doubt himself a little inside. Then, as the woman gave Gretel a kindly kiss on her dirty cheek, he watched on in fear as the woman grabbed and groped his sister's belly. It was gently gropes, but it wasn't unlike  the adults in the market groping a fruit. It unsettled Hansel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the woman lifted Gretel up from the chair and carried her from out of sight. </span></div></div>",

A smile formed across Gretel's face as she examined it and stuffed the fattening treat into her mouth with glee. \"Yum!

The woman gently squeezed Gretel's hand and led her inside.<br>\r\nDispite being edible on the outside, the foyer was ordinary. The dining room however, was a sight to behold. There was a long oak wood dining table filled with cakes, pies, doughnuts, ice-cream sundaes, eclairs, milkshakes, and other treats. Gretel's mouth was watering; the only foods she ever had were stale biscuits, moldy cheese, small sips of bad wine, and maybe a rancid lamb-chop if she was lucky.<br>\r\nThe woman smiled sweetly and said, \"Eat up!\"</span></div></div>",

She groaned as she held belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone over did it.\" Heidi giggled little as she pulled back her chair. Now that she wasn't being blocked by the table, they could see the damage.

After ten minutes, the pressure began to feel unbearable, and her middle grumbled ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... too full...\u201d she moaned, turning away from Heidi\u2019s forkful of home fries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi smiled at Gretels bloated form. \u201cOh, but there\u2019s only a few bites left!

He had to find out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited days for some sort of opportunity to present itself. Then, finally, it seemed luck had struck in his favour. Heidi had gone outside and left her kitchen unsupervised. Hansel wasn't slow to seize his chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen was well stocked. Heidi had no lack of rich foods lying around. Yet all she had served Hansel was porridge and bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an open book on the counter. Hansel could make nothing of the letters, but there was a picture. It was a drawing of a young woman quite unlike any that Hansel had ever seen. She was grotesquely fat. She was a mass of rolls and bulges, with three wobbling chins, flabby arms as thick as tree trunks, and a drooping belly that was reaching for her knees. She was almost as wide as she was tall. Hansel could hardly bring himself to believe that such an obese woman could exist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the book aside. There was no sign of Gretel anywhere. Then he noticed the door. It was a big sturdy door, locked and sealed from the outside with a bar. Hansel wondered what his host could be keeping in there. The door had a hatch and he decided to look through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin was a small, dark room with no windows, lit by a single oil lamp. On a soft bed right in the middle of the room sat his sister. She was eating. Stuffing herself with sausages and pie. She did not look to have been doing much in the way of hard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skinny undernourished girl Hansel remembered was no more. The budding blonde beauty was starting to get fat. Her thin face was turning round and cherubic, her arms were soft and plump. Her bulging midriff and widening hips were straining against her tight dress. Whilst Hansel had been working himself half to death it seemed Gretel had been busy stuffing her face.</span></div></div>",

Heidi smiled as she poked Gretel's belly. \"Stop...too full.\" She groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, I can feel that you have a little room.\" The witch chided as she once again flicked her wrist. Hansel found himself walking into the kitchen and grabbing a pitcher of cream out of the ice box. Heidi took it from him before flicking her wrist again. Hansel panicked as he reached forward and placed his hands of her bloated belly. He was surprise to find a small layer of soft fat on top over her rock hard stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide,\" Gretel opened her mouth as Heidi brought the pitcher to her lips and started pouring the cream down her throat. Gretel moaned lightly but swallowed regardless. Hansel could feel her stomach swelling as she drink. Suddenly it hit him, the picture of the lady in the book. He glanced at the witch in horror as she winked back. Gretel quickly drained the pitcher before falling into a food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are turning my sister into the lady in the book, why?\" he asked on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply, I like meat on my dinner.\" She said with a sick grin as she grabbed her own chubby belly. \"Where do you think all this came from. Now, there is someone in the dinner I want you to meet.\" She flicked her wrist and he once again found himself moving against his will. The door magically closed and locked behind them. Hansel pushed through the kitchen doors and found himself staring at a young woman around his age in a red hood sitting at the dinning room table. \"Hansel, this is......</span></div></div>",

Her eyes wide and of a deep blue color, her face dotted with freckles, her long auburn hair covered by her distinctive red hood. Even now in the midst of danger and despair Hansel could not fail to see her beauty. She looked like a sweet angel. \"You see she was sent her to study under me by her grandmother to be a fat witch.\"<br>\r\nWait so you're not here to eat my sister?\" Hansel asked. \"And what is a Fat Witch?\"<br>\r\n\"Contrary to what most people think of witches young Hansel,\" Heidi started, \"a lot of witches are not evil. I for one am one of them.\"<br>\r\n\"Still doesn't answer my questions,\" Hansel replied.<br>\r\n\"You see a fat witch is a good witch that trains new witches into being fat and also using magic from all the energy they have store into the fat they have,\" she explains, patting her own belly. \"We eat more then we can use so that we won't ever run out. I'm fattening up bot Red and your sister to be new Fat Witches.\"<br>\r\n\"Y-You want Gretel to be one of these witches?\" he asked. \"But why?\"<br>\r\n\"Like my Niece who has potential to be a great Fat Witch, your sister does too,\" she explains. \"I saw a spark of magic in her that was was bright as a star, but was locked away due to how skinny she was, couldn't use her powers or unlock them at all.\"<br>\r\n\"So that's why you're fattening up both your Niece and Gretel, so they can awaken their powers?\" Hansel asked, which Heidi just nodded.<br>\r\n\"You see,girls who become Fat Witches have to be at a weight that depends of the girl,\" she explains. \"some girls take just a few ounces of fat to unlock it. others, like Red and Gretel take a lot more, like tons of fat, the higher to fat, the stronger the magic they have.\"<br>\r\n\"So that's why you're feeding her her so much, and said she's working so hard in her own way,\" Hansel said.<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Heidi answered. \"That's why I wanted her to come here, for when they are ready, I can train them.\"<br>\r\n\"But why am I here then?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Well it is hard for us Fat Witches to move around, we'll need someone to help us, even if we do have powers,\" she answered, \"and you're Soul Mates to my niece,\"<br>\r\n\"Okay I can see-\" Hansel started but stopped at what she said lastly. \"What do you mean I'm her Soul Mate?\"<br>\r\n\"I mean that you and her and meant to be in love,\" she explains. \"You are to be her husband, you feel in love with her the second you saw her, did you not?\"<br>\r\nHansel blushed at what she said. \"W-Well... I do think she's beautiful...\"<br>\r\n\"That's because you also have magic in you young Hansel, you are a wizard,\" she told him.<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" he asked in confusion.<br>\r\n\"Like your sister you have magic powers that are to be awaken, but you are not like the three of us, so making you fat won't help,\" she answered. \"You need to do other things to awaken your powers.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait so that's why I'm also here?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, when a wizard and witch are Soul Mates, they must meet each other, and their powers are stronger together then they would be apart,\" she explains. \"The tasks I had been giving you may have seemed worthless and me just pushing you around to not see your sister, but to actually help you awaken them. One with nature and hard work for you. I was hoping to have you awaken when your sister and my Niece had. I knew if you found out earlier, you'd have ran off with out me explaining to you what I was doing.\"<br>\r\n\"I would no-\" he started, but stopped when she was giving him the look of 'you're lying to me'. \"... Okay... maybe I might have done that...\"<br>\r\n\"but now that you do know,\" she started, \"Will you keep working and awaken your powers, or help me fatten your sister and my niece up to help them awaken theirs faster? I'll let you keep working to awaken your magic after they have, but you'll be behind in magic lessons if you do so.\"<br>\r\n\"And how can I trust you?\" he asked. \"For all I know, you could be lying to me.\"<br>\r\n\"I promise, as a Fat Which, I will not do harm to you or your sister, I just want to train and help you.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" he said. \"I'll keep you to your word.\"<br>\r\n\"So will you help me with your sister and my niece or work on your training?\" she asked.<br>\r\nHansel thought for a second. \"I think I'll...\"</span></div></div>",

Her eyes wide and of a deep blue colour, her face dotted with freckles, her long auburn hair covered by her distinctive red hood. Even now in the midst of danger and despair Hansel could not fail to see her beauty. She looked like a sweet angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hansel, this is little Red.\" The witch said. \"I found her wandering through the woods. Quite lost and looking like she could use a good meal. Isn't that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Little Red smiled. \"I was going to see my grandmother but then... Suddenly the path was gone and I found myself in a part of the forest that I'd never seen before. I don't know what would've happened if Heidi here hadn't found me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome dear.\" Heidi beamed. \"This young man is Hansel, my servant. He'll make sure you get something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl blushed as Hansel caught her eye. He had always been a handsome boy and the many tasks Heidi\u2019d put him to had not exactly diminished his physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very kind of you.\" She stumbled out. \"But I've really gotta find my way back to my grandmother's house. You two wouldn't know the way would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in good time dear. You need to rest and get some food in you. Hansel!\" She commanded. \"Get this girl a nice pie to munch on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel wanted to warn the girl. He wanted to tell her to run. To run as far away from Heidi as she possibly could. But his tongue would not obey. The words seemed to stick in his throat. He found himself grabbing a warm pie out of the oven and putting it down in front of the unsuspecting young woman. He tried to stop his body from moving but it was no use. Scared and confused he glanced up at Heidi. She smiled at him. A wicked grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Red looked at the scrumptious pie Hansel had put before her. His heart filled with hope as she hesitated to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all very nice, but I really need to get to my grandmother's house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course dear. I'll be happy to help you find your way as soon as you've had yourself a bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel found himself hoping against hope that Red would say no. That she would resist the tempting treat and escape from Heidi's clutches. But it was not to be. As she bit into the greasy pie Hansel knew that it was already too late. Red grabbed another piece and soon the entire pie had vanished into her little tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pie must've had an enchantment baked into it for upon devouring the thing Red's disposition changed. She seemed vacant. Her mind lost in a dim haze. Her concern for her grandmother seemed to have slipped away. Heidi patted Red\u2019s back as the girl let out a loud burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow wasn\u2019t that tasty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch grinned. She was licking her lips and rubbing her plump belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like some more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed was a slight young thing. Not the kind of girl who would normally gobble down a pie of such immensity in one single sitting. It was obvious just from looking at her that the delicate girl was stuffed. Even so she seemed eager for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi commanded Hansel to bring her skinny young guest some cake to munch on. He tried to resist but it was no use. Soon he found himself watching helplessly as Red shovelled down slice upon slice of creamy carrot cake. Heidi made the girl eat until her belly was a big bloated ball packed to the brim with food. Then she brought her into a deep magical sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Red drifted off into her enchanted dreams Hansel found his tongue loosening. He could finally speak his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Witch laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a little enchantment dear. I\u2019ve put my mark on you. You can neither disobey my word nor yourself speak a word against me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel said nothing. There was nothing for him to say. The blubbery witch had him exactly where she wanted him. He was powerless to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi grinned as the realisation filled Hansel with dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what boy. Why don\u2019t we make a deal? Little Miss Red here seems quite taken with you. If you feed her until she\u2019s fat enough I\u2019ll let her take your sister\u2019s place in my cauldron.  I\u2019ll make a meal of her and let the two of you go free.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hansel felt queasy at the witches proposal. His natural kindness couldn\u2019t change his answer, but made it much more difficult to say. If he must choose between his sister and this stranger, his sister always came first. Worried that he\u2019d throw up upon opening his mouth, he nodded his agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi smirked contentedly. \u201cGood boy. I\u2019m going to go check on your sister. She\u2019ll remain under my care until your little project gets good and fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel suddenly felt panicked. He\u2019d never fattened anybody before, nor thought of how one would begin doing so. \u201cBut what do I do?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Feed</i> her, of course!\u201dThe plump witch tittered. \u201cDon\u2019t let her leave the bed, and when she says she cannot possibly eat, feed her more! No matter how sick one may feel, it\u2019s impossible to throw up in this house - though you do then have to make sure not to pop them! It\u2019s a very fine balance you must keep.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidy laughed again as Hansel\u2019s face grew chalky white. This was such an enjoyable twist to her little game that she was actually considering keeping the boy around after she\u2019d eaten the girls. Of course, she had no intentions of keeping her deal with Hansel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly left Hansel to go visit Gretel. Through the kitchen she went, slipping into the barred room with grace usually unseen in one so portly. To her disappointment, the girl was still fast asleep. Her stomach was completely round and gurgled loudly as it struggled to digest the mass of food within it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi swept closer to the slumbering girl. She was already growing quite fond of Gretel. The girl was slender still, but had a pretty face, and could hold a lot of food. Better yet, her manner was meek and submissive - she ate when told, and hardly ever questioned why she was being fed as she was. Heidi could stuff Gretel until her belly was ready to pop and she would hardly put up a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now there was a second morsal. Children had been so hard to come by these days that Heidi had been making it a point to slow their gain, so as to better enjoy the process. But with Red in the reserve (Hansel lacked the ferocity necessary for a swift gain - he would make sure her gain went slowly) there was nothing to prevent her from pushing Gretel to her limits!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently stroked the girl\u2019s tortured tummy, feeling a layer of softness that had already formed. \u201cYes, you\u2019re going to be quite the masterpiece...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\no o o<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Heidi finally showed Hansel her kitchen. In reality, she never cooked anything at all, relying instead on a magic cabinet to supply her fattening food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou simply say what you want, and how much. Watch.\u201d She looked directly into the cabinet\u2019s handles. \u201cOne chocolate chip cookie.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the doors, and there was one cookie on a platter. She offered it to Hansel, who accepted nervously. Heidi giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not enchanted. Just delicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed him the plate, then closed the cabinet. She caught his eye for just a moment before reciting an order for an incredible breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTen pancakes with maple syrup and butter. One pound of hash browns. One pound of bacon, done medium. Six eggs, scrambled, with cheese, ham and peppers. Six cinnamon rolls. One gallon of creme.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel\u2019s eyes widened as the witch pulled out platter after platter of food. How did she expect Red to stomach all that? She was so petite, that food probably weighed more than she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi saw his startled face and guessed what he was thinking. \u201cOh, this isn\u2019t for Red. This is for Gretal. I can\u2019t have her falling behind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy suddenly felt his trepidation turn to anger. His sister was just as small as Red - if not smaller! There was no way... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he thought back to the day before, watching as his sister was stuffed to the brim. Her stomach had been <i>pregnant</i> with food, as if she\u2019d playfully hidden a pumpkin underneath her dress. Yet he could see through the rip in her dress that there had been nothing but her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of his sister like that shocked and terrified him. He remembered Heidi\u2019s warning yesterday and shuddered. Was that what he was supposed to do with Red? Force her to eat until her belly was about to burst? Till she felt as though she would puke - and keep going? Could he keep feeding her while she was moaning pathetically, begging for him to stop?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. He couldn\u2019t afford to think like that if he wanted to save his sister and himself. Under the watchful eye of Heidi, he turned to the cabinet and ordered a substantial breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he entered Red\u2019s room, she was still asleep. He walked to her bed gently, and shook her awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said. Red opened her beautiful blue eyes and saw the handsome, mysterious boy from yesterday standing over her with a platter of breakfast. Her heart shuddered delicately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning-\u201d her voice was raspy and dry. She coughed and cleared her throat, blushing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Good morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed the tray in front of her. There was a large stack of seven pancakes soaked in butter and syrup. Beside them was a large pile of bacon, and on a separate plate were greasy golden hash browns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI made you some breakfast. There\u2019s more where that came from, so please eat up.\u201d He said, nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Red said. It looked delicious - he\u2019d cooked it all for her? She immediately began on the pancakes, moaning as they hit her tongue. Something about the flavor reminded her of what had happened last night. It was all a blur - she\u2019d been lost in the woods and found this house, but she couldn\u2019t remember anything after she\u2019d been given dinner. Granny would be worried sick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed took another big bite as she thought about it. \u201cExcuse me, er... Hansel, I think? Can you tell me what happened last night? It\u2019s all kind of fuzzy... I can\u2019t remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel took a calming breath, and recited the story he\u2019d made up. \u201cHeidi, my aunt, found you lost in the woods. You looked distressed, so she took you into her home and gave you something to eat. You didn\u2019t seem well, and after you ate, you fainted. You can\u2019t be wandering the woods in such a state - my aunt has promised to keep you here until you are better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed swallowed her mouthful of hash. \u201cOh my! But Granny will be worried...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you tell Hei- my aunt where your grandma lives, we can send word to her where you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed felt a sense of relief wash over her. \u201cWould she really? Oh, thanks so much!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel smiled as best he could as he watched the beauty eat. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to get to my chores. Ring when you finish, but don\u2019t get out of bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left Red alone with her meal. She continued to shovel the amazing food into her mouth, egged on by both the taste and her infatuation. In less time than she\u2019d thought possible, the plates were empty. She huffed, placing a hand on her middle and loosing a little belch. She hadn\u2019t realized how large the meal had been! Straightening her red hood and smoothing her hair, she rung the little bell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, the door opened and Hansel walked in with another platter. This one was covered in pastries, donuts and eclairs and strudel. He placed it on her lap and smiled. \u201cPerfect timing, these just came out of the oven. Please, enjoy them, and ring when you\u2019re finished\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked in surprise, but didn\u2019t argue. She dug in reluctantly at first, but was able to genuinely enjoy it once the flavors hit her tongue. She plowed through the thick bread and fillings, slowing down as the plate began to empty. She quickly became more and more aware of her aching belly pressing against the laces of her frock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she finished the last bite, she was practically gasping. She\u2019d never eaten so well in her life, and her mother owned a bakery! She squinted in pain as her belly murmured unhappily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinkle of the bell brought Hansel in once again. He saw Little Red laying on the bedsheets, face flushed. There was a small bulge in her dress where her stuffed stomach was - but it wasn\u2019t large enough. When Heidi came in, she needed to see that he could keep his end of the bargain. He couldn\u2019t look Red in the face as he placed a new platter in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast night, you said you loved cherry pie - I made this special for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see the discomfort in her face, though she tried to hide it. \u201cOoh, that\u2019s very, <i>urp</i>, kind of you, but I\u2019m pretty full...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel pursed his lips. \u201cAunt Heidi says that you need to eat up... you look malnourished...\u201d he said uncertainly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned, clutching her stomach as it began to fight her. \"Oooh... I really can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel closed his eyes... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could feel as it strained the fabric of her dress. The girl blushed; her heart skipped a beat as Hansel started to slowly rub her painfully full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW, what are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Hansel smiled as best he could. \u201cI\u2019ll help you get it down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flustered girl nodded. She managed a slight whimper as Hansel brought the food to her lips. She groaned as finally she dug her teeth into the delectable slice. Hansel slowly pushed more into her mouth. He made sure that Red ate every last crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPainfully stuffed as she might be some strange part of Red still rather enjoyed the whole procedure. There was something enticing in having such a handsome young man coddle her and fill her belly up with such delicious foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finally the pie was gone Red was left panting and groaning, her mouth hanging half open.

You look so tired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Red agreed. \u201cNow that you mention it I do feel like I could use a nap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you do...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Heidi could finish her sentence Red had once more drifted off to sleep. Her hands still clutching her midriff she whimpered and groaned as she fell deeper into her food, and magic, induced slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi turned to Hansel, a wicked grin on her chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, what a little charmer you are.\u201d She giggled. \u201cIf you keep this up you might well be able to fatten this little morsel of a girl up into a nice meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel said nothing. He just watched as the slender, unsuspecting girl slept; the bulge of her stuffed belly all too visible under her white dress. Could he really do this? Could he really bring himself to feed that frail, beautiful girl until her slender body was a shapeless sack of sagging fat? Until she was a heavy mass of heaving flesh, thick and flabby enough for Heidi to dig her teeth into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi could see Hansel\u2019s doubts written clearly on his face.<br>\r\n\u201cRemember boy, if you don\u2019t pile the pounds onto little Red here I\u2019ll make a meal of your sister in her place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel thought of his sister. The poor pale girl locked in the witch\u2019s dungeon. He couldn\u2019t let her suffer that fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s big enough for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d The witch purred. \u201cI want to see this emaciated little thing bulging with fat. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now get back to your duties!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, in a spare room, much less welcoming than the others, Hansel awakened. He rubbed his eyes with closed fists as he dreaded another day dawning upon him, which meant more dirty work for Heidi and her meal making...  But, he toughed it out, and got out of bed, brushing himself as he opened the door of his room and exited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs then, Heidi was already up, face at the cabinets as she ordered another massive meal for his sister. Hansel sighed, and Heidi turned around to face him with a wicked grin of hers. \"Mm, Good Morning!\" She said with a pert attitude, successfully making the boy more miserable as she let out a laugh, \"Well? Quit slouching around! You have a full day!\" She said with sweetness in her voice, then slinking quickly behind the turn towards Gretel's dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel had already gotten himself to work, quickly saying an order as he grabbed the monumental load of wonderfully cooked eggs, greased to the Nth degree bacon, and a pile of pancakes sloppily adjusted on top. Perhaps the cabinet was mocking him for his tired tone. He set the plate down, and made the short walk to Little Red's Prison. He opened it up, and spotted the sleeping girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stressed stomach had calmed itself to a small pudge, but that only had it spread quietly through her body. Her face was in a much softer appearance, and her arms seemed just a bit chubbier... Hansel approached her, and gently shook her, and she woke up with bleary eyes and a tired yawn. \"Good Morning!\" Hansel said, trying to sound as sweet as he could, while also dealing with the knowledge this girl was to be eaten as a massive bag of flab. Red blurted out a dreary reply. \"Thanks...\" she said, tired and meek. Hansel gave a smile, \"It's breakfast time....\" he said towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed was a bit partial to this, she had eaten monumentaly.... some time ago. Yet she also felt rather, starved? How long had she been sleeping? She didn't think it could be that long, but she couldn't deny the feelings of hunger that had formulated inside of her. Hansel simply parted to get the meal he made, and Red felt quite honored. After all, with such a handsome man, and delectable food, it was like some sort of dream land... if it was, she could sleep for just a little while longer....</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Little Red's beautiful blue eyes widened as she saw the sheer size of the meal Hansel had prepared for her. Upon the tray he carried in his hands were more greasy, delicious breakfast foods than she'd ever seen in her life. The contents of that tray could've fed an entire family, but they were all for her. Though Red doubted anybody could possibly eat that much her mouth couldn't help but water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange. She'd always been a dutiful, hardworking girl. Never before had she allowed herself to be waited upon, to spend her days lazily lounging in bed, to gorge herself on such vast amounts of rich, heavy food. Any thought of duty, of responsibility, seemed to have vanished from her mind. She was so comfortable, so drowsy, so ravenously hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hansel set her meal down before her Red eagerly dug in. Not wanting to make too much of a pig of herself she tried as best she could to be dignified and ladylike as she stuffed spoonful after spoonful of delicious, greasy, unhealthy food into her slowly rounding belly. She knew that Hansel wanted her to eat. He seemed so kind and gentle. Never before had anybody gone to such trouble to take care of her. She didn't want to disappoint him. She wanted him to think well of her, to be happy with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate until at last, a third of the way through her huge meal, her stomach started to protest. Then, letting out a pained groan, she turned to Hansel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" she said, a blush spreading across her cheeks as she reached the handle of her spoon out towards him; \"I don't think I can take much more on my own. Would you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Hansel froze. Seeming to quickly collect himself he took the piece of cutlery out of her hand. Slowly, gently, he pushed another spoonful of fried eggs in between her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing as, once again, the handsome young man fed her Red did as best she could to ignore the pain in her stomach. When finally every last crumb was gone she let out a moan as Hansel rubbed her stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young man fondled her softening flesh Red, trying to make small talk, asked him about Heidi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seems like a kind woman, Heidi that is, How did you end up with her? You don't look like you're related.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Hansel shrugged, \"there isn't much to tell. Our family had kicked us out, she found us when we were lost in the woods and took us in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us?\" Red asked, raising a quizzical eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said 'us'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel tried his best to keep a calm face as he realized his mistake. Suddenly, by sheer impulse, he found himself trying to tell Little Red all about his situation. About his sister and about what the witch Heidi had done to her. But his throat would not allow him to speak, his lips would not form the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I said 'me'.\" He answered her, curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Red shook her head; \"you said 'us'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I?\" He furrowed his brow. \"Must've been a slip of the tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving, some minutes later, somewhat soothed Red's stomach Hansel left her room only to return shortly with another tray, this one holding a plate full of cookies and a tall glass of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something for you to snack on.\" He smiled. \"Call me again once you've finished it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough painfully stuffed Red grabbed herself one of the sweet treats. She knew that the sooner she'd made her way through them the sooner she would get to see Hansel again.<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nCrumbs falling on her chest Gretel let out a loud, unladylike burp. She was breathing hard, a glassy look in her eyes as she cradled her aching tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever the sharpest or most active of girls Gretel's confinement had done neither her body nor her mind any favours. Weeks spent in darkness, without so much as either a glimpse of the sun or a whiff of fresh air, had dulled her wits and drained her strength. Already a lazy and docile girl she seemed every day to grow more sluggish and compliant. Food was her only pleasure, Heidi, kind and motherly, her only source for human affection. Hungry and eager to please poor little Gretel was only too happy to eat as her captor told her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking pity on the girl Heidi allowed her a short rest before pushing yet another of the syrupy, cream-covered pancakes into her half open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on deary, eat.\" The well-fed woman said, a sliver of steel in her sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowing the delicious breakfast treat to slip past her lips Gretel did as Heidi told her. Bite by bite she munched her way through one mouthful and then another, and then another still until not a single pancake remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what her life had come to consist of: a constant stream of sweets, of pies and pastries, of cakes, cookies, and chocolates. The food that Heidi fed her was neither very healthy nor very nutritious, but it was certainly tasty, and certainly fattening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Gretel herself, having no access to a mirror, had not yet noticed it Heidi's food had already had a noticeable effect on her youthful figure. She was rounding out, growing full and wide. Though not yet truly fat her body had been coated in a layer of soft flesh. The girl was getting plump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the pancakes all packed inside of Gretel's engorged stomach Heidi brought out one final surprise treat. A small apple pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, how about a little something extra to finish off with.\" She cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel's eyes widened at the sight. Though the scent was enough to set her drooling her sides already felt as though they might split at any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm full.\" She whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense.\" Heidi responded, gently squeezing the girl's tightly packed tummy. \"You've still got plenty of room in there. I put a lot of love into this. The least you can do is have a bite. Or don't you like my cooking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do.\" Gretel assured her. \"It's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go on.\" Heidi interrupted, holding a slice up to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a pained groan Gretel allowed her lips to part. Trying as best she could to ignore her aching belly she slowly chewed her way through piece after piece of the delectable pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are such a good girl.\" Heidi cooed, running her fingers through Gretel's golden hair as finally she swallowed the last piece of the pie. \"I'm so proud of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo full to think Gretel simply let out a soft groan as she allowed herself to sink into Heidi's warm embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take care of you.\" Heidi said, putting a hand under Gretel's chin and raising her head until the two were looking into eachother's eyes. \"As long as you do what I say, as you eat what I tell you to, I'm going to keep you safe, happy and full. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Gretel simply stared at her host, a vacant look in her eyes. Then, finally, she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in this moment, with her mind jumbled and her belly stuffed to the brim something was bothering Gretel. It'd been so long since she'd last seen her brother. Where was he? Why hadn't he come to visit her, to talk to her? So many days had passed, yet she had not seen so much as a glimpse of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Heidi, at her warm, kind face, at her safe, plump figure Gretel couldn't help but ask:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, where's Hansel? What's he doing? I haven't seen him in so long.\"</span></div></div>",

He thought that you were perfectly happy here under my care. Is he correct?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....well, yes, but he's my brother.

You deserve someone who will look after you. Someone who would make sure you would never go hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Heidi sweetly placed a hand on the girl's gravid belly and lightly patted it, forcing herself not to drool as it felt tight as a drum.

Of course, Heidi expected something to \"come along to stop Hansel\" so that she could have both of them as a meal. With a knock, she entered the room careful not to startle either of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, miss Heidi. I didn't expect to see you again so soon.\" the older woman just chuckled at the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course dear, I need to make sure my guest is in good hands.\" she turned to Hansel \"Hansel, be a good lad would you and add some coal to the furnace. I'm starting to feel a bit of a chill.\" with reluctance he agreed, if only not to break the fa\u00e7ade the two had made. once he had left, she closed the door and looked to little red. \"well, at the very least it seems like he's keeping you well fed.\" another chuckle as the girl blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he does much more than that. He's so kind to me, and he even keeps me company so I'm not feeling lonely. Although....I should really apologize for the mess. I shouldn't be eating like such a pig, especially in the house of such kind people.\" Red motioned to the crumbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, nonsense. We take it as complement that you eat like that. It just shows how much you like the taste.\" Red thought on that for a moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Heidi, may I ask a question of you?\" A confused look on the older woman's face prompted her to continue. \"When I asked about how he came to live here, Hansel said 'us' when you took him in? Was there someone else with him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi thought for a moment as if debating on whether or not to tell the girl. but then a thought struck 'mayhaps if I spin a half-truth, she may be resolved to quicken her pace of eating.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that is a touchy subject for him indeed. You see, he had a sister. a sweet young lass. but was mentally ill. As I remember, the two were abused, not physically but mentally. While Hansel was strong enough to continue the road of healing, his sister was not as lucky. She broke down many a time. Their father was a week willed man married to a....how to put it?\" she paused for a moment. \"street walker? prostitute? Bah, details....at any rate, She spoke down to Hansel because he wasn't the smartest among the boys of his age and she had shamed Gretel near constant by putting down her body and forcing her to thin out. When I took them in, she was nearly a skeleton. Hansel has become much better, but his sister ended up starving herself to death. This was almost two years ago now. He is starting to act against what that woman put onto the poor girl though, if what I've seen up till now is anything to go by. Who knows, maybe more appreciation to his cooking could win his heart.\" Heidi laughed as little Red blushed even more than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...but I don't....I.....\" Heidi put on a melancholic face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"please dear, do this old hag a good will. Don't tell him I told you any of this. As I've said, it is a very touchy subject and the last thing either of us need is for him to break down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That day, when Hansel brought Red her lunch, the girl ate like never before. Stuffing huge forkfuls into her increasingly fleshy face, she plowed through the huge mountain of food that the handsome young man had set before her. Once, at last, her tray was empty, once she'd stuffed every last morsel of her meal into her tightly stretched tummy, she looked up at Hansel, a coy smile on her face, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have some more please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Red's stomach was packed painfully tight, though she felt as if another bite of Hansel's delicious food might cause her to burst, she wanted so desperately to please him, to win his affections. Thus, when Hansel returned with another tray piled high with fattening treats, Red dutifully ignored her aching tummy and dug in, placidly chewing her way through every forkful that Hansel pushed between her lips. Only once, at last, she'd eaten her way through every last crumb of her oversized meal did she allow herself to let out a pained groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure were hungry,\" said Hansel, a smile on his face as gently he rubbed Red's round, bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your food is very good,\" said Red, a dazed smile on her face as, adoringly, she gazed at the man stroking and soothing her overpacked stomach. \"I've never eaten anything so delicious in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that the young man smiled at her. A bright, warm smile that seemed to Red somehow just a little bit uneasy. Perhaps, she thought to herself, she'd caused him to think about his poor, dead sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the following weeks and months Red ate like never before. Every day she would force more food into her stomach, ignoring as it cried for her to stop. Hoping to impress her host, to win his heart, she obediently ate whatever he put in front of her. The more she gorged the hungrier she seemed to get. Soon she was eating not only to impress Hansel, but also to feed her constant cravings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Red had stumbled on this strange house deep in the forest she'd been a dutiful and hardworking girl. She'd never thought much about boys or about food. Now, however, she could seem to think about little else. Shut up in her room she had little to do but eat, little to think about but food. And the food Hansel served her was like nothing she'd ever tasted before. It was so rich, so creamy, so oily, so salty, and so sweet, nothing like the plain meals her parents had used to serve her. No matter how much she ate she constantly found herself desiring more. It didn't matter whether she was full, whether her belly was packed to the brim, her brain always wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever before had Red experienced such pleasure, never before had she eaten food like the food Hansel served her, never before had anyone cared for her like Hansel cared for her. Yet as time passed the girl couldn't help but start to worry. Was it really alright for her to stay like this? Shouldn't she have recovered already? Might her family not need her? Did they even know where she was?<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nHansel could hardly believe the way Red had been stuffing her face. It was almost like the girl wanted to be eaten, like she was eager to fatten herself up for the witch's table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Red's figure had continued to swell, her face turning soft and round, her thighs and arms growing fleshy and thick, her slender waist spreading into a doughy muffintop, Hansel found he couldn't help but think of the girl as a pig. As a piece of livestock happily fattening herself up for slaughter. She'd been so thin when he'd first seen her, so delicate and slight. Now she was anything but. A hefty girl, her figure covered in a thick layer of loose spongy flesh, Red seemed to be growing hungrier and lazier by the day. Sometimes Hansel couldn't help but wonder if there was something in her food making her drowsier and more indulgent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching as the girl fattened up, Hansel couldn't help but hate himself for what he was doing to her, for what he was turning her into. She was such a sweet girl, so pretty and kind, yet he was robbing her of her figure, of her independence, turning her into nothing but a slab of meat for the plump Heidi to dig her teeth into. Still, he needed to save his sister, to save Gretel. He had, he told himself again and again, no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, though she was getting increasingly drowsy and lethargic, Red still seemed to have some sense of her situation. Over the last few days she'd started, slowly, to ask uncomfortable questions. Questions about what her family was doing, about when she'd be allowed to leave her room, about whether it'd take her much longer to recover from her undernourishment. If this continued, Hansel knew, the girl might wise up to what was going on. She might do something to risk his sister's life. He couldn't allow that. He had to do something, had to make sure that Red stayed in her bed, that she kept on stuffing her increasingly fat face.</span></div></div>",

The source was of course the mouth of the gluttonous girl that had been pampered thoroughly these last few months. Her belly was on its way to becoming a mountain of flab that moved the dress to a mere centimeter below her navel. Her face was truly like that of the moon. Her thighs were almost perfectly touching each other. It was as the slight and petite girl that came into the house never even existed. <br>\r\nIt was at this point of 110 percent fullness that Red realized that she had not seen much of this cottage before. The farthest she had explored even her very room was the bathroom in which she bathed and relieved herself after Hansel\u2019s meals. She decided that she should at least have some idea of where she was staying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no small amount of struggle and effort, Red got up to her feet and after some wild stumbling, she sat up straight with her enlarged belly and behind balancing her out. With heavy footsteps, she walked towards the wardrobe that she never bothered to open before, wearing only the same clothes ever since she came in.<br>\r\nWhen she opened the doors to the wardrobe, Red saw an abundant of children\u2019s clothes that were quite dusty and covered in spider webs. They looked as if they belonged to quite a few children, boys and girls, that came across Heidi and found themselves sleeping in the very same room. There were dresses, shirts, lederhosen, caps, skirts, and even underwear all over the enclosed space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why these children left without taking their clothes? Or perhaps\u2026..\" wondered Red. <br>\r\nShe put a chubby finger up to her ever decreasing chin and pondered. Could these children have their clothes here if they never left the house but were somewhere else? <br>\r\nJust as this awful thought came to her mind, she heard the door open next to her and saw\u2026..   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two siblings have become emaciated from their travels. \"Hey what's that?\" Hansel said pointing to a cottage in the distance. \"GASP a house we're saved! Yayyy!\" Gretel squeeled with glee as the siblings rushed to the mystery cabin in the middle of nowhere. As they reached the cottage they noticed something rather peculiar about the cottage. The typical cottage was built out of wood and bricks but this one had been concructed out of...\"CANDY! Look Hansel solid bars of chocolate NOM!\" Gretel said sinking her chompers into a corner of the house. \"Yum! its the best chocolate I ever had Hansel.\" squeeled Gretel in her elation. \"Gretel maybe you shouldn't...\"Hansel attempted to calm his voracious sister as she took bites out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well what do we have here?\"said a seductive voice behind the door. \"Uh oh\" Hansel said while his sister was franctically trying to discreetly swallow her mouthful of chocolate. Out came a beautiful pale skinned woman with long silver hair and a huge bust. \"Looks like I've got visitors.\" the woman said licking her lips. \"Yes maam uh we're lost and hungry and we'd be so grateful if you supplied us with a room and board.\" Hansel implored. \"It appears that your sister has bee eating my house.\" the woman said eyeing Gretel's chocolate stain lips. Gretel began to stammer but the silver haired woman stopped her. \"Don't fret dears, I'm more than happy to house such a handsome man and a delicious girl.\" she said caressing Hansel's face. \"Please come in.\" the woman said. \"Thank you for your generosity.\" the siblings simultaneously said before they introduced themselves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here have some food.\" the woman said offering two different plates of food to the pair. Hansel's food appeared to be more balanced some meat and vegetables whereas Gretel received a plate filled with desserts. But the two were too hungry to criticize. \"Mmm you know Hansel its been such a long time since I saw such a attractive man like yourself.\" the captivating woman said wrapping an arm around him. \"Oh Gretel when you're finished tell me I'll get you more.\" the woman said while sitting next to Hansel pressing her large bust against his shoulder. A jealous Gretel glared at the two as she ate. Gretel finished while the woman groped Hansel. \"I'm done.\" she said. \"Finished oh no my dear there's plenty more for you to eat.\" the silver woman said. \"But I'm full.\" rebutted Gretel. \"Oh sweety you've must try eating some more.\" the woman said pulling a plate filled with sweets up to Gretel, seemingly out of thin air. \"I don't want anymore sweets though.\" Gretel said.

The room was beautifully furnished, with a smooth wooden floor and homely green walls, the air had a smelled faintly of vanilla. The bed itself was breathtaking. It was King-Sized with handsome crimson sheets and a soft, draping canopy. Gretel stared in awe, which seemed to please the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make yourself comfortable dear, there's bedwear in the cabinet, there to your left. I'll let you get snug while I go get some water for the two of us.\" the woman said. She then gave Gretel a soft kiss on the forehead and exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel did just as the woman said and happily stripped herself of her dirty clothes and chose a fuzzy pair of pajamas from the cabinet. Although she chose the smallest pair at her disposal they were still the slightest bit too large for her, but she wore them nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman returned shortly after to find Gretel had already dozed off and was snoring quietly. She climbed the bed in and pressed herself up against her prize. Gretel was thin with slim legs and a flat stomach, she could easily feel the girl's ribs as she groped her. The woman squeezed the at girl's breasts and bottom to get a grip on how much work she would need to do, careful not to wake her sleeping beauty. She fell asleep cuddled up against the small girl cozily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel awoke and for a moment she couldn't find out where she was. She adjusted herself and saw the silver-haired woman sleeping soundly with a sweet grin on her face. She groggily got out of bed as quietly as she could as to not wake the kind woman who had offered her and her brother so much and asked nothing in return. She took a sip from the glass of water that the woman had laid on the bedside table next to her the night before and then exited the room, moving down the hall to find her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the door to Hansel's room and slowly opened it.

She then walked down to the end of the hall into the kitchen to find that Hansel had nor been there either. Where had he gone? surely he hadn't left without her, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the woman appeared. \"Are you hungry, darling?\" the woman asked her, she never waited for a reply and from the cupboards she produced a plate of soft pancakes, smothering in a thick layer of syrup. Gretel heard her stomach growl, she was famished again, but before she ate she inquired about her brother. \"I am hungry but I think I'll wait for Hansel before I start eating. Would you by chance know where he is?\" she asked. \"Why I'm sure he's simply asleep in his room, I'm quite surprised you're up so early to be frank. But I'll go wake him.\" the woman replied, placing the heaping stack of pancakes on the table and heading towards the guest room to wake the boy. \"He isn't in his room.\" Gretel called at the woman, \"I already checked\". The woman called over her shoulder \"I'm sure you looked in the wrong room dear\" and opened the door to Hansel's room. She then turned to face Gretel with a look of confusion upon her face. \"Maybe he went out for a pee\" she said after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel sat down at the table warily. She never began eating. After a few minutes of waiting, she began worrying for her brother. \"He hasn't come back yet. Where could he be? You don't think he left me do you?\" Gretel heard herself say as the tears fell down her face. \"Sweetie I'm sure he'll be back, no one in their right mind would leave a lovely little thing like you\" the woman replied, moving a chair closer to Gretel and seating herself upon it. \"Here, some food will make you feel a world better\" the woman said bringing a piece of pancake to her lips. Gretel didn't want to upset the nice woman so she complied and opened her mouth for the bite. One mouthful turned to two, two to three and so-on until Gretel had finished the entire stack. The woman was right, she did feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go my sweet\" said the woman, patting Gretel on the back \"I'm sorry to say but you're not in the cleanest state, I'll heat up some bathwater for you\". Gretel agreed,<i>I'm filthy and haven't bathed for a week, Hansel can wait</i>. And so the woman started a fire and heated some water in a small cauldron, she then led Gretel to the bathroom and told her to ready herself in the tub. Gretel stripped her self of her clothes once again and sat herself in the wooden bath, covering her small breasts with her hands as to not expose herself when the woman returned. It took three cauldron-fulls to fill the tub to an apt amount, and by the third cauldron Gretel had found herself in a deep comfort and allowed herself to drop from her breasts as the water covered them, it was only the woman who was going to see her anyways, she wasn't exposing herself to anyone who would care as much as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never did ask your name\" said Gretel as the woman aided in scrubbing her clean. \"My name's Valory, dear, but I'd like it if you called me Val\" she said with a warming smile. When she was scrubbed clean she asked Val to leave the room so she could dry herself off and dress. Val did just that and said she was would leave some clean clothes by the door. As Gretel dried herself off she found herself hungry yet again. She had eaten a large breakfast so this was quite unexpected. She opened the door a crack and pulled in the clothes Val had left for her, a comfy green shirt and some blue shorts that fit her quite loosely. She found Val in the kitchen frying some bacon and eggs and seated herself at the table. Val turned and smiled at Gretel, fixed a large plate of food, placed it in front of the girl and plunked herself down next to her and happily watched her eat, licking her lips all the while. When Gretel finished the plate, Val refused to let her leave without eating another, she managed to down one more but assured Val she was unable to eat anymore. Val seemed content and allowed Gretel to stand up. Her stomach was visibly swollen and as she stood up. Val gleefully hugged the Gretel then took her by the hand and led her back to her room. Val opened the door, pushed Gretel in and swiftly closed the door before Gretel could react. \"I'll be right back my dear, why don't you have a nap?\" Val said to the girl through the door. Taking in all that food had exhausted Gretel and she wasn't in the mood to argue so she plopped herself down into the bed and fell into a deep sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel awoke to...</span></div></div>",
