Currently the two were simply reading in the castles grand library, enjoying each others company.  The dog-eared princess surprisingly had some rare free time this afternoon and suggested that Cinque read up on the land of Fronaldo.  As he was summoned from his home-world of Earth only a few weeks ago, he still had a novice's knowledge of this amazing world, where war is settle with fun competitions rather than dangerous conflict.  Heck it was even impossible to die in these wars as well, due to the magic that surrounds each country. This was perfect for a teen like Cinque, who was a master of anything relating to gymnastics.  Summoned by Millehiore as the warrior of Biscotti, he had fought in many battles and brought much prosperity to the kingdom of Biscotti as well.  As money is rewarded to the victor of these struggles, Cinque's wins were seen as a blessing in the previously struggling country.  In his hands, the boy held a rather big book, filled with the different foods of Biscotti and the history behind each of them.  Flipping through each of the smooth pages, a query had emerged from his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Cinque?\" answered the princess affectionately called 'Millhi' by the boy.  Sitting across from him on one of the many couches of the grand library, she was also reading while the summoned here learned more about her precious land.  The pink-haired girl was wearing her normal pink and white dress, one that complimented both her hair color as well as her lithe figure.  During their time together in the library, she was reading a short romance novel, as the very idea of love would cause her heart to speed up, especially when it came to Cinque.  While they hadn't known each other for long, the two had great chemistry together, and were nearly inseparable as well.  While they weren't exactly official yet, the pair would be 'touchy-feely' at times.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you people have eclairs here?  I've looked through this book and I haven't seen it mentioned yet.\"  Tilting her head slightly, the girl was confused at what he was asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eclair? Do you mean Eclair the knight?\" said the princess, referring to Eclair, the head of the castle guard.  A temperamental girl, her skill showed no equal, well until Cinque was summoned.  The two were evenly matched and would spar often; sometimes a bit too much for Millhi's liking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no. I mean the food. The pastry called an eclair.\" explained Cinque.  Still confused, the dog-girl went over to where he was sitting, and took a seat somewhat close to him.  She took the book from him and turned to the table of contents.  Scanning the few pages, the word 'eclair' failed to show up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's nothing in the book about it. And this pretty much includes all the kinds of foods we make here.\"  Cinque still wasn't satisfied by such an answer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, then what is Eclair named after if you guys don't have the food here?\" Scooting closer to him, the girl tried to recall the origin of that name.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I remember right, it's based off of a famous warrior in ancient times.  Though there's not much else to go on though. What does this food look like? Oh and how does it taste?\" Now she was getting curious.  She always did love the eccentric 'things' that came from Cinque's home-world. Actually noticing that the girl was quite close, he tried to move back, but she moved an equal distance towards him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An eclair is a pastry that's made of dough. It's then fried, and injected with a type of creamy filling.  To finish it, you place a layer of chocolate frosting on the top of it.  I've had it a few times, and it tastes very sweet, and the chocolate only accents that taste.\" explained Cinque as he found himself on the edge of the couch, Millhi still quite close.  By his description, her eye gleamed with interested. She wanted to have one of these so-called eclairs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That sounds wonderful! Do you think we can make them here?\" asked Millhi, grabbing onto Cinque hands in excitement.  Her ears were twitching and her tail was waging very rapidly.  Though Cinque was clearly flustered at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you guys have the right ingredients theoretically its possible.  Though you might need an oven for that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm, we do have a few since we need to make so much food for our troops. Let's go over to the kitchen then.\" said Millhi as she rose from her seat.  Cinque followed suit, though he had a little help from the girl 'helping' him up.  Exchanging a small smile, the two headed over to the rather large doors of the library and into the many vast hallways of the castle.  They were perhaps walking a little too close to each other, but that didn't seem to matter that much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Like Lady \u00c9clair of the Knights?\u201d Cinque shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. From where I come from an \u00c9clair is a unique desert.

We\u2019ll be more than happy to try and make these \u2018\u00c9clairs\u2019 for her majesty.

As they needed to wait patiently to receive the fruits of the worker's labor, Millhiore led her hero to one of the many gardens that the castle possessed. It was actually her favorite one as there were many beautiful flowers to admire and it was rather peaceful. Reaching the stone doors, the princess exerted a bit of force to open them, which created a rather serene view. Cinque was awed to such a sight. There were flowers of all colors and of different types and were strewn around in arrangements that could only be described as art.  A calm wind passed from the closed area making the air quite refreshing in addition to the natural scents of the flowers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess! This is quite amazing. I didn't know such a place existed here.\" exclaimed Cinque, happy that his princess would share such a place with him. The girl flashed him a warm smile, her dog ears twitching and her pink tail swaying in happiness. She grabbed his arm and lead him towards a nearby stone bench. Both of them sat down, close to one another once again. This time however, the princess was practically touching sides with her hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like to come here from time to time, when things get a bit stressful.\" she said. As the princess to the Biscotti kingdom, she had many responsibilities and the pink haired girl always made sure that everyone is happy. Thanks to that, she was revered by all of the people in her land.  Cinque felt sympathy for his princess; indeed to have such duties at a young age was admirable. Cinque closed his eyes, taking a deep breath of the fresh air and let his mind wander. His stresses about returning home slowly dissipated and were replaced with those of his princess, The had instantly connected within days of knowing each other and the blond felt a strange feeling in his chest whenever the two were close to one another. The feeling building up in his chest once more, he tried to ignore it, but it was very persistent. Trying to figure out what this meant, he felt Millhiore place her head upon her shoulder. A small blush growing on his face, he saw that her eyes were closed and her breathing was calm. The strange feeling only seemed to intensify.  Before he could react, a noise was heard in front of them and the door was opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess! I knew I would find you in here!\" A very bouncy and hyperactive girl bounced into the small garden, her small brown tail wagging with happiness and eagerness. It was Ricotta, or Rico as she was called by all of her friends. The girl had long brown hair that flowed on to her shoulders , a yellow buttoned up shirt worn under an oversized lab coat and a pink skirt around her waist.  The small girl's dog ears fidgeted with delight as she ran over to the two. In her surprise entrance, both of them had separated much to the disappointment of the energetic pink haired princess. Rico sat right next to Cinque and snuggled into his side. The hero of Biscotti smiled and rubbed her head gently. The princess couldn't help but to fee; somewhat upset about the scene in front of her. Perhaps it was a simple pang of jealousy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what brings you here Rico?\" asked Cinque. Rico stood back up and took out some blueprints that she had on her person. In a flash she presented them to both of her friends, but they lacked the technical know-how to fully grasp it. Seeing their reactions she began to explain what her plan was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know when Cinque let me use the thing he called a 'cell-phone?' Well using that I was able to make something really awesome. I also incorporated some magic so it would be balanced in its efficiency. It's a device that can mass reproduce any item! How useful is that dear princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Now we wouldn't have to worry about our war supplies or other related things.\" said the princess, happy that some of the problems that the kingdom faced could be solved. Cinque was quite impressed that Rico could come up with such an invention, shw was leagues ahead of any scientist on Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, now all I need is a few materials, luckily I made a list.\" Rico then retrieved a piece of paper from her person and handed it to the other girl. It was a list of the mentioned materials and their costs. As the princess looked over it, the door was opened once more.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Dressed in her combat attire, the trio assumed that she was head out to the training yard to work on her skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Eclair, how are you this afternoon.\" said Milhiore with a sweet voice and smile to match. The others greeted similarly as the icy-hot girl blushed when she saw Cinque, never quite getting over their accidental kiss a few weeks back.  The chef went back to the kitchen to let the four chat without any interruption.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing fine princess, I'm headed out to train a few of my bright power skills. I've been slacking a bit since the last festival, I hope you don't mind.\" During the last festival, the girl clashed blades with the ruler of Galette, Leon Michille. While she managed to break her weapon using her bright power skills, her body was greatly fatigued and she had been resting ever since. The princess shook her head as she petted Eclair on hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its fine Eclair, after your splendid display of bravery and strength, you deserve to rest.\" smiling back, Eclair nodded, her tail happily wagging back and forth for such praise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be sure to spar with me sometime soon! I want to make sure I'm keeping up with you.\" Cinque said in an enthusiastic voice.  He was always eager to test his abilities, hoping to make his princess proud of him as her hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, before you leave, would you like to taste eclairs with us?\" Turning her head and her ears twitching in a bewildered fashion, the girl began to think that they wanted to taste her! Seeing the confusion on her face, Cinque began to explain that back in his world an eclair was a dessert. More specifically that it was fried dough frosted with chocolate and injected with a cream filling.  The description of the dessert did cause Eclair to become interested and she decided to head along with the trio. Training could always wait a bit. Becoming impatient, Rico grabbed the wrists of Cinque and the princess and started in the direction of the kitchen, with Eclair following the three in silent laughter.</span></div></div>",

Milhe looked towards Cinque, her ears twitching and her tail wagging in a rapid manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cinque! It tastes delicious!\" she shouted, her eyes shining with enthusiasm. The other two girls reacted in the same manner and began to eat the rest of the treats off of the plate. Milhe, seeing that she was losing in this 'race' began to pick up the pace as well. Ten minutes had passed and the girls had devoured the treats and Cinque wasn't even able to taste one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I guess you all enjoyed them?\" he asked, slightly shocked at seeing such an amusing event play before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were decent.

Before they even started, Rico had to go over the details in baking, how to make the flour, how to create the creme, chocolate glaze and all of the instructions needed as well.  With everything said, the four began to work, finding it easy to split up the work. Cinque and Milhe would work on the dough, Eclair would work on the chocolate glaze and Rico would work on the creme. Heading over to Milhe, Cinque got a good look at the pink haired girl, finding even an apron to make her look rather adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So ready to get started?\" he said with that bright smile of his. She gave an eager nod and began. They first started with stirring up the batter, making sure to put in the right measurements and such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going well huh Cinque?\" said Milhe as he watched as he stirred the bowl in a rigorous manner. With a smile, she lightly tapped his face with a bit of flour. Feeling the touch, he looked up to see Milhe giving a soft laugh. Touching his cheek, he saw the bit of flour that got on his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milhe?\" With that, she lightly tapped him once more, letting out a giggle this time. Placing down the bowl, he took a bit of flour and tapped her back. The second he touched her face, he felt just how 'soft' the dog eared princess was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop flirting and get back to work!\" yelled out Eclair, her face red with anger from seeing such a 'cute' exchange. The two let out a laugh and went back to work, not even fazed by Eclair's accusations. With a frown, she went back to her own work. Rico saw the whole situation and let out a small giggle, she really was hoping that Milhe and Cinque confess their feelings for one another. All four continued on with their work until all the parts were ready. Handing the dough to Rico, she shaped and rolled it into equal parts, placing that bit into the oven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job so far, but we probably need to pick up the pace.\" explained Rico as she observed the dough baking in the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't want to involve the kitchen staff, I do want them to rest and give them the treat.\" said Milhe, trying to think of a possible solution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we try to use magic?\" suggest Cinque, recalling the possibility of magic being used to create food from Rico earlier that day. </span></div></div>",

Now, Cinque, can you add in that vanilla to the cream for the next batch?\" She asked. \"I'm too short to reach it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already half-done!\" He leapt up and open a cabinet door, inspecting several different bottles containing vanilla. Since there's going to be a lot of mouths to feed...the bigger one can work! He grabbed that and leapt back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Improving leg strength?\" Asked Eclair towards her fellow blond champion of Biscotti. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Keeping in tip-top shape for whenever the next war comes around!\" Cinque flexed off his muscles a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so, with this batch do we add them to the batch for the servants or-\" He was cut off by the sound of a growling stomach, mainly one coming from Milhe, making the princess' cheeks as pink as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh dear...Well...\"</span></div></div>",

We are making more after all.\" said Cinque as he stared at the dog eared princess who still sported a rather red blush on her normally pale face. Rico and Eclair looked at her as well, finding her to be rather cute right now. A quick idea formed in Rico's crafty mind. Taking the now finished eclairs and placing them on a platter, she put them in Cinque's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eclair and I will take care of things here. Take Milhe into one of the dining rooms and take care of her.\" said Rico with a wink as she pushed the two out of the room. As Eclair watched the whole thing, another frown formed on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really do dislike how you're always pushing them together. You shouldn't force things like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? They like each other, I'm doing them a favor. Anyways let's get back to work. Help me out with the magic.\" said Rico, her hands glowing with an orange light as she commanded the bowls and utensils to move around, mixing the necessary ingredients. Eclair helped out by taking out more bowls and setting up the materials to be used.  With this pace, they would probably be done in an hour or so. Meanwhile, Cinque led Milhe to one of the numerous dining halls in the castle, this one being a bit more private than the others. Approaching the door, Milhe unlocked it, leading to a single room with a very long dining table, a few cabinets and numerous chairs. Walking forward, Cinque placed the eclairs on the tabled while Milhe closed the door behind them and locking it. She wanted privacy after all. Walking over, she sat down right next to Cinque, the light blush still on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we're alone now.\" she said, her voice rather low. Cinque nodded, feeling his own face grow red. Still, he had a rather interesting idea. Taking an eclair, he slowly presented it to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, open up.\" he said with a bright smile. She nodded and let him feed her, taking a bite out of the sweet treat. Just like before, they came out perfectly, tasting like absolute wonder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it good?' he asked as she ate the rest of the treat in one bite. She nodded vigorously, feeling a rather warm sensation emanating from her core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it really is.\" With a nod, he continued, feeding her eclair after sweet eclair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you have a bit on your cheek, Hold on, let me go get a napkin.\" said Cinque as he was about to sit up.  The creme was right near her lips so it would be easy to remove with a cloth.  However, Milhe grabbed his hand, her face once again dyed in a reddish color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Not that way, there's another way you can do it.\" she said in a rather shaky voice.  He looked at her, seeing her red face made his mind finally make the connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Milhe gave him a soft nod. With this, he took in a breath and came closer the girl, holding her by the shoulders. Slowly, he inched his face closer to hers and kissed the corner of her lips, tasting the sweet frosting. He gently pulled back to find her with a soft smile and warm face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we continue?\" asked Milhe as she pointed to the rest of the eclairs on the platter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"</span></div></div>",

And whenever he saw a speck of cream near her lips, he would draw near and give her a kiss, cleaning her. The girl would blush deeply, her face being redder and redder as he continued to feed her. He noticed her tail behind her wagging constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, Cinque?\" Asked Milhe as she finished swallowing Eclair Five. She turned her head around, looking towards the sofa. \"Wanna move this over to the couch? You can shuffle the table over if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what you got in mind?\" HE asked as he stood up and helped Cinque to her feet. He noticed a slight curve in her dress as she sat down at the sofa. The blond moved some chairs aside and dragged the table over more closer to the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, while you feed me, can I...rest my head on your lap?\" Asked the princess nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead...resting on lap!? Steam came out of Cinque's ears at the prospect of it all. This truly was the beginning of something beautiful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uhhh..yeah I'd like that!\" He rubbed the back of his head as he sat down. Biscotti's champion felt the girl lie down, resting her head on his legs and looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" smiled the boy as he ruffled behind her ears, making the girl moan slightly and even...move her leg!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are such a puppy-girl.\" He chuckled as he began to place the Eclair up to her mouth, and Milhe took it without object, eating and moaning as she felt her ears getting some loving and the texture and creamy filling of the treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she had many many more to go.</span></div></div>",

It's almost completed!\" Cheered a perky dog girl within the confines of Firianno Castle. Riccota \"Rico\" Elmar, the head scientist of the Biscotti Regime has finally created her unique elixer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week ago, she was approached to by Princess Millhiore due to a concern with the health of the Biscotti troops. It turns out that many of them are becoming more and more tired through out the various war games with Galette and it's not just a matter of physical conditioning but rather of exhaustion. Wherever the heroes are not fighting at, the fighting could sometime rage on for hours on end, and even with peak physical condition the Biscotti soldiers cannot seem to catch up to the Galette troops. As it turns out thanks to an observation by Imperial Guard Captain Eclair Martinozzi, the Galette troops have been drinking some kind of substance. After the war game(Biscotti won but barely) the higher delegates of both city-states met in regards to whether or not this new substance some of the Galette troops are illegal or performance enhancing. As it was revealed, it was simply an energy drink and not a perfomance enhancing drug of any kind, as Leonmitchelli Galette Des Rois, the cat-people's monarch, allowed the Princess and Hero Cinque Izumi to inspect the facility that churns out the energy drinks. And so Millhi has asked Rico to craft a caffine drink of some kind to give the Biscotti soldiers a boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a little more...\" She said, inspecting her machine as it was churning and twirling the liquid within and drank some water from a nearby mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the giant blender chimed, signaling it's completion, Rico's tail stood on end and wagged. It was done! She took a mug and placed it under a faucet attached to the machine and allowed some of the substance to pour out. She took a sip...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd blanched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeek! Too sour!\" She blanched. She gave a sigh. \"I suppose I was too optimistic in thinking I'd get it right on the first try...maybe I need to add more sugar...\" The brunette dog-girl thought outloud. She looked back at the pitcher which contained the leftover substance. \"Eh, might as well scratch this.\" She took the pitcher and and poured it out of her window...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd down into the stream below. She 'eeped' when she relaized she poured out the juice into the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully no one saw that...\" Rico mused. \"Well,\" she bounced, grin back on her face. \"Back to the drawing board!\" She began to tinker with her experiments and materials again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, the light blue liquid began to merge in with the water as the stream flowed right into Galette lands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-X-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to grab some water,\" mused a short girl in monotone as she treaded near the river, canteen in hand. Noir Vinocacao was traveling with her fellow Genoise members, Jaune Clafouti and Vert Farberton down to Vannette City for a meeting with the Prince Gaul on some new development in which they are in the dark about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark haired girl took the canteen, took the pure river water, and took a swig slightly. She smacked her lips noticing how the water had a unique taste that she couldn't describe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better head back...\" She droned as she stepped away from the river and headed back to her fellow Genoise members.</span></div></div>",
