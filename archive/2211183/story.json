You had been left out of the den of the so-called \u201cMonster Sows\u201d dwelling deep in them\u2014your master forbade you stepping a toe into the entrance as you were but a frail page barely earning your privilege into being a lowly squire at this rate. Thus you had many conflicted feelings about the ordeal; as much as you wanted to go inside with the others of your company, you did not want to run into the alleged \u201cMonster Sows\u201d that your king had commanded the knights to vanquish; had you gone in and nothing was seriously wrong you would be teased for letting temptation steal you unlike a proper squire-to-be, if something was truly wrong then you would be next to fall prey to these monsters if you weren\u2019t harshly reprimanded for disobeying orders before then, if you stayed and nothing was wrong then you would be further mocked and jeered at for not daring to be a true adventurer, and if the others truly were set upon then when they returned you would be scolded for not having the foresight to at least bring them aid. As a result you found himself steadily inching toward and away from the entrance in a back-and-forth pattern, constantly at war with yourself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maybe they didn\u2019t really need you in there you though. Then again, you could just wait inside close to the entrance so the others don\u2019t have to come back as much. Weighing your options one more time, you had finally come to make your decision\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

Taking a spare sword and dagger with you, along with a few provisions, you made your way torch in hand inside of the cave. The trip was surprisingly uneventful for a while; you half expected some wild animal or maybe even sort of hideous monster to jump out at you\u2014only to be cut down by your blade (which was actually very unlikely the more you thought about it but one can dream). It hadn't occurred to you that you had been walking for several minutes straight until you saw the light in your torch dim, though before you could lament your ill-fated decision you were nearing the end of the tunnel when light besides that of your own came into sight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few more moments and you finally made it through the tunnel, and then you found yourself in another conundrum; the torch-lit room you had entered had three more tunnels to travel down. The one right in front of you had a bright light coming from further back, making it easier to see, but you could make out a distinctly non-human shape if you squinted your eyes hard enough. You could even hear voices coming form it, and you couldn't tell whether or not they were friendly. To the right of that tunnel was a pitch-black one, being so dark that you doubted that your torch would grant you much light in it. It was also deathly silent, so there was no immediate clue if anything was down there. Finally, to your left you saw a tunnel that trailed off into darker lighting, but what caught your attention most was the trail of blood just leading further into it, and there was the sound of someone or something clearly eating whatever. Either way, all the tunnels seemed to be just as dangerous any way you looked at it. Instead of making another move, you contemplated your next action\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

Incredibly wary, you slowly advanced toward it with your torch held out in front of you to better see up ahead. A few minutes in, the torch had flickered to half of its brightness; it seemed that even the silencing, suffocating darkness of the cave was snuffing out the flame on your torch. Your gut instinct told you that the moment it went out, some monster would jump out at you to attack, and at that point you would need to head back. Soon enough, the flame on it finally went out, and with your page's blade drawn you were backing away from whence you came\u2014only to find the narrow tunnel widen up and you fall flat on your keister. You struggled to stand back up, and not long after that you were snapped up in a powerful grip, dropping your only means of defense to the ground. You tried to scream but a cold-as-death hand clamped itself over your mouth, and from your cheeks you can feel that this thing had sharp claws. Struggle as you may, you couldn't escape from this creature's grasp, and you were rewarded for your meager efforts with a chilling giggle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, well, well\u2026\" a silken voice whispered in your ear. \"What a fine, fresh catch to have stumbled blindly into my lair\u2026\" You wondered about the rest of your knights\u2014mostly hoping that one of them would come to your rescue, but the voice's mocking laughter dashed those hopes. \"Foolish child; no one will come to save you in this pitch darkness. Now that I have my perfect prey, the outside world will be a thing of the past for you.\" You then heard the sound of what sounded like stone slowly moving from behind you, and then it suddenly stopped. Suddenly, torches from all around the room lit up, revealing a small room decorated very much like some noble's private quarters. Disturbingly, there were also some sort of magic sigils scattered throughout the room along with the dried up husks of a few of your fellow knights. The next thing you knew you were harshly jolted around to face your captor: a young white-haired woman with skin pale as the moon and eyes red as blood. Her entire appearance was impossibly immaculate from top to bottom, though you quickly chanced a glance behind her to find that the way you came in from was sealed off with a giant slab of stone marked with magic inscriptions all over it. The woman smirked at your impending fear once you also found that your weapon was gone, leaving you completely at the mercy of this woman.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You poor fool of a lad\u2026\" the woman cooed mockingly. \"You ought to have known better than to wander into a pitch black cavern all by your lonesome, and now you are paying the ultimate price.\" She was right; you embarked on an ill-fated quest to prove yourself ready to become a knight, and you walk right into a monster's trap beyond any hope of saving if your fellow fallen knights were any indication. \"Now, I could simply quench my thirst with your virgin blood and put you out of your misery, or perhaps\u2026enslaving you could be more worthwhile\u2026\" Either way you were not coming out of this encounter, and either option sounded equally bad. Before she could come to her own decision, you had to see if you could change her mind\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

One day, the king orders your company to rout a nest of monsters known as \"The Den of Monster Sows\". While the knights venture on inside without you, telling you to stay put \"for your own good\", you can't help but feel that you were wasting your time sitting out all of the action as they seem content letting you stay as a lowly page. You could either be a good lad and wait for your masters to come back or you could go after them into the so-called \"Den of Monster Sows\". Either way, you'll run into encounters that you'll have to think quick or else you'll end up as the monsters' next victim\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story revolves around you and the many \"Monster Sows\" in and out of their dens\u2014who are actually very beautiful creatures\u2014but are nonetheless monsters who you will have to find your way around to not end up as another of their victims like your knight's company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow are the general set of rules and, fair warning, they may be strict:<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If you start a route, be sure to leave at least one empty slot for another person to start their own routes\u2014mark your routes that you do not wish to be disturbed as \"reserved\", especially if you can add up to three or more extra routes, and respect others' \"reserved\" routes by not hijacking them. However, if you have a \"reserved\" route and it has not been worked on for at least a month or two (or I suspect that you have been inactive for that long period), I will free it up to the best of my ability for others to use it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If you are going to end a route, please do so on a route you \"reserved\" for yourself and not on others were there is no such \"reservation\".<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While I will not disallow any sort of sexual fetish, I will not tolerate out-and-out rape made out to be \"enjoyable\" for the victim in any fashion; if I see such writing it will be trashed immediately. Rape fantasy thus should be written very carefully to make sure that it is entirely consensual on both party's ends.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While not a \"rule\" per se, please take care to write with proper grammar, though I understand that sometimes it can be difficult if you do not speak English or some other language you're writing in as your first language.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another thing is that while this isn't an outright rule it should still be considered; I enjoy stories with heart put into them; even if it is just about the page \"taming\" all the monsters in the den I would like to encourage all of you to put some care into it to make it enjoyable to read. Short entries will be allowed on a case-by-case basis; chapters should be about four to five sentences long (which themselves should be about four to five words long).<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Since this is an interactive story from the reader's perspective it would be expected that most entries are written from the reader's point of view and what actions they will take next; the page will be male by default but changing his sex and/or gender is still perfectly acceptable for those who do not identify with a male/cisgendered protagonist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules may change and be adjusted to entries added here and there but that should be about it for now. I bid you all a well writing experience. I will add gift points for entries that I find satisfactory for as long as I have gift points.<br>\r\n</div></div></span></font></span></td>",
