So, where's your dorm?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led me down a hallway upstairs and went inside his dorm. His roommate wasn't there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's your roommate?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. No one does. He disappeared suddenly, like 2 monthes ago,\" Evan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered about that for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey David, I have to go to class now. Will you be fine here til I get back?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll be back at four,\" David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he left, I looked around the whole dorm. I felt kind of thirsty, so I opened the fridge to see if Evan had anything to drink. Of course not. Before I closed the fridge, I noticed a small bottle in the back of the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" I asked myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drank what was in it(I was that thirsty).

Suddenly being reduced to a hundred-fortieth of that was a major experience. Everything around him was one hundred forty times as large: a paperback book on the floor stretched 82 feet long, a pencil was 46 feet long, a dime was nearly five feet wide and had thickness that Dave could actually see. He gingerly walked up to it and stepped atop the dime, realizing that he was now higher up. It was mindblowing that a dime, something he used to be able to fit in his pocket, could now be like a podium to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid struggled to recall the series of events. He had guzzled a bottle of something, sat down, and...taken a nap? Or had he passed out? He couldn't shake the feeling that he has passed out and fallen off the couch, because he was now on the carpeted floor, not the seat cushion of the couch. Was that a shrinking solution or something? Somehow, though, he was still fully clothed. He had a feeling that if he hadn't been wearing his shoes, the thick carpet would have been hard to navigate. It felt like thick moss under him, he could barely walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to find that bottle! Should he go to the minifridge in the corner, or go somewhere that Evan would find him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered if the bottle was even still in the fridge. Had he finished it or not? He couldn't remember. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, there was an area right by the door where Evan might notice him. There were two pairs of shoes by the door, black flip-flops and New Balance running shoes. He wondered if Evan would see him when he entered the room and took off his shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to decide soon, because, looking up at the Big-Ben-sized clock on the wall, David noticed that it was 3:50. He must have been asleep for longer than he'd thought; Evan would be here soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard a squeak from under Evan's bed. Squinting, David gasped. He could make out what looked like a jail, a tiny cage, with someone inside. A shrunken person? David flashed back to what Evan had said about his roommate. Disappeared? Or shrunk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should he go? He had 10 minutes to decide and get there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
