When you walked in the door, your mom called saying the dog got ran over.Then at lunch your Amanda wanted to talk, she didn't explain why but she broke up with you, tearing up as she walked away. Not just that, but you had failed a test earlier and would fail 2 more later in the day. By the time you got home, you didn't want to do anything you were so depressed. You skipped out on dinner, your mom tried everything to get you out of your room but nothing worked. It was about 10 at night when you finally said aloud, \"I wish I could be someone else....\". The Lights shut off, and a glow came from outside your door. It grew more intense as it approached your door. The door flew wide open, a beautiful spirit appeared. Her hair flowed down past her back, her clothes like a roman goddess, she glowed a bright white, illuminating your entire room. She spoke softly, \"If you truly wish to be someone else, I will grant it.\" You nodded in awe. \"I will show you how you are living in other dimensions, for I cannot disrupt someone else's life.\" she seemed to whisper but her voice filled the room. She waved her hand over your bed, 5 items appeared. A hairbrush, a football, a guitar, a gold wristband, and a mysterious box. \"Touch one, and view how the you who owns it lives.\" the spirit said soothingly. Which did you choose?</span></div></div>",

When you came too, you were lying on a bed. You sat up and looked around, the room was very girly. The floor was covered in a dark purple shag carpet. On the back of the door to the hallway hung a short pink robe. On the wall were posters of male actors and singers. On the end of the bed was a pile of stuffed animals. You pulled the purple and black covers off of yourself and stood up. You noticed that you were at least 6 inches shorter. You noticed the weight on your chest and peered down. You saw the two mounds protruding from your chest. They were covered by a white tank top. You looked farther down to see pink sweatpants. You finally looked in the mirror, you saw a cute teenage brunette. Her hair a light brown, in long elegant waves. Freckles were scattered across her face in a cute fashion. Her eyes a beautiful green, you kinda got lost in them until you remembered that girl was an alternate version of yourself. So you were mesmerized by yourself. The room got dark, then bright again. You turned to see the spirit behind you. \"You will now observe for one day how this you lives, when the day is done I will reappear to you.\" she said calmly fading away. The lights turning back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nicole, hurry up and get ready for school!\" your mother said from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright mom, be down in a sec.\" your body replied. It started to move on its own towards the closet. You were confused until you remembered that the spirit said you would observe this life for a day, not live it. Your body opened up the closet, you could feel everything your body could. \"Umm what would be cute today?\" your body said. Then your body grabbed a v-neck sweater, pink and black stripes. Then it grabbed a jean mini-skirt. Quickly your body stripped revealing a bright green bra and panties. It slid the skirt up, and put a laced tank top on under the stripped v-neck sweater. Your body sat down in the mirror, it grabbed the brush the spirit showed you and brushed its hair. Then it did it's makeup, grabbed a purse and headed downstairs, slipping on some pink flip flops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute!\" your mom said. She seemed much skinnier in this universe, you almost hated to say that she was almost more beautiful too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom!\" your body said hugging your mom good morning after walking down the stairs. You could feel your breasts bounce on every step. They had to be at least C sized. Your body sat down, ate some cereal and then left for school........</span></div></div>",

Your body was talking with some girl named Kate before your second class when she stopped your conversation. She pointed towards the door. Your  head turned and a couple of football boys walked in. You found your eyes focused on the the tall dirty blonde boy in the middle. The moment his gaze turned towards yours, you felt your face flush and look down. Even your hand went up to play with your hair. The boy walked over and sat in the seat in front of you. Your body turned to look at Kate, who in turned motioned for you to talk to the boy. Your body shook it's head, but Kate kept urging. Finally your body seemed to agree. Your head turned to see the name on the back of the jersey. You recognized it, Van Dyke, that was your ex Amanda's last name. You felt your left hand raise and tap him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mitch,\" your body said, \"Good luck tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned, but your body wouldn't make eye contact with him, \"Thanks, cheer hard for me okay?\" he asked. Your face flushed again and your head nodded and giggled an \"Okay\" It then turned to look at Kate as if to celebrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the rest of the day, this version of you couldn't help but think about Mitch, who you assumed was this universe's Amanda. So much that even you couldn't focus on the classes, her thoughts were so loud. She fantasized about a date, homecoming and even what might happen after that. It scared you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found that Nicole wasn't super popular, but had a larger amount of friends than you did. She even had better grades than you. She was on the cheer squad and was a candidate for captain next year. Towards the end of the school day, you thought you had figured this girl out when. You felt a familiar sensation when....</span></div></div>",

The flirty first encounter with the bouncer at the door, and inside the pair would bump into Mark Thompson, the club's owner/manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was bound and gagged in her own small flat. One she shared with Amanda. The bouncer now pacing nervously back and forth in front of her. She'd just put on her uniform blouse as she'd opened the door, to see the horror on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing his way in by sheer strength, he'd overpowered both her and Amanda easily. Amanda laid out with a single back-handed blow, her head hitting the wall with a sickening thud, before she fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole/Carli wasn't sure how the man had found her home, but events were escalating terrifyingly. Her hands cuffed securely behind her back, and no-one aware of her situation. The bouncer, Carl was on the phone, his agitation obvious, he paced up and down the small kitchen area as he talked in low hurried whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis leering gaze falling on her exposed flesh. Her firm, full bust completely exposed for his appreciation. The sight almost as disturbing for Cole, as she watched her chest heave as she gulped deep lungfuls of air down to calm herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never went far, but a sense of relief flooded your veins when he went to check on Amanda. The rapid ticking as she was secured in handcuffs too, oddly settled her nerves, at least if she needed to be handcuffed she was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/96881c493572cf58937c4c8a91291b76/tumblr_p2ckoi5Efq1w2lwkto4_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/96881c493572...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to see her flatmate through the door, as Carl returned.

Her attempts at freedom renewing as she saw him pull a syringe from his case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you know of our little operation?\" His voice steady, and smooth, making it all the more intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head 'no', as you truly know nothing. Both you and Amanda were chosen for your youth rather than any insight you'd bring to the case, or anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then this will come as a surprise to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStabbing the needle into your arm, he presses the plunger down quickly filling your veins with it's contents. Uncertain whether it was a poison, or whatever the hell it was, she hoped it wasn't lethal. Hoped against hope that the nightclub was just spreading drugs, she felt a warmth spread out from her arm. From the injection point, a colder dread filled her, was she going to be turned into an addict, and made to work as a whore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your panic filled thoughts and fears, you look up to see Mark returning to the living room an empty syringe in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat reached her shoulder, and her heart raced as the warmth spread across her chest. The heat intensified becoming unbearable as the cuffs held her in place. Half afraid her heart was about to stop, Carli was slow to realise what the drug was doing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/449b1efe517ea3871187bc64dde778d4/tumblr_p2ckoi5Efq1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/449b1efe517e...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crop-haired bouncer enjoying her plight.

One of the only real differences was some of the clothes choices and the two guitars and amp sitting in the corner. You looked in your mirror. You didn't look a whole lot different, in fact one of the only differences was longer hair and a earring. The Spirit appeared behind you as the lights dimmed. \"You will observe this life for a day before you see me again.\" And with that she vanished and you lost control of yourself. Your body took a shower, threw on a band shirt and some ripped jeans and went downstairs. You hugged your mom as you grabbed breakfast and headed out the door to your car, all uncontrolled of course. You got to school and people were high fiveing you a bunch. You walked up to your friend group, whom had all changed a bit too. \"Hey Cole, you ready for our big gig tonight?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it dude. It's going to be awesome, hopefully the record label guy likes us.\" your body told your friends and now band mates. Through out the rest of the day, your body tapped its feet, sang and banged on desks. Not that anyone cared, people must have liked your band. At the end of the day, a girl ran towards you and hugged you tightly. Was this Amanda? you thought to yourself. It was, in this dimension she was a slightly emo chick, and still your girlfriend. \"Hey Babe, good luck tonight! I'll be in the front row!\" she said, kissed you and then caught up with her friends. You then drove off with your friends, grabbed your gear and headed to a local theater. It was time to warm up and sound test. After all the electronics were plugged in everyone stepped into their places to test. Your body walked center stage with the guitar, right to the mic in front. Not only did you play the guitar but you were lead singer to the band also. Your body turned back to your band mates, you saw the banner and your band name was....</span></div></div>",

You reached out and touched it, the other items vanished and the spirit waved her hand over you. You were enveloped in a bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you could see again, you found yourself in a very large bed. You sat up, it was a four post, king sized bed. The bedroom was also very large, on the opposing wall was a large stone fireplace with a 50 inch flat screen mounted on it. The floor was wood with a large fur-like area rug. To your right was a sliding glass door, leading to a large deck. To your left was two sets of doors. One set of doors lead to a hallway, the other lead to a large bathroom. You removed the covers and stood up, the rug felt soft on your feet. A silk nightie fell down to your ankles. It surprised you. An even bigger surprise was the weight on your chest.. You looked down, a large pair of breasts showed cleavage through the white silk nightie. Long, straight blonde hair fell down over your face, you whipped it away behind your ears. You walked towards the glass door, noticing your breasts bounce with each step. You looked out to see a vast pine forest. On the deck was a table, and on the other side was a hot tub. You shivered, and walked towards the bathroom, a very soft elegant robe hung on the door. You put it on because you were cold. You walked into the bathroom, there was a large shower and bathtub. To your left was an immense walk in closet. Filled with a large amount of clothes, all assorted by season, color and type of clothing. It suddenly got very dark, a glow came from behind you. The spirit had appeared, \"Before I let you observe this life, there is one choice left to make as this life has three versions.\" she whispered and three more objects appeared. A diamond ring, a fur coat, and a pair of silk panties. You assumed that if you picked the diamond ring you would be married, but the other two were a mystery. Which did you choose?</span></div></div>",

Thats when you remembered the spirit said observe, not live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood at the window, admiring the pine forest when a pair of arms came from behind you and gave you a hug from behind. \"Morning hun.\" the voice said.

You felt a giggle come from you. \"I gotta go to work honey.\" he said kissing you one last time.<br>\r\n\"Okay, see ya later.\" your body said, kissing him back. You followed him outside and watched as he drove away. Your body let out a sigh of pleasure and practically skipped back into the large house. Your body kept skipping down the hall into the bedroom, you could feel the boobs bounce every step. You went into the large closet to a vanity. You sat down, tucking your nightie and robe underneath you.  Your body sat down, and opened a draw, pulling out a notebook. The front page said: Colette's Diary. That must be this version of you, Colette. Your body began to write:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is our 3rd anniversary and Jack is taking me to that 5 star place downtown!!! Won't Amanda be jealous! Today, I gotta get ready, get my hair done and find a new dress. Time to go shopping with my bestie!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all you wrote,  you grabbed a pink phone and found a contact. It was Amanda, was it the same though? Your body texted her if she was ready to go shopping with you. Then your body stood up, noticing yourself in the mirror. You were a trophy wife! Amazing blonde hair, bright blue eyes and a perfect figure! Your body did a couple poses you would never be caught dead doing, you felt so odd doing them, even though you couldn't control it. Your body walked into the bathroom and turned the shower on, you hung up the robe and dropped the nightie revealing a white bra and thong. </span></div></div>",

You had hopped out of the shower, The bathroom was warm from the steam. Your body dried off and your hair blow dried. Then the towel was replaced by the robe worn earlier while your other self looked for an outfit. The first thing grabbed was a black lace thong and matching thong.  After they were on, you placed the robe back on and continued looking for a outfit. After you had found one, you put it on and heard something yip and scratch at your heals.

As Colleen fantasises about his taut body, long, thick cock, and tight ass. You gasp inside her head, as you recognise your Amanda's features in his face. Obviously rougher, coarser, manlier. His jaw is squarer, you recognise the sparkle in his eyes, and the colour of his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, Colleen's imagination is flattering her boyfriend, otherwise this is even more intimidating. Armando is a wall of muscles. His chest ripples, and his arms as thick as your round thighs, but much, much firmer, and make you feel some confusing thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColleen licks her lips, as you struggle with her emotions. Certainly you wanted to lick your lips, at the thought of your boyfriend, your protector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Gorgeous...\" He purred, his voice liquid sex pouring in your ears. \"Thinking about me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find Colleen pressing her thighs firmly together, as she fights her arousal.
