Also another result is that your bodies muscles are toned and you have an athletic ripped body without being bulky. <br>\r\nYou are really attractive, but you have not reall realized it. Becuase you grew up in the mountains with your master away from society, and thus you dont know what is conscidered attractive by most people, nor why all these girls have been gigling while taking glances at you.<br>\r\nAs for your personality you were raised to ( and where by nature) a really kind person that would never get into a fight for petty reasons. Only if something important was at stake, would you raise your hand, ( or your magic) against another being.<br>\r\nAnyway, your life chnaged suddenly two months ago when Saki dissappeared leaving behind a short message.<br>\r\nOne a scrap of paper she had written. \"We will meet again, when you will have joined a Guild. I'd recommend Blue Pegasus, but the choice is yours.\"<br>\r\nEven if it said so, you remembered that when you were young and Saki used to tell you stories of the Guilds, way down in the southern countries, the one that had caught your eye, or rather your ear, was another guild. Fairy Tail!<br>\r\nAnd so here you were, after two months of traveling through the coutnryside, several villages and a couple of towns, with nothing but your clothes( a dark  sleeveles shirt and black sweapants, you had discorded your coat when you left the frozen cold mountains behind) you just had  done it... You had reached Magnolia Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now do you find Fairy Tail or does something else happens first (By the way since this interactive begun before Tenrou Island arc was finished, let's say that the storyline is right before that arc and after Edoras arc, you know when Lissanna came back and all, what happens from now on is up to the writers to decide the S-trial does not have to occur or it could happen but it does not have to be like it was in the manga.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were raised by a water dragon named Aquadia. She taught you everything there was to know about water dragon slayer magic. She taught you attack magic, healing magic, and many other things too. She raised you like you were her own son. You loved her so much you hoped that you two will never be apart. Then one day Aquadia disappeared without a trace. When you found out you were devastated. You were scared that you were all alone. You tried to find her, but you had no luck. And so you went on journey to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A few years later)<br>\r\nYou walked toward a town called Magnolia Town. You got a lead that there were other people living in this town that were dragon slayers like you. You were hoping that if anyone knew what happened to Aquadia they would. Their names were Natsu Dragneel, Wendy Marvel, and Gajeel Redfox. All three of them were members of a guild in this town. On the way you came across a dark guild. You didn't know the name of it and frankly you didn't care. All you needed to know was if they knew where to find the people they mentioned. You burst into the dark guild hall ready to find the information necessary. When the people in the guild saw you burst in they they were pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark wizard: Hey! Who the hell are you?!? and what the hell do you want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I'm just a passerby. I only got one question for you guys. Where can I find Natsu Dragneel, Wendy Marvel, and Gajeel Redfox?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark wizard 2: Who the hell do you think you are?!? First you bust in unannounced and then you gave the gall do come in here and give us orders!?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark wizard 3: Yeah! Even if we knew where those people were there's no way in hell we'd tell you!! Because we'd would've killed you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you were surrounded by all the guild members, but you weren't worried. You cracked a confident smile and your hands were covered in water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Guess I'll have to kick your ass to get you to tell me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark wizard: Screw that bastard. There's at least 50 of us and there's only one of you. You'll get your ass kicked!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Then why don't you try me then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark wizard: You little bastard! Get em boys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all the boys charged at you. Then you punched you left hand to your right and showed your stuff. You first started with one of your favorite spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) WATER DRAGON IRON FIST!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made sent 10 of the dark wizard flying, but that didn't stop the wizards. They kept on attacking. Next you used your second favorite spell. Water enveloped your hands and turned into swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) WATER DRAGON WATER BLADES!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sliced more than half the guild members with this attack. Now the guild members were getting worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark wizard: What the hell?!? This guy is crazy strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Wizard: He obliterated half our numbers in two attacks!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Now then tell me..... Where can I find Natsu, Wendy and Gajeel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the dark wizards were more than willing to answer. They trembled in fear of your power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark wizard: Look buddy we don't know OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What a shame. I'm out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to leave, but then all the guild members fired a lot of spells at you. There was a loud boom and a big could of smoke from where you were standing. Unfortunately for the bad guys when the smoke cleared you were still standing, but your arm was bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) OK you cowardly bitches, I was gonna let you off the hook, but now I'm really pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuffed your cheeks and focused your power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Wizard: Please have mercy!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you wasn't listening. You released a giant blast of water from your mouth, unleashing your best attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) WATER DRAGON ROOOAAAAARRR!!!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in one blast you defeated every single dark wizard in the guild. You brushed off the dust on you body and looked around. There were beaten up wizards left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Man. I guess they didn't know anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt a sharp pain on your right am. You held onto your arm in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Damn. I guess they did more damage than I thought. I better heal myself using my magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could start using your magic you heard someone yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice) Hey you! Are you responsible for this?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and see......</span></div></div>",

You're Natsu Dragneel?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Yup that's me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Well you're certainly not what I was expecting. At least I found one of the people I'm looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Huh? You're looking for me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: One of the people you're looking for? Why are you searching for Natsu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I take it you're Wendy Marvell? If you are you're definitely not what I was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: First off I'm not Wendy. I'm Lucy! Second of all why are you looking for Natsu and Wendy? And what do you mean I'm wasn't what you expected?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Ha ha. He thinks you're a crazy girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Shut it cat! Anyway answer us. Why are you searching for Natsu and Wendy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) That is none of your business Lucy or whatever your name is. All I can say is it has to do with the fact that they're dragon slayers. Although I am disappointed. I finally found one of the people I'm looking for and he turns out to be completely stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: He's looking for dragon slayers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: But why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Hey! Who are you calling stupid!?!? If you won't tell us why you're looking for dragon slayers I'll just beat it out of you!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands with burned with fire and he was ready to brawl. You took a defensive stance and your hands enveloped with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Fine with me. This dark guild was to easy to beat up. Hopefully you'll be more of a challenge. Tell you what Natsu. If you can beat me I'll tell you why I'm searching for dragon slayers. Sound good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: OK!! Bring it on! I'm all fired up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand then......</span></div></div>",

Lucy and Happy hid behind a bar to avoid being hit. Then Natsu punched his fists together and called for one of his favorite attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Try this on for size! FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came at Natsu with a fist attack of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) WATER DRAGON IRON FIST!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour and Natsu's fist attacks collided with a great force that sent a massive shockwave which caused the whole building to shake. Broken glass flew everywhere and the beams creaked and groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Oh man! He's strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: No way! He's a dragon slayer just like Natsu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: So you're a dragon slayer like me huh? Interesting! You've made this fight a little interesting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I could say the same about you, but I didn't come all this way just to chit chat. Let's go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Natsu a big punch in the face and he punched you in the chin with an uppercut. You both traded blows back and forth and neither of you backed down. Every punch and every kick made the whole building shake. All Happy and Lucy could do was sit and watch as you and Natsu fought with all your strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: I don't believe it! This is incredible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Not only is he a dragon slayer like Natsu, but he's just as strong as he is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Strong as me yeah right!

Then your feet were enveloped with water and counter attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) WATER DRAGON TALON!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attack canceled out Natsu's and hit Natsu square in the chin sending his flying straight into a wall with a defining boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Oh no Natsu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNATSU: FIRE DRAGON FLAME ELBOW!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu jumped out from the wall and with great force it you with an attack of his own. His right arm was shooting out like a rocket and sent you flying this time. You smashed straight into the kitchen with caused it to burst into flames, but you stepped out unharmed. You and Natsu were breathing hard and running low on magic energy. You two were battered weary, but definitely unbeaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Hey you. You're pretty good. It's been a while since I've had a good fight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) You're not so bad yourself. I'd expect nothing less of a dragon slayer, but now I think it's time we end this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: You don't need to tell me twice! I'll finish this right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the flames behind began to swirl around and went straight towards Natsu. Then Natsu began eating the flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) what the hell?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Natsu sucked up all the flames. He was completely healed and good as new,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Heh! Now I got a fire in my belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Tch! In that case...!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a sink and broke it water came flying everywhere. You sucked up as such water as you needed. You drank and you drank until you were good as new as Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: What the....!!! He IS just a dragon slayer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Heh Now I got a torrent in my belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Hey! That's supposed to be my line!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Who cares dammit!! I'm ending this now!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuffed up your cheeks and gathered all the water in your mouth. Natsu gathered all the fire in his mouth and got ready to fire. Lucy and Happy on the other hand were freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Natsu wait a minute!!!! If you and that guy's attacks collide.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: The shock wave from the attack will blow the whole place up!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: FIRE DRAGON........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) WATER DRAGON.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and Natsu unleashed your most powerful attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) and Natsu: ROOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen both of your attacks collided, when force was so devastating, the blast made the building exploded. Lucy and Happy went flying out. Luckily Happy caught Lucy and used his aero magic to catch Lucy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Thanks Happy. Good thing you know aero magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Where's Natsu?

At first you were a little nervous, but then you warmed up and greeted everyone. Then suddenly a giant iron spear flew out of nowhere and knocked Natsu straight at the head.

It was Gajeel Redfox one of the dragon slayers you're looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Hey! Gajeel! What the heel was that for!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel: For keeping me waiting Salamander!

It's pretty normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and you see a girl behind you which made you stop dead in your tracks.

I'm a water dragon slayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you said \"water dragon slayer\" the entire guild gasped and looked at you with shock. There was a long and awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What? Did I say something wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the entire guild erupted with an even louder cheer making you jump with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: No way! He's a water dragon slayer?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacao: That's so freakin' cool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWakaba: Now we have four dragon slayers now! How cool is that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElfman: Hell yeah! The other guilds better watch out, because now were ten times more manly now that we have four dragon slayers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: In any case, welcome to the guild. We're glad to have you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: OK everyone! Enough with the introductions! Let's welcome our newest member the only that Fairy Tail can! Eat, drink and be merry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that everyone began to party like there was no tomorrow. At first you thought you shouldn't be so happy because you were on a mission from the start, but then decided to have fun and partied the night away.</span></div></div>",

Maybe I can find one that'll give me some info on Aquadia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lucy, Natsu, and Happy came up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Yo (name)! Checkin out the job requests?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yeah. I'm trying to find one that's simple yet challenging for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: why would you want one that's challenging? Just go for the easy stuff. That way you won't end up destroying things and take and won't be risking your neck. Unlike this pink haired daredevil over here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Hehehe. It's more fun that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Natsu. Is fighting all you ever think about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mira walked up to you.

A man could get lost or die alone in a blizzard like this. Thankfully (and unfortunately) you weren't alone.  Natsu, Gray, Erza, Lucy and Wendy (and yes Happy too) were all with you. They were all helping you search for the herbs the job requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Okay. I know Makarov wanted to have someone come with me, but how the frick did you all end up coming with me anyway?!?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorologium (Wendy): Well to put it simply, Natsu was requesting to go with you and then Gray showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorologium (Lucy): Then Natsu and Gray started fighting again and Erza came in and tried to stop the fight. Then the fighting got so intense that we all ended up going with you. The girls explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Thanks for the play by play. So Lucy why are you and Wendy hiding inside a talking cuckoo clock anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorologium (Lucy): He's not a cuckoo clock! He's one of my celestial spirits! And his name is Horologium! The girl exclaims with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Well excuse me! Says the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Come on man. It's no big deal. You should be glad.

I mean you could get eaten alive out here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yeah. Yeah. And would you put on some clothes already?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Don't worry. The storms letting up so the search should be much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yeah. Hopefully we'll be able to find the herb we're looking for. I think the flyer said that it's supposed to increase your magic power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: It does. It shouldn't be that hard to find so keep an eye out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Hey herb! Come out and fight me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Would you shut up Natsu?!? How do you expect a plant to talk let alone fight back? Then again if it could I hope it kicks your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: What'd you say frosty?!? You got something to say? Then say it to my face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Then when you get a stupid idea to talk to a plant keep to yourself pyro!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Would you two shut up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu and Gray: Aye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Well I guess that explains why Erza came along.

Right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorologium (Lucy): Geez. He's doing stupid stuff like this. The girl says exasperatingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Lucy how long are you gonna stay in that cuckoo clock?

The girl says gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Sorry, but Lucy you and Wendy can't stay in there forever you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorologium (Lucy): Well excuse me for not wanting to freeze to death. I'll stay in here as long as I want. The girl says stubbornly.

His sense of smell is keen as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey Wendy. You're a dragon slayer too right? Shouldn't you be able to track things by scent?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Well yes, but Natsu's nose is way stronger than mine. My nose isn't as keen as he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: OK!

I'm impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were right about one thing. The wyvern was mad and it was very territorial. Especially with the herbs you and the others were trying to gather and it no intention of sharing. Then Gray stepped up and put his fist into the palm of his hand and prepared to use his ice make magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Looks like we'll not only finish the job,but we'll get an added bonus too.

Natsu went first on the attack. He gathered all of his flames in both of his hands and put them together in a giant ball of flame and launched it at the wyvern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: FIRE DRAGON BRILLIANT FLAME!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attack was right on the mark, but the wyvern deflected it with ease. To make matters worse it was heading straight for Wendy, Lucy and Happy. They barely managed to escape just before the blast hit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Eeek!! Look out!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Why do these things always happen to us?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the battle continued. Gray this time went on the attack. He created a giant spinning ice disk, which was like a giant buzzsaw and then he launched it at the wyvern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: ICE MAKE SAUCER!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wyvern was able to deflect this time too. And once again the attack deflected straight at Lucy and her squad. The attack barely missed Lucy by a hair. If she had gotten hit by the attack she would have been sliced in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Waaaaahhhhh!! Hey! COuld you hit the wyvern and not me?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sadly her voice could not be heard. Erza had now leaped into the fray. Her launched a powerful lightning attack using her staff. The wyvern quickly flew up and dodged it with ease. Unfortunately for Natsu and Gray, they got hit with the attack instead. They ended up getting barbecued and well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Idiots! Don't you know how to dodge?!? You both should've been able to dodge that attack with ease!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: (cough) We can. It's just....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: The attack was too fast. (cough)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the wyvern turned to attack Erza. Erza was able to save herself by blocking the attack, but even you could see that the wyvern was beginning to overwhelm her. You had to do something to help her. Besides you couldn't just stand there and let Natsu and the others have all the fun. It was time for you to step in and get into the brawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey Erza! Save some for me! It's time I show you what a water dragon slayer can really do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou charged your energy and water enveloped your fists and you unleashed a giant shockwave with both of your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) WATER DRAGON WING ATTACK!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attack hit the wyvern square in the face. The attack made the wyvern step back in recoil and it got even madder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Nice work (name). Pretty impressive power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thanks. You haven't seen nothing yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Gray appeared from nowhere and froze the wyvern's foot making the beast incapable of moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Hey guys! Now your chance to attack! Do it now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Consider it done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Let's go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all three of you went into battle with all three of you attacking the wyvern simultaneously. Meanwhile Lucy, Wendy, and Happy were gathering as many herbs as they could find. They managed to grab a full basket full. Suddenly there was a rumbling noise it grew louder and louder until just when you all defeated the wyvern, Lucy and Wendy screamed something that made you jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: AVALANCHE!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all turned to where they all screamed and sure enough there was a giant avalanche coming straight toward all of you.

You can use healing magic just like me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Wow! It's like your twinsies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Natsu. You are to refrain from speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: I take it your dragon taught you how to use that magic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yeah. When I was little Aquadia taught me everything about water dragon slayer magic. Even healing magic. I can even use water to heal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Wow! That's so cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everyone began to gather around the stage for some reason. You look and you see.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway after that you went back to the apartment where Lucy lived. She had set you up for a place to live after you had joined the guild. Like her you had to pay seven thousand jewel per month, but it was worth it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Mira?!? What the heck is she doing up there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIra: Oh hey guys! Glad you made it back safely. How did your first job go (name)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well, it was okay. More or less. More importantly what's with the stage and what are you doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Since we have a stage, we like to sing or show off our talent sometimes. It's a lot of fun. Although I've never been up there since the Ms. Fairy Tail contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Really? You guys sure know how to have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: We sure do. So, in honor of (name) recently joining the guild and for completing his first job, I want to dedicate this song to him and to the strongest team in Fairy Tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone cheered and Mira sang this song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSong for the Road by Mirajane<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walk past....your room,<br>\r\nmy shadow falls through your door.<br>\r\nOne more day you're not here,<br>\r\nWhen will my time...pass by?<br>\r\nGazing up at the stars above,<br>\r\nI pray that they guide...your way.<br>\r\nJust look up and follow the starlight that follows each moon...<br>\r\nSo when you're voice begins to fill with tears<br>\r\nLook up and when<br>\r\nThe light begins to shine from above,<br>\r\nI'll be waiting here...under the starry sky,<br>\r\nTo light  your pathway just count on the stars<br>\r\nFollow them to your door..<br>\r\n...Follow them home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the song, you were completely absorbed into Mira's voice. You felt that you fell even deeper in love than you were before. It touched a deep feeling in your heart. It was a song that moved you so much that you almost started crying. You felt a tear on your right eye, but you quickly wiped it away. When Mira was done singing everyone cheered for her incredible performance, especially you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow. She's amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Yup. Mira is one of most beautiful girls in the entire guild. She's also our guild's poster girl in Sorcerer Weekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Whoa. I didn't know she was that popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the lights went off again, which meant that another performance was gonna go down. This time, it was Gajeel. Instead of his usual attire, he was wearing a white tuxedo with a red bow tie. Unfortunately, his singing talent was less than stellar. When he started singing everyone started throwing food at him to try to get him off the stage. When you saw him, you were pretty shocked and surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Is that Gajeel?!? And why the hell is he dressed like that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: That's......Gajeel's alter ego when he gets on the stage. Mr. Shoobidobop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Seriously?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: Unfortunately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu (covering ears): Man! No matter how many times I hear it, It's still the worst song I've ever heard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the guitar Gajeel had went flying and hit Natsu square in the face. And that was straw that broke the camel's back. Natsu and Gajeel went at it like two charging bulls. The fighting got so intense the fight headed straight toward you. You quickly jumped out of the way, before you ended up getting into the crossfire. Then a beer mug hit Natsu square on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: HEY! Which one of you punks threw that huh?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Natsu! Knock it off already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon one by one, every single male was locked into a slug fest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey! Shouldn't we stop them or something?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: This is nothing new. Just let them have at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) But Erza.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could protest a chair came flying and bonked Erza on the head. She simply ignored it. Then another flying from out of nowhere it her on the head again. This time it was a barrel. Again she ignored it. Then a chair hit her and that's when Erza got a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Would you stop all of you stop fighting!?! I thought the master taught you all......GAH!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Erza could finish her sentence, a table came flying and hit her square in the face. Now, Erza was mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Very well then. I GUESS I\"LL HAVE TO TEACH YOU AGAIN!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Erza jumped into the fray. All you could do was stand there and watch the scene before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Oh man. What a bunch of psychos. Can't we all just get along?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly your words would fall on deaf ears as the fighting continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.....</span></div></div>",

You were getting used to all the jobs that Fairy Tail did, and you got paid really well, but soon you were getting bored of doing the little stuff. So you decided to take a break and just sit around thinking about what you should do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm pretty much used to everything in the guild, but I was hoping when I joined I would find some information about Aquadia. Not even Natsu and the other dragon slayers know what happened to their dragons. I just wish I knew where I could find Aquadia. Aquadia.......where are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a young woman sat next to you chugging a bottle of beer. She was Cana Alberona. She is well known throughout the guild as Fairy Tail's heaviest drinker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh hey Cana. What's up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: (groans) I need a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): A man? What do you mean by that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Well I need a boyfriend. I mean I've been single for quite a while and I'm starting to get the urge if you know what I mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you didn't understand what Cana meant, but after a moment you caught on and you face flushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Huh? Why did that make you blush (name)?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) looks away: No I'm not! I'm not blushing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Haha. Oh come on water boy. You've had a girlfriend before right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Of course I have! Like....uh....two! Yeah that's it two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Two? Yeah right. You're so lying. Haven't you ever been on a date with a girl before? Heck have you ever even wanted to date a girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well, to be perfectly honest I've never even considered dating a girl before. I've never really thought about dating, because of my search for Aqaudia. Besides, I don't think any girl would want to date a dragon slayer like me. It's....not meant to be I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Cana shouted so that everyone in the guild could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Hey everybody! Listen to this! Our newest guy in the guild has just told me that he's never had a girlfriend before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Cana!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacao: Oh come on Cana, cut the kid some slack would ya? Although he's is young, so it's normal for a guy like him to be single.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWakaba: Speaking of which. Hey Mira, how would you like to go on a date with me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Now hold on Wakaba...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could protest about Wakaba asking out your crush, Mira used a transformation spell. Her face was now chubby and her hair was brown and was in an afro. When you saw this transformation, you and Wakaba nearly fell off the edge of your seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the heck!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Sorry Wakaba, but there's one problem. You already have a wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWakaba: Hey! Stop that! You know that creeps me out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed. You breathed a sigh of relief, happy that Mira turned Wakaba down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Hey (name). What's up? You look like your jealous or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No I'm not! I just don't want Wakaba flirting with girls that are twenty years younger than him that's all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Uh huh. Anyway, listen you don't need to worry about being single anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) And why is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Cana held up a fortune telling card that had an arrow with a heart at it's point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Because the cards have spoken to me and they're saying that you'll have a fateful encounter today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Huh? Me? Seriously?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: No way. It's gotta be a prank. But then again, Cana's predictions are usually spot on considering that she's a master of card magic. I wonder if she prediction will come true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then someone ran by you that interrupted your thoughts. It was.....</span></div></div>",

She was wearing a sexy red dress and her hair was in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Lucy! What's with the getup?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Sorry! Gotta get ready! Oh man! My hair is a mess! I know! Maybe I can get Cancer to help me out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Lucy ran off, leaving you completely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the....? What's with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you saw Erza. She was in a tizzy just like Lucy. Only she was wearing a purple dress and had her hair tied in a bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Erza! You too? What are you...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: No time to talk! I have to hurry and get my makeup on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she ran off too. At this point you were confused as to why even Erza was acting so strange. And it wasn't just her, everyone in the guild was getting ready for something. Even Gajeel dressed up as Mr. Shoobidobop was rehearsing for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the heck is going on here? Everyone is acting even more stranger than usual. I wonder why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Makarov came up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: (name). How are you today my boy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm fine sir, but what the heck is going on here? Everyone in the guild acting stranger than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: You didn't know? Well, you're new to the guild so that's to be expected. Anyway a reporter from Sorcerer Weekly magazine is coming by later to do an interview with us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No way! That's like the most popular magazine around! (At least as far as I know.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those who don't know, Sorcerer Weekly is a magazine that details all about guilds and their functions. It's published every Wednesday. They introduce new hot magic items and popular conferences, as well as publish photos of popular Mages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: That's right. So get ready and be sure to make a good impression OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Makarov left. You were left alone in your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Oh man. So that's why everyone's freaking out. Well I'll just leave them alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remembered what Cana said about your fateful encounter. When you thought about that you began to think about Mira and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wait a second! Maybe my fateful encounter has to do with Mira! It could happen! She could be my fateful encounter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou imagined Mira falling in love with you and you getting married to her. This made you blush so much that steam began coming out of your head. Natsu, Gray and Happy were watching from afar and saw you fantasizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Well guys, it's official. (name)'s lost his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Nah. He's probably just hungry or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Come on Natsu. He's obviously is nervous because of the reporter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I gotta get ready! I don't know what I should say when that happens! I know! I'll go to the book store and look up some books! I'd better get going! I'm wasting time standing around!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you raced off to the book store. Later at the book store you picked a couple books about relationships. You had already picked two books to take and were just about to take your third. Then you came across a book with big letters that said; \"Fateful Encounter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the....? No way. Give me a break. Don't tell me this what Cana meant. I'm just gonna reach for the book and the love of my life will reach for the same one right? That is how it works. Nah. There's no way that could happen. Well might as well take the book and check out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just reached for the book and just grabbed it when another hand grabbed the same book you were holding.

You look and you a rather unexpected surprise. The girl that just so happened to be grabbing the book that you were grabbing was Wendy. When you saw her your heart nearly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) W-w-w-w-wendy?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Oh (name). What brings you here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): N-nothing! Nothing at all! Anyway, here. Take it. You had your eye on this book first right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Well yeah, but I didn't think you'd be into that sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the cover and you nearly face faulted for what you saw. The cover was indeed called \"Fateful Encounter,\" but the cover had a couple that was kissing and filled with lovey dovey stuff. When you saw it you remembered what Cana said and then you thought about how you met Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Wait a sec! No. No it can't be! There's no way! Wendy's my fateful encounter?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly gave back the book to Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Dah!!! No I insist! Please enjoy! I gotta go! Bye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Hey wait!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Wendy could stop you, you raced out of bookstore to try to escape from Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That was way to close. I can't believe it! I don't want to believe it! Wendy's my fateful encounter that Cana was talking about?!? No way! Absolutely not! I can't just fall in love with a kid! I gotta get out of here fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't stop running until you got back to the guild. It was then that you realized that you forgot to read up on your research. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Aww crap! I came back to the guild hall when I was supposed to be looking up research on relationships. Oh man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: (name). There you are. I was looking for you. Natsu's been telling me that you've been acting strangely. Is everything all right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, before you had a chance to speak, a young man with a camera burst through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason: Yes! It's Titania! This is so cool! SO FREAKIN COOL!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the..... Who the heck is this guy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: (name). This is Jason. Sorcerer's Weekly's reporter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Seriously?!? This guy is the reporter?!? He's more of a fanboy than a reporter to me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jason went around interviewing all the guild members. Erza, Gray, Juvia, and even Happy all had interviews. All of them were happy to give him an interview, although there was one wizard in particular who wasn't willing to give him an interview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: AHA!!!! So you're here again eh?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason: YES!!!! Natsu the Salamander!!! I've always loved interviewing you!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Well I don't jerk! All you ever do is write bad stuff about me! Like how I blew up this and demolish that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason: So freakin cool!!! Can I shake you hand? Please sir?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Would you shut up!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Natsu decked him square in the face. Jason was sent flying to the floor, but he didn't seem to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason: Wow! What a scoop! Natsu is awesome showing me his secret hand shake! He's so cool!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Either this guy's completely insane of just plain oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realized something. There was someone who was missing. A certain blond haired wizard was no where to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Now that think about it. Where's Lucy? I haven't seen her since this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the lights dimmed and the spotlight flashed on the stage and there was Lucy. She was wearing and sexy bunny girl outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) What the hell?!? Lucy?!? What the heck is she doing dressed like that?!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Oh brother. There she goes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: She's always does this. She's just trying to get the reporter to interview her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Seriously?!? I understand she wants to get the reporter's attention, but there are other ways of doing it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Hey there everyone! I'd like to sing a little number for you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lucy could finish Gajeel came in and knocked her out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel: Outta the way blondie! I got this one! Shoobidoba!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray and Happy: Gajeel!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Oh no! Not this again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason: Oh yeah!! It's Black Steel Gajeel! SO COOL!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel: Doin the right thing ain't always that smart. but lucky for you, you just ain't that smart. You dig me man? That means you always do right. Now listen close to me brother, cause it's coming from the soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason: SO COOL!! I can totally dig it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Would you shut up already?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Natsu came flying from out of nowhere and decked Gajeel in the face sending him flying and crashing into the ground. Now Gajeel was p.o'd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: I was already mad enough now this jerk! But now your song just sent me over the edge!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Gajeel punched Natsu back with his iron dragon fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel: I've got a song in my heart and you can't stop it from getting out Salamander!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Oh yeah?!? Bring it on Iron Boy!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, (and for the umpteenth time) Gajeel and Natsu started duking it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Hey you guys stop it! The press is still here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason: Wow! This is so cool!! Two dragon slayers are slugging it out right before my eyes! No matter how many times I watch it, it always so cool!!! This will make an awesome photo spread! SO COOL!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um yeah. Something's telling me he doesn't care either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took photo after, after photo of the fight. He was loving every minute of this fight. Then you saw that he was getting dangerously close to the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Jason! Be careful! If you get to close you're gonna....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late. Just when Natsu and Gajeel's punches were about to collide, Jason found himself in the middle. And he was sandwiched between their punches hard. And what was really shocking to you was still alive and that he was still in his own little world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason: So cool.....they're the strongest....and the best.....dragon slayers ever.......So cool.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater after everything had settled down, you decided to get some air and to get away from all the violence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man. It's a good thing I got away from all the craziness. I understand that it's always like this, but they could try to show a little restraint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Cana's words about your prediction and your encounter of Wendy flashed in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Come on. I gotta stop thinking about that. Besides there is no way it's Wendy! I mean she's cute and all, but she's way to young for me. And if anyone else were to find out about this, I'd die of embarrassment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(voice) Find out about what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped in surprise to the voice.

Wendy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: What's wrong? You don't seem happy to see me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No! It's not like that! Anyway what brings the you this way? I thought you were back at the guild being interviewed and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Wendy began to fidget and blush. And in turn you began to blush too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Um......(name)...can you....um.....could you......could you meet me tonight? By the Sola tree in the park? There's something I need to tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Wendy's request pass through your brain, you felt something inside you scream. You remembered Cana's words and when you and Wendy touched hands in the bookstore. Your heart began to beat like a jackhammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Um.....Sure I can, but....is there any particular reason why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: All I can tell you.....is that it's important. See you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything else to her Wendy ran off. You were left alone with a million thoughts rushing through your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No way. You've got to be kidding me! Wendy turning out to be more and more like what Cana!  No way! No way! I got to calm down and think! There's no way Wendy could be my fateful encounter! I need help! I don't know what to do! OK. I need to calm down. I know since things have died down in the guild maybe I can go and find a job. That's it. I'll just go on a small job and get it out of my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went back to the guild and went to the request board to look for a job to take to get your mind off of Wendy. But then as you were looking at the flyers on the board you heard some of the girls talking. Cana, Levy, Lucy, and Laki were talking about the very thing you were trying to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this, but I heard something about Wendy! Apparently I think she's got a crush on some guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: As in out Wendy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaki: Oh come on Levy. You got to be joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Yeah. She's the last person to ever imagine getting a girlfriend. She's way too young for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Oh come on Lucy you never know. It could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Do you even realize what you're saying Cana? Anyway are you sure about this Levy? Maybe you misheard or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: I know what I heard guys. Besides she's been saying stuff like \"I gotta see him\" or \"I wanna see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Him who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: Beats me. I'd love to meet the guy though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the whole conversation your heart began to beat like a jackhammer. And as you were walking away, you were walking like an automated robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: What am I gonna do?!?! I'm the \"him.\"!!! I mean it's not like I hate her or nothing. I just don't see her like that. We're not compatible. Then again I've never had a girlfriend before so how can I be sure of anything regarding that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Wendy flashed in your mind. You imagined her looking more womanly and cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey! Let's not imagine her looking pretty like that OK?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you imagined you and Wendy arm in arm looking like a real couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Why are all these thoughts running through my head?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs steam gushed out from your head from thinking all about Wendy and your fateful encounter prediction from Cana, you tried to think about what you should do.

Then you decided to go home and figure out what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I need to go home. I need to take it easy and relax a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you went to the boys side of the dormitories of Fairy Tail where you currently lived. It was a modest little place, but just right for someone who was just starting out with the guild life. Anyway when you got to your room you took a shower to help you think about your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh man. What am I gonna do? This is way too much pressure for a guy for me to take. Its obvious that Wendy is definitely gonna confess her love for me! Why else would she be blushing like that? What should I do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about how Wendy was acting when she asked you to meet her. Then you remembered what Cana said about your fateful encounter. After doing some thinking you decided to politely turn her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I know this is probably going to make things awkward, but I have to turn her down. I'm sorry Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your mind, you were going to turn her down, but then your heart had other ideas. You went to your closet and remembered an outfit that you kept that made you look awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): All right! Wendy will drop dead when she sees me in my outfit. Wait a minute! What am I doing?!? I'm not supposed to be dressing up for her!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen once again you instinctively began to dress yourself up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. Don't be dumb. What should I do? What am I supposed to do now? Hey I know! I'll do my hair! If I comb it and give it a little gel, Wendy will think I'm the hunkiest guy alive! Oh yeah! Wait!!! Why am I getting dolled up for her!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end you ended up doing your hair yourself. Then your mind began to get wild ideas. You imagined you and Wendy by the Sola Tree. Wendy was looking pretty and womanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey Wendy? I'm sorry I'm late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: No it's fine. I'm glad you could make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So.....you wanted to talk to me about something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Yes. There's something.......that I needed to tell you. Look. (name). I love you. I love you with all my heart!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Are you serious Wendy?!? Are you sure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Yes. I mean it. I love you with every fiber of my being!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm touched. I......I love you too Wendy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Really? You mean it?!? You'll accept me? I know I'm not as busty as the other girls, but I'm hoping you'll accept me for who I am. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took Wendy's hands into yours and you two looked lovingly into each others eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Yes. I love you Wendy. With all my heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: I'm so happy! Let's have a baby or two my dear sweet (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes my darling Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you snapped out of your daydream and slapped yourself on the cheeks. You were blushing so hard that you were like a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) How the hell did I dream that up!?!?!? Am I some freakin pervert?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you looked at the clock. It was almost time to meet Wendy. You went on your way to meet her. Your heart was beating like a jackhammer and you didn't know what to say or do. On the way you walked along the river on your way to the Sola Tree. You looked at yourself in the river and admired your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: There's no denying it. I'm looking good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But wait! It's not like I'm going to accept her feelings!!! I mean I like Mira and stuff!!! So why does it matter how I look?!? Besides I can't just go crushing on a girl just because of a prediction that Cana made!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: But then again, maybe going out with Wendy is the way to go. Maybe we'll end up being together forever.......Wait!!! No!! Stop thinking like that!!! Wendy is a friend!!! I've got to stop thinking about her that way!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was in so much in disarray that steam began spouting from your head again and your face flushed deep crimson. Then you slapped yourself to calm yourself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) OK. I need to chill. I have to just let her know that I see her as a friend. Nothing more, Nothing less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater you arrived at the Sola Tree. You could see Wendy standing by the tree waiting for you. When you saw her your heart began to beat more and more. You got more and more nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. Calm down. Don't be nervous. Just stay cool. Just tell her straight out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you took a breath and went toward Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: (name). You made it. Glad you could make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Y-y-yeah. Did you wait long?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: No. I just got here actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So.......uh......what was so important that you needed to call me out here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Oh yes. Well.......there's something.....I need to speak with you about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Thinking: Oh crap! Here it comes! She's finally gonna say it! She's gonna declare her love for me and we'll both live happily ever after! Oh man. I'm such a pushover when it comes to this stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Aloud: O......K....... What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart began to thump in anticipation and with worry. You felt like your heart was gonna leap out of your chest.

Why are you giving me this book?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Well......I like to read and stuff. And I wanted to read this book. But then I saw you had your eye on it and you graciously gave to me the other day. So I asked the bookkeeper if he had another copy. I figured you'd want it after you gave it to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard Wendy's reason for giving you the book, you felt that your heart just stopped and your eye began to twitch. Not to mention you felt like the whole world came crashing down upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wait a minute. Didn't you have something important to tell me? I mean....I heard the girls saying that you wanted to see me because apparently you had a crush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Oh no. I think you misunderstood. The only reason I wanted to see you was because wanted to give you that book. I never had a crush on anyone. I only just wanted to see you to give you that book and apologize about the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I......I see.....so that's why......you just.......hahahahaha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Um.....(name)?

You usually took the little jobs around town like waitressing for a restaurant, or finding a lost job. Those were good paying jobs in all, but you felt it was time for you to take a bigger and high paying job. Not only to gain experience, but hopefully to find some information on Aquadia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hmm. I wonder which job should I choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Oh hey (name). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) blushing slighty: Oh hey Mira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIra: Find a job that captures your interest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Not yet. There's so many jobs on here, it's hard to choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Now that I think about it, this is your first major job isn't it? Take your time picking. But, I would suggest you don't go on any solo quests any time soon since your still new and all. I would recommend assisting another team on their job. There will be a pay cut, but the experience will be well worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well....it does sound a little interesting, but I don't think I have a lot of options for potential teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pointed over to Natsu and Elfman were sitting laughing and eating like barbarians to make your point. Just then Lucy and Levy came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Hey Mira Jane. Helping (name) find a good job?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Actually Lucy, I think it would be best for him to tag along on someone else's job so he can get some experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: Not a bad idea. Lulu here started in Fairy Tail by helping out Natsu right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Yes, but sadly it's lead me to more life threatening situations than any girl should have to go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: One things for sure, you got more luck and guts then me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well in that case, is there any jobs that I can help the two of you with? I'll do whatever I can to help the guild and I'll do my best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: We could use that attitude in Team Shadow Gear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Or maybe you could work with us again. Why don't you stick with us?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: That might be dangerous to his health, considering your reputation Lu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Well, why not have him work with both teams?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sure.

Why don't you tag along with us?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I suppose, but somethings bugging me about all of this. For one thing, I've never even heard of a human communicating with a dragon before.

How are we supposed to find Daphne now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Maybe we can find her if we check the rooms. The lodge is automatic, so maybe she's staying in one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. That's true, but there's a lot of rooms. Daphne could be in any one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Well, we're not gonna find her by standing around. We're gonna have to split up and knock on all of the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you went one direction, Natsu another way, Wendy another, and Happy and Carla in another way. You searched and knocked on every door you could find, but there was no sign of Daphne anywhere. Soon you came to one more door, but this one was different than the others. There were cat dolls decorating the entire door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: So far we've checked every door except this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: And this door is totally not suspicious in anyway. I mean come on is that a giant Happy doll?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I don't even know. In any case, Daphne's gotta be here, cause this is the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Hello!! Is there anyone named Daphne in there?!? If there is, open up! We need to talk to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the door opened and there was a young woman with long black hair. She was wearing a green tank top with a blue miniskirt with cowboy boots. She was munching on what appeared to be a fried salamander of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes? I'm Daphne. Can I help you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: We heard that you can help us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes, yes! Helping out is what I do! And I'll help you because you're customer! Come on in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, magic circles deployed underneath all of you and you were suddenly brought into a dark room. Suddenly a spotlight shone and Daphne was standing on a podium with holding a bunch of the snack items like the one she was munching on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: You're in for a real treat because I'm a wandering beauty master, spreading my talents as well as my tips throughout the land. And it's not those fake ones you see on TV. No, no, no. These are 100% real and 100% natural products that you slimming you down in weeks! Yes, yes, yes! And here it is! The product that will solve all of your weight problems and beauty! The one and only; Matamo chan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Say what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Beauty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes, yes! This wonderful product is scientifically proven that it fights obesity and melts the pounds away with ease! If you don't believe me try some yourself! You'll definitely love the taste and the effects it'll do for ya!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wait a sec! We're not even obese! So why would we-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Don't worry! One bite's not gonna kill ya! Take one bite and your skin will be silky smooth! Take two bites and you'll be as slim as me guaranteed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Wow! Incredible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Awesome! I wanna try some!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Wait! You're buying into this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hook, line, and sinker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: If you're mot convinced that this product's not for you, listen to real testimonials from real customers. \"This product completely changed my life and I feel awesome!\" Yes, yes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Excuse me....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: \"I've been eating this product for ten days and I really like the results! Yes, yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um excuse me....could you stop talking and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: And thanks to this product made me the most prettiest girl in Fiore! Yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) and Natsu: WOULD YOU SHUT UP AND STOP SAYING YES, YES?!?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes sirs. Would you be interested in signing up for the fitness for the obese program?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: We're not interested in your stupid letters, your obesity, and your crazy kabobs!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): The only thing that we're interested in lady is dragons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes. Everyone has a preference or two. So how many pounds does your dragon want to shed? We can make a diet plan,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu and (name): WOULD YOU STOP WITH DIET CRAP AND LISTEN TO US FOR TWO SECONDS?!?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Listen. We're dragon slayers from Fairy Tail. I've been searching for a dragon named Igneel who disappeared.  Wendy has been searching for one too. The sky dragon Grandeeney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): And I'm also looking for a dragon. A water dragon named Aqaudia. Word on the street is that you recently met one. That's the only reason we're here get it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: So if you know anything, please tell us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne was finally silent for once. Then she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes. I did say that I met a dragon. But that was a lil fib for marketing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: You lied?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: That;s too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man! I knew it! I knew it was too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: What a waste of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes. That's because my product is made of a primary ingredient, which happens to be dragon scales. Without that it's useless, but that's a lie too because they're impossible to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: So.....the whole thing is just one big hoax?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: How shameless! How can you say that with a straight face?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes. A girl's gotta make a living somehow. You understand don'tcha dragon boy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: I understand that you suck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I've had as much as I can take of this chick. Let's make like a banana and split!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Natsu head for the door and were just about to leave, but when they opened it the hallway wasn't there anymore. Instead there was a barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the heck?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: The hallway's melting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: How the whole building vanish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You're asking me?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: You're all mine now! Like birds in a cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: It's a barrier! You're a wizard aren't you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Then that means this was a setup! You planned this all along!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes, yes! and you all fell for it! Sit back and have some Matama chan! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Why would I want that thing you psycho!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeawhile Wendy opened the window to see if there would be a way out, but sadly the barrier surrounded the entire building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: Looks like this trap was skillfully crafted. We're trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: I've never met a wall I couldn't bring down before! I'll punch it down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm with you Natsu! Maybe if you hit the wall with our magic, maybe it'll come down. Though it's a long shot, it's better than doing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Sorry water boy. you guys are going nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh yeah? And who's gonna stop us? Let's go Natsu! WATER DRAGON IRON FIST!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Yeah! FIRE DRAGON IRON FIST!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of your punches were just about to connect with the barrier when.....</span></div></div>",

What the heck was that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look toward the doorway and you saw a figure standing there. Then you all heard a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: How's the floor taste Natsu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the figure stepped out from the shadows and you immediately recognized the face as well did everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: It's Gray!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Wait a second. How the heck was he able to get here in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Good question. A better question would be how he got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Screw the questions! I've got my own bone to pick with with this guy! Hey Gray! Next time, make sure your info isn't a complete piece of garbage! You pervy popsicle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: It wasn't garbage. You did just what we wanted you to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Daphne put her arm around Gray and flirtatiously stroked his chin like he was her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes, yes. So glad you could make it, my beloved Gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Hold on. Just how the heck do you two know each other? What the heck is going on?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Natsu! Would you put two and two together? Daphne and Gray are-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Those two are in love!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Would you stop saying that you stupid cat?!? I was gonna say those two are working together!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: WHAAAAAT?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: What's the meaning of this man? You're really slumming it if you're working for this chick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Shut up. Natsu, you and I both know that we've been at it for a long time now haven't we? If you didn't think this was gonna happen one day then you're even stupider than I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: What'd you say?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: You know what? I think it's time we settled this little rivalry. Once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: What are you talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Damn you're slow. Until now, I've brought myself to you level by being nice to you. Now I'm sick of following your lead From now on, I'm following my own path now. As of now I'm through with Fairy Tail and with all of you losers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: You can't be serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I wish I could say he wasn't Natsu, but I think he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes. Water boy's pretty smart. And Gray really knows how to make a statement don't he? He really knows how to warm me up. Now then, Gray fetch me a dragon slayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray obeyed by taking his stance for using ice make magic and got ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Gray! You don't wanna do this man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: If you really believe that, just stay right there. It'll that such easier to end you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: He seems mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: This has to be some kind of bad dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hate to break it to you Happy, but this is real. Natsu, let's fight this guy together. Even Gray can't take on two dragon slayers. Let's double team this guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: No way. Protect Wendy and the others and leave Gray to me. I've got score to settle with this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But Natsu come on. Can you really take on Gray by yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Sure I can.

We have seen magic like that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I don't know about that. This looks like the real Gray to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: No! Wendy's right! This Gray has to be a fake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: How do you know that? He seems identical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. Enlighten us Happy. How can you be sure that this Gray is a fake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Happy could explain, Gray had taken off everything from his upper torso off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Eep! He took his clothes off! This guy's the real Gray after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla and Happy: Are you kidding?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You idiotic cat! It took you till Gray took off his shirt to make you realize that he's the real Gray?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: If you keep dodging this is gonna get boring. Come on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: If it's a real fight you want, you know I'm always down for a brawl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Take this! ICE MAKE BATTLE AX!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: FIRE DRAGON ROAR!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth or their attacks collided leading to a tremendous explosion. Then Gray closed in on Natsu and landed a flurry of blows. Then he sent him <br>\r\nflying with a powerful upper cut. Daphne looked on quite pleased and was eating her matame-chan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes. Nothing like dinner and a good brawl. As you see, this isn't a cheap imitation. This is the real Gray. I also should remind you that I'm not controlling him or anything like that. He's simply beating your face in because he wants to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: No need to tell me that lady. I've been punched plenty of times to know that no guy can punch like Gray can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: I figured you would try testing me or something stupid like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Natsu got close to Gray and gave him a mighty headbutt and gave him another attack to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: FIRE DRAGON TALON!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force was so strong, that Gray went flying straight through the wall into a hallway. Natsu followed close behind in hot pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Come on Natsu! You got this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! Could you guys take it easy with the destruction already?!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Natsu and Gray were now standing in the hallway in a staredown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: All right man! You can at least tell what's going on! You owe us at least that much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: A city without sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard what Gray said, you felt like you heard that somewhere before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: A city without sound? Where have I heard that? For some reason, I feel like I've heard it somewhere before. But where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: You're not making any sense man. Can you speak plainly please?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: That's about as much plain as you're gonna get. Besides you're too stupid to understand anything. Get ready to take your last breath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they both went at it again. Fire and ice were flying everywhere as you, Wendy, Happy, and Carla looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Man! Those two have stepped up their game lately!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: This isn't the time to be watching!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: I don't get it. Why would Gray betray us like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Believe me Wendy. I wish I knew. I'm wondering about that myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Not that it's any business of yours, but that handsome hunk offered to help me on a secret project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Secret project?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: That's right. I came to Magnolia about ten days ago to continue my research. I was digging into Natsu's background when I ran into Gray. He <br>\r\nliked what I was doing so he offered to help me lure Salamander all the way out here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: OK you and Gray are partners, but what's this \"city without sound\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): And what does this have to do with Natsu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Now, now your questions can wait. In the meantime how about some Matama-chan with twenty differnt flavors?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: Who could possibly want to eat that junk at a time like this?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Oh yeah! Get me one of the fishy flavor kinds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough Happy had one of Daphne's Matama-chans and was now munching happily on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: Don't you have any bit of self control?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Happy's face turned red and a giant flame burst out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Got quite a kick don't it? Come on take one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Damn it all! Would you stop trying to feed us that crap?!? Come on you guys! We gotta follow those two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you, Wendy, Carla, and Happy followed in hot pursuit down the stairs. Meanwhile the battle between Natsu and Gray was still raging on.<br>\r\nEvery time one side threw the punch, the other one countered with another punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: If you're not gonna tell me what's going on, I'll just have to beat it out of you!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: In your dreams! You'll never get past my ICE MAKE SHIELD!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: FIRE DRAGON TALON!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray made a shield of ice using his magic, but Natsu was able to break through it using his, sending Gray down a flight of stairs. Natsu followed down the stairs, but then Gray froze the stairs turning them into a slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: ICE MAKE FLOOR!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu slid down the stairs and went flying straight to a wall. Then Gray pounced on Natsu using his Ice Make Hammer. Natsu countered with a fireball to destroy the mallet. Gray countered again using Ice Make Canon and fired. Natsu blew the ice away using Fire Dragon Wing Attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: At the rate this is going, this could last forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'll give you that one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: FIRE DRAGON FLAME ELBOW!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu's next attack hit Gray square in stomach and both fighters went crashing through a wall and straight into a pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Aw crap! Of all the things this room to have!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: Now Gray's got the advantage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Now I got you! ICE MAKE PRSION!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray used to water to trap Natsu inside a cage made of ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Oh come on man! That's playing dirty! Come on! Let me out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: This is good for you. You belong in a cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: I'm some kind of wild beast! Now I'm really mad! FIRE DRAGON ROAR!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu attack busted the entire cage, but then snuck behind Natsu and fired a sneak attack using Ice Make Lance sending Natsu crashing through another <br>\r\nwall. Then Gray made a scythe and prepared to strike Natsu while he was down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: I think we both knew that this was gonna happen eventually. Fire and Ice don't mix after all. Say goodbye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Damn it! If that's how you feel, I'm not holding back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu slammed his fist into the floor causing the floow beneath him and Gray to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Natsu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: They're down on the next floor! Quick after them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you all raced down the hall to give chase to Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Darn it all! We have to do something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: I know it's risky, but were gonna try to use our magic. I'll use my sky dragon magic and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: No child! I know you want to help, but using your magic in tight quarters like this is to dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: OK then! I'll fly back to town and get some reinforcements!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Happy! Wait! There's gonna be a....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish Happy opened a window and tried to fly out, but sadly there was a barrier and Happy was sent flying straight to a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Can't say I didn't warn him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes.There's no where to run so why don't you make yourself comfortable for a while. It's useless to resist. You see I use concealment magic which allows me to keep anyone and anything hidden for as long as I want. So if I want you to stay, you stay. On the plus side you won't have to worry about reinforcements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all look out the window and standing outside were Erza and Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Hey! Erza! Lucy! We're up here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): It's no use Wendy. They can't hear us up here. Thanks to this stupid chicks magic were stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: OK then! No choice, but to take her on! If we beat her, it'll have to break the spell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Happy's right. If we beat her, maybe her magic will go away, but should I really try this idea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

What are those things?!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: I don't know, but they seem to be coping their magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Those lizard guys must be working for her too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: What a smart kitty cat. They're not the only ones either! I've got an entire army of artificial playthings at my disposal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: They're not even real? They must be golems then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: That's right! I made those bad boys automatically adapt to match the attributes of their opponents. Since I was gathering info from Natsu I figured I'd get a little data from other varieties of wizards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): And just what are you planning to do with all that data huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Now that my dear boy is a good question. Be patient and the real show will begin. Why spoil the surprise when you'll be able to see it soon enough?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Natsu and Gray exploded from below them continuing their fight. They were both out of breath and almost out of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: My, my, my. Those two sure know how to play rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: I gotta admit it. Out of all the fights we've been in this one the best by far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Yeah. I could say the same to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Come on Natsu! Give him one smack on the nose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes. Everything's going according to plan. Now Gray! It's time to finish this little game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: No need to tell me that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Natsu and Gray charged at each other again. Gray attacked with Ice Make Seven Strike Dance while Natsu attacked with Fire Dragon Swordhorn. At least they both were evenly matched, but then Natsu used all of his strength and he overpowered Gray. His attack hit him square in the stomach and sent him and Gray crashing through a wall knocking Gray out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: All right! Natsu won!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: He definitely lives up to his reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You got that right. I knew Natsu was strong, but I had no idea he was this capable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Not bad dragon boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Yo Gray! You all right man? I guess maybe I over did it a little. Oh crap! What if I did more than just knock him out?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu ran over to Gray to see if she was all right, but then he felt cold feeling on his feet. Gray was pretending to be knocked out. Because Natsu was worried about him, Gray took that opportunity to freeze his feet to prevent him from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Aw dammit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Idiot. You'll never learn will you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes, yes! I'll take from here! HIDDEN DARKNESS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a dark hole appeared below Natsu fell straight into it and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Well done Gray! I knew I was right choosing you as my partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Thanks. Took at bit more work than I thought, but got the job done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No! Natsu! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Now what'll we do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: You tricked us! It was never your intention to fight him in the first place! You were luring him into a trap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Yup. He may be strong, but I at least use my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: You cheater! The only reason you beat him because you played dead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Gray grabbed Happy and hung him over the hole where Natsu fell into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: You can join him if you want furrball!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Hey! Let me go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Leave him him alone! WATER DRAGON IRON FIST!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attacked Gray to get him to let Happy go. He did, but at the same time he dodged your attack. Daphne then came between you two and stopped the fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Stop fooling around Gray! We got bigger fish to fry. It took this much effect just to capture him and get the important piece of my experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Now I get it. Trapping Natsu was your goal the whole time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes. Now my research is complete. Now it finally begins. Concealment magic off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the whole building began to shake and fall apart. Carla and Happy carried you and Wendy to safety. Then a giant dragon-like creature came out of the ground. Daphne's voice boomed throughout the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Finally it's alive! Activating lacrima core! Transmitter set! Everything is good to go! Salamander heart engaged! With the Salamander acting like the blood of this wonder specimen, my baby is unstoppable! Now my dragonoid! ACTIVATE!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dragon roared, you felt someone else screaming and that someone was Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Now I get it! She's using Natsu like a battery! She's gonna drain every magic power out of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Wendy landed safely, Erza and Lucy ran toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: We're glad you guys are OK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: We were worried about you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Lucy! Erza! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: How did you beat those lizard men?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: No time for that! Where's Natsu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): He's inside that dragon thingy! This crazy girl named Daphne set us up and Gray helped her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: And that's not all. He's not being controlled or manipulated! He's doing this of his own free will!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza and Lucy: What did you say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all you look and there on top of the dragon's head was Gray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: What is the meaning of this!?! If you've betrayed Fairy Tail! There had better be a good reason!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Sorry. I don't have a reason. If you want to stop us then be my guest. Then again considering how weak you all are, I doubt you'll be able to be around to see the dragonnoid's full power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: yes, yes, yes! After countless years of blood, sweat, and tears I've finally produced the ultimate dragonoid! If anything you could've at least congratulated me on a job well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: So you're the one who's behind all this?!? Release Natsu or else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Sorry, but I have no intention of letting him go. After all he is the battery of my dragonoid. You might as well say your goodbyes while you have the chance because he won't be around much longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What do you mean by that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Magic power is a wizard's life source. If we don't get him out of there, Natsu will be finished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Are you serious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: You messed with the wrong guild lady! Let him go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Like I said,there's no way I'm letting him go. Besides in order to operate the dragonoid, I'd have to get my hands on dragon slayer magic. So Natsu's staying right here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: And why have you made this monstrosity? Clearly not for show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: You're a smart cookie Erza. I want to create the ultimate dragonoid! Sadly, this one is a prototype so I need to do some testing. Luckily I found the perfect test subjects!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the dragon raised it's foot and stomped on you and the others, but luckily you all it just before it crushed you all. Then you all heard a honk and a car screeched out of nowhere and raced toward you. Driving it was Macao and Elfman and Wakaba were with him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Hey look!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElfman leaped from the car and punched Gray in the gut knocking him out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElfman: Sorry, but Gramps wants you back Gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Just in time Elfman. Did master send you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElfman: Yeah. Since he found out about Daphne, he sent us to take Gray to Gramps and he'll decide what to do with that thing once he's talked to Gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the dragonoid began to take flight and was flying toward the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Guys look! If we don't stop that thing, it'll get to Magnolia in no time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Listen up! You all need to get back to guild and prepare for action. We have to protect Magnolia no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Erza what about you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: I'll try to take care of the dragonoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Erza! Are you crazy?!? There's no way you can take that thing on by yourself. Not without any backup!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: I'll be fine. I can take care of myself! Now get moving! That's an order!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: OK. Let's go Wendy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of the gang left for Magnolia you.....</span></div></div>",

You followed the others back to the guild. When you all got back to Magnolia you helped evacuate all the citizens to the guild. Unfortunately the dragon was slowly approaching. It would be at Magnolia in a manner of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Look! Fake dragon dead ahead. Man it's huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDroy: I don't suppose anyone's figured out how to stop that thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet: Hey Mira. Master's got some kind of strategy right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIra: Yes, but he wants to wait till he has a chance to talk to Gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: What good is that gonna do? We don't even know if Elfman and the others still have him or not. We can't just sit here twidling our thumbs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: and can we really protect the town and stop that thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): We have to Levy. And we must. We're just gonna have to hope that Erza stops that thing and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went back to the guild and decided to wait for further instruction. Then you saw Mira. She was sitting on the table with a worried expression on her face. You decided to go ease her worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Mira. Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Oh (name). I'm fine. I'm just worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): About Elfman? He's your brother if I'm not mistaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Don't worry. I'm sure that he's OK. I mean he is your brother after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: I hope your right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Levy raced into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: Mira Jane! Elfman and the others are back, but they got roughed up pretty bad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Mira raced to Elfman, Wakaba's, and Macao's aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Hurry up! Get these guys some medical attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Elfman! Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Dude what happened to you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElfman: We were attacked by these weird lizard that copied our abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So Daphne sicked her lizard men on you guys too? In any case, Laki can you take Elfman to get fixed up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaki: Sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElfman: Hold on. I can still.....gah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Take it easy Elfman. Let us do what we can to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElfman: OK, but listen Mira. You have to save Natsu. I owe it to him after everything that he's done for me. Bring him home. For all of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIra; Don't worry. He's as good as saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Elfman fell over unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Elfman no!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) It's no good Mira. He's out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: Don't worry. I'll heal him with my sky dragon magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Thank you Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see Cana shaking Gray in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Hey you! You don't get to sleep on the job. Why don't you admire your handiwork you pathetic traitor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you try and stop Cana, Juvia stepped in and stopped Cana instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Stop it. My beloved Gray would never turn his back on Fairy Tail. What happened to hearing both sides of the story before accusing  someone? I have faith in him even if the rest of you don't!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Gray gently placed his hand on Juvia's shoulder to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: That's enough Juvia. It's alright. You're supposed to take me to see Gramps right? Unless you want to sit here and talk all night I'm ready when you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlzak: Fine start walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBisca: No funny business. Got it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched Alzak and Bisca leaving with Gray. you suddenly remembered what Gray said about the city without sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Alzak! Bisca! Wait a sec! Let me go with you guys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nALzak: Hold on. How come?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): There's something I need to confirm. And Gray is the only one that can confirm it. I can't say, but it's only something that I need to talk to with Gray alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlzak: OK then. Follow us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Alzak and Bisca led you and Gray to Makarov's quarters. Later you, Gray and Makarov were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: (name)? Why are you here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm here for the same questions you have, but the main reason is I have a question for Gray that needs to be answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: And what's that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What is the city without sound? And what does Natsu have to do with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen....</span></div></div>",

Now would be a good time to explain yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: I take full responsibility. I didn't expect this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS GONNA HAPPEN?!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard Makarov yell you felt your heart jump. You knew he was frightening before, but now he was even more frightening. You were even more surprised that Gray still kept his composure in front of Makarov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Look gramps. Only Natsu can beat that thing. He's right where he needs to be to make that happen. Listen, I was working on a job when I heard the rumors. Someone was trying to build an artificial dragon. So I decided to look into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: And that's when you had this rendezvous with this reckless fool?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Her plan was entirely focused on capturing Natsu and using him to power that fake dragon. I don't know if she knew, but she told me something that was important. Once it awakens the only way to stop it is to have a dragon slayer destroy it from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): That would make sense, but also you could've prevented this if you didn't hand Natsu over to Daphne i the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Look (name). I had to. You're missing part of the story. There's a city counting on us. It was for their sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wait, does this have anything to do with the city without sound?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: You got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well tell us. What does this have to do with Natsu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: Yes. Go on my boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Natsu made a promise to the people in the city without sound, but he forgot because he's an idiot. Self control isn't exactly his strong suit. So I used to check up on him after he finished a job to make sure everything was OK. Whenever he heard word of Igneel, he would get distracted and he completely forget about the task at hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: So you felt the need to remind him that finding Igneel is important, but fulfilling his obligation to the guild is even more important?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Gray clenched his fists and had a serious look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: I never had the chance to prove myself to my master Ur, but there's no limit for him. Every challenge that was put before him, he over came it. I know that if he found him, he would beat Igneel! He always has that. He can always be ready for that day when it comes! But he needs to get stronger and stronger because he's the only person I can prove myself to! But I messed up. I thought he would have no problem beating this thing. Please let me fix this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was along silence then you spoke by putting your hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): If you're gonna need to help cleaning this mess, count me in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: What? But why....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I can see how determined you are. And how much Natsu means to you as a friend. Call it a man's intuition, but my guts telling me to trust you. Besides I owe Natsu. After all he's the doofus that got me in this guild in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray looked at you and smiled. Then you both bumped your fist as a sign of friendship. Makarov sighed with exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: Very well. But you two must promise to do exactly as I tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Have you got some kind of plan gramps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: Yes I do. And don't worry. This plan will work. Just make sure you do as i say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Makarov began telling you and Gray his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

Even Erza who had joined up with the guild couldn't even land a scratch on the dragonnoid. Wendy was standing by healing all the injured and the wounded. She had just finished healing Elfman when she fell over about to faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Wendy! Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: I'm fine, but I may need help getting to other people who need treatment too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: Absolutely not! I forbid it! If you keep using your magic to heal people your own life will be at risk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: If that's what happens then so be it. I'm not a baby anymore Carla. I'm a Fairy Tail wizard and I'm gonna act like one whether you like it or not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla was silent, and then she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: What stubbornness. I don't know where you get from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: We're all Fairy Tail wizards, so let's take that thing down and rescue Natsu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you arrived on the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): If you guys want help rescuing Natsu, count me in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy: (name)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I overheard everything you said Wendy and I gotta say you have a lot of guts as well as the rest of the guild. I may be new in Fairy Tail, but I can see you guys really care for Natsu. He may have made me join this guild, but I'm glad he did. For that I owe him not only as a member, but as a friend. So let's beat this overgrown lizard and get Natsu out of there! Who's with me?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone: Yeah!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Makarov's stern voice echoed throughout the guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: Not so fast! The well being of this guild and the town of Magnolia are tied together. Preventing the destruction of Magnolia as well as destroying the dragnnoid takes top priority above anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: But Master! If we do that then what's gonna happen to Natsu?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: We can't destroy it with him still inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: I'll say it as clear as I can. As the master of this guild, I'm order you all to stop the dragonnoid before it can destroy the town at any cost. And Natsu will be fine. That boy is as tough as nails. If anyone can survive through things like this he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Makarov left. There was a long and awkward pause. Then Erza called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Natsu! We've been ordered by Master Makarov to destroy the dragonnoid by any means necessary. But before that I need to know what you want us to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you and rest of the guild could hear Natsu's voice coming from the dragonnoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: It's about time someone asked that. OK. Clear the gunk out of your ears and listen up, because I'm only gonna say this once. Forget about me! Destroy this thing with me in it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Say what?!? Are you out of your mind Natsu?!? If we did that what's gonna happen to you?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Just do it would ya?!? If Magnolia were to be destroyed because of me, I would never forgive myself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragonnoid was stomping through town. Everyone was firing their best magic attack at it, but still nothing worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlzak: Damn it! Nothing's working!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: We don't stop that thing, it's gonna destroy the whole city!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Please tell me you got some kind of plan to stop that thing Erza?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Erza said nothing. Meanwhile at the cockpit of the dragonnoid Daphne was enjoying herself enormously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: What a rush! It totally rocks! It really takes me back to my childhood. Such wonderful memories! I never forget what I saw that day. It was beautiful. Powerful! So majestic. And ferocious. It was the most incredible thing I've ever seen. I kept waiting for it to come back, but it never did. So I thought if I wanted to see one again, I would have to make one with my own two hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu (inside dragon): OK lady, I've just about had it with this crap! You think you're the only one waiting around for a dragon?!? I am too! Gajeel, Wendy, and not to mention (name) too! That makes us in the same boat doesn't it?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: You dreamed it up they told me. There's no such thing they said, you're crazy they said! What I saw was real! No matter what I said they never believed me. They laughed at me, turned their backs at me, and told me that dragons never existed! But I knew that they were wrong. It was so frustrating! I'm sure you know what it's like right? Yes, yes, yes! Now I can show them! Show them a dragon that everyone can see! First I'll show them how my dragon can destroy an entire city and then an entire country!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Well's it's official. This girl has flipped her lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: The whole thing is crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I know. But in a way I kinda feel sorry for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Gray appeared right next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Gray!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: OK. Let me just say I completely screwed up. I underestimated Natsu's strength. But I need you all to listen to me, even though you won't believe what I have to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: And why should we believe you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Easy Cana. Just listen to Gray. I know Gray helped Daphne, but he had good intentions. Gramps and I heard him ourselves, so just listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes, Gray explained everything and when he finished everyone was shocked as well as annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Are you serious? How could he forget something that important?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: I swear! No matter what happens he never learns!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Oh my beloved Gray! I'm so relieved! I just knew that you'd always be true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: This was the only I can think of way to make things right. But right now we gotta deal with Daphne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza (thinking): I don't understand. Why would the master tell us to attack the dragonnoid when he knows that Natsu's the only one who can destroy it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza pondered and then she understood and in a brilliant flash of light, she requipped into her Heaven's Wheel Armor. Meanwhile dozens of Lizardmen appeared from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Erza let me explain what Gramps told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: I know. I figured it out. The rest of you focus your attacks on the Lizardmen. I'll take care of the dragonnoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Wait are you sure? Natsu's still inside that thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: We can't defy the master's will. Therefore it's the will of Fairy Tail. Protect the city at any cost. If we have any pride we must be prepared to protect it at any cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone: RIGHT!! LET'S DO IT!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: (name). Juvia. I need you to come with me. (Juvia blushes) (name) you too. (Juvia depressed).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Me? What for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Just trust me. I need you and Juvia to make this work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. You got it Gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you followed Gray and Juvia. Then......</span></div></div>",

To make  matters worse, the dragonnoid had absorbing so much of his magic, he was close to passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Damn it! Come on! No matter what I can't pass out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen heard voices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice 1: It's useless man. You should just give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice 2: No way1 You're still in this so don't give up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Hey! Who's there?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu opened his eyes and looked for the source of the voices. Then he saw them. There above his head was two mini versions of him.

Like you know what Daphne's talking about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Natsu: Hey! I'm not the bad guy here. You're the one that the promise we made!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back at the battlefield, everyone was doing their best on fighting of all the lizardmen. Erza was trying to find a weak spot on the dragonnoid so she can save Natsu. Then all of a sudden the dragonnoid let out a ferocious roar and then things began to get strange. The dragonnoid began to speak in Natsu's voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonnoid (Natsu): RRRRAGGGGGHHHH!!!!! Guys you gotta stop me! I mean you'll never stop me!!!!! I'm gonna destroy everything!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: What the heck?!? He's starting to crack up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: What the heck is going on?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Bixslow took off his helmet and used his figure eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBixslow: I tell you what's going on. He's at the breaking point! The dragonnoid monster is close to absorbing Natsu's spirit. If we don't get him out of there he's done for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonnoid (Natsu): Destroy!!! I mean destroy me!! I mean... Oh man! I don't even know what I mean anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Dragonnoid<br>\r\nLight Natsu: Wow. Looks like Erza's really fired up now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Natsu: You can say that again. We'll have to destroy her too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight Natsu: But she's a good friend of ours, we can't do that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Natsu: Let's put her on the ground. Don't be so soft!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Dragonnoid<br>\r\nNatsu: Grrrrr!!!!! WOULD YOU TWO SHUT UP!!! If you two are gonna argue at least get out of my head first!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: (sweatdrop) Oh my.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Sounds like he has a screw loose.

Is there any particular reason why were all the way out here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Yes. We should be in that things blind spot over here. She won't even know what hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: What do you mean by that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: (name). Juvia. Listen up. I need the kind of help that only you two can give me. If we pull this off Natsu just might make it out of there alive. I wouldn't want it any other way. You can't have Fairy Tail without Natsu. That can't even be a possibility!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: You're so passionate my beloved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah, yeah we get it. Just tell us how we're gonna help Natsu while were all the way from up here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: We're gonna help Erza and everyone else by taking out all those lizardmen at once. We're doing a unison raid. A triple unison raid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): A triple unison raid? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Can we do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Yeah. We're ice and water after all Juvia. When you and I first fought I remembered thinking our styles of magic would seem to compliment each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia (blushing): R-r-really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: And (name) you're a water dragon slayer. With you also being water you should be able to give our combined attack the power boost it needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You do make a good point there, but are you sure that we can do it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: I know we make it happen, but we have to work together on this. So can the two of you do it? Please. I need both of your help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence and then Juvia spoke and took Gray's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: I will. I won't let you down my love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah and you can count me in too. Let's do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Gray and Juvia took a stance like they were doing the tango and you held on to both of their shoulders. Then three magic circles appeared above the three of you and all of your magic fused together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name), Gray, and Juvia: MAGIC FUSION!!!! TRIPLE UNISON RAID!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant spouts of water erupted from Magnolia's river and shot into the sky. Then the water froze and formed a storm of needles and ice dragons that rained down on all the lizard men and destroyed them instantly and left the your guild mates unharmed. Even the dragonoid was hit the attack. Everyone was amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet and Droy: What's happening?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: It's a giant curtain of ice! With ice dragons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonoid (Natsu): WOOOWW!!!! WHOOO!!!! That's cold!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: This magic power. It feels familiar for some reason.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla: It's an ice and water unison raid! No....a triple unison raid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira Jane: Did Gray, Juvia, and (name) do this? Amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back on the rooftop)<br>\r\nGray: Thanks a lot you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: It makes me so happy to know that you'd anything to save your friends, even put your life on the line. Oh Gray. Oh my love....!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Juvia turned around to gaze into Gray's face to praise him, she found that you were the only one standing next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um Juvia? You do realize that Gray left a little while ago right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Say what?!? Gray my love! Don't run away from me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Come on Juvia! If you don''t move it, we'll leave you behind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you followed Gray back to the battlefield where the dragonoid was.

No I shouldn't!! I mean yes I should!!! What the hell's wrong with me?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone who saw this sudden outburst was a bit weirded out. Even Erza was a bit......perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Natsu's finally gone nutso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Short trip if ask me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Gray appeared on one of the rooftops close enough for Natsu to hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Hey! Listen up you pink haired freak! Are you seriously that weak? It's pathetic! I should've known that you were nothing, but hot air! We're getting real tired of this comedy act so man up already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonoid(Natsu): What'd you say?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you appeared next to Natsu on another rooftop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You heard him you fire breathing moron! I mean come on! Are you really that defenseless?!? Are meaning to tell me that all that stuff I heard about you being a strong dragon slayer were nothing but a lie?!? You're such a disgrace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonoid(Natsu): Watch it water boy!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Hey! This isn't the time to be mean!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Yeah! Come on you guys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy and Happy were confused, but then they both began to catch on as to what you and Gray were up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: You know a real Fairy Tail wizard never forgets a promise! You making the guild look like were a bunch of liars! Come on! Show em how we really do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah! Smash that lame excuse for a dragon into pieces!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: Yes, yes. So you show your true intentions Gray Fullbuster, but you're too late. Soon Salamander will absorbed by my creation. Who needs those lizardmen when I have this instead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: I'm disappointed in you Natsu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonoid(Natsu): What?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: I mean what's your problem? I thought you were the kind of guy that crushed everything in your way! So you're gonna let this fake dragon beat you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Come on! Everyone in Fairy Tail needs you and you're just gonna give up? We all expected a lot more from you, but I guess you decided to take the easy way and quit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Dragonoid<br>\r\nNatsu: What?!? Come on Lucy! You don't need to get so personal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight Natsu: That was totally uncalled for man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Natsu: Add her to the stomping list!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Erza joined the insulting game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: They're right Natsu. I understand you were caught off guard, but you lost heart so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonoid(Natsu): No I didn't! I give up! No way never!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: You said to destroy the dragonoid with you inside. That's the very definition of giving up. It's nothing more, but a display of weakness. Allow me to give you what you asked for. I'll put you out your misery personally! I'm sure if your precious dragon saw you again he'd be ashamed of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragonoid(Natsu) Grrrrrr!!! GIVE ME YOUR BEST SHOT!!!! YOU AND ME RED!!!! IT\"S TIME TO PARTY!!!! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR A LONG TIME!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the dragonoid went berserk. The red core that was sparking like mad and the magic power began to leak out of it. Soon magic power began to leak throughout the dragonoid's body and Daphne was beginning to lose control of the power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne: No, no, no! At this rate the dragonoid won't be able to take much more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Erza swooped in, requipped into her purgatory armor and struck the dragonoid's red core with her giant spiked mace. The core cracked a little, but it didn't break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Damn it. Don't tell me that's all she's got!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man! We need more power! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Gajeel came on the scene.<br>\r\nGajeel: Man he's an idiot. I tried to warn him, that this would happen. I mean I know that he's a lava brained idiot, but this is taking it way to far. It's time to make him shut up and to stop being a nuisance! DRAGON SLAYER SECRET ART!! KARMA DEMON IRON SPIRAL!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Gajeel leaped into the sky and his legs turned into a giant drill at pierced the dragon's center and broke open setting Natsu free. When Natsu regained his senses he was staring at Gajeel who was right at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel: Well this didn't work out like I planned. I was hoping to sneak in the middle of the confusion and beat the crap out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Heh. Is that so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel: Hey! Lucy! Call that horse spirit of yours! We need to get some flames over her ASAP! In fact, all of you, conjure up as much flames as you can to feed Salamander!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Right! Let's do it! Ready everyone?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone: Yeah! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone used the most powerful fire based spell they can think of and Natsu downed all of it in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Oh yeah! Now I got a real fire in my belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel: That stupid chick tarnished the dragon's reputation for their nobility and grace. So teacher a lesson she'll never forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Exactly what I was thinking. I'M ALL FIRED UP!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all that added power Natsu went on a furious rampage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh man. I knew he was strong when he's mad, but this is a little much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: His driving force will always be righteous anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Oh hi master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: If you want Natsu to pull through, to overcome any situation no matter the cost. Make him angry. It's surefire way to give him the motivation he needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: No kidding!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: I told you and Gray to make Natsu extremely mad. Then it seems that Erza figured it out. Keep a close eye on him (name). You're about to see a real Fairy Tail wizard in action. Carrying out our most sacred duty in the guild. Destroying evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Natsu was still rampaging and soon he found Daphne and unleashed one final attack, destroying the dragonoid, defeating Daphne, and breaking her spell on the city without sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow. Incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel: It looks like the Dragonoid's weakness.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Is an unstable power sourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I guess so but......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Hey Gray! What's the big idea putting me through all of that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: It's your fault for breaking promises!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed even you. Then you looked into the sky and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Wow. These guys may fight a lot, but everyone relies on each other for support and guidance. I gotta say I'm coming to like this guild. Even though they're crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lucy called you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Hey (name)! You coming? We're going back to the guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey wait up! I'm coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you went back to the guild with your friends ready for the next adventure.</span></div></div>",

(placing a book on the shelf)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well, I can't really complain I guess.(climbing up ladder and placing book on shelf) Everyone's pretty cool. Hahaha. Although, Natsu could try to be a little more mature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIra: But that's what makes him so sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Are you serious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Of course. You're attracted to Natsu's charms too right? After all he is the reason you joined the guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Say what?!? No...whoa....YAAAAHHH!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of you were on top of the ladder, you lost your balance and fell on the floor. You were in a pile of books and papers. Mira quickly rushed to your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: (name)! Are you OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I'm OK. I just fell. Hahaha. Sorry for making such a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: It's fine. I'm just that you're not hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in the pile of books that you were laying on, you something that caught your eye. It was an old painting of a bunch of familiar faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey. What's this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Hey. I remember that painting! Reedus painted this a long time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Mira. Is this a painting of everyone when they were younger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Yes. It is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): (looks at Cana and Gray in painting) Wow. That's Cana and that looks Gray. (looks at Wakaba and Macao) Macao and Wakaba look so young! (looks at Natsu) Heh. I recognize that pink haired dope anywhere. Natsu's hardly changed at all. (looks at Happy) And.....what's with the blue dragon? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Oh that's Happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Say what?!? Why the heck is he a dragon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Well....why not? It's cute isn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Uh.....never mind. (looks at Erza) That's Erza (looks at Makarov) and that's definitely Master Makarov and.....(looks at Elfman) what the....no way....is that Elfman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Yes it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But he looks so......non manly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Hahaha. I know. Everyone was a little different when they were kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You ain't kidding. (looks at Mira) Hold the phone. Who's this girl? She looks like a rebel. (looks close) Hey Mira, is she a relative of yours like a sister perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIra: Nope. That's me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): SAY WHAT?!?!? Are you for real?!? You have to be joking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Nope. I'm not joking. That's really me. Surprised?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes! I mean, you look totally different than you were back then! It's a little hard to believe. (looks at Lisanna) If that's you, then who's this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: That's my sister Lisanna. She died a couple years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh. I'm so sorry to hear that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: It's OK. I don't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew your conversation was heading toward a sad direction, so you decided to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): So how long ago was this painted and what was it like back then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Well let's see..... Back then I hadn't been a member for very long when the picture was painted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow should the flashback be told? Short or long?</span></div></div>",

Natsu was always fighting with Gray and Erza was always breaking up their fights. The only thing that was different was that Mira was always picking a fight with Erza which again shocked you. <br>\r\nThen she told you about how Happy came to the guild and how Natsu and Lisanna took care of him when he was an egg. Which made you a little puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Mira. Do you know where Happy came from? I mean did he have a mom or dad or something before Natsu found him as an egg?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: To be honest, I don't know. All I know is Natsu found him in the East Forest. No one really knows for sure where Happy came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Elfman came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElfman: Hey Big sis. It's time to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: OK. I'll be right there. Sorry (name). I have to go somewhere OK? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK. I'll see you later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Mira left to join Elfman leaving you by yourself looking at the painting. You looked at the many different faces on the painting. Then you looked at Lisanna in the painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow. It must have been hard losing a sister like that. I would've loved to meet her. I wonder what she was like. Maybe the other guildmates would know. I can probably even ask Mira. I better catch her before she leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you went back to main guild hall. When you got there you were startled by the sounds of lightning. You looked outside to see that it was raining outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man. For a minute it was all sunny second ago. When the heck did it start raining?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard the sound of crashing, bashing and yelling. You looked to find that Natsu and Gray were fighting again. Only Natsu had a lot of drawings on his face. You sat next to Lucy, Levy, and Cana watching the brawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh brother. What are those two fighting about this time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Gray doodled on Natsu's face because he was getting annoyed pf Natsu's snoring. Natsu woke up, figured out it was Gray and now those two are brawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): I thought it something that stupid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia (looking at Natsu and Gray): Oh my beloved Gray. He's so gallant like a knight fighting for his true love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Has anyone seen Mira? I wanted to ask her something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: She went to the church with Elfman. (drinks from a giant barrel) Ahh. Rainy days are best cuddling with your boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Uhhhh. I.....see. Anyway why would Mira and Elfman visit the church in this weather? I mean it's pouring cats and dogs out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana's face then turned solemn and a little sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: The anniversary of Lisanna's death is coming up.  They always spend a lot of time at the church when it comes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh. I see. Actually Cana that's what I wanted to ask you and the others about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: About Lisanna?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. I was wondering what was she like? And how did she die?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: Well for starters, she went on a job with Mira and Elfman two years ago, but didn't make it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: She was a girl that was a tenderhearted. In fact, she was best friends with everyone in the guild. Including Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Wow. I had no idea. It must've hard on both of them. I would've loved to meet Lisanna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Yeah. I can relate. I would of loved to meet her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Hey. Now that I think about it. (name) and Lucy both remind of Lisanna a little, but mostly Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: It's because they get along with Natsu so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Well I wouldn't go that far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Gajeel came in. His face was covered in scratches and cuts like he got into a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey Gajeel! What happened to you? Got into a fight with a cat or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel: Shut up would ya?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Gajeel stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What's with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: Who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: Man. I'm so bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You can always take a job Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy:  Nah. Besides it's raining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: It's hard to feel motivated when you're stuck inside.  Besides you should take a load off once in while (name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): If you say so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy: (sigh). I wish something interesting would happen today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy would soon get her wish because suddenly time seemed to have stopped, then everything went white.  When you came to, you were laying down on something soft. You slowly opened your eyes and sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh man. What the heck just happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you surveyed the area around you and your eyes opened wide in shock. The area that was once the guild hall, in fact the whole town that was once Magnolia was nothing more, but a desert with floating bubbles. You looked up and you saw that the sky had a dark and round like appearance in the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the hell happened here? Where is everyone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a familiar voice. You followed the voice and it led you to.....</span></div></div>",

You were still doing small jobs, but eventually you took some of the more higher paying jobs. You tagged along with some of the guild members on the quests, but you at least got some experience. Soon you were handling quest on your own like a pro and you were loving it. One day you had just completed a quest and had come back to the guild. Then you ran into Natsu, Gray, and Erza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Yo! (name)! Welcome back man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: You just come back from a quest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yup. Easy as pie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Seems you're used to handling quests on your own now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yeah. It took a while getting used to, but now I love going on quests. Especially the ones where I have to find the escaped convicts. That's where the real jewel making is at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Cana and Levy came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: (name). You're starting to sound like Natsu. With all the fighting and stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Yeah. Keep that up and you're gonna scare the ladies away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh come on Cana. Give me a break. It's not like I'm trying to scare anyone away. I just like testing my abilities that's all. Besides, I don't exactly have anyone I want to impress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Anyone except Mira Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Cana! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard Mira's name you couldn't help, but blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: You have a crush a Mira? You're kidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Yup! He's head over heels for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Cana! Be quiet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Happy came sailing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: You loooooove her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Would you just shut up you furball? That's really getting old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: Aww don't worry about it (name). I think it's cute that you like Mira, but you do have your work cut out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What do you mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: For one thing Mira's the cover girl for Sorcerer Weekly. She's the most popular girl in our guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: And all the boys are all over her. Including some in the guild. If you started going out with Mira, they'd go crazy with jealously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): R-really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to imagine yourself going out with Mira. Then an angry mob of men were chasing after you and beating you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh man. That would be bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: But still, I would love to see you and Mira go out. You two would seem like a good couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) blushing: Y-y-you really think so Levy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Of course she does and I agree with her. You should go up to her and ask her out on a date!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): A d-d-d-date? No way! I mean...I'm sure Mira has better things to do rather than time with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: Oh come on man! All you gotta do is go up to her and ask her like this. \"Hey Mira! Come on and fight me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: You fire breathing dork. He's not trying to ask Mira to a fight. He wants to ask her on a......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Gray could finish got up in his face and glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNastu: Who are you calling a dork you freezing exhibitionist?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: I'm calling you that! And you don't even know what that word means you magma brain idiot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu: You wanna fight?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Get ready to have your ass beat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the two have started fighting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Honestly, do those two ever stop? Anyway (name), I agree with Cana. It never hurts to ask. I'm sure Mira will comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um....thanks Erza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: See? If Erza says that you have a chance, than it must be true. Just go for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling reassured by the encouraging words you felt a lot more confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Thanks guys. I think I'll go for it and ask her. But....what do I say? I mean I'm not exactly good with this sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Ah! I've got just the thing to help you (name)! I'll be right back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask Erza raced off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the... What's with Erza? She's acting even stranger than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: Oh boy.

I think you better run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Why do you say that Levy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: Well....when it come to helping someone with romance Erza kinda goes over the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: I'll say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could wonder what Levy and Cana were talking about.....</span></div></div>",

Erza. What the heck is all of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Just a few books. They all have detailed information to your problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: A few? She practically brought a whole library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um....thank you Erza, but I don't think I'll be able to read all of these at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: I must insist! I want to help you overcome this trial! You may have joined the guild in a short amount of time, but I consider you a good lifelong friend. Friends are always there no matter what the cost.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erza kept rambling on and on about friendship all you could do was sit there and listen. Then Cana and Levy whispered to you so Erza couldn't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: You see? Once Erza's gets like this, there's no stopping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): You weren't kidding. Is she always like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: Yeah. She means well, but she has a habit of going a little over the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I'll say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: WHICH IS WHY....!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Erza's voice suddenly boomed which caused you as well as Levy and Cana to jump in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: I would appreciate it if you would read these books for research! So you could one day meet your own true love! I can understand if you don't need them...I only wanted to assist you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um....no. It's OK. I'll take the books. Thank you for the help Erza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Erza took your hands and began shaking them like crazy like a two handed handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Thank you! I knew you'd understand! Friends sure are wonderful aren't they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Yes! They are! Take it easy with the shaking would you?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Now then. I best be off. Good luck with your problem! Go!

I've never seen Erza like that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: Yup. She's always like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later you carried your books to your room in the boys dorm in Fairy Tail. The books were a little heavy, but you managed to get them to your room. After that you headed back to the guild hall to see if you could find a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Man. I know Erza means well, but there is such a thing as restraint. Then all of the guildmates have got something crazy about themselves. Hahaha. But that's what I like about this guild.

When you saw it, you couldn't help, but feel a little creeped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Umm Juvia? Is this the place? It looks kinda creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Yes it is. Right this way. Drip, drip, drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia went inside the store and you followed. Inside there was a an old man mixing a couple of potions together. You looked around at the other potions in the shop while Juvia made her request to the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld man: Ah. Welcome you two. What brings you this way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: I need one of your special potions that will make a boy notice me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld man: A potion to make a boy notice you eh? And what about you boy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Um...don't mind me. I'm with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld man: Well young lady, my potions can't be tailored to such specific needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Please sir. If he could gaze into my eyes passionately just once, that'll be more than enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man thought and he thought. Then he reached behind him and pulled out a violet colored bottle with an ox's head on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld man: Try this. It'll do exactly as you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: What's this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Looks kinda creepy looking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld man: This will make sure that the boy you like burn with a passion only for you. For sixty thousand jewel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Sixty thousand?!? That sounds a little pricy to me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Yes. It does seem a bit expensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld man: Eh who cares what you think boy? Did I forget to mention it's one hundred percent effective?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: One hundred percent? Of burning passion? I'll take the whole bottle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Juvia are you sure about this? I mean, is it worth spending sixty thousand jewel for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Yes. As long as Gray gazes passionately into my eyes and loves me, it is worth it. So how exactly does this potion work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld man: All you have to do is blow the bubbles toward the person you desire and make sure he inhales them. Once successful the man you desire will become aware of the feelings you have deep inside of your heart if your feelings are strong enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: I understand. Thank you very much sir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld man: What about you boy? Do you have a potion in mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): No thanks. I wanna see for myself if your potions work. So I won't be buying anything yet. If this potion works, then we'll talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you and Juvia left and headed back to the guild. Then.....</span></div></div>",

You followed close behind raring to see what would happen. Then you both saw him. There was Gray getting into a fight with Natsu as usual. You and Juvia hid behind a pillar so no one would see you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): OK Juvia. If you want to use that potion on Gray, now would be a good time to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia was about to open the bottle, but then she hesitated. As soon as she saw Gray, she began to go into her own little world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Oh my beloved Gray. All I ask for is for you to give me one passionate glance. Oh! My heart is beating so fast! And I'm shaking from head to toe just thinking about you! Oh the suspense!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Hey! Would you quit daydreaming and use the freaking potion already?!?!? Stay focused would ya?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Eeep! Yes! You're right! Thank you (name)! My beloved Gray, forgive me. I was so nervous that I could barely move! But now, thanks to (name) I got to courage to use it! The potion that will bind us together! We'll be known as sweethearts! So my love, give me your passionate gaze!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Natsu and Gray ended their fight due to both of them being tired. This was the perfect chance for Juvia to use the potion. She opened the bottle and purple bubbles floated out from the tip. Juvia took careful aim, and blew the bubbles toward Gray. Just when the bubbles were about to hit the mark, Gray moved out of the way because he wanted to sit down and rest. The bubbles unfortunately hit another target. Master Makarov that it is. You and Juvia watched in horror as the bubbles went up Makarov's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: Achoo! Hmm? I wonder what that was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Juvia what was that?!? You completely missed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: It's OK. Let me try again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia took aim again and blew a few more bubbles toward Gray. The bubbles missed again and hit six different targets instead of Gray. The targets hit were Fried, Bixlow, Evergreen, Macao, Wakaba, and Levy. She tried a third time and she missed hitting another six. Jet, Droy, Cana, Erza, Elfman, and to your horror Mira Jane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Ahhhh!!!!!! Juvia! You hit Mira! Not to mention you hit a few other people in the guild! You have the worst aim ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: It's not my fault! My beloved Gray won't stop moving around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): But at this rate, everyone in the guild is gonna be in love with you except Gray!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Don't worry! This time for sure! Gray my love! Feel my love!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia took the stance of a baseball pitcher and fired the bubbles at Gray one more time! This time they hit the mark. Just as Gray sat down and yawned the bubbles entered right in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: Yes! I did it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): About time, but did it work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Gray came walking toward you and Juvia blushing beet red and......</span></div></div>",

It looked like Gray was coming towards Juvia, but instead he walked right past her and walked up to a certain blue colored feline. He now had a look of jealousy on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: You got some nerve Happy. Flying around free as bird showing me up all the time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Say what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: I'm incredibly strong, but I can't fly! You on the other hand are weak and yet you can fly! As far as I can tell we're even! So listen up! As of right now, you're my rival!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy at this point began to panic and scream while you and Juvia looked on in horror and shock. (and comically purple)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren: What the heck as gotten into Gray?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray: Come on! Show me what you got cat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: Somebody help! Gray's gone crazy in the head and he wants to fight me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia: I don't understand. He's supposed to be noticing me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Forget about that Juvia! We got bigger problems! Look!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a table Wakaba and Macao who had swallowed the bubbles were arguing about who made the most money in the cast month. At the bar Makarov was yelling at a barrel of alcohol saying that he was not going to drunken by it or something like that. Then you saw Erza. When you saw her, you nearly fell down in surprise as to who or what she was yelling at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Curse you wretched pillar! Why must you block my path?! Shattering my dreams of going through unhindered! Answer me scoundrel! Is your silence your way of challenging me? From the moment I met you I knew we would be rivals!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax: I hate to break it to ya, but I doubt you can be rivals with an inanimate object Erza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren: The alcohol thing kinda makes sense when it came to the master, but against a pillar, that's just crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: It would make sense if she was talking about a caterpillar, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Screw that Happy! She'll more than likely torture the thing! And that'll be even more messed up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax: I'll pretend I didn't hear you two say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mira Jane popped up and started talking to Erza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Bring it on Red! Let's fight the way we used to back in the old days! But this time I'm not holding back because there's no way I'm losing to my lifetime rival!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: I'm so confused! I don't know what's going on! Natsu where are you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax: He went out on a job with Lucy and Wendy. They won't be back for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Oh man. As if this guild wasn't crazy enough! Now it's even more crazy! I knew that potion was bogus! I wonder how this thing will last? I know! Maybe the potion's can tell how long this'll last. Where's Juvia? She's got the potion so.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around in the chaos to find Juvia, but she was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) thinking: Aw crap! She's gone and disappeared on me! Man! Now what?!? I don't even know that the potions got some time delay or not?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore our readers get confused, I think an explanation is in order. You see the old man who gave Juvia the potion really just mixed a bunch of bad potions together which he happened to have on hand and he had absolutely no idea what that would do to Gray. Now you're probably thinking how could he do such a cruel thing? Well, he skipped town so he really didn't care less. Anyway back to the craziness. Cana has now joined Makarov in some kind of drinking contest and Team Laxus and Team Shadow Gear were now having a pose off The Thunder Legion and Team Shadow Gear were locked in a pose off, and Elfman was......well apparently looking miserable for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: Master! I've come to challenge you! I've always wanted to see who would win at drinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakarov: You're not worthy to call yourself my rival! My enemy is alcohol itself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana: You'll never win! (glug, glug, glug)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile.....<br>\r\nFreed: Three against three is it? We may have the same number of teams, but our skills are clearly superior to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: What kind of trash are you spouting? Everyone knows that we're the best three man team!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The Thunder Legion poses)<br>\r\nFreed: Very well! The Thunder Legion vs Team Shadow Gear! Let's find out who the strongest three man team is in all of Fairy Tail!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Team Shadow Gear poses)<br>\r\nLevy: I hope you won't be too disappointed when we mop the floor with you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreed: How dare you?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevy: You have no idea who you're messing with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElfman: Why doesn't this guild have any real men in it's ranks? I can't even find a real rival! This situation makes me sad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren: Is he looking for a fight or a man?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax: I don't know, but I don't want to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh man. This is getting a little out of hand. Man. Can this get any worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Erza requipped into Heaven's Wheel Armor and began stabbing the pillar with her swords one after the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Oh damn! I spoke too soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax: Hey Erza! Knock it off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren: Yeah! It took us a long time to fix the guild so don't wreck it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Silence! This vile pillar insists on standing in my way! I need to go further inside, yet it blocks my path! It secretly blocks me, while I have time to walk around it!! It's obstructing my course!! Why would it do that, unless it would be my greatest rival!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax: Has it ever occurred to you that maybe you should take a different route in the hall?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren: I know you're settin' your ways, but this is a bit much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) That's the understatement of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy: I think Erza's finally found an opponent that's just as stubborn as she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax: That's true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mira Jane came in wearing boxing gloves and sent you, Max, Warren, as well as Happy flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Get your butt over here, and fight me Erza!! It's time we finish this once and for all!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: Are you blind, can't you see that I'm in the midst of battle with my life long rival?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax: Not really. It's just a pillar. It can't fight back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Mira! You need to calm down! Seriously! If you and Erza duke it out here, you'll tear the whole place apart!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira: Grrrrrr!!!!! I won't be ignored!!!!! SATAN SOUL!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax and Warren: Mira!! No!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a dark magic symbol appeared over her head and Mira transformed into her Satan Soul form much to your shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): What the crap?!? What the hell just happened?!? Why the hell does Mira Jane turn into some kind of devil?!? Where'd my beauitful Mira Jane go?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax and Warren: That's his problem?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Erza requipped again. This time she wore one of her most powerful armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza: That's it!!! Re-quip!! Purgatory Armor!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren, Max, and (name): Can't we talk about this ladies?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mira Jane came from behind and punched all three of you at once, knocking you all on the floor with lumps on your heads. Then Elfman joined the fray, but Mira Jane sent him flying with a fierce punch. Erza however went back to whacking the pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren: It's no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax: Guess the guild hall is gonna get destroyed....again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Again? You mean it's happened before? What kind of crazy guild did I get into anyway?!?!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then.....</span></div></div>",

It was your first time riding on a train, but Lisanna gave you a small tour. Erza on the other hand was focused on doing her vocal exercises to pay any attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Man. Does she ever stop? She acts like she's going go and put on a show of the ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisanna: Well, that's Erza for you. She does love putting on different outfits as well as collecting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Actually Lisanna I was wondering about something. Now that I think about it, I forgot to ask Natsu and the others this, but what magic does Erza do anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisanna: I'm you asked. Erza uses a magic called The Knight. This Magic allows the user to store weapons and armors in pocket dimensions and summon them during battle. This gives the user a high level of offense, defense, flexibility and variety in combat, regarding the type of the armor and/or weapon they Requip. Erza has many different types of armor. About one hundred to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) One hundred?!? No way! No wonder she loves different outfits so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisanna: Yeah. Although I think it would be better if you see for yourself because just explaining it doesn't cover it. When Erza does it in battle it truly is something beautiful. In fact Erza's considered to be the strongest female wizard in all of Fairy Tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) I see. Make me think that the Erza right is nothing more, but a little kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisanna: Hahaha. So by the way (name) there's something I want to ask you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name): Ask away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisanna: You have a crush on my sister don'tcha?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard this question you nearly fell off your seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(name) Excuse me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisanna: I asked you if you had a crush in my sister?

So this way you can prove your better than him.... Oh my /she turned towards me/ I'm so sorry I didn't ask for your name, can you tell me please?\" am I finally able to say something \"well of couse my name is Maxwell Miyamoto and actually I don't know if I should join Fairy tail, I mean any work would bound me, and I need to be able to travel from one place to another for something I'm researching, I Only wanted to make sure those three are getting here without harm.\" Natsu jumped up \"as if I need you to protect me!\" Mira immediately walked to Natsu and rested a hand on his shoulder \"hey now, don't be like that, we all know about your strength. Maxwell made a nice gesture and even if you don't need any rotection he would have protected Lucy and Happy. /Natsu quickly calmed down and nodded, Mira now a dressing me again./ thank you for that, but if to be bound on a place is the only issue fairy tail is perfect for you, you can take a job that is on the way to where ever you want to go, do the job, afterwards do your research and when you find the time to come back you can collect your earnings, pretty simple right. \" really? Just that simple \"I don't have to be here for any events and other stuff?\" Mira nodded \"yeah we basically have 2 members who are most of the time away. One is the mystery Mystogan, the other one is Gildarts he's on a mission for three years now.\" a little confused I asked \"three years aren't you concerned he might be dead?\" everyone started to laugh like they got crazy, what the hell? Lucy was as confused as I amand asked  \"who is this Gildarts?\" now Cana stepped in again \"well he is the strongest member in fairy, basically take Natsus strength and multiply it with like a billion or more.\" Lucy was shocked \"really? That strong?\" well that explains why they laughed at my question. But still the next question is do I join or go my own path alone? </span></div></div>",

You heard that Fairy Tail was the best around, so you made up your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How much longer till we get to Fairy Tail, (name)?\" you heard from your right side. You almost forget about your exceed partner/little sister, Luna sitting on your right shoulder. She had yellow fur and big, blue eyes. You found her only four years ago so she's pretty young, and a bit of a whiner. \"No Luna,\" you answer. \"We still have a ways to go till we get to Magnolia.\" The little kitten pouts. \"But I'm getting tired! And hungry!\" You look to her with an annoyed face. She always acts like this when you two travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're tired? You haven't been the one walking for two here!\" When you say that, she looks like she's going to cry. You forget that she's only a child and start to feel bad. \"Hey, I'm sorry. I'll tell you what. Why don't we get some lunch at that restaurant over there?\" You ask, pointing to a nice-looking restaurant over yonder. She jolts her head up. \"Can we get fish?\" she asks innocently. You chuckle  and say, \"Of course! Come on let's go!\" Her eyes light up and you two sprint to the restaurant.</span></div></div>",

Luck was on our side as it wasnt very packed and immediately got a table. Luna ordered a plate of salmon while I got a couple of burgers. She looked so cute munching on that fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm! So yummy!\" Luna said in euphoria. She really loved fish. I can relate to her as I took a bite of my delicious burger. After a moment, I began thinking of how we'll get to Fairy Tail. \"Ok, Luna. After we finish eating, we'll ask directions to Fairy Tail. It can't be very far from here.\" I explained to the little exceed. She just smiled cutely and said, \"Ok! I can't wait!\" She said with a salmon in her mouth. Little did I know, someone was listening to us. \"Excuse me? Do you need help getting to Fairy Tail?\" said a majestic voice. We both turned our heads to the source of the voice. I could've sworn that I died and went to heaven, because I was looking at an angel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman looked to be around my age of 18. She was drop-dead gorgeous! She had beautiful shoulder length blonde hair and stunning chocolate brown eyes. She wore some nice, yet slightly revealing clothing that just made her look even more sexy. Being a pervert  for a second, I noticed that she had huge breasts! I also noticed that she had a nice lower figure too, if you now what I mean. Apparently I was silent for too long and spoke, \"Excuse me? Anyone in there?\" She waved her hand in my face. I snapped out of my trance and blushed before speaking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, I got distracted.\" I felt like such a loser, embarrassing myself in front of such a beautiful girl. She giggled and said, \"Dont worry about it. I'm Lucy by the way.\" Lucy. Such a pretty name. \"I'm (name). Nice to meet you Lucy.\" I said before shaking her hand. She then noticed Luna. \"Aww! And who is this little cutie?\" She asked, tickling Luna's belly. Luna giggled in response. \"That's Luna. She's kind of like my little sister.\" \"Well she is just adorable! Hi Luna! I'm Lucy!\" She greeted. Luna smiled. \"Hi Lucy!\" I smiled at the sight if those two getting along. Luna's usually shy around other people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy turned to me and asked, \"So, you two are going to Fairy Tail?\" I nodded. \"Yeah, we've been traveling a long time to get there so I can become a full-fledged wizard!\" Lucy smiled. God, she looked so beautiful! \"Well it just so happens that I'm a Fairy Tal wizard. I left for a mission a fee days ago and I was passing through Hargeon while I was heading back to Magnolia. So I can  take you guys when I head back.\" I couldn't believe it! Not only did I meet this beautiful girl, but she's part of the guild that I want to join! She showed me her guild mark on her hand for proof. \"So what do you say? You wanna come with?\" She asked. I looked to Luna and her eyes beamed. She nodded he head rapidly. \"Yeah! Let's go!\" I yelled in excitement. She smiled. Oh, man I am going to enjoy being with her. We pained for our food and left toward the train station. Wait, The TRAIN STATION?!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The we got our own car with seats facing toward each other with Lucy on one side and Luna and I facing her on the other side. I would say that the seats were comfortable, but I was too nauseous to notice. You see, I don't really mix well with trains, or any vehicles for that matter. It took all of my concentration not to puke my guts out in front of Lucy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy then got concerned. \"Are you gonna be ok?\" I couldn't really answer, so Luna did it for me. \"He's fine. This always happens when we take the train....or boat, or carriage, or.......\" \"Luna, I think she gets the point!\" I said while still trying to keep my lunch down. \"It's nothing I haven't seen before. A couple of friends of mine have motion sickness too.\" Lucy replied. Huh. I wonder what they're like. \"Here. Wanna rest your head on my lap? It helps my friend Natsu whenever were traveling.\" Lucy offered. I got a little nervous, but I somehow found the strength to slither over to her side and rest my head on her lap. It was actually reall comfortable and I actually feel a little bit better! I'm not sure if she noticed, but she was rubbing her fingers on my head, but I didn't mind. \"Feeling better?\" Lucy asked with a soft smile. I nodded my head. \"All thanks to you.\" I unconsciously said. She blushed and smiled again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI relaxed my head into her lap and inhaled her sweet scent. The sweet smell of grapefruit lingered on her. A few minutes later I fell asleep. After a couple of hours I woke up to find both Luna and Lucy asleep. I looked to Lucy and saw her beautiful, sleeping face. And I thought Luna looked cute sleeping. In my dreams, when I wasn't thinking about becoming a wizard, I was thinking about Lucy. She is just so beautiful, considerate and helpful. I think I'm falling in love with this girl......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention passengers! Our next sto to Magnolia will be docking in 15 minutes.\" The conductor announced. That woke both Lucy and Luna up. \"Hey, (name). You sleep okay?\" Lucy asked, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. \"Yeah, and thank you again for helping me. I probably would've thrown up if it wasnt for you!\" I said and laughed. She giggled also. God, I loved her laugh. \"We'll let's go. Fairy Tail awaits!\" She says as we get our stuff and get off the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look around the city of Magnolia and it it a beautiful city! Every one seems so friendly and there are tons of shops and hotels around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisclaimer: this story takes place one year after the Tartaros arc, but no one left and the guild did not disband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy directed me to the Fairy Tail guild hall. I was so excited! \"Come on! It's just straight ahead. I'll race you!\" Lucy challenged and then took off running. I accepted her challenge and ran after her with Luna on my back. After a few seconds, I not only caught up to her, I saw the guild hall and boy was I suprised with what I saw.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(I will be starting this right after the X792 timeskip.  If you are not there in either the anime or manga, spoilers ahead.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeet you!  Your name is Andrew \"Andy\" Valencia, and you are a Water Dragon Slayer.  You are about 5'11\", and are lean, muscular and quite attractive.  (Think of Sting.)  Your hair is a dark blue and quite spiky.  Just like all Dragon Slayers, your canine teeth are much more pronounced than normal humans, and you get quite motion sick, though not quite at a Natsu level.  Your usual clothing consists of an open vest, shorts, and a pair of running shoes.  You also always wear a bracelet that was left when Hydronis, your dragon dad, \"disappeared\".  It's brass and can protect you from black magic, like Natsu's scarf.  Always with you is your Exceed friend, Johnny.  Johnny looks like your typical exceed, and has a similar demeanor to Happy.  However, Johnny is much more forward thinking than Happy.  (They would be great friends though...)  Johnny typically wears a similar vest to you, and a small backpack.  You are also biologically 18 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour personality is as follows.  You are somewhat of the strong, silent type.  This is because you've never really interacted with others aside from your dragon dad and Johnny.  You are quite timid and somewhat reluctant to join Fairy Tail.  However, your father, Hydronis, said that you should find the son of Igneel, who you knew was part of Fairy Tail.  Hydronis came out of your body to help defeat Tartaros like all the other dragons, but never seemed to interact with any others.  When he returned to you, he told you to find Natsu, because the two of you would be able to defeat a much greater evil to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHydronis was the king of the Water Dragons, similar to how Igneel was the king of the Fire Dragons.  Despite the opposing elements, the two got along very well.  However, once Natsu was taken in by Igneel, and you by Hydronis, they stopped talking.  Hydronis wants to fix this mistake by having you join Fairy Tail.  Besides, a guild with 4 first generation Dragon Slayers and a second generation Dragon Slayer is not a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you were raised by the king of Water Dragons, your magic is not shabby.  You are basically the Natsu of water.  (I'm going to be using him to compare).  If you and Natsu fought, it would probably end in a draw.  You use all of the normal skills that Dragon Slayers use, (Roar, Wing Slash, Claw, etc.) but you have your own unique ones.  Your \"Dragon Slayer Secret Arts\" include Beam of the Water Dragon, where a powerful beam of water shoots out of your hand, and Shield of the Water Dragon, where you create a bubble of water to protect anyone in it.  You are also able to create drinking water, and can change the temperature of water that you use.  Your standard temperature is a comfortable 70 degrees Fahrenheit, but you can go anywhere from 32 to 212.  Basically, you can make water of any temperature that water can be in its liquid form.  One thing that makes you unique is that, through rigorous training, you were able to achieve the ability to use Dragon Force at will, but it is very taxing, and you save it for only the toughest of battles.  As a Dragon Slayer, you also have heightened senses and physical attributes.  While Natsu has a great sense of smell and Cobra can hear basically anything, you have as perfect vision as you can have.  Your best sense is vision.  You are also quite physically strong, being able to lift a tree when it fell on Johnny during one of your training mishaps.  You are also quite fast and agile.  Johnny is also able to fly you places considering he's an exceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther things to note about you is that temperatures really do not bother you.  Unless it is a blizzard or an extreme heat wave, you are fine.  It helps that you can cool off very easily.  You also usually carry a bag of water with you just in case your magic power runs too low and you need some water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, that's all I can think of about Andy.  I made this so when people add to this, the story can stay consistent.  If you want to add to this story, by all means!  Just be consistent and keep it in the second person.  (Refer to Andy as You).  Anyway, there's an adventure waiting!  Onward to Adventure!!!!!</span></div></div>",

I will be setting this in an alternate timeline where Fairy Tail was never disbanded, but instead put on hiatus.  After the one year, Makarov comes back and everything is normal.  It works better for the story that I want to tell.  With that off of my chest, on with the story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, the woods can be peaceful.  Other times, not so much.\"  You said, lying on a small mat you use as a bed.  \"I have a strange feeling today is not going to be a peaceful day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it, not me!\"  Johnny replied happily, a small fish tail sticking out of his mouth.  \"I just want to get to Magnolia already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon Johnny.\"  You assured your partner/best friend.  \"I just hope my feelings aren't justified.  Anyway, I need some water for my pack.  I'll be back in a bit!\"  You left Johnny at your campsite to walk over to a river.  The water was crystal clear, and your reflection showed your somewhat disheveled face.  It's been a week since you saw any kind of civilization, and you desperately wanted a place to stay.  Camping in the woods had lost its merit after all the years.  As you were reaching into the river to collect water for pack, you saw a couple of figures approaching.  You could clearly see 5 people, all in their late twenties, running towards you.  They did not seem of the friendly type either.  \"Huh.  I guess I was right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!  WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON OUR TURF!\"  One of them, presumably the leader, yelled.  \"THESE WOODS ARE PROPERTY OF GHOST SHADOW!\"  You let them get closer so you can have a somewhat civilized conversation with them, despite your social anxiety.  You can tell that these are the only people in the area, so Johnny is safe.  Besides, you did teach him some offensive magic just in case you weren't there to defend him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is Ghost Shadow?  Never heard of them.\"  You said as they approached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dark guild that's going to beat you!\"  One yelled as he threw a punch directly at your face.  You casually reached your hand up to block the punch, which startled the fighter.  \"Boss, he blocked my punch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not very smart, are you?\"  You asked angrily.  \"All I want to do is pass through these woods on the public path.  Last I checked, these woods are controlled by the Kingdom of Fiore.  If you are not affiliated with them, you have no right to say you own these woods.\"  As you finished, you returned a strong punch, knocking the attacker out instantly.  \"Is this your whole guild?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  You have a problem with that?\"  The man you presumed to be the leader answered, somewhat timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do actually.\"  You replied angrily.  \"If you don't leave in the next five seconds, I will destroy your existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I listen to you?  You may have beaten one of our guys, but you can't beat all four of us at once!\"  The leader yelled cockily.  \"Come on guys!\"  All four members charged at you, magic ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be too easy.\"  You muttered to yourself, as one of the attackers hit you in the side with a bolt of magic.  It did not faze you at all.  \"You want to fight?  Try attacking!\"  You taunted as you punched the ground.  Doing so activated your best close range attack.  \"Explosion of the Water Dragon!\"  You yelled as a large sphere of scalding hot water surrounded your body, engulfing the entire guild.  As soon as the water dissipated, you noticed you were surrounded by 5 unconscious men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andy?  Did I miss something?\"  Johnny asked out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Johnny, I got into a bit of a scuffle.\"  You smiled, showing off your large canine teeth.  \"No big deal.  Let's get ready to go.  I think Magnolia is close by!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny, could you fly up to see if you can see Magnolia?\"  You asked your best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.  Be right back!\"  He responded happily.  As he was flying up, he collided with a strange blue object.  Both Johnny and the blue thing fell down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny!  Are you okay?\"  You yelled, holding your friend in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just hit something.  Probably a bird.\"  Johnny replied with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  What was that about!\"  Someone yelled.  You turned to your side to see a blue cat-like animal.  \"Why did you hit me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another exceed?\"  You muttered in confusion.  \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Happy!\"  Happy replied.  \"I just was trying to find some fish when he bumped into me!\"  Happy pointed at Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I was just trying to see if I could spot Magnolia.  We're looking for a very important person!\"  Johnny said, trying to make amends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?  I know a lot of people in Magnolia!  I live there!\"  Happy replied happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dad's dying wish was for me to find Natsu Dragneel.\"  You explained.  \"Do you know him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Happy could even answer, another person appeared.  He seemed to be a muscular young man with reddish-pink spiky hair.  \"Happy!  Is this where you fell?\"  He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye!\"  He replied.  \"Natsu, I think this person wants to meet you!\"  Right as you heard Natsu's name, you fell on your knees and cried.  \"Hey?  Are you okay?\"  Happy asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  I'm just happy.\"  You answered crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm Happy!\"  Happy interrupted with genuine anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy, he means he feels happy!\"  Johnny corrected.  \"Andy's dad, Hydronis, said that Andy needed to find the guild Fairy Tail and meet Natsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here he is!\"  Happy yelled as Natsu arrived at the site of the air collision.  Immediately, Natsu approached you and asked if you were okay.  You explained the whole story, including how Hydronis was your dragon dad, how he came out of your body, and his final wish.  Eventually, you stopped crying and got to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I found you already!\"  You panted.  \"I'm just too happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good!\"  Natsu laughed.  \"Do you need a place to stay?  I know some inns here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great!\"  You responded.  \"I was actually wondering if I could join Fairy Tail.  That was also part of Hydronis's wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not up to me.  You'll have to talk to Gramps about that.\"  Natsu laughed.  \"Come on!  I'll take you there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Natsu, fish!\"  Happy interjected worriedly.  \"We're out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can get some after we take this guy to the guild!\"  Natsu assured Happy.  \"By the way, who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Andrew Valencia.  Most people call me Andy.\"  You replied.  \"I'm a Water Dragon Slayer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Johnny, his best friend.\"  Johnny interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, my dad and your dad used to be good friends, but after they took us in, they grew distant.  All my dad wants now is for us to make amends and be friends.  What do you say?\"  You asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't we be friends!\"  Natsu asked with genuine confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, fire and water are not known to pair well.\"  You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any friend on Igneel's is a friend of mine!  Come on!\"  Natsu smiled.  The four of you started running off to Magnolia, where the real adventure of your life will begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Chapter. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before this begins, I would like to clarify something.  This story that I am writing takes place in such a way that the time skip happens after Tartaros, and it is X792, but this story takes place instead of Avatar and Alvarez Empire.  With that out of the way, enjoy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe City of Magnolia.  Your entire goal for one year was to reach this place and find Natsu Dragneel.  Well congratulations, you managed to do both at the same time.  Walking down the streets made you simultaneously feel nervous and excited.  Interacting with people was never your strength, and the sheer amount of people in Magnolia almost gave you a panic attack.  This is the first time you've been to a \"big city\".  The farther you walked down the streets and the more you talked to Natsu, the more comfortable you felt.  Eventually, you made it to an intersection.  To your left, you could see Magnolia's pride and glory, Kardia Cathedral.  To your right, you could make out a large building that said Fairy Tail on it.  In front of you were just a couple of shops.  Most notably a small, but historical bakery.  (Watch Fairy Tail Zero).  Obviously, you turned right.  Using your keen vision, you spot the doors to the guild opening, and a blond teenage girl walking out.  It looked like she had a whip and a small pouch attached at her waist, and a small purse around her shoulder.  You thought nothing of it and continued forward to the guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Natsu noticed the girl, and quickened his pace.  \"LUCY!  THERE'S SOMEONE I WANT YOU TO MEET!\"  He hollered.  By the end of this, he was at a full sprint.  This caught you off guard, and you raced after him.  Happy and Johnny didn't even bother trying to keep up.  \"Lucy.  Meet Andy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Andy.\"  The girl, presumably Lucy, said happily, presenting her hand for a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.  I'm assuming your Lucy.\"  You responded timidly, completing the hand shake.  \"Are you one of Natsu's friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  We go on jobs together a lot.\"  Lucy smiled.  \"We never get anything out of them though.  Natsu usually ends up destroying everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M RIGHT HERE!\"  Natsu yelled angrily.  \"Besides, it's not my fault cities are so flammable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not going to be setting Hargeon on fire in the near future.  I'm a Water Dragon Slayer.\"  You joked, trying to ease the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised your getting along with Natsu then.\"  Lucy replied with a somewhat shocked expression on her face.  \"Considering how you get along with Gray...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because our dads were friends.\"  Natsu interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!  That's so cool!\"  Lucy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason rubbed off on you a bit, didn't he.\"  Happy said out of nowhere.  It seemed that the exceeds had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, are you interested in joining Fairy Tail?\"  Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  My dad asked me to.  He kind of appeared out of my body and told me to find Natsu and join Fairy Tail.  Weird right?\"  You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Not weird at all.  Igneel came out of my body and fought Acnologia.\"  Natsu's happiness went away.  \"It didn't end well for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moving on.  If you're part of Fairy Tail, then you're a wizard.\"  You deduced.  \"What kind of magic do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a celestial spirit mage!\"  Lucy replied happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  You became very interested.  \"I've always wanted to meet one.  My dad, Hydronis, used to tell me bedtime stories about the celestial spirits.  He said that if I was a good boy, I would get to meet them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Andy, it seems that you've been good.\"  Lucy smiled.  She reached for the pouch and took out a golden key.  \"Gate of the Lion, I open Thee!  Loke!\"  Immediately, a young man with orange spiky hair, blue tinted sunglasses and a suit appeared.  \"Andy, this is Loke, or Leo more formally.\"  You were speechless.  This was a goal of yours for much longer than making it to Magnolia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\"  Loke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I've always wanted to meet a celestial spirit.\"  You calmed yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here I am in the flesh!\"  Loke laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to need to stick around you Lucy.\"  You smiled.  \"I can't wait to meet more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, we even go to the celestial spirit world.\"  Lucy smiled.  \"The King refers to me as an \"old friend\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.\"  You said.  You just stood there gawking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you just broke Andy.\"  Johnny laughed.  \"Oh, I'm Johnny!  Andy's best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my new friend!\"  Happy interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's always good to make friends.\"  Lucy said.  \"Anyway, I have to get something from my place.  I'll be at the guild in a bit.  Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Lucy.  Bye Loke!\"  Natsu yelled as the two left.  \"Anyway, let's get you into Fairy Tail!\"  The four of you started walking towards the guild hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's Fairy Tail.  Ready?\"  Natsu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  I'm ready.\"  You opened the doors and came across what looked like a large bar.  There was a bar full of drinks, tables where people could sit and eat, and a large cork board with small papers on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everyone, I have a Fairy Tail hopeful!\"  Natsu yelled.  Immediately, the room erupted in a roar of celebration.  You could even hear a couple of girls comment on your looks.  As the roar died down, a small old man started walking towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsu, why is it that new members always seem to be brought here by you?\"  The man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"  He asked.  \"Oh Andy, this is the master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\"  You said timidly.  Your social anxiety seemed to be kicking in.  \"I'm Andrew Valencia.  I'm a Water Dragon Slayer.  And this is Johnny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're very familiar with dragon slayers.  You'll be number 5.  And Johnny will be exceed number 4.\"  The master said.  \"Oh, and I'm Makarov, the master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I call you?\"  You aksed.  \"Master, Makarov, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you feel comfortable with.\"  He replied with a smile.  \"Anyway, what makes you want to join Fairy Tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my dad, Hydronis, said that I needed to become Natsu's friend to make amends with Igneel.  He and Igneel were good friends, but grew distant over time.  He wants to close that gap.  He thought that the best way to become his friend is to join the same guild as him.  Basically, my dad's dying wish was for me to join Fairy Tail.\"  You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's no arguing with that one.  Where do you want your guild mark, and in what color?\"  Makarov asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about dark blue, like my hair.\"  You replied.  \"And right here!\"  You pointed to your right shoulder.  Makarov pointed his finger at your shoulder, and the Fairy Tail insignia appeared on your shoulder.  \"Wow!  I'm in!\"  You almost started crying again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\"  Johnny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that depends.  Where do you want yours?\"  Makarov asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my back, and in the same blue as Andy!\"  Johnny replied excitedly.  Immediately, the guild mark appeared on Johnny's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVERYONE LISTEN UP!\"  Makarov yelled.  The entire room went silent.  \"MEET THE TWO NEWEST MEMBERS OF FAIRY TAIL!  ANDREW VALENCIA AND...\"  He paused.  \"What's your name?\"  He asked Johnny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny.\"  Johnny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JOHNNY!\"  Makarov finished.  The room erupted in a loud roar.  Everyone was yelling and cheering.  People were coming up to you and introducing themselves to you.  After person 20, you started to feel more comfortable, like the social anxiety was being drained out of you.  Eventually one person introduced herself, and you broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!  I'm Mirajane Strauss.  Pleasure to meet you!\"  Mirajane smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.  I'm Andy.  Pleasure to meet you too.\"  You replied, very flustered.  It seems that you now have a crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem a little worked up.\"  Mira stated.  \"You should come over and have a drink.  That should loosen the tensions.\"  You followed her over to the bar, where she made you a drink.  \"This one's on the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  You smiled, taking the drink.  \"So, where does everybody live?  Are there Fairy Tail apartments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"  She nodded.  \"Talk to the master about that one.  So tell me about yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is she interested in me?</i>  You thought, panic stricken.  You started looking around for Johnny.  Eventually, you spotted him talking to the other exceeds.  You decided to sit this one out.  \"Well, I'm a Water Dragon Slayer.  I've basically spent my whole life wandering from town to town, trying to find fulfillment in life.  The only constants were my magic and Johnny, my best friend.\"  You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did meet Johnny.  He's so cute!\"  She said.  \"What made you join Fairy Tail?\"  You decided to tell the whole story about Hydronis and Igneel, your conversation with him last year, and your run-in with Natsu.  \"Neat.  If you have any questions about the Guild, then just find me!\"  She smiled again.  You were definitely in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\"  You paused.  \"Thanks for the drink.  I think I should get my room and board situation settled.  It was nice talking to you!\"  You got up and headed over to the master.  Unbeknownst to you, Mira had some interest in you.  \"Ummm...  Master?  What's the deal with where I live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's Fairy Fields, the boy's dorms.\"  He replied.  \"Would you like a room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see any other options for me at the moment...\"  You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  The rent is 100,000 jewel per month.  If you get good jobs, that shouldn't be too difficult.\"  The master explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.  Johnny and I will do that.\"  You smiled.  It seemed as though your life was finally coming together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Chapter</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, after what felt like hours of being social, you had some alone time.  Even though you were feeling more comfortable as the time went on, enough was enough.  Now, you have some peace and quiet, and a room all to yourself.  No more sleeping on a mat in a tent.  You finally had a place to call your own.  The best way to describe your new home would be a studio apartment.  There was one main room with a bed, a sofa, chairs and a table, a kitchenette and a closet.  There was a small bathroom on the side as well.  It was quite spacious, which comforted you.  The confines of a tent were a thing of the past!  As you put the backpack containing all of your belongings down, you made a sigh of relief.  For some reason, your mind chose now to realize that you were an official member of Fairy Tail.  The magnitude of this realization made you feel an odd combination of worry and relief.  You worried that you wouldn't find your place in the guild, but simultaneously felt that you shouldn't be worrying.  To ease your mind, you decided to take a shower.  Your first one in quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing calms you like the feeling of water on your skin.  As a Water Dragon Slayer, this was your element.  The shower refreshed you, and immediately made you think about how you would customize your room.  You knew that you needed a bed for Johnny, who was waiting for you to finish your shower.  After you dried off, you put on the only clean clothes you had, your usual vest, shorts and shoes.  \"You were in there for quite a while Andy!\"  Johnny laughed.  \"Contemplating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that.\"  You smiled.  \"I was thinking about how we're really part of a guild!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gave that away?\"  Johnny responded with snark, pointing at your guild mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean like that!\"  You yelled.  \"There are a lot of responsibilities of a guild member.  Plus, we need money...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we get a job!\"  Johnny suggested happily.  \"I saw a bunch on the cork board in the main guild building!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea.  Maybe we'll be able to get more clothes and stuff for the room!\"  You smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or pay the rent...\"  Johnny muttered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.  Let's get a job!\"  You yelled happily.  You opened the door and were startled by what greeted you on the other side.  It was Gray Fullbuster.  \"Hi Gray.\"  You said, a bit flustered.  While you were meeting people in the guild hall before, Gray was one of the people you bonded with the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Andy.\"  He responded.  \"Could you keep the volume down a bit.  You were being particularly loud just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\"  You said sincerely.  \"Wait, if you could hear me.  Are we neighbors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Funny how that one worked out.\"  Gray laughed.  \"Just keep it down.  You were louder than Natsu, which is quite the accomplishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  You laughed.  \"You know, I'm thinking about going on my first job now.  Wanna come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Gray replied.  \"I can show you the ropes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\"  You smiled a big, happy smile.  You and Gray walked to the Guild Building together, Johnny following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  Reading job postings is simple.  There's a description of the job on the slip, along with the reward.  When you see a job you want, you bring it up to either the Master or Mira, who will take care of the rest.  Then, you head out and do the job.  Simple right?\"  Gray explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I guess.\"  You said hesitantly.  \"You said Mira right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...  Why?\"  Gray asked confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason.\"  You quickly answered, trying to hide your feelings for Mira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.  You've been a member of the guild for only a couple of hours and you already have a crush.\"  Gray laughed, poking fun at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\"  You started.  \"What's wrong with that?  Have you ever heard of 'Love at first sight'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  I'm all too familiar with it.\"  Gray muttered.  Immediately, a blue haired girl appeared behind you and Gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gray-sama!  I'm back!\"  She yelled, completely ignoring you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Juvia.\"  Gray muttered.  \"Juvia, I'd like you to meet Andy Valencia.  He's new to the guild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Hi.  I'm Juvia Lockser.\"  Juvia smiled with an outstretched arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you already know my name...\"  You said, completing the handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Johnny!  Andy's best friend!\"  Johnny yelled out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Hi!  I didn't see you!\"  Juvia laughed.  \"Anyway Andy, what kind of magic do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a Water Dragon Slayer.\"  You answered timidly, your social anxiety coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also use water.  How about that.\"  Juvia laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.  That is interesting.  I can't wait to see what you do with water!\"  You smiled, feeling more comfortable around the water mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same!\"  Juvia smiled.  \"Anyway.  I MISSED YOU GRAY-SAMA!!!\"  She yelled, hurting the ears of everyone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were gone for one day!\"  Gray yelled back.  \"That should not be enough time to start missing someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was!\"  Juvia yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.  I'm about to go on a job with Andy here.  Show him the ropes.\"  Gray said, trying to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come?  I can't stand to be away from you.\"  Juvia begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This specifically asks for two people.\"  Gray answered, trying his hardest not to say no directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll miss you Gray-sama.\"  Juvia frowned, almost crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Gray responded without emotion.  \"C'mon Andy.\"  Gray started towards Mira, you and Johnny following.  \"Hey Mira.  I'm taking Andy on his first job.  Should be a quick one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  You'll be going to Clover Town for this one.  The train will leave in about 10 minutes.  Have fun Andy!\"  Mira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mira.\"  You responded nervously, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we have no time to waist.  Let's go!\"  Gray smiled, rushing out the door without his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRAY!  YOUR SHIRT!\"  You yelled, holding his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has a problem with keeping clothes on.\"  Mira laughed.  \"I'd suggest not questioning it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the warning.\"  You smiled, chasing after Gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT FOR ME!\"  Johnny yelled, running after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train ride was the closest thing to torture you've ever experienced.  Your dragon slayer motion sickness got the best of you, leaving you a queasy mess.  \"Well, at least you're not as bad as Natsu.\"  Gray laughed.  \"He'd be one step from death right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he's not?\"  Johnny asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  This is normal for dragon slayers.\"  Gray responded.  \"No idea why though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will he be okay?\"  Johnny continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  He'll be fine.  Have you never rode in a carriage or anything before?\"  Gray asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  We've just wandered everywhere.  We're not originally from Fiore.  We came here once Andy's dad, Hydronis, told him to join Fairy Tail.\"  Johnny explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he want Andy to join Fairy Tail?\"  Gray asked.  Johnny then explained the story of Hydronis and Igneel, and Hydronis's dying wish.  \"Wow.\"  Gray responded surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Deep.\"  Johnny responded.  \"Are we almost there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should be.\"  Gray answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEXT STOP, CLOVER TOWN!\"  The voice on the train boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, next stop.\"  Gray smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God!\"  Johnny said, relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, the torture finished.  With help from Johnny and Gray, you disembarked the train, and proceeded to your job.  Once you got to the address on the job, you were greeted by the client.  His name was Eric Idleson, an aristocrat living in Clover.  You must be Mr. Idleson.\"  Gray started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you must be the Fairy Tail wizards who took on my request.\"  He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are.\"  Gray responded.  \"What do you need us to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there have been reports of some Gorians in the forests.  We were hoping that you could deal with them.\"  Eric explained.  \"Also, please try not to destroy the forest again.  We had enough problems rebuilding after Lullaby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  Natsu and Erza aren't here, so that shouldn't be an issue.\"  Gray laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  But still try.\"  Eric demanded.  \"Damage the forest, no reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.  Andy, Johnny, let's go.\"  Gray said.  As you left the house, Gray started to look worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Gray?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't talk much.  Do you?\"  Gray asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um...\"  You hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johnny's not good around new people.  We're working on it though.\"  Johnny explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  You confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want to do jobs well, you're gonna need some better communication skills.\"  Gray said sternly.  \"Anyway, let's beat up some Gorians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I can get behind.\"  You smiled.  \"I've been attacked by a lot in my travels.  They never stood a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good to hear.\"  Gray smiled.  \"Can't stand those things either.\"  The three of you continued talking as you walked into the forest, looking for Gorians to beat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Chapter</span></div></div>",

You've encountered many of these things during your travels, and each one was easier than the last.  After all, you got stronger over time, and they didn't.  \"Gray.  I see one.\"  You said, smiling.  \"I haven't fought one of these in a while.  Should be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun?  These things are more annoying than fun.\"  Gray quibbled.  \"Easy, but annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've never lasted long enough with me to be annoying.\"  You snickered.  \"Just watch.\"  You could see the Gorian approaching you at quite quickly.  You simply pointed your hand towards it like you were telling it to stop.  \"Beam of the Water Dragon.\"  You said at your normal talking volume.  Instantly, a magic circle appeared in front of your hand, from which a narrow, but strong beam of water shot.  The beam collided with the Gorian's chest, causing the large green ape-like creature to fly up and into a mountain several hundred yards away.  You could tell it was dead.  \"See what I mean?\"  You asked Gray, who was awestruck from the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I've ever seen one go down so quickly.\"  Gray said, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andy is really really strong!\"  Johnny yelled, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have killed it though...\"  You smirked.  \"Oops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one less Gorian in the world won't hurt, will it?\"  Gray said, shrugging it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it won't!\"  Johnny smiled.  \"Hate those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  You agreed.  \"I've battled more Gorians than I can count.  It's what happens when you used to live in forests.  Camping 24/7.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, let's let the next one approach so we can get some information.  Gorians love talking.\"  Gray started.  \"Your attack made Natsu seem patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing that's not good.\"  You laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  It's not.\"  Gray laughed.  As this short conversation finished, 3 more Gorians appeared, startling the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOH!  LOOK!\"  One of the Gorians yelled.  \"PEOPLE TO TAKE OVER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not supposed to say it outright!\"  The middle Gorian chided.  \"They're not supposed to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.  Sorry.\"  The first Gorian muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, while you two are fighting, can I ask you a question?\"  Gray demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whataya want?\"  The middle Gorian sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many Gorians are here in this forest?\"  You demanded.  \"Or better, how many do I have to defeat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the three of us and one more.\"  The middle Gorian answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So three.\"  You smiled.  \"One's already fallen by my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've already attacked?  How could you!\"  The third Gorian yelled, starting to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was charging toward us.\"  You smiled cockily.  \"And you're next.\"  You rushed up to the Gorian and punched it directly in the stomach.  It immediately curled up and fell limp on the ground.  \"Don't worry!  I didn't kill this one!\"  You laughed.  \"Your turn Gray!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ice-Make Lance!\"  Gray shouted, extending his arms forward.  A large barrage of pointed lances of Ice shot from his hands, impacting the other two Gorians.  When the barrage was over, the two Gorians were unconscious.  \"Andy, here in Fairy Tail, we try our hardest not to kill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, my Beam attack sometimes goes a bit overboard.\"  You laughed, apologizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.  Let's just get these things out and get our reward.\"  Gray said, picking up one of the Gorians.  You could only pick up one, and you knew Johnny couldn't carry one.  Not knowing what you do, you used your magic to launch the last one into the mountains when Gray wasn't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, got this one.  Let's go!\"  You said, ignoring the fact that you sent the other Gorian flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the third one?\"  Gray asked, turning around to see the last one missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....  I made it go away.  It should be fine.\"  You laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just gonna pretend that didn't happen.\"  Gray sighed.  \"You're like a watery version of Natsu.  Using your brawn before your brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If someone's willing to teach me a more strategic way to do things, I would.\"  You laughed, trying to make some light in the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want strategy, find the First Master.  Sometimes she appears.\"  Gray laughed.  \"Anyway, let's get our reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk back was particularly uninteresting.  Aside from the two unconscious Gorians on your back occasionally moving, nothing happened.  After a while, you made it to the town, where the reward was waiting.  you told Eric that you'd gotten rid of the Gorians with only a couple of trees retaining minor damages.  He was impressed, and paid each of you 200,000 Jewel.  This was more money than you'd ever had at one time.  Needless to say, you were excited to get back.  You deposited the Gorians somewhere they would not be any trouble for the people of Clover, and headed back to Magnolia.  While you were in town, you bought some new clothes, some decor for your apartment, and a small bed for Johnny.  After your shopping spree, you still had about 30,000 Jewel left.  The master said that your first payment would be at the end of the month.  You still had 23 days to get 170,000 Jewel.  If every job was as easy and lucrative as the last one, you should have no problem making enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting away all of your stuff, you went back to the guild hall.  It was nighttime now, so not many people were there.  The only people who were there were Natsu, Happy, Lucy, Erza, Gray, Wendy, Carla, the Master and Mira.  The Master looked to be talking to everyone while Mira was closing up the bar.  \"Andy!  Johnny!  How was your first Job?\"  Mira asked from across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It went well.  Thanks for asking!\"  You answered, approaching the bar.  As you got closer, the blushing in your cheeks became more prominent.  \"How was your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good!\"  Mira responded smiling.  \"Same as any other day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you do all day?\"  You asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I work the bar, serve and make food.  That kind of stuff.\"  Mira started.  \"Whenever there's an emergency though, I fight.  I might not look it, but I'm one of the strongest mages in Fairy Tail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  You asked, smiling.  \"What do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take Over with different demons.  I'm a really different person when using my magic.\"  Mira replied.  \"They're really strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to see them in action!\"  You said excitedly.  \"Living alone, aside from Johnny, all my life has made me very curious and excited to see new magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hope you'll never be in a place where you'll need to see my magic.\"  Mira laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if it's for emergencies only.\"  Your smile died down a bit.  \"What's going on over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  the Master is giving them a mission.  It's supposed to be secret.\"  Mira answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess I shouldn't be here.\"  You laughed.  \"I'll go.  It was nice talking to you Mira!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too Andy!\"  Mira said, smiling.  You really were not sure what to do to further your relationship, because you wanted to.  You've never felt the way you do near Mira before, and you like it.  Maybe you'll ask her out on a date soon.  Who knows?  As you and Johnny were leaving the guild hall, you felt a tap on your shoulder.  You turned around and saw Happy flying behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andy!  Gramps told me to get you!\"  Happy smiled happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he want me?\"  You asked confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\"  Happy yelled.  You and Johnny turned around and entered the group of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andy.  Johnny.  Now that you're here, I would like to explain what is happening.\"  The Master said, taking a piece of paper out of his coat.  He unrolled it on a table, revealing a map of Crocus.  \"There have been rumors of some suspicious activity going on in Crocus.  We got a request directly from Princess Hisui to sort it out.  Not much is known about it.  For some reason, Hisui requested you guys specifically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I fit into this?\"  You asked.  \"I doubt she asked for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she didn't.  Gray did.\"  The Master replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After seeing what you did in the forest, I thought that you'd work in our group's dynamic.\"  Gray explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, we need someone to put out the inevitable flames.\"  Erza said, looking at Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"  Natsu yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\"  Erza yelled, frightning Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we want to make sure everything is okay in Crocus, and make sure the Royal Family is safe.\"  The Master finished.  \"Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"  Everyone said almost in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll leave tomorrow.  I hope everything goes well.\"  The Master added.  After that, everyone dispersed, going to their various residences.  As you were walking out, you felt another pat on the shoulder.  This time it was Mira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're part of a team now.\"  She smiled.  \"And that one of all teams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're notorious for their...\"  She paused.  \"Destructive nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I can help.\"  You laughed.  \"Water does help keep the fires down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Mira smiled.  \"I was wondering if you wanted to go out?  Celebrate your joining Fairy Tail and your first mission.\"  You were screaming with joy inside.  You couldn't believe this was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  I'd love to!\"   You replied excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll meet you in the apartment.\"  Johnny yawned.  \"I'm going to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya there!\"  You said happily.  Mira was asking you out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know a good place.  Let's go!\"  Mira suggested, grabbing your arm and heading towards the location of your date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Chapter</span></div></div>",

I also never mentioned that your eyes are a seafoam green</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira basically dragged you to Yajima's restaurant in Magnolia, 8-Island.  It was a nice looking restaurant, albeit a bit small.  You were excited though.  You were out with Mirajane Strauss!  You were having a hard time keeping your composure, especially because Johnny wasn't there to keep your mind balanced.  You were, for now, functional.  As you walked in, you were immediately greeted by a short man wearing a large chef's hat.  \"Hi Yajima-san!\"  Mira happily said to the man.  \"I want you to meet the newest member of Fairy Tail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, how do you do?\"  Yajima answered.  \"I'm Yajima.  I used to be a member of the Magic Council and Fairy Tail, but those days are long gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Andrew Valencia.\"  You stammered timidly.  \"But most people call me Andy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about him.\"  Mira smiled.  \"He's a bit shy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\"  Yajima nodded.  \"Well, would you two like a table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be lovely!\"  Mira smile continued.  \"By the way, the renovations are great.  I'm glad you were able to rebuild after last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened last year?\"  You asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\"  Yajima sighed.  \"Are you familiar with Tartaros?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.  I think my dad mentioned it last year.\"  You started.  \"My dad is, er.. was a dragon.  Hydronis, King of the Water Dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he probably helped stopped Face from going off.\"  Yajima started.  \"Last year, Tartaros tried to activate a weapon called Face.  If it went off, it would destroy all magic on the entire continent.  To activate it, they tried to kill every current and former member of the Magic Council.  Me included.  They destroyed this place, and almost got me.  Thankfully, the Raijinshuu (Thunder God Tribe) were here and saved me.  Since then, I've been slowly rebuilding this place.  Now it's back open!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have to fight during this?\"  You asked Mira, knowing from your walk that she doesn't like to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  But I was in my element.\"  Mira answered.  \"Tartaros was populated by demons from the Books of Zeref.  I have demon particles in my blood, hence my magic.  It was a fitting fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could have helped.\"  You sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dad did though.  You should be proud of that at least.\"  Yajima said, trying to cheer you up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  At least he did that.\"  You started to smile.  \"Let's just sit and eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we came here!\"  Mira smiled.  Yajima handed you and Mira menus.  As you were looking through the choices, you notice that they were a bit out of budget for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if I'm going to get much.  I'm low on cash.\"  You said with your head buried in the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay!  I'll pay!\"  Mira smiled.  \"I'm sure you spent a lot on stuff after your job.  You needed stuff, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I did want to have more than 3 shirts.\"  You and Mira laughed and talked for a while, before ordering your food.  You decided to get the Beast Man Curry, seeing how you like spicy food.  Mira got the Blue Sky Bolognese, something you were thinking of getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I've told you this Andy.\"  Mira smiled.  \"This restaurant specializes in preparing food with magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!\"  Your magic curiosity senses were tingling.  \"Is there a way to see it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  There's a window into the kitchen to watch the food being prepared.\"  Mira laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I look for a bit?\"  You asked, seeing how you didn't want to interrupt your date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  I need to go to the bathroom.  I'll see you in a bit.\"  She said, getting up to leave.  You darted over to the window, where you saw different ingredients floating around.  There was a pot of soup being heated up with fire magic, onions being chopped without knifes, and so much more.  It was almost like heaven for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, you heard a door open.  Assuming it was Mira, you started to walk back to the table.  However, it wasn't.  Instead, it was the front door opening to let someone in.  He was a mysterious looking man, wearing dark robes and keeping his face shrouded.  You had a bad feeling about this guy, but you did not instigate anything.  You just hoped he was another patron.  Mira came back from the bathroom as you sat down.  She too, saw the man in the robes, and had the same feeling about him.  \"I just hope this restaurant doesn't get destroyed again.\"  Mira muttered.  You saw the man standing and waiting at the host's stand.  It looked as though he was waiting for a table.  After a minute, Yajima came out of the kitchen and greeted the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!  Welcome to 8-Island!  Would you like a table?\"  Yajima said happily, though it sounded forced.  The man nodded, saying nothing.  \"How many?\"  The man held up one finger.  \"One?  I have a table right here.\"  Yajima walked the man over to a table 2 tables away from you and Mira, where he sat down and took a menu.  You felt very uneasy.  You couldn't put your finger on why, but you just knew something bad was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes passed before your food came.  A large bowl of curry was put in front of you, which you tried to eat in a civilized manner.  However, you were very hungry, so you still ate quite quickly.  Meanwhile, Mira calmly ate her bolognese.  The two of you continued talking.  Mira told you about the history of Fairy Tail, and how Mavis has been showing up a lot recently.  You hoped that you could meet her.  Maybe learn how to be strategic from the Fairy Tactician.  As you and Mira were finishing and getting ready to go, you noticed the man get up.  You thought this was fishy.  As you and Mira left, you noticed the man following you.  He continued following you until you made it to a park near the Fairy Tail building.  You looked behind you and saw the man.  You stopped, making the man stop as well.  \"Who are you?  And why are you following us?\"  You demanded.  You got no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir?  Why are you following us?\"  Mira asked much more calmly.  Still no answer.  You were feeling very confused and worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shield of the Water Dragon!\"  You yelled, waving your hand in an arching manner.  Immediately, a bubble of water surrounded you and Mira.  \"A precaution.\"  You were right to do that.  After seeing this, the man attacked with a strong blast of fire.  Thankfully, the bubble stopped it.  You took action and shot a beam of water at him, knocking him back.  Other than that , he was not very fazed by the attack.  However, the attack did knock the hood off of his head.  Oddly, it was Natsu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsu?\"  Mira asked.  \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to see how strong Andy was.  Considering how Gray described it, it got my curious!\"  Natsu explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanted to fight, then you could have just asked!\"  You yelled.  \"You didn't have to stalk us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..  I was also wondering what you and Mira were doing.\"  Natsu laughed.  Hearing this, you took a small bit of water in your hand, and made it into a whip, slapping Natsu in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you must know.  Mira took me out to celebrate my joining Fairy Tail.\"  You explained angrily.  \"Now, if you don't mind, I want to go back home and go to sleep.  It's been a long night.  If you want to fight me, then let's do it later.  Now, I'm not feeling it.\"  You finished with a yawn, dispelling the bubble.  Mira watched this whole thing laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a very Natsu thing to do.\"  She laughed.  \"Although this one was pushing it.  Don't worry, he means well.\"  She smiled as she grabbed your hand.  You finished the walk back to your apartment holding hands like a real couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you got back to your apartment, it was nighttime.  You were hoping you'd get a lot of sleep tonight, but you felt this more than made up for the sleep you were not getting.  As Mira was saying good night to you, you froze up.  \"Andy, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira.  I think I need to just come out and say it.\"  You started.  \"First of all, tonight was amazing, even after the Natsu thing.  Second, ever since I walked into the guild hall the first time, I..  I..\"  You tried to finish, but you couldn't say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had a crush on me?\"  Mira finished your sentence.  You just nodded, embarrassed.  \"Honestly, the same can be said with me.  When I saw you, I thought you'd be the one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  You asked in disbelief.  \"So I had a crush on you and you had a crush on me?\"  She nodded.  \"So, does that mean that tonight wasn't a celebration as much as it was a date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"  Mira smiled.  \"I took you out on a date!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.  One day of being a Fairy Tail mage and I'm already in a relationship.  This is awesome.\"  You smiled happily.  \"Thanks for the awesome night Mira!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too Andy!\"  She responded, initiating a hug.  You and her hugged for a solid minute before briefly kissing and going your separate ways.  This was a day you were never going to forget.  You made it up to your room, where you noticed Johnny sleeping in his new bed.  You quietly got ready to sleep, and passed out on your bed, excited for what's to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Chapter</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wake up sleepyhead!\"  Johnny yelled at you, jumping on your stomach.  \"Any longer and you'll miss the train to Crocus!\"  You slowly opened your eyes, and was greeted to your apartment.  You were happy that yesterday wasn't a dream, because it seemed too good to be true.  You were also thankful that your dream didn't come true.  Your dream, or nightmare in this case, was that Fairy Tail was abolished, and you were on your own again.  Like that could ever happen.  You smiled as you sat up in your bed.  When you slept, you usually just wore some sleeping pants, so your muscular, toned torso was on full display.  As you rubbed your 8-pack, stomach growling, you got up to shower.  There should be no reason for me, the author, to tell you why you love to shower.  You loved the feeling of water cleaning you.  It felt amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a much longer shower than necessary, you got dressed, ate some quick breakfast that you hoped wouldn't be lost on the train, and left to go to the guild hall.  It was the same as when you first arrived.  Everyone was either eating, drinking, talking, or looking for jobs.  You could see your group sitting at a table eating.  You rushed over to them, joining them at the table.  \"Okay, we're only waiting for Natsu and Happy now.\"  Erza started.  \"Figures they'd be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\"  Johnny yelled happily, trying to get over the noise of the guild hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Johnny!  Hey Andy!\"  Wendy yelled, smiling.  \"How was your dinner with Mira?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was great!\"  You smiled.  \"It turned into a bit more than a dinner though..\"  You looked over to the bar, where she was pouring drinks.  She noticed and smiled towards you.  You blushed as you turned your head back to the group.  \"Her and I both had a crush on each other, and last night, it became a real relationship.  Less than 24 hours as a Fairy Tail Mage and I already have a girlfriend!  I've never been happier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's Mira too.\"  Gray added.  \"That's impressive.  People have been trying to get with her for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, people have always said that I'm attractive.\"  You chuckled somewhat coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they're not wrong.\"  Lucy laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you children are done, we have planning to do.\"  Erza interrupted, shutting everyone up.  You could tell that she's the only reason why anything gets done in this group.  \"Once Natsu and Happy get here, we need to hurry to the train to get to Crocus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way to get there that doesn't involve trains?  My last one didn't go well.\"  You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you want to walk.\"  Erza answered sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind.\"  You sighed, lowering your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say first we talk to Hisui to get the whole scoop.\"  Lucy suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea Lucy.\"  Gray interrupted.  \"We should also find a place to stay in Crocus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Hisui will take care of that.\"  Lucy smiled.  \"Remember how she pardoned us after Natsu did his little stunt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"  Carla sighed.  \"We really need to make that one up to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did Natsu do?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"  Carla started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He almost destroyed the arena for the Grand Magic Games.\"  Wendy interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must really like you guys.\"  Johnny laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we did stop a flood of dragons from destroying the world.\"  Gray smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  All of the guilds helped with that one.\"  Erza butted in.  \"There's a lot to the story.  I'll tell you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Erza.\"  You smiled.  Another minute of banter and planning went by before Natsu and Happy arrived.  As soon as they got there, everyone got up and headed to the train station.  Erza, Gray, Lucy, Happy, Johnny and Carla all talked about what the group would do in Crocus on the train while you, Natsu and Wendy were all trying not to throw up.  Gray was right when he said it was a dragon slayer thing.  Eventually, the motion-sickness torture was over, and you arrived in Crocus.  You thought Magnolia was big until you saw Crocus.  It was huge.  You'd never seen anything like it.  There were buildings everywhere.  As you and Johnny gawked at the vastness of the city, everyone else headed towards the palace.  You were dragged there by Erza.   The palace was huge as well.  You felt so small compared to this place.  Eventually, you made it to the throne room, where a young woman with green hair was sitting.  She was in very fancy clothing.  You could tell that she was the princess.  As your group approached, she got up and walked towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairy Tail.  We've been having troubles here.\"  Hisui started.  He immediately stopped when she noticed you.  \"Who's he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Andy.  He's new to Fairy Tail, and joined our team.  He'll be useful, believe me!\"  Lucy smiled.  You whispered 'Thank You' under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, there's been a series of crimes committed here.  Every squadron of soldiers sent to investigate has come back saying that they couldn't handle it.  Seeing how you're much stronger than any of those guys, I want you to investigate these crimes.\"  She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider it done Princess!\"  Natsu yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've arranged rooms for you at an inn in town.

A guard gave you a slip of paper with the address for the inn on it as you left the palace.  When you got to the inn, you learned that you were rooming with Gray, your current closest friend in the guild.  After putting your stuff down, everyone regrouped, decided where they would look and with who, and split up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Chapter</span></div></div>",

It's noisy shouldnt be a problem to find, NOW LEAVE MY FOREST HUMAN AAHHH!\" shocked by getting screamed on I run out, as fast as possible leaving the forest I spoke to myself \"Now I haven't thanked her or that Mystogan, I will do that later than.\" I was walking through the city an old lady spoke to me \"what are you doing alone here, little child, where are your parents?\" well I'm an 8 year old (same as natsu and grey) little girl what did I expect \".... Mmmm I... My parents.. Are gone, do you know where fairy tail is?\" the lady gave me an smile full of sympathy pointing towards the building behind me, how could I not see that. \"thank you\" with that I entered the guild. I saw many people gathering around, I was stunned. An old little men greeted me \"so you've awoken at last.... Nice to see you well, child.\" I smiled since I thought he looked funny \"you know me?\" he laughed a little \"no of course not, Porlyusica showed me while you where knocked out for at least 2 days.\" 2 days, 2 days, a tear was running down my cheek \"so Sutakira was nowhere found?\" the old men nodded \"is she your mother?\" I smiled at him \"no, she is a dragon who raised me.\"<br>\r\nEveryone was silent when I felt a someone touching my left shoulder, turning me around, a pink haired boy smiled at me \"You where raised by a dragon as well, SEE GUYS IGNEEL EXISTS SEE, DRAGONS ARE STILL ALIVE!\" due to his loud roar I had to cover my ears, suddenly a white haired, a bit older than us turns towards the boy, who is now trembling \"hush hush Natsu, you shouldn't scream at a girl like that, that's not how you win there hearts.\" with that she plays with he's hair. Than a red haired girl spoke \"Mirajane leave natsu alone!\" the girl called mirajane giggled \"you stop me Erza?\" the next thing I saw was Erza holding a sword, and mira turning her hand into a demons.... They glared at each other, than natsu tapped me on the shoulder, so my attention was back to him \"erza and mira will take there time, so... Uhm.. Sorry for screaming earlier, I was a bit too much excited, learning that I'm not the only one, you know being raised by a dragon. Oh are you here to join the guild as well, we could train together?\" I nodded \"since I have nowhere else to go I might as well join...\" I was cutted of by another boy he's black haired and shirtless \"I'm gray fullbuster and I say we have enough female newbies in the guild!\" I was a bit surprised \"well than... I can.. Le....\" this time natsu broke my sentence \"shut up gray that's not your desicion!\" gray nodded \"yeah but I can make her want to leave us.\" <br>\r\nAn elder man laughed \"don't mind him, he's upset since erza and mira showed up, they pretty much destroy him, by the way I'm Makao.\" Gray grunted \"WHO CARES!\" with that he tried to punch me.... </span></div></div>",

I tried to give a friendly smile \"I don't know why you are attacking me, please stop.\" as the guild started to laugh \"hahaha Gray can't even beat a girl who doesn't even fight back hahaha.\" Gray however got all angry \"LIKE HELL I CAN'T FIGHT HER I'LL SHOW YOU! ICE MAKE LANCE!!\" as I saw 5 thin ice lances rushing towards me my reflexes caused me to use my magic as well \"Star dragons judgement punch!\" I broke the ice in front of me, running towards Gray, I quickly punch him in the face, sending him to the other side of the building, he crashed into the wooden counter, where the alcohol was. I felt my face pale \"Oh I'm.. I.. I am... Uhh.\" the whole guild starts to clap there hands and cheer \"Another strong one huh.. Seems so.... She's stronger than Gray... I'm beginning to think Gray's just to weak... Yeah maybe...\" Makarov claped only once, the whole guild was silent again \"so you are talented with magic hmmm... I guess Gray was the only one who was against you joining our family... what's your name?\" I was a bit surprised by all aren't they mad I punched him so hard? Everyone's looking at me, everyone expect from Erza, she looked away.. Trembling, who knows why? Anyway I was supposed to speak \"My name is Yumi... Just Yumi.\" Makarov nodded \"well than Yumi everyone in fairy tail is considered a part of our and therefore your Family, Gray insulted you and attacked you in the first place, so it's your choice what to do with Gray now.\" after that Makarov left the Guildhall. I looked over to Gray he was still on the ground soaked in alcohol liquid, suddenly I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder it was the girl mirajane again whispering \"go on Yumi teach him a lesson he never forget, he deserves it.\" after that I heard a boy \"Miraneeechan, we shouldn't be like this, let Gray apologize, and everything's fine.\" that was Elfman.

Whom again?\"<br>\r\nGray greatly displeased \"hey if you think I can't pull it of just say so!\" I couldn't stop smiling, which made him even more angry \"Stop smiling so silly, Yumi!\" I really tried not to but couldn't \"oh Gray you're so cute when you're angry, but no I don't think you can't pull it of Gray, I just think you should more rely on your friends, you know I'm your friend right?\" Gray was still displeased \"yeah I know... But let me do that alone alright, see you in two hours.\" he leaved the guild hall, I shrugged it of well maybe I do underestimate him... Hmmm 2 hours to kill then. I looked around I saw Cana sitting in the corner drinking her beer, since I don't drink I turn away for now, I saw Mirajane  cleaning the dishes. Yeah might as well help her than. Mira turned towards me \"oh wanna help me, thank you... Well what was with Gray, normally you go together on quests, did something happen between you two?\" I was drying the dishes \"hmm I don't know, he wanted to do that alone, maybe he thinks I stop hes fighting progress, since I normally fight the stronger enemies.\" Mira nodded \"might be so, Gray always has been proud in fighting, getting beat up by three girls, and having one of them constantly around him can hurt he's dignity?\" I never thought about that, did I hurt him by trying to help? Does he even want me as a partner or did I, well forced him into beeing a team.... Mira than stroked her chin \"or maybe... Well maybe he gets distracted when you're around.\" I looked confused to Mira \"what do you mean, distracted when I'm around?\" now Mira was the confused one \"well you maybe just haven't noticed but he might start to check you up you know?\" I didn't know what Mira is getting at \"check me up?\" Mira giggled \"oh you're so cute, well you know I pose in the sorcerer weekly magazine, exposing my more womanly parts, he might look at yours.\" still I didn't get it, Mira knew that and silently pointed at my cleavage, as I looked at my own cleavage I understood what Mira was talking about. Instantly blushing in embaressment \"what.. No.. I mean no Gray..would never.. He's like a brother to me!\" Mira smiled \"think of it your partners for 7 years now you're the woman he mostly saw while growing up, and I admit you're quite the beauty, if I where Gray I would try to make a move.\" I stood there in disbelieve as Mira winked at me \"Mira you're you're wrong Gray and I don't and never will have such an relationship understand.\" I tried to stay calm although feeling emberassed. Mira shrugged \"as I said or MAYBE I never stated that you have feelings towards each other, but interesting how much you tried to deny it though.\" I was angry at her, even though since Lisanna died Mira became a nice, kind and gentle person she still knows, how to twist my words. After a few seconds of silence Mira hugged me \"don't worry I'm just teasing, thank you for your help Yumi-Chan.\" 30 minutes past after that I looked around, I saw Levy reading a book. I decided to kill some time with her \"Levy, how are you today?\" Levy put her book aside giving me a friendly smile \"everything's fine today, Jet and Droy are out on a mission, I took a day off so I was just about to finish that book.\" I smiled back \"oh I'm sorry if I disturb you.\" as I was to leave Levy grapped my hand \"NO, no you're not disturbing Yumi, sit down please.\" I did as I was told \"you're having a day off aswell huh?\" I nodded \"well at least Gray decided that I have a day off.\" sounding more upset than I really are. Levy shoved the book further away leaning over the table towards me whispering \"soooo did anything happen between you two, Yumi?\"remembering my conversation with Mira I sighed \"not you as well, Levy please.\" levy sat back \"hmmpf well what else to talk about?\" thankfully Levy isn't pushing to talk about Gray \"what's the book about?\" I pointed towards the old book levy was reading, Levys face showed she was surprised maybe even shocked that changed quickly in a happy broadly smile \"Well its all about an ancient society before the Dragons ruled the world, its interesting it seems like they had magical guilds even back than.. It's out of the perspective of an young men who wants to become the wizard King there are even diary entrances, so that boy might have really existed, that such a book was in our library is amazing. Most time I had to spend in decipher there language and fill the non-readable words with something making sense..... It's a shame that the last sites are all gone, ripped out decades ago I think..... \"Levy goes on and on talking about the book, but it wasn't boring at all Levy was good at explaining the necessary and leaving out the stuff I don't care about, it seems she knows me pretty well. But I don't know her that much. As Levy stopped she smiled at me again \"1 hour I hope I helped you killing time Yumi.\" after a few seconds I spoke up \"I Levy you aren't just a time killer.\" Levy however shrugged \"oh I don't mind you're the first one to really listen while I explain a books story, doesn't matter why.\" that statement made me sad, even though Jet and Droy are mostly with her all the time, she seems to be lonely, I liked her talking about that book, maybe I will listen to her later again. Well what to do know Levys back reading the book, Mira is scrubbing the counter... But I don't want to talk to her right now.... Maybe talking with master Makarov he's on the roof to the upper floor. With that I walked upstairs, Makarov turned around to face me \"hmm you don't come up here often, what can I do for you, child?\" Makarov always called you child, of course everyone in fairy tail is he's \"child\" but I'm mostly called so. \"well it's about Gray do you have an idea why he wants to do the work alone?\" Makarov closed his eyes \"Well Yumi you see there is that day in every men's live he wants to prove himself, towards...himself, it has nothing to do with anything you or Gray did, it's normal, back in my young days I've done the same thing running out alone just to say, I did it I am Makarov Dreyar and I did it. So please don't waste to much on something that would have happened anyway.\" I nodded smiling to know it's probably nothing I started to hold a bit of small talk with gramps. 30 minutes later the called 2 hours are over and.... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>20 minutes later you turned to Mira \"Gray had to get permission for the quest which village was he going to?\" Mira smiled \"are you already worried, awww that's so sweet.\" I was a bit pissed \"Mira just tell me alright.\" Mira nodded \"alright, alright it's the village santia just a few miles in the west.\"<br>\r\nThat was enough information for me, th rest would my nose do to find Gray. So I walked to that village for 30 minutes, to see the village elder \"Say are you another one of fairy tail?\" I nodded \"yes, you know about the other one?\" the elder sighed \"he was so eager to attack the bandits he didn't even listen to us, we wanted to tell him that the bandit leader is a black wizard... Able to use strong death magic...\" I felt inner anger boiling inside me \"DEATH MAGIC, BLACK WIZARD, HOW IS THAT AN ORDINARY QUEST.... ONLY THE STRONGEST OF OUR GUILD SHOULD BE PUT AT THIS RISK!\" I was as loud as a dragon there, all villagers running inside there houses, the elder trembles \"I Im sorry, we don't have enough money to pay for s class wizards and we thought no one would try to help us if that's the case......\" seeing there desperately times I calmed down, without talking longer I followed Grays scent to a nearby cage, stepping inside I see its just one room, I see 12 men beated up pretty badly and one men in black clothes speaking to Gray, he is gagged and tied up in an iron cage struggling. My sharp ears help me to hear the black wizard \"So your name is Gray Fullbuster and you will stop us, well now that I took away your magic power with my drained touch spell, I guess you don't, after 2 days your magic will come back, but don't break your head in a few minutes I offer you to Zeref, be honored.\" I had to act now so I jumped out now standing in the middle of the cage, I only had to give the 12 men an deadly glare, so only the black wizards my concern. \"Oh zeref doesn't need two sacrifices in one day but he doesn't mind as well.\" he stormed towards me \"Drained touch.\" he's finger tips where covered in black shadows, if they touch me I'm done, wait only the fingertips? I stepped to my left side and grapped his arm, so he couldn't touch me. \"Is that all you've got?\" I asked him , he however smiled at me \"zeref doesn't need two sacrifices, ultimate death magic, WHISTLELING BLOW OF DEATH!\" the spell was never casted as I punched him in his face, he was down immediately, all the twelve men tried to run away, but I stopped them at the caves entrance, they where pleading \"sorry miss we didn't, he forced us, he can use death magic killing an opponent instantly, we are so sorry!\" I smiled at them \"I believe you guys, but still the magic council has to make a judgement after all, STAR DRAGONS SEALING BOND.\" with that they're tied up unable to move, I walked back into the cave bounding the \"Black wizard\" as well as taking his key to the cage. I opened the cage and removed Grays gagg \"How did you lose to him?\" Gray stayed silent looking away from me. I grapped his face and forced him to look at me \"Gray how did you lose to him?\" Gray remain silent... \"uhh than don't tell me.\" I removed he's ties freeing him as Gray spoke silently \"I didn't knew his magic he touched my back from behind draining my magic power.\" I was relieved he didn't lose in a real fight however he fell to the ground, a wizard without magic energy isn't able to move. \"well Gray shall I carry you on my back?\" Gray still looked away \"NO DON'T DO THAT!\" I rolled him over facing me again \"than stop me doing so.\" Gray was silent again, as I lifted his body on my back, I walked to the village collecting the payment and then back to the guild, shortly before arriving the city Gray spoke to me \"I heard you....\" I stopped walking \"what you heard me? What did I say and when? Gray sighed \"before you rescued me you screamed, only the strongest of our guild should be put to this risk, I guess you think I'm weak huh? Hell I can't even be mad I am pretty pathetic... Even my teammate calls me weak!\" I was in disbelieve firstly I screamed that loud, secondly he thinks that I think he's weak? I tried to explain \"look Gray I am sorry for what I said it was out of rage you see.\" Gray shrugged \"whatever.\" you entered the guild hall again hearing the people talk \"oh Yumi had to rescue the damsel in distress.... Hahaha ha.... If Gray did not have Yumi he probably wouldn't get one job done... Hahaha...\" I felt Gray grip on my shoulders tighten, as I walked to the medicine wing to lay him on one of the beds. This afternoon Natsu came back screaming as always \"IGNEEL WASN'T THERE YOU IDIOT!\" I walked back to the main room \"Natsu please calm down already ok?\" Natsu looked at me \"AYE SIR!\" well to explain Natsu always challenges others me as well, and I beat him every single time... I saw beside him a blond woman in a red dress, she looked nervously in my direction, as I walked towards her \"hello my names Yumi who are you, if I may ask?\" after that she seemed to relax a bit \"well my names Lucy Lucy hea.. Just Lucy, hehe.\" I nodded \"well welcome to the guild than Lucy.\" Lucy smiled happily \"thanks\" the rest of the day was pretty uneventful we showed Lucy around, exchanged some names on and on, in the evening before I leave the guild hall I got back to the medical wing. I saw gramps sitting by the side of Gray, even though Gray is asleep Makarov sits there watching him. I silently moved to masters side and whispered \"is everything alright master?\" gramps nodded \"if a child is hurt in any way, doesn't matter which it's a parents duty to watch them, so they prevail all suffering.\" I was relieved that we had Makarov, I knew Gray will be Allright so I decided... </span></div></div>",

She might not speak about it, but I'm sure she thinks it's her fault your in that state now.\" as my head layd on Grays body I heard his heart beat since I was turned away from Gray's face he didn't see me open my eyes. I felt him gently stroking my head \"if it is someone's fault than it's mine, I should accept that I'm weak... In comparison with her, I should forget my proudness...\" what is that fool talking about, accepting being weak? Forget your own pride? I wanted to slap him in the face for saying those things... However Makarovs voice was heard again \"Gray you shouldn't see that in that light, you know her to be stronger than you, good to accept that there are persons above yourself is important, but never let yourself give in to the pressure they've given you always try to lift the pressure to grow with them, and maybe someday over them.\" Gray stopped stroking instead his hand was now resting on my head, the room was silent for a few minutes, as Makarov spoke again \"maybe you should tell her your feelings towards her?\" Gray removed his hands \"what... What feelings gramps... Sheesh there are.. None of that never would be.. She's like a sister to me that's all.\" how came that up right now? Although I'm relieved Gray has the same opinion about us just like siblings. Gramps however sighed \"I mean about her strength and how you feel about facing her power in magic on and on... Of your shame when she brought you here on her back she might understand.\" Gray was ASHAMED when I brought him back why? Grays voice was trempling right now \"well to think all of them laughed at me... Damsel in distress.. Over the time, Yumi unknowingly gave me the reputation of being one of the weakest members in fairy tail, you think that would change if I talk with her?\" Makarov let out a little warm laugh \"that question you answered  yourself, Yumi unknowingly.. Your words Gray.\" Gray spoke \"thanks gramps I try that.\" with that Gray started to poke my cheek trying to wake me up, I not wanting to cause suspicion stayed calm for a few seconds, before taking a yawn \"hmm what's going on.. Gray.. Why do you wake me up?\" as my head was on his chest my upper body was now leaning over him, as I didn't want to push him too much into the confession he want to make I whispered \"do you want to tell me something Gray? I didn't know why but he looked to the side again not facing me, although sometimes glancing to me and instantly turning back again \"well yumi you uhhm.. You probably... Uhh... Well you want to go home to sower don't you staying here over night made you get some scent... Yeah wanted to tell you that...\" WHAT.. THAT... GRAY.. GRR I DON'T STINK DO I?, I started to sniff myself..... FUCK BUT HE SMELLS EVEN MOR BAD THEN ME... although wanting to scream I just smiled at him, giving him cold eyes \"your right Gray, I want to take a shower, next time remember me to do that before I rescue you... Oh and I wish you to get healthy soon, bye.\" so I silently stood up and slowly walked out the guild forcing myself to calm down.... Entering fairy hills I walked to my bathroom, taking that damm shower... 3 hours I scrupped my body.. Spotless, changing in new clothes I got back to the guild there I saw Natsu and Lucy rushing outside going on quest. I walked to Mira \"so those two teamed up huh?\" Mira smiled \"semms so, I wonder if they succeed, Natsu destroys to much, and Lucy might be too unexpirienced.\" noding I saw  Makarov signaling me to go upstairs, so I did, Gramps stood there \"so child, please don't be mad at Gray's commentary, you know what he really wanted to say, as you where awake the hole time.\" I don't know why but I blushed a little \"how... I.. Uh no.. I slept while you two talked.\" Makarov sighed \"Yumi I know that Gray isn't able to talk to you, about how much pressure you give him, so I decided to let him talk to me while you listen us, so please don't anger him for his stupidity.. To tell a women she stinks.\" I smiled \"you're right master, thanks for the talk.\" I walked back to Gray still laying on the bed, I saw Gray looked at me, he shifted a bit uneasy \"Yumi, I'm sorry.\" as I sat down next to him \"NO, Gray I apologize, I overreacted, I'm sorry.\" this time Gray does not look away \"thanks, for watching over me.\" happy by Grays appreciation, I let out a light giggle \"Gray I'm your teammate, of course I take care of you, dummy!\" Gray smiled and closed his eyes for a few minutes \"hmm... Could I.. Ask you for.. A glass of water.\" I smiled broadly \"of course you can.\" so I brought him a glass water \"here you go.\" I sure thought the black wizard was weak but this drained touch of his took Gray out... Tomorrow he's fit again, until that I should go speak with the others. Entering the main hall I saw Natsu and Lucy got back, Natsu grinning as always, and Lucy with her head hanging down, Natsu spoke up \"Mira daybreak quest solved!\" as I hear Lucy whispering \"without payment.\" Lucy seemed to be upset about it, Natsu and Happy don't mind. I walk to them \"HEY guys, how are you all today.\" Natsu answered \"Yumi, everything's the ordinary, I think next time you should come with us, double dragonslayer power you know, you don't have to stick around Gray.\" before I can answer I hear Lucy \"She's a dragonslayer as well?\" since Lucy never saw my magic she couldn't know, Happy then started to talk to Lucy \"AYE SIR! she's even a stronger dragonslayer than Natsu is.\" Natsu crossed he's arms \"Huh you think that but I'll show, Yumi fight with me now!\" without hesitation he tries to punch me, I evade his attack and strike back \"STAR DRAGONS BOND.\" Natsu didn't expect me to use that kind of magic, so he couldn't evade, he was tied up unable to move \"YUMI FIGHT ME FAIR, THIS IS... SILLY COME ON!\" I simply smiled down to him \"since when is it unfair to use your own magic abilities, Natsu?\" Natsu did not answer, so I assumed he can't answer. I turned towards Lucy \"well now that the noisy sounds are gone, Lucy I want you to come over, I'm sure there is someone you would love to know of. I took her hand and walked towards Levy \"Hello Levy, can you tell me more about that book you read?\" Levy was again a bit confused, by that question. \"OF COURSE!!\" a bit to enthusiastic, but well we just sat down ignoring Jet and Droy, for now. Levy however started to recap, the things she already told me for Lucy, after that the story continues... On.. And.. On, Lucy and I are completely following levys explanations and storytelling... I think for myself, maybe I should start reading... After 3 hours I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder, turning around I see Happy with a Sad look in his eyes \"Yumi... Please release... Natsu.\" my eyes widened.... I totally forget him... I rushed to him, realising my magic \"I'M SO SORRY NATSU I I.. SORRY REALLY I DIDN'T I.... sorry.....\" Natsu gave me a smile \"well at least it wasn't as bad as last time you 'forgot' about me in that forest for 2 days!\" I turned my head down whispering \"sorry...\" I did torment him unknowingly just like I torment Gray, I really am a bad person... Then suddenly I felt Natsu hugging me \"it's alright I'm not mad at you, just please don't do that to often, alright?\" he hugged me, even after I did this many times.... He was forgiving towards me, I hugged him back tightly \"I promise I won't do it to often, I'm sorry Natsu.\" after a few seconds we stopped hugging \"Alright than Yumi, see ya tomorrow.\" Natsu leaved the guild hall, I however walked up to Mira \"hello Mira anything new?\" Mira winked at me \"well the only delicate informations are about you, Yumi-Chan.\" I raised an eyebrow \"what do you mean 'delicate' information about me?\" Mira grinned \"for example you stayed the night with Gray.\" oh no not again I thought \"Mira he's on the medicine wing I only watched him, just as gramps did.\" Mira started to play with her hair \"really I thought you slept resting your head on his chest,isnt that right?\" Mira again succeeded at emberassing me \"yeah but... Look I fell asleep and my head just landed there, alright.\" Mira giggled \"I never said you seduce those two knowingly you might do it unknowingly.\" I sighed \"wow Mira now I wonder who is the second one I seduce?\"<br>\r\nMira leaned over towards me whispering \"let me tell you, I saw married people hug with less passion, you hugged Natsu, you really don't know how alluring you are don't you?\" I blushed lightly \"Mira it's not that way.... We're only friends alright?\" Mira shrugged \"is that a statement or a question, I just tell you what I think someday you will make a decision. And if you do what you do right now, at least one or both of them, will get very sad.\" I think Miras suggestions are silly so I tried to shake them of with a joke \"well Mira what if I choose you, what then?\" Mira grapped my cheeks.. What is she doing? Why... It was a joke right.. Our foreheads touched together Mira whispering \"Than Yumi, I would happily press my lips on yours, I already told you I think you're beautyful and alluring.\" I was in horror... Or not??? I was confused.. Why it was a joke I... I.. Than I hear many voices the people looked at us \"Are they going to.... Mira and Yumi huh... I thought Yumi had a thing for Gray... Maybe Gray never had a chance if Yumis not into men?... But Mira as well?.... Hmm Mira is one of the most popular woman but still never had a boyfriend... At least that I know of... That explains many things.... Kiss kiss kiss kiss! \" the males started to roar for us to kiss. </span></div></div>",

I thought they would do it.... Yumi looked like she wanted it though..... Hahaha!!\" I felt my face getting a deep red color, I looked at my feet, my body trembling \"that... Was mean.. Mira.\" with that I run out back to fairy hill constantly thinking about why Mira would do that.... And how embaressed I am right now, for hours just running up and down my room, when evening came I heard a knock at my door, as I opened I saw Mira staying there, first I wanted to just shut the door again, but I holded back that urge \"WHAT DO YOU WANT MIRA!\" i said rather loudly at her. Mira looked sad at me \"look I'm sorry Yumi, I shouldn't have done this, I never would do you any harm.... I just... Look im sorry ok?\" I sighed \"just stop talking about this stuff and don't make such jokes, no talk about Grey or Natsu or anyone alright?!\" Mira slowly smiled a little \"I.. Understand it won't happen again, I promise.\" Mira walked away towards her room, this I s what I wanted isn't it? She looks very sad though... Anyway I closed my door, I wasted the day being mad at Mira, might as well just sleep now.... The next day I walked into the guilds medicine wing, but Gray wasn't there as I walked back to the main hall I didn't saw him to speak of Natsu and Lucy aren't here as well. Than I heard Miras normal again happy voice  \"if you search for Natsu and Gray they left a few minutes ago with Erza.\" Erza great so my teammate is going on a mission with the one person in fairy tail that hates me, 2 days I haven't took a job because I waited, alright than I'll do a job alone if I must. As I walked towards the board Mira stopped me \"that's not necessary, master told me to give you that letter, before he left for the guild master meeting, he said this is a quest specially asking for you, and that you're not allowed to open it before you leave the city.\" what something that mysterious someone asking for me personally, this better is worth it, but if Makarov is involved, it can't be that bad \"Alright, I'll take the quest, whatever it might be.\" after I leaved the city gates I opened the letter,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Yumi, but I can't write the Intel of the mission on paper, I fear someone could, accidently read it. Meet me at Porlyusica's old hut, I'm waiting for you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigned \"-----------\" </span></div></div>",

There I saw him, he was sitting at a tree, fully wrap in clothes wearing his mask \"there you are.\" he stood up and walked away... Huh? Am I supposed to follow him? \"Mystogan wait what is this all about?\" he silently walked further away mumming \"later, I'll show you.\" it's the first time I see him without getting all tired, he seems to be one without words... Well I of course followed him. Hours pass we only walked silently until he sat down \"we need to wait.\" that is the most boring quest I've ever had, should I try to speak with him... \"well for what are we waiting, Mystogan?\" he answered rather quickly \"Anima\" I never heard about something like that \"what is an Anima Mystogan?\" Mystogan sighed \"you'll see.\" <br>\r\nWhat is with him? He seems to hate speaking, but waiting doing nothing no way \"so why do you hide your face, Mystogan?\" he shrugged \"reasons.\" this is going nowhere. \"at least let me thank you, for bringing me to fairy tail.\" I holded my hand to him, he however ignored that, he stood up \"it's time.\" I wanted to ask what's happening but I already saw the sky, it got dark and started to Form a hole, suddenly I feel weakening, it's like drying out my magic as Mystogan spoke \"its connecting two universes, parallel worlds so to speak, I can close those breaches, but I don't know how long I can do that alone, are you able to eat that?\" what is he crazy how am I supposed to eat that. I guess he saw how uneasy I got \"Yumi heavenly body magic, is your element, although the Anima uses not only that type of magic, but it's mostly consisting of your type. I understand if you want to withdraw the quest.\" wait after hours marching and waiting, he asks me now if I want to do the quest? After that torture I will go through it, I opened my mouth starting to breath in I start to devour the Anima, after a few seconds trying, I had to spit out the foul taste my throat was burning, is it because it was my first time eating my magic type or is it because Animas other magical types? I tried to speak \"I'm 'cough' ah 'cough' sorry.\" I couldn't recognize my own voice it was scratchy and barely noticeable. Mystogan positioned he's staffs to create a magic seal, he needed 15 minutes to close the Anima, I saw Mystogan being exhausted he turned to face me taking a little bottle out of his bag \"here rake one of these pills, it should help you.\" I took the pill it was tasteless and I haven't felt any difference, even to gulp down the pill my throat started to hurt. \"let us go back to Porlyusica, she should know how to help your throat, would be a shame if your voice wouldn't get back to normal.\" well that was maybe the most social conversation I will ever have with him, is it because I can't talk right now? He lifted my arm over his shoulder and we both walked back... </span></div></div>",

It hurts, but this wasn't all his snake flights towards me biting my left leg, there I was dangling in the air, I couldn't bear all that pain, I started to cry unable to scream with my throat crying was everything I could do... As I saw one of Mystogans magic rods hitting the snakes head, the snake let go, I fall before I could hit the ground Mystogan catched me. The snake dude spoke up \"hey don't ignore us, Mystogans right is it, she called you that name in her thoughts, not that it matters with mine and Cubellios poisen inside her body she won't see another day.\"<br>\r\nMystogan looked at me \"don't be so sure about it, Yumis tough.\" that snake dude laughed \"HAHAHA even if that's the case how do you stop us, from killing her right now!\" I was barely awake but saw Mystogan removing his mask. The weird nose guy spoke up \"look now he wnts to scare us with an ugly face.\" the snake guy calmly said \"why should we fear you as if a face could.... WHAT THE HELL, HOW YOU'RE????!!!\" I saw his face I couldn't believe it was Siegrain? How is he a member of fairy tail, he's an council member and one of the 10 wizard saints. To see both our enemys tremble in fear now, Siegrain positioned he's rods around that snake guy, a few seconds later he semned to be relieved \"you're not him you smell like him, your face looks like him, but you're not him, you're not.\" mystogan smiled \"too late you lose.\" he does some weird hand signs forming 15 magic seals above snake guys head, a violet beam struck down on him, the snake guy was knocked out, the nose dude catches him \"the oracion seis won't forget that.\"with that they vanished. Siegrain covered his face again, and I closed my eyes. I woke up to see Porlyusica looking down at me \"you're quiet the lucky one most people would be dead already, but you survived the hardest point.\" even though my voice still was racked \"h ho w l...\" she put a finger on my lips \"stop speaking right now, or you could lose your voice, you've been here for three days now, I can't imagine what happened, but Mystogan gave me a letter for you.\" with that she leaved \"just rest understand, Human!\" I nod. I read the letter:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sorry for everything you've put through, because of me, and I'm not the person you think I'm I told you about this parralel world connecting through the Anima, I'm from there, don't tell anyone about my face or Anima Only Makarov knows about that with him you can speak of course.<br>\r\nPS. Thank you, and destroy this letter after you've done reading.\" I teared the letter apart throwing it away. The door opened and gramps came in \"I heard you are awake, yumi I'm glad to see your eyes again.\" since I can't talk, agai I nod, and giving him a smile.\" Now the door was opened by force as Gray entered the room,\"YUMI YOU'RE AWAKE!\" Makarov turned towards Gray \"she knows that she is awake you don't have to scream that Gray.\" he smiled sitting down next to me. As Makarov spoke \"hmm I will let you two alone, take care of her.\".. After a few minutes gray started to talk, about what happened the past days, how the fought with eisenwald, defeating a demon of the book of Zeref, partly teaming up with Erza, Lucy, and Natsu. After he reviewed it all I saw tears running down he's cheeks. Why is he crying? \"I should have.. I you always protect me and now the one day you got hurt I wasn't there to return the favor, I'm so... As a teammate I'm a total loser...\" I shaked my head, he protected all the guild masters and he still thinks he's a loser Danm. \"even though you shake your head, it's true and you know that it's true.\" with that we remained silent as Gray losed some more tears.... The door opens again, Gray quickly wiped his tears away, as Mira stepped in \"hmm already watching her again Gray, that's so cute.\" as Mira sat down next to Gray confronted her \"I'm just taking care of a teammate that's all, nothings cute at that.\" I knew that grinn on Miras face pretty well \"I think it is, mostly when I see you staring at her lips.\" what did Gray do? Gray looked confused \"I've never stared at her lips.\" Mira smiled \"well I thought I'm doing a wild guess there, you really didn't, so I'm sure in the future you still don't want to watch at her lips, and you don't want to think about them right?\" Gray shrugged \"of cause not, why would I?\" as Gray said that I notice him looking at my lips, a few seconds later he turned his face away now he was face to face with Mira \"You really don't like her lips hmm?\" Mira was already manipulating him, I gave her a stern look as she noticed she talked to me \"well you only said I'm not to talk about Gray Natsu or anyone else with you, so I can talk about you with them.\" Mira smiled at me, she seemed to be nicer than before but maybe we're all wrong and she is even more evil than before. As gray spoke up \"you talked with Yumi about Natsu?\" Mira giggled \"my, my are you getting jealous? Gray hihi, but yes I talked to her after she hugged Natsu more passionate than I could have thought.\" WHAT IS SHE GETTING AT, WHY AM I UNABLE TO SPEAK AAARGGGHHH THAT'S SO FRUSTRATING!! Gray answered \"NO I'm Not jealous, why would I?\" Mira than leaned over to Gray whispering (due to my good ears I could hear her) \"well I just say that If you don't start to seduce her, that sweet Yumi could end up with someone else, that's all.\" I got more and more angry at Mira again. Gray seemed to be upset as well \"NO Mira I'm not going to do that, and even if I had Any feelings towards her, which I don't have, there's no way anyone was wanting to have HER as a girlfriend so back off.\" Wow that actually hurt me, even though I didn't want to have one right now, that was still much to take, tears flowed down my cheek. Mira looked shocked at Gray, and Gray quickly holded his hand over his mouth, as he turns his face to me, I turned around, showing him my back, I just didn't want to see him right now. \"Yumi I.. I.. I'm.. I didn't im sorry Yumi I'm I didn't mean it like I said, it's just that uhmm you wouldn't because eeeehh.\" if I could speak proberly right now I would tell him to go away, but so I stayed sobbing into my pillow, as Mira spoke up \"you should leave for now Gray, it doesn't matter what you say right now, after what you've said, no apologize would work, that needs time much time.\" Gray nodded \"you might be right.\" as he left I turned around to see Mira with a smile of sympathy \"I'm sorry it's my fault gray said that, but I really thought he likes you.. And just needed a little push.\" well at least it's clear now neither I nor Gray have any such feelings towards each other. Mira gave me a handkerchief \"here please wipe your tears away.\" and that I did, at least Miras now nice to me again. I smiled at her thankfully. \"Since Gray isn't watching over you now, don't worry I'll do that for now, if you don't mind?\" I just smiled at her, which was enough for her, to stay with me, Mira provided and helped me drink water, eat my food and all this until I fall asleep.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mira stretched herself, turning her Face towards me \"you're already awake.\" smiling sweetly. I gave her that smile back, still my voice wasn't much better \"th.. anks\" Miras sweet smile turned into a broad one \"don't mind it Yumi, I love to help you right now.\" with that Mira stood up brought me a new glass of water, giving me my medicine from Porlyusica, which tastes disgusting, after a few hours Natsu stepped inside \"yo Yumi are you feeling better?\" Mira spoke up \"hello Natsu, she shall not speak, but yes it seems she is way better than before.\" Natsu smiled \"good, that's good.\" he walked to us as he stranded  right next to me he grapped my hand \"Yumi I don't now what happened to you, and gramps forbid us to ask for Intel of your quest, but I swear to you, if I ever know who did this, I will make him or her pay!\" his grip tightens, which causes me to smile, thanks Natsu I appreciate that. Mira than spoke \"I think Yumi needs some time without thinking of a fight or that fight at least.\" well that's true, Natsu released my hand \"just wanted you to know that, I will burn everything away that brings you pain.\" he said that calmly, he's statement felt warm and friendly, I smiled openly, as Natsu took his leave. Mira noticed my smile \"you shouldn't smile so invinting, I might not resist to kiss you this time for real.\" blushing I stopped smiling immediately, why does she have to destroy the warmth feeling. \"Sorry couldn't resist that joke hehe.\" I think she needs to learn more about what a joke normally is. Anyway throughout the day nearly everyone in the guild visit me, telling me things of there daily life, in the end Levy came in as well. \"sorry I wasn't here earlier but.. I didn't wanted to see you in pain, or worse.\" I notice her pressing a book against her chest, \"I wondered since you can't move so much, maybe you, you want to read a good book?\" she holded the book towards me. I nodded, it might help a bit thanks levy, I took the book. Levy got a happy expression in her face \"good good, that was all.. Oh wait I hope you get healthy soon, now bye.\" Levy leaved quickly. I tried to read but it was hard to concentrate, Mira than took the book from my hands \"you should rest, now.\" with that Mira started to read the book out loud, her voice is so gentle and harmonic, I don't know how long I did but sometime I noticed I was staring at Miras lips, why was I doing that, and even now I didn't stop I'm a bit confused about myself, anyway Mira doesn't seem to notice, or at least she doesn't care. I watched her lips forming words after words, until I drifted into sleep. When I woke up I saw </span></div></div>",

Uhh.. Fine!\" Mira smiled at me \"your voice is on her old beauty again, and you say your fine? No pain at all?\" I didn't noticed but she's right I'm fine, how? I saw Mira standing up \"I knew a good cuddling would do wonders.\"<br>\r\nI felt myself blushing again \"what no I guess it's the medicine, and not some cuddling that cured me, Mira it's silly to think cuddling would change anything.\" I was a bit confused to see a sad expression on Miras face \"it's just.. Well it's what I always told myself, since Lisanna had that fever, and we couldn't afford any medicine, I thought maybe it does help after all.\" wow talking about Lisanna.. Now I feel even worse than before. \"but than I think it did help me, Mira I was just a bit surprised that's all.\" Miras face lighted up a little \"I'm just, I'm sorry since Lisanna died, I started to... You know I used you as a replacement I'm so horrible.\" as I saw Mira starting to cry I quickly hugged her \"Mira I don't mind that, it's OK.\" I've never thought she would think like that about me. \"thanks Yumi.\" after we broke apart I walked to the guild hall, the people instantly roared \"HEY YUMI... YOU'RE BACK ALIVE.... NICE TO SEE YOU WELL!\" I saw Gray turning towards me \"hello... you're back.\" I felt myself tensing up in anger, so I ignored him, the next one who spoke to me was Erza \"it looks, you failed disappointing.\" her eyes where cold as ever towards me, before I could speak, she just walked away. Why does she hate me? Anyway I should talk to gramps now. With that I got upstairs to his office, opening the door I saw him sizzling on his table smiling \"good to see you are well, Mystogan didn't talked much about what happened, care to explain?\" as I explained everything that happens, and I know of, gramps sometimes nodded listening to my words \"So you know about Edolas and Mystogan, Anima... As for your attackers I know of whom your speaking, the snake guys called Cobra, the one who's fast calls himself Racer, you where lucky that it where only those two. We won't let that unanswered, right now the Balam allience hinders us to take action. Oh and for your payment Mystogan decided to pay your rents, to explain he never needs any money living in nature and all, so he tributes all his earnings to the guild, he just said I shall take the needed part to pay your rent from now on.\" WHAT IS THAT EVEN FOR REAL? I was already thinking how to pay this times rent.... wait I failed the quest, he doesn't have to pay me for anything.... Unless for my suffering I gone through that is, still it is quite generous I think. Gramps seemed to be amused now \"you must have made quiet the impression on him, exposing his face and letting you know his real identity.\" how was I impressing in anyway I couldn't eat Anima and got nearly killed by Cobra, I was pathetic, in fact I think I've made his job harder than it was in the first place. But still I nod \"guess so.\" I realized I haven't succeeded in any quest, either I socialized or had to cure myself... And that weak 'black wizard' I don't consider that a real 'victory', this time I'll do a quest, and surely succeed. Makarov smiled \"hmm it looks like your fire is lighten again.\" I smiled at him \"yeah its time to show why I'm an S class fairy tail wizard!\" storming out off his office, I took a quick glance to the S class quest board, but after consideration I don't know how fit I'm exactly, maybe pay it easy on the ordenary ones right know. I stept downstairs looking at the board. 'need help building a new house.... Escort a trader.....protect the bank from thiefs' ... That one's interesting \"investigate the complete vanished population of our neighbor village.\" hmm payments only a mere 15000, but since I don't have to take care of my rent now, I take the quest. \"Mira I'll take that one!\" Mira quickly looked over it \"alright registered, may you succeed, Yumi-Chan.\" I have to tell her later to stop with that Chan crap, but for now I have a job to do. As I wanted to leave I noticed Gray following me, \"why are you following me.... GRAY!\" still angry at him I waited for an answer, Gray took some minutes propably trying to find the best words to say... \"well, we're teammates aren't we?\" that is all he has to say, for that he needed so long? I calmed myself down ad said </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well Gray decided to follow me \"Yumi... I'm sorry for what I've said.\" as if that changes anything, I concentrated on breathing to calm down again, ignoring him further. Gray increased his speed until he's right besides me \"I mean it, Yumi I'm sorry it slipped out of me.\" still it doesn't change a fact \"Just shut up, 'TEAMMATE'!\" Gray nodded and remained silent. With that we walked silently, it felt weird having him around right now, so much for having a nice job, why did I take a quest that sends me to the other side of that fucking island. Hours we walked now, should I speak with Gray? Maybe not a good idea I'm a bit unpredictable right now. As the evening was coming I decided to take up camp for the night, I made a fire and sat down infront of it, Gray sat next to me, why isn't he sitting on the other site? I stood up and walked to my sleeping bag \"you can wake me In 4 hours than you can sleep, alright.\" he didn't answer me but I didn't care for that. As I woke up it was already daylight, I saw Gray sleeping, why didn't he wake me! \"GRAY WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU, WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED, WHILE NO ONE OF US WAS ON WATCH!!!!\" I screamed what waked him up in shock, this time Gray seemed to be pissed \"OH YEAH I CAN'T SEE THAT ANYTHING HAPPENED, SO CHILL!! AND SINCE WHEN DO I HAVE TO DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAY? IF THAT'S BECAUSE WHAT I SAID EARLIER STILL, I SAID I'M SORRY SO IT'S FINE NOW!\" I didn't know what I was doing, I walked slowly towards him and *SMACK* I slapped him harder then I thought I would ever slap someone, my slap was enough to send Gray fly to the ground, forming a violet hand on his right cheek. \"AAAAH. WHAT THE FUCK, YUMI THAT FREAKING HURT!\" I shrugged \"LOOK GRAY IM SORRY THAT I DID THAT, YOU SEE I SAID I'M SURRY, SO IT'S FUCKING FIIIIINNEEE RIGHT THAT'S HOW IT WORKS IN YOUR WORLD DOES IT?\" Gray stood up he wanted to say something *SMACK* I slapped him again same procedure only now I hit his left cheek \"I'M SORRY GRAY I'M SO SORRY SO ITS FIINEE, IF YOU STAY UP I SWEAR I SLAP YOU AGAIN, BUT DON'T WORRY I WILL SAY SORRY SO IT'S ALRIIIIGHT!\" Gray looked more than a little shocked at me, I saw his body trembling, he didn't stood up this time, after a few seconds his body calm down he spoke up \"Yumi.. I get your point, but your slapping like you want to kill me... Please stop that.\" Now I realised what I really did, he might have been really sorry and I oh god.. His cheeks are all violet, \"alright I'll stop that, Gray stand up.\" he seemed to be unsure if he really should stay up, maybe fearing I lied to him and going to slap him again. But at last he did stand up, I brought my hand toward his left cheek, he had a little fear in his face, which vanished after he knew I was only touching his pulsing cheek gently, feeling the pulsation I knew i was horrible \"Gray I.. I.. I'm so, Im sorry\" Gray smiled a little, guess it hurts him to smile more than that \"I accept you apologize as it was my fault to say no one would want you as a girlfriend, of course that's wrong.\" I couldn't hold them my tears I started to cry \"No, it's not your fault... I.. I.. Just couldn't bear the truth... You're right who would want something from me.... I.. Even hurt my own teammate I'm... Brutal... Evil... Pathetic, I'm unable to be loved anyway..\" I cried more than ever sobbing sniffing and trambling I stood before Gray as he hugged me, why was he doing that, after what I've done why?\" Gray spoke \"Don't say that, I was an idiot and I said that out of anger towards Mira. Look Yumi I can imagine many persons beeing happy having you with them.\" still I couldn't stop sobbing \"you're wrong, after someone knows what I did to you he would hate me doesn't matter who's there.\" Gray tightened his grip \"Yumi, that's not true, and you know that, do I have to slap you now that you realize?\" was he seriously thinking someone could love me in the future, I looked at him most my tears already flown only a few are running down \"how can you... Now that..... Gray how.... Can you possible know that?\" Gray holded my cheeks \"Yumi I know that because I.... Well I just know it.\" did I just imagine that or did he blush through the now even deeper violet hand marks on his cheeks, anyway his words helped me for now \"thanks, Gray.\" as he realesed me from his hug he started to walk, but I quickly grapped his hand \"Gray let us stay here for a day, so I can at least tend to your wounded cheeks.\" he nodded, \"alright if we have the time.\" I tried to smile, although still feeling horrible for what I've done \"please sit down right here.\" Gray did as he was told, I sat down infront of him, taking out a white ointment, I put it on my hands, and started to rub the salve gently on Grays cheeks, I massaged it on he's pulsing pores, the salve hurt him, I can imagine that it burns \"sorry, but the salve will help you, Gray.\" Gray nodded \"but how came you have that ointment with you, did you plan to slap me?\" I still massaging Grays cheeks even though I'm done with the salve \"since my experiance with poisen, I stocked up my Proviant, with some medecine.\" Gray nodded \"but isn't the salve already attached?\" I smiled at him \"well I thought I owe your cheeks a good massage.\" Gray tried to turn his face away hurting himself at the process, this caused me to slip a little giggle \"guess you will have to life with that then.\" he tried to look away but I massaged he's cheeks as gentle as I possibly could for 20 minutes. \"Uhm.. Did did it help? Are you feeling better?\" Gray shrugged \"not really, but I do appreciate it.\" It didn't help? Hmm I thought it would, \"sorry I hoped it would ease the pain a bit, what a waste of time\" Gray laughed \"true it didn't ease the pain, put your hands did feel magical gentle... Somehow I mean.\" again he quickly looked sideways, I thought he might just don't want to talk, about that. \"So gray how where the last days for you, as you know I did not speak with you?\" he told me how Natsu wanted to fight Erza in an showdown, and how the magic council, took Erza prisoner... Natsu humiliating her, with the intention to help her.... More or less Gray himself was busy tending to my sleeping self, before we had our quarrel, he was the one making sure I drink enough and take my medicine. I feel a bit dump at how angry I was \"Thank you Gray.\" I bowed before him \"Yumi, you really don't have to thank me it's fine, you might have forgotten I'm your teammate that's what we're for.\" after that we wasted some time talking idly chatting, I admit I already missed that a bit, this evening Gray made the fire this tim I sat down right next to him close, shoulder on shoulder to be exact, Gray quickly moved a few inches away Makin space between us, maybe he didn't except my apologize after all \"Gray you haven't forgiven me have you? Why else would constantly try to look away from me? and now your trying to be as far away as possible from me! Gray what else could cause you to act like that.\" Gray was a bit uneasy to answer my question, so I guess I'm right, I will make sure we're on good terms again while we're on the mission, I will be the most nice and sweet Yumi towards Gray than ever!\" Gray than asked \"how are we doing the sleeping and watch shifts.\" I sniffed in a bit in the air \"well I can't smell anything other than yesterday so there should be no problem, but if you feel saver doing shifts, I let you decide Gray.\" I notice him being surprised by that, it's true I probably never let him decide anything, it feels weird to do so now. Grymay shrugged it of \"I guess I like to rest a whole and not a half night.\" I nodded \"than it's decided, tonight we rest together.\"  Gray was again confused  \"wha.. What do you mean, re.. Rest to.. To.. Geth.. Er, Yumi what is with you?\" I didn't understood he's reaction is about \"huh Gray you did not expect me to stay awake the whole night, I will sleep as well, what is this question all about?\" wait he looks embarrassed, did I say something wrong, who could've thought being nice is so challenging. Again Gray didn't look at me \"I... See\" whatever that was about. The next hour we watched the flames shining in the dark \"the flames are beautiful to watch at are they not Gray?\" Gray turned his head towards me, almost staring \"Yes, yes they're, very beautiful.\" after a few moments he quickly looked back at the fire. I however shifted towards him so our shoulders touch again and rested my head on his shoulder \"Yumi what... Are uh what are you doing.\" what a silly question \"I'm resting my head on your shoulder, it's not so hard to notice that Gray.\"  Gray was shaking a bit weird \"I... See\" wait did I insult him, I wanted to be nice I have to say something nice, maybe sweet hm hm I shifted even closer, now the side of my right boob is touching his arm \"Gray I just wish we could be as good friends as we where, before you said what you said, and I did what I did,do you think that's possible?\" I noticed he started to breath heavenly \"Yumi I you uhh... You're acting weird right now, I already forgave you, and if you forgave me everything fine. Would ehhh would you give me some personal space please.\" I did release him and sat back to my normal place, I really suck at being nice dammit. 1 hour later I erased the fire and we go to sleep. When I woke up </span></div></div>",

I meanwhile took out the ointment, and rubbed it all over my hands, sitting down next to him, I started to rub the ointment on his cheeks. \"Yumi, what are you doing.\" I didn't stop rubbing \"Gray your cheeks are still showing clear marks of my hands, so firstly you need more of this salve, and secondly I think my hands owe your cheeks more than one massage.\" suddenly Gray removed my grapped my hands, removing them from his cheeks \"Yumi, I have to tell you something, I can't abuse your trust like that, you call me best friend and you're well I just need to tell you, I did stare at you, it won't happen again I swear!\" that I had to gulp down first, \"you, you swear you don't do it again?\" Gray nodded \"yes I swear!\" I started to rub his cheeks again \"why did you do it in the first place?\" Gray started to shake a bit \"well you have a right to know, remember Mira speaking about your lips, that I should never look at them, and never think of them, since that day I started to look at them.\" wait he did stare at me more than this once? Gray took a breath and continued \"and lately I had thoughts about Kissing you, now that's it, this is the whole truth, as I said it won't happen again.\" what is all this, Miras simple words did corrupt Gray? A kiss... That's what he's thinking about.... This is bad, very bad, still he told me with his own free will, somehow I'm not mad at him. \"thank you for being honest with me Gray, I'm willing to trust you, still I warn you don't do anything stupid alright, unless you like getting a few slaps that is.\" Gray relieved that I'm not mad at him let out a soft laugh \"well even if I where into getting slapped on, no one would like your slaps, they're horrible inflicting huge pain.\" I removed my left hand from his cheek and slapped him.... Playfully \"don't you dare insult my slap techniques, or do I have to train them?\" Gray was silent as I was as well, now I noticed how weird that all is, the whole situation. \"it's time to rest now, good night, Gray!\" Gray stayed silent watching the fire, I looked at him just sitting there almost not moving, the light of the flames reflecting on him giving him something mysterious, how would it be if he kissed me... What am I thinking. I rolled over and closed my eyes, tomorrow</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gray and I arrived at the village, a everything's old and partly broken, a few villagers gathered around us whispering something even I couldn't hear, the oldest of them spoke up. \"You must be guildmages, we thank you for taking that long journay here.\" everyone of them started to kneel before us \"we thought no one would come to help us.\" I walked up to the old guy helping him to stand up again \"there is no reason to kneel, I'm Yumi and that dork here is Gray, just tell us what happened.\" the old dude nodded \"well the thing is, our neighbor village got soulless over a night, no one's there anymore, so we decided to scratch all the coins we have together, to find help, the thing is we don't know much about magic, as there is no reason for they disapearience we thought it had to be magical.\" Gray stepped beside me. \"and why would YOU do THAT for a neighbor village?\" I gave him a serious look \"Gray maybe they're only nice people wanting to help friends.\" the village elder smiled \"well its more returning a favor, we never had anything to do with them, we never even spoke with them, until 3 years ago, the river flooded our fields, destroying our harvest, we all thought the winter would take nearly everyone of us, but then the villagers from there came to us, sharing there supplies with us, they had no reason to do so, they just did.\" Gray just shrugged, \"let us go, investigate that village.\" I nodded and followed him, after we've been outside the village I run over to stay before Gray \"Gray you should really be nicer to strangers, they haven't done anything to you.\" Gray just stood there \"and you should start to distrust strangers more you don't know there intention.\" \"YEAH but if we start distrusting everyone, we would start to live a life of hatret and loneliness!\" Gray breathed in for a moment \"Yumi, stop talking about things you don't understand am I clear!\" now he walked away, I stood there confused this was the first time I saw him like that, I just followed quietly for now. As we arrived the village it looked like the other village same buildings, same streets, and I couldn't smell any human scent \"Gray I can't smell any humans.\" Gray stared into that village \"than we should leave now, they tricked us.\" that would be the first time we're not ending a job \"Gray magic or whatever did that can also erase the scent, as I said I think you should trust others more.\" he didn't objected but wasn't happy either, we walked through the village, the houses clothes food everything's there, nothing but the ordanary, we couldn't find any tracks, at night we decided to sleep here, maybe something happens here at night, the bedroom of couse had only one bed as Gray noticed \"there is a children's room on the other end of the corner, I'll go there.\" I grapped his arm and tossed him on the bed \"you're forgetting about your daily ointment do you?\" Gray got uneasy shaking and his cheeks turned from a mere bright red to an deeply red again. I sat down behind him lifting his head on my legs and started rub the ointment on his cheeks again. \"Gray relax if you move your head like that it feels weird.\" Gray trying to hold still \"Are you doing all this on purpose? If that's some kind of punishment for what I've done, I think you've made your point.\" I was confused \"what do you mean? Is trying to be nice a bad thing?\" Gray nodded \"I told you I had those thoughts what you do is torture right now.\" I saw him struggling and knew what he meant \"but how am I supposed to act than, your my best friend and I care for you, I mean you even told me that you're a pervert, but I trust you not to do anything.\" Grays eyes widened \"you think I'm a pervert!!??\" I smiled at him \"you told me yourself, you stared at me while I slept and you thought about kissing me, what are if you're not a perv?\" Gray looked at me with disbelieve and sorrow \"Yumi, I don't want you to think that way about me, please tell me that's just part of a weird punishment.\" he really thought I punish him? \"Gray I'm not punishing you alright. I thought about how shall I react and act and all, I decided that it's not your fault, it's just that you have a perverted mind, so I.. I.. I don't mind if you can't control your urge and stare at me, just don't do anything weird alright, I still consider you my best friend, pervy.\" Gray stood up \"Yumi please, is there something I can do so you would see me in a better light again?\" I sighed \"Gray what is done is done... I told you I don't mind, and I'm sure the others won't mind as well.\" Gray nodded \"guess I messed up.. Wait others what do you mean others?\" I gave him a sweet smile \"well I have to tell the other girls in fairy tail what you are, so they know what to expect when you're around.\" Gray trembled stronger than ever \"YUMI, DON'T DO THAT!! I'M NOT A PERV IF THEY ALL BELIEVE YOU I, YUMI DON'T DO THAT JUST DON'T, I'LL DO EVERYTHING YOU WANT JUST DON'T SPREAD SUCH A RUMOR!!!!\" I saw pure fear in his eyes, I've never seen before, \"Gray, they need to know that or you could abuse there unawareness, like you did towards me.\" Gray probably not thinking straight yelled \"NO I WOULD NOT, YOUR THE ONLY ONE I'VE EVER STARED AT BECOUSE, YOU'RE BEAUTYFUL, BRAVE, STRONG, SWEET, CARING, SOMETIMES A BIT FUNNY OR WEIRD BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE YUMI I MEAN I'M...\" what is happening right now, why do I feel so good all of a sudden, I'm blushing why? \"Gray, you swear that you only perved at me?\" Gray still desperate \"YEEES I MEAN NOOO I'M NOT PERVING BUT IF YOU CALL IT THAT WAY YES!\" I hugged him \"alright than I won't tell anyone, but if I see you Perving on another woman I will tell them, so I trust you only take me.. I mean perv on me, don't ever touch me in anyway, or I'll kill you!\" did I really said that? I literally ordered him to perv on me! Gray seemed to at least calming down a bit \"Yumi just believe me, I'm not Perving on you either.\" but do I believe him? </span></div></div>",

I thanked you for that, do you really want to say anything that could change that? Or do you want to just go out and say good night?\" I smiled towards him, he again red faced turned towards the door and mumbled \"Good night, Yumi.\" I giggled \"smart choice, good night Gray.\" well that was something reviewing its all a bit silly with Gray, but still we have no clue what happened to the villagers, at least I have a bed with a roof, hmm now we aren't in the nature, and gray is in another room finally I can take off these clothes at least for the night. After I removed them I took a deep breath. Tomorrow maybe I'll take a quick shower in that house. But then again it's not mine, who's house are we in, in someway it's not right to sleep in here. I quickly bowed and said \"sorry mister or misses or both what names you may have, I thank you for that roof. I swear I will find all of you, and then I thank you for real.\" Now I slipped under the blanket and slowly drift into sleep the next morning I woke up due to a knock on the door \"Yumi we shouldn't waste more time resting.\" luckily it was just Gray, the bed was really comfy I stood up and grabbed my clothes as I heard Gray \"I come in now.\" I saw the door open as I screamed high pitched \"DON'T YOU DARE GRAY STAY OUT!!!\" I feared the door to open further but it didn't, the door closed really quick, \"Sorry should have guessed you didn't sleep full clothed like in the nature, I didn't saw anything, I just wait here alright.\" I breathed in and out, he really didn't came in, still my heart is beating because of that, trying not to think about it I slipped into my clothes. And walked out of my room, Gray stood there scratching the back of his head. \"you're ready Yumi?\" I smiled at him \"thanks for not peeking in you know, would you mind if I take a quick shower or bath I feel a bit dirty.\" Gray sighed but than nodded \"well your right I need one too, you can go first I would take one after you, if you don't mind that either.\" I gave him a quick nod \"why would I.\" I feel dump slipping cloth on off on off only to take a little shower, as I started, no water came, uhh of couse, why would I get a shower right now, as I tried to figure out what's wrong, I saw a spider crawling towards me. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A spider? What is it doing here, not only all humans but also everything else isn't here, no flies, bees, birds nothing but this spider. I took my and towards the spider and it immediately walked on my hand. It tickled  a bit so I giggled \"so and who are you, do you now why no one else is here?\" of couse the spider couldn't answer, but it wasn't hostile either, such a small thing, what ever happened hear the spider could either hid him or herself or wasn't affected. The spider crawled over my arm and stood on my shoulder. \"oh wanna stick around little buddy, alright then.\" I stepped out the shower, a shame I couldn't wash myself, and again without accomplishing anything I slip back into my clothes taking care not to crush my little friend. I walked out of the bathroom and stopped Gray as he wanted to enter the bathroom \"no water there.\" Gray than noticed the spider \"Yumi don't move you have a spider on your shoulder, I'll kill it.\" as Gray wanted to crush the spider I stopped his hand midway with my own hand \"Gray don't kill the spider it hasn't done anything to you alright.\" the spider crawled upwards my arm and than on Grays back hand biting him, the spider jumped back on my shoulder. \"aaggh it bit me!\" I giggled turning towards the spider \"who is a good spider, hmm yes you're a good spider, say the dork deserved it didn't he? Well I think you need a name what about Fullbiter, that's a good name isn't it?\" the spider jumped happily in circles, Gray however wasn't happy at all \"Yeah very funny Yumi, that was what I meant with sometimes you are weird.\" ignoring Gray I talked to Fullbiter \"well now back to the investigations, at least now we have 2 brains working on that case.\" Gray had a disgust written on his face \"hey that wasn't nice to say at all.\" I turned towards Gray and took my hand on his shoulders \"don't worry to much about it you have other qualities, dork.\" with that I walked outside the house, I heard Gray mumbling \"yeah right!\" maybe I should have played it a bit nicer but he did try to kill that little buddy here. But where could we find informations of what happened here, suddenly I feel Fullbiter jump again, as I turn my head to him, he was pointing towards the east with one of his legs \"you want me to go there, don't you?\" Gray suddenly spoke up with a angry but still not loud \"we are not going to trust that spider aren't we?!\" I crossed my arms \"he's name is Fullbiter and we don't have anything else, have we?\" Gray sighed \"you really gave it that name? If I have a say in that I would rather not go that way!\" I shrugged \"luckily you don't have a say in it as it is 2 against 1, democracy decides.\" Gray looked away \"that's not what democracy should do, you can always say my pets on my side, and do whatever you want!\" I walked close to him and put my hand on his shoulder \"that's exactly how it works, dork but to explain it would go over your brain ability, so don't waste your time with that alright!\" wow that one was harsh maybe I should cool down a bit, as I feel cold air building up, he's angry enough, there is no need to push it further \"come now to the east it goes.\" Gray followed quietly with staring at me with cold icy eyes, I don't feel intimidated as I'm stronger than Gray it's more like feeling bad for him.\" anyway we arrived at a cave, Fullbiter again jumped up and down, as he had my full attancion he pointed at his little teeth making a biting movement the air, than shaked his whole body and flipped himself on he's back, Than stood up again trying to make himself as big as possible doing those bites again, than he points at Gray and than to the cave. I nodded through all this \"I get it.\" Gray visibly shocked \"HEEE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THING!\" I sighed \"yes I do inside the caves are spiders, but those are dangerous for us, they killed all the villagers they have a poisen, to paralize humans as there queen feeds on them for 5 years each, they die a torturous death, they're also the reason no birds or other animals are around here, as no humans where around anymore they took other animals as well, and the least thing he told me was, to send you in first, without giving you those information, inmsnt he adorable.\" Grays face had a mixture of hate, disgust, disbelieve, confusion. \"so adorable nothings ever being cuter than that spider.\" I smiled \"right you are, so wanna go in first?\" Gray just shrugged and walked inside, it was a joke I quickly run up to him \"let us rather go together, dork.\" Gray grapped my shoulder \"I don't know why you started to call me dork but stop it!\" not answering him I noticed Fullbiter is gone as he wasn't on my shoulder again \"Do you know where Fullbiter is?\" Gray shrugged \"forget it than!\"<br>\r\nI playfully punched his arm \"I won't call you a dork anymore if you don't want me to, never forget you are my B.E.S.T  F.R.I.E.N.D. seriously the next time you forget that, I swear I slap you again!\" Gray trembled \"you know, sometimes it's hard to remember that you know?\" why is that so hard... Hmm I shrugged it of \"let us go further.\" so we did, there was a large room before us, we saw about 40 large spiders gathering around there, they're clearly weak but many and not close to all as I was to attack Gray stopped me \"let me do that please.\" why does he always want to do something alone? I just stepped behind Gray and he started to easily kill them first he used his ice Lance to pierce through the first ones, than he used his ice slash Hamer.. It didn't even took 1 minute and they're all down, Gray smiled at me \"see pretty easy!\" why is he smiling? This was nothing \"let us go further.\" did I imagine that or was he disappointed? It isn't the first time he always tries to do things alone, and when he succeed he always smiles at me. Anyway we walked further, there she was the spider queen a huge one around her gathering hundreds of those spiders, \"Gray do your work I watch.\" Gray was a bit confused \"you really think I can, I won't disappoint you, I swear!\" I looked back at him and calmly said \"it's about if you survive or not, I won't help you if you fail I leave you here as food for the queen understood.\" Gray gulped and looked at me probably to find out if I say the truth right now, I didn't even change the expression on my face \"you want to do everything alone, and you want to be an s class wizard in the near future? Than this shouldn't be a problem right? There is only one other option, if you fear you can't pull it off, beg me, get in your knees kiss my feet an beg me to help you.\" of course I'm not really serious but he has to learn something right now either he tries and learns that one wrong action means death, or that he has to know when he needs help and once live is worth more than his dignity. But I remained calm and quiet so he couldn't know its a lie. </span></div></div>",

His face expressed pure disbelieve, however did act quickly \"Ice make Canon\" with that he killed a few spiders, so he could land on the ground, \"Ice make wall\" he casted that one 5 times to build 4 walls and one roof closing himself inside and the spiders outside, I admit that's smart now he has time to find a tactic to handle them, I heard him screaming up towards me \"HEEY WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT YOU WOULDN'T REALLY GO THROUGH THIS, WOULDN'T YOU?!!\" I quietly sat down \"if you make it up here you can start begging, but as you already insulted my feet you'll have to lick them as well.\" Gray coughed \"WHY, WHY AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO BE TEAMMATES!\" that's the point of this that you have to learn now \"I don't care if you die here Gray, if you do you're an insult for fairy tail and unworthy, no one would even lose a tear for you, if you can't pull of some spiders.\" Gray started to sweat \"SO THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND, ALRIGHT I DON'T NEED YOU ANYWAY, YUMI YOU'RE SUCH AN EVIL BITCH!\" I'm sorry Gray but what I said is just how you treat your own life everytime you can, after this is done I'll make it up to you. \"don't waste your time the ice starts to crack.\" in the meantime I notice a few spiders crawling towards me, I sighed \"star dragons roar!\" I quickly killed those, Gray however started his move \"ice make Lance!\" he touched the eastern wall to shoot out of his cover, good but to late the ice walls already broke partly, if he had it done before he could have succeeded! But he needed to waste his time trying to convince me. As the walls finally broke the siders jumped on Gray three of them bit him, shortly after they all made a passage for there queen s she spoke \"my my what a delicious meal I got, I will feed even longer on that one!\" Gray couldn't move due to his paralization \"YUMI HELP, PLEASE ALRIGHT, I BEG YOU, HELP MEEE!\" I turned my head away \"you called me a bitch!\" Gray screamed more desperate \"I'M SOOOORRRY FOR THAAAT PLEEEASE I DO EVERYTHING DON'T LET THAT THING EAT, I WILL EVEN LICK YOUR FEET IF THAT'S IT WHAT I HAVE TO DO!!\" I shrugged \"since you called me a bitch that's not enough.\" the spider queen hovered over him now \"you will taste perfect your magic power will let us create 1000 more of our children.\" Gray started to cry \"ALLRIGHT I'LL DO EVERY THING I'LL EVEN MASSAGE YOUR FEET EVERY DAY OR OR SUCK THEM WHATEVER I'LL DO EVERYTHING!!!!\" that is enough he throwed his dignity off, I slowly walk to the queen. \"STAR DRAGONS HEAVENLY ARROWS!\" I summoned 200 hundred arrows of shining light that crashed Down on the rest living spiders killing them off the spider queen got raging \"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO OUR KIDS!!! YOU WHORE, DON'T COME CLOSER OR I INFLICT A DEADLY POISEN ON THAT WEAK MALE HERE!\" I just shrugged \"it's not like I have to come closer to kill you. I moved my 200 light arrows  towards the spider queen piercing through her 200 times until she exploded. Gray still crying, \"Gray get on your knees, all fours, you're not paralyzed anymore, it's a weak poisen.\" Gray slowly got on his knees he is on all fours infront of me looking up to me \"please don't make me!\" I just removed my left feet from my boot making a circle motion with my feet \"roll over, slave!\" Gray hesitates but than sighed and rolled on his back. I moved my barefoot over his face dangling not far from him \"open you're mouth say aaaaahhh.\" Gray bit in his own teeth, closed his eyes and slowly opened his mouth, I removed my feet and sat on his chest, he opened his eyes, closing his mouth, he seemed to be confused again. *smack* I slapped him.. Gently \"I told I slap you if you forget we are best friends, you idiot.\" Gray blinked at me \"why then..\" I smiled down at him \"I wanted to test what you would do, and I must say I'm disappointed. Did you really help killing a demon of the book of zeref? Guess Natsu and Erza did the whole work than.\" Gray seemed to be humiliated by my words \"Yumi, I'm sure I could have pulled it off somehow!\" I sighed \"but you didn't Gray, imagine if I had been serious, your dignity your proudness would have killed you, there is nothing wrong having dignity, but you have to learn to know the times in which dignity means nothing, you had to learn that one wrong move one decision can kill you, and I guess you've learned that now, the most important thing is your life Gray nothing else matters more.\" he didn't answer for a few minutes. \"Yumi you.... can stand up you know?\" why, would he want that? He didn't seem to like it \"if you wish.\" I stood up now I was standing on Gray \"OFF OF ME YUMI!\" oh that makes more sense I guess, I jumped off of him, he immediately stood up \"Yumi I I really thought you would let me die there.\" I quickly hugged him \"idiot, if I would ever let you die on me, idiot, you are a real idiot.\" Gray didn't answer, I released him from my hug, and holded his hand \"Let us go, back to that village.\" Gray remaint silent the entire way back. As we came back to the village the elder approached us with a small wooden chest \"Did you succeed?\" I smiled at him, we couldn't rescue the villagers they're all dead but the threat is erased.\" he nodded here take that humble payment. I saw a little spider crawling towards me \"Fullbiter is that you? Come here cute little buddy, I've missed you so much!\" </span></div></div>",

He responded \"oh that the river dryed out last year, we suspect it was that magical source?\" Gray spoke \"what are you getting at Yumi?\" ignoring Gray completely \"second question, the threat kills its pray in five years if the villagers helped you 3 years ago how are they all dead?\" the elder started to shake through his body \"how am I supposed to know what that spider queen does or not?\" I nodded \"third question, why aren't there any birds or bugs around this village too?\" everyone in the village started to tremple right now \"I I don't know the magic eventually?\" \"question number five last one, how did you know it was a spider queen, I never told you that!\" now they turned into spiders as I thought the cave only had female spiders here are the males, Fullbiter was one of them, the queen couldn't get out that cave due to her hugeness, so he was to lure us there. The elder seems to be the spider king \"you killed her my queen better ru away my poisen is deadly aaaarrggh!\" Gray yelled at me \"WHY AREN'T YOU MOVING YUMI!!\" I giggled \"what a weak bluff.\" the spider king than dropped to his knees \"dammit, you killed her, you killed my beloved, the mother of these children, please let us live, we are only doing what we need to do to survive, you already killed our family with the spider queens death we can't reproduce you've done the job, please leave us be!\" all of them dropped to there kness \"please let us life, please!!!!\" I smiled at them \"don't worry it will end really quick, you shouldn't really suffer by it. STAR DRAGONS UNIVERSE WHIP\" that way a dark blue whip formed around my two fingers it does not take long to kill them all, I pierced through the kings eye and then beheaded all the other spiders that gathered here in one smooth motion. Than I took the wooden box and walked to the biggest house in that village, so where here, they surely haven't offered all they had as payment in case there plan fails, after a few hours gathering all the money around I come up to a summ of 134000 jewel. As I got back I saw Gray still standing there shaking \"isn't that thievery?\" I shrugged \"the villagers died years ago, besides I'm not greedy I collected it for you, here it's all yours.\" Gray blinked at me twice \"the whole money, from the job, why you did most, no you did everything, I don't deserve even a share of it.\" I giggled \"just take it alright.\" he pushed it back \"I can't take it.\" how stubborn alright than \"take the money, or I'll tell the woman in fairy tail you're a perv, well I could add that you layed on your back mouth wide oben expecting me to shove my feet inside.\" I gave him the sweeties smile I had while I said that, Gray quickly took the jewel \"alright, alright I'll take it.\" I giggled again \"nice, I just thought I made you go through this horror, you deserve it.\" he put the wooden chest in his bag \"alright let us go back now Yumi.\" as we walked through the woods again Gray started to talk \"Yumi what you did there, exposing these spiders I never knew you are that brilliant, but than again I... Haven't seen you so merciless, there was one second I thought you're like.......... Deliora.\" what was I, was that the reason he didn't move, he considered me as ruthless as Deliora back there \"so you think I killed a village of innocent spiders, because they where weak?\" Gray shoked a bit \"well, they only did what they gad to, you know the natural order.\" I walked closer to him put my finger on he's mouth signaling him to shut up, after a few seconds I removed my finger \"did you notice something.\" Gray only looked at me, why is he looking at me like that? \"THE BIRDS GRAY, the birds are singing trough the nature around us, look at the ground, there you see bugs, how can bugs live here if birds do live here as well, because nature naturally doesn't erase itself, normally which means those spiders where greedy, true they feast 5 years on there human pray but every each of them needed that, nothing else was alive around that village, now look at my eyes and tell me the village worked in a circle of nature, go on Gray..... What are you waiting for!\" Gray nodded \"you're right, sorry I didn't thought that through.\" I punch his shoulder lightly \"I know that's what you are after all, an idiot.\" Gray punched me back also lightly \"stop calling me that.\" I smiled, \"alright alright let us go further now,... Dork.\" Gray followed me \"wait you said you wouldn't call me that either.\" I shrugged \"did I, hmm sorry I lied then.\" I hear him breathing out, guess he accepts then. Soon the evening came in, time to make camp again, everything has its routine this time its my turn to make the fire and Gray makes our sleeping places ready, as I lit the fire Gray  sat next to me, \"Yumi, I really think I've learned that I should trust you more today, even though sometimes it's hard to do so.\" I feel like I've achieved a great victory \"Gray, thank you, but I have a question, as I told you about my point of view of the circle of nature, you stared at me again, what did you thought about, not about a kiss again right?\" Gray remained calm \"no I thought about everything, you know of me, and everything I know of you, I just realized I don't know you, sometimes you act like normal girls would act, sometimes I think your the nicest person in the world, than again sometimes the most evil one, in the end I noticed I don't even now your surname.\" relived that he didn't thought about a kiss again I smiled, \"Gray, I'm a women I have to be a bit mysterious at least, you know how about that you start to be a bit nicer, and I give you some information about me, what do you say?\" Gray shrugged \"if that's the only way, I'll try that, something else I noticed a city as we came here, maybe we should take a ride back, it would be a lot faster.\" shit he really doesn't know much about me, no way I'm taking a ride back home. I noticed my left leg and feet shake about that thought I grapped my leg and feet to pin it down. I hear Grays voice again \"Yumi what are you doing?\" I answered way too quickly, \"oh it's just because we walked so much, my feet hurts that's all!\" Gray nodded, \"than it's a good thing we'll take a ride back tomorrow.\" fuck why did I say that now he thinks I want that as well. \"Oh ehh Gray, I noticed I don't have any jewel with me, it's I'm sorry I can't pay for a ticket, I really would have loved to have that ride, you know it's such a shame.\" Gray grapped my shoulder \"don't worry you gave me all that jewel, I don't mind to pay the ticket for you, it's the least I can do!\" fuuuck he really things he's doing me a favor, \"NOOOO,....... I mean no I ehh uhh can't accept that, it's your hard earned money I don't want you to spend it on me!\" I tried to give him a convincing smile, \"Yumi firstly a ticked isn't that much of a cost, secondly how am I supposed to be nice to you if you deny me being nice to you?\" my words, game over, there is only one way I have to tell him about my motion sickness, or I could knock him out and carry him to the guild, no that's not what I do, but I can't expose that either no one knows about it, but if I take the ride he will know anyway, maybe I should try to convince him tomorrow not to take that ride?</span></div></div>",

I blushed, why is he doing this, this is, I don't want that, I mean it does feel very good, but no my best friend massaging my feet, I tried to rebel, but it feels so nice, he even uses some magic to cool them down. I couldn't do anything else than smile, never have I been woken up better than today. Gray smiled back at me \"glad you like it wasn't sure if I'm good at that.\" I giggled still blushing \"you could do that for a living, Gray maybe this is the place you belong?\" Gray laughed at that \"very funny I only do that because you said they hurt alright.\" it wasn't a joke so, I could imagine waking up like this every morning, \"Gray, are you sure you haven't massaged feet in your life before, you're an expert!\" Gray shrugged it off, I imagined How it would be if he massaged Erzas feet, that might have a funny outcome... Anyway I focused back on Gray and the nice feeling on my feet, he was looking towards me \"Gray what are you thinking about, you stare again?\" Gray responded \"this time I think about a kiss again, sorry Yumi I just can't fight it.\" I blinked at him \"well.... I... I I think if, it's uhh only a kiss, but that's so weird.. I guess it's alright than.\" Gray looked in disbelieve he started to breath stronger than ever before he moved his face closer and I pressed my foot on his lips \"I don't know why you want that, you're weird Gray.\" he breathed in deeply, it's so weird does he like that.... It's so disgusting, suddenly Gray jumped back and started to cough \"WHAT the fuck was that about, Yumi?\" I was confused \"you said you wanted to kiss them!\" Gray spitting and coughing probably trying to get the smell and taste out of his mouth \"what no, how could you think that, I wouldn't even want that if they're freshly washed!! I wanted to kiss you on your lips!\" I started to blush even deeper now \"Gray I told this won't happen, you promised me not to think about that anymore, dork!\" Gray nodded \"alright at least I won't come up with it again!\" he returned to massage my feet \"Gray why are you doing this for me, I denied you? Why are you still massaging my feet?\" Gray sighed \"I hope we're still best friends and I guess I wasn't nice enough towards you, as you said I have to act nicer to find out more about you, if that means to do stuff like that I'll do.\" my hearts racing right now, should I let him kiss me, no he told me it was the last time, but how would it be? I've never kissed someone I do like gray after all, but not like that do I? For now I stay relaxed and let him do. After 10 more minutes he turned to my other feet, I had to stop him, I move my feet away \"I'm sorry Gray I don't feel good about that, don't be that nice, I don't treat you good enough to do that, I swear I change that I will treat you better, but don't be that weird, ok?\" Gray nodded \"it's not like I want to massage your stinky feet.\" I smiled \"I can imagine that.\" without speaking any further, we gathered our stuff adn started to walk, Gray spoke up \"the city is in that Direktion will be nice not to walk for once.\" i have to tell him now \"Gray, even if it was weird what you did, and what happened you know the kiss....\" Gray turned towards me \"please forget that, really do forget it, it never happened, and I don't want to talk about that, you know what never happened.\" I nodded \"still you've done something that felt very nice, so I have to tell you, something about me right?\" Gray gave me a weird smile \"I guess so.\" I've never told anyone, so I took my time to find the rights words \"Gray you know I'm a dragonslayer, like Natsu and he has that, motion sickness you know, maybe it's something, you have as dragonslayer.\" Gray didn't reacted first.... \"are you telling me you have that as well.\"<br>\r\nI nodded \"yes I do, I only drived once, after what I experienced I never stepped into something that moved from alone again, but don't worry, if you want to take a drive, I.. I.. Guess I owe that, after...what not happened of couse...\" Gray considered his options. </span></div></div>",

You a new information, is there something you want to know?\" Gray smiled at me \"if I had known it's so easy, I wouldn't have given you a foot massage you know?\" I do know that, and I do feel sorry \"well, you have a question or not?\" Gray considered a moment, \"would you tell me what happened while you had that quest with Mystogan?\" why is he asking that all of a sudden, I can't tell him, I would abuse Mystogans and gramps trust \"sorry that's one thing I can't tell you, ask something else please, I won't deny an answer no matter what you ask!\" Gray nodded \"I see, than tell me about Sutakira what is your dragon like?\" I always refused to talk about her, but I told him he could ask everything. \"I wouldn't consider her my dragon, it's not like Natsu and Igneel, she is nothing someone would call a parent. I'm only an experiment for her, every day I had to train, and if I didn't pleased her she punished me harshly. Once I asked her why she's holding me captive to train me, her answer was: I want to see you despair, suffer and when you're finally on your knees and beg me to kill you, I might kill you slowly.\" Gray stood before me \"sorry I couldn't know, but it does explain many things.\" I raised an eyebrow \"it does? What exactly does that explain Gray?\" he smiled again \"it does explain how you're so strong, and why you're so cruel in teaching lessons, I guess the spider test, you brought me through, you did it because it was something she would have done.\" how could he... How, he compares me with that vile creature off a dragon, but he doesn't really know her, and it was cruel what I did, I calmed down \"let us go now Gray.\" </span></div></div>",

If you have any questions just ask, alright?\" Gray was greatly confused \"uh huh?.... Well, what's you favorite color?\" he wants to know that? \"Green.\" Gray nod once \"and favorite food?\" why is he asking stupid questions \"don't have one, I'm glad for whatever I get.\" Gray nodded again \"is there something you dream of, a goal you want to achieve?\" I smiled \"to kill Sutakira, guess we're not so different on that one, even if deliora was sealed by Ur I think you know how I feel.\" Gray nodded \"I do, did she kill your parents as well?\" I shrugged \"I don't know all my memories given I was her experiment, slave or however you want to put it.\" he swung his arm around my shoulder and gently hugged me \"I can't imagine how it is to be that for a dragon, I know a demon mercilessly kills, but to be a dragons experiment. It must've been horrible, if you want to talk about it I'm here.\" the moment he hugged me I wanted to rebel, but he didn't do anything more and it was gently, to talk about Sutakira is always hard for me, but I admit it's a lot easier when your hugged in friendly way. \"Gray I.... I'll tell you an example, how she treated me. on my 4th birthday, she told me she had a present for me on top of a mountain, I had to fly to get the present, of couse I couldn't fly so I tried to climp that mountain, I need 3 weeks to get on top,.... /Sutakira gave me insects to eat and water from the swamps, that was everything I had to eat and drink anyway/..... As I finally reached the top, I saw a dead dog starved on that Mountains top, Sutakira landed in front of me I screamed and cried 'Stop crying if you had flight here your present would be still alive, but since you couldn't fly you don't need those wings of yours' she put both my arms between her claws, and snapped breaking my bones. Than she said 'don't waste time you have 3 hours if you aren't down to start your daily training I will punish you!'.. I.. Don't.. I won't tell what her punishments are all about.\" as I told gray all this I started to cry and tremble, he responded by tightening his hug \"you don't have to, Yumi I didn't know you had such a past, don't worry something like this will never happen to you again, I'm sure of that!\" even though I cry I'm a bit happy to tell him, to speak about it, to trust someone to so much, I calmed down and leaned against Gray \"thank you, for well for everything.\" Gray smiled \"don't mind it, if you want to talk about whatever, I have an open ear.\" I nodded, I can't rember when but I fell asleep, when I woke up now I lay on top of Gray who was still sleeping. WHAT DID HAPPEN HOW WHEN WHY? I tried not to scream, and slowly tried to get away without waking him up, but he was still hugging me, which means couldn't get up unnoticed, my hearts racing my face blushing I thought about how nice he was towards me, and how he wanted to kiss me twice, well he wouldn't mind if I try it out wouldn't he? No I can't do that I judged him for that it isn't right, suddenly I hear him yawn he wakes up! Fuck how I don't want that, he would think I have some of those weird feelings. He opened his eyes, what should I do now, there was only one thing I could do \"AAAA LET GO OFF ME PERVERT!!!!\" *SMACK* I slapped him a red hand shaped on his cheek again, did I really do that, did I blame him? I even slapped, that's so fucked up right now, however he instantly released me I quickly stood up \"YOU'RE SICK!!\" stop why am I saying this, he was so nice to me I'm happy to have a friend like him. Gray nodded \"I'm sorry I swear I don't know what happened, Yumi please believe me we must have fallen asleep yesterday, I'm so sorry!\" he's sorry? He doesn't have to be sorry, I should be sorry about what I thought. Calming down now I can control what I say \"oh God, Gray I slapped you again, I know it wasn't your fault, let forget about it alright, this never happened.\" Gray gave an awkward smile \"Many things didn't happen on this mission.\" I started to blush again \"well let's go home now!\" he nodded </span></div></div>",

Whatever I got back to fairy hills I quickly got to my room, and entered the bathroom, I really need a shower right now. Under the shower I started to wash myself, why did all that happen, practically Gray did \"kiss\" me I had to think about it while I scrupped my feet, firstly I thought its just disgusting but now I don't know how to feel about it, did I like it? Or did I like... Gray doing it.... Anyway after I was done I dryed myself and slipped into some underwear, a black skirt and a white blouse, I stepped to my mirror and started to brush my hair, normally I do that 10 minutes maximum but now I took my time \"Maybe I should take my appearience more serious, from now on.\" telling that to myself, why do I want to look better all of a sudden? I do feel happy, but I don't want to be happy, I guess everyone wants to be happy, but not this way! After I finished brushing my Hair it didn't seem to be any better than before.... I saw that little wooden crate once Cana and Mira forced me to shop with them, I buyed that Make-up box, well there is always the first time, I opened the box and.. I have no clue how to use it, all those colors which one comes where.... Uhhh... Suddenly I remembered it is not like I'm going out today, I'll go to sleep now, so it doesn't matter. I slipped out my clothes again and layed down on my bed, it's so soft, after a few days nature this is just perfect, I wonder if I should try to get on some make up tomorrow? Anyway time to get some rest, it's very easy to sleep on my bed.... I woke up in the morning, this time a quick shower is enough, slipped into my clothes adding a pair of black ankle socks and my boots, I looked at the box and sighed, i would probably fail by trying to use that. As I walked out someone hugged me from behind \"I was worried about you, what took you so long?\" it was Miras soft voice \"well I always need a week or two to find my way back here. Since when are you worried about me Mira?\" she tightens her hug \"ever since you came back bleeding, three times poisened, without a voice? Oh no wait there's literally no reason to be worried about you!\" I touched her hands \"thank you Mira for your worries. Well Mira?\" Mira stopped hugging me and turned me around \"What is it Yumi?\" </span></div></div>",

Now come in there you go!\" with that she gently pushed me inside her room, I wonder if I made a mistake right now. Mira was all happily going through her stuff \"where to begin... Oh of couse, Yumi sit on my bed.\" I did as I was told, a few minutes later Mira sat next to me, with a huge box where she put everything she needs right now. I think a few of the things in there are used for torture, but well it's Mira how bad can it be? Firstly she took out a magic mirror that was now flying, \"so Yumi firstly, I'll brush your hair, not that you did it bad or something it's just you know.\" I nodded \"yeah I know I'm not good at that that's why I asked you in the first place.\" Mira smiled and started to brush, I wondered how but I felt like my hair was smoothing every time she gently brushes over it. After some time Mira asked me \"Yumi, not that I mind you wanting to look better, but is there a reason normally you don't do stuff without a reason?\" I blushed \"no there... Is no particular reason!\" Mira giggled \"I see, say what happened on the quest, how did it go?\" I told her we succeeded, and that it was pretty easy, even though Gray couldn't pull it off himself, I tell her how I found out that the villagers hiring us where the male spiders. I don't know how it's possible but my hair looks so much better now! I smile proudly. \"and now to point number two, to your eyebrows\" she starts to rip off some hairs until it's all evenly high, than she started to take the first make-up tools, as she starts to do stuff I closed my eyes sometimes she pressed something on my cheek sometimes a tiny pencil was near my eyes, on and on after an hour I opened my eyes, I was a bit surprised she did so much I thought I would look like a clown, but it was my face a bit more colorful and somehow my eyes looking better, she didn't my eyes where closed how. I smiled at Mira \"thanks that looks perfect!\" as I was to stand up, Mira laughed and grapped my shoulder \"Ohhh no, so easy I will not let you go, Yumi-Chan.\" she forced me back down, i guess this will take its time. Mira than massaged my shoulders \"What why are you doing this?\" Mira smiled \"to become truly beautiful you have to feel perfect yourself, confidence is a mayor part of beauty!\" this indeed feels very good, After some time Miras hands go Down to massage my arms \"Yumi is there anything else you want to talk about?\"</span></div></div>",

And then he started to act weirdly nice around me..... He admitted he wanted to kiss me,we talked that through and I thought it would end... He got even nicer around me, on the way back the first morning, he just waked me up with a foot massage, after I make him beg my feet because of that test in the spider cave, I told you before, I guess he got curios about them, it felt weird, but let me tell you he's an expert, he even used his magic to cool them down, I had to Stopp him massage them!\" as I told her all this Mira giggled sometimes or gasped in shock not believing what she hears \"Yumi, I can't believe that, Gray massage your feet, staring at you like that, having those thoughts, you don't lie to me do you?\" I turned my head to her \"oh no I tell you I do not lie, he even kissed my left feet, and breathed strongly, and haven't had washed my feet for days!\" Mira gasped again \"oh my, this must be pretty tough to have him as a teammate huh?\" well he does want to do much things alone, it's hard to be teaming with him so \"yes, yes it is he's so stubborn!\" Mira blinked twice now tending to my hands, using a nailfile \"he forces you to do stuff?\" as he always tries to do something alone it's more like \"he just wants me to stay still.\" Mira gasped again, why is she gasping there is nothing by that? \"Do you like Gray being like this?\" what a silly question he's my best friend \"Yes I do like him very much!\" Mira finished my nails, and hugged me \"alright <br>\r\nYumi-Chan, I don't judge you two, ok I'm always on your side anyway.\" what? Doesn't judge us for what, I noticed her removing my boots and socks \"Mira what are you doing?\" Mira smiled towards me \"I told you I'm with you, if you two are into that I'll make your feet pretty enough to eat from, for Gray!\" WHAT SHE THINGS HE LIKED IT, AND THAT I LIKED IT... \"Mira wait its not auwww\" Mira started to scratch skin of of my foot \"since you've never done that it might hurt a bit.\" after she was done with both feets skin she took out another nailfile, and started to work \"Mira wait this is a misunderstanding!\" Mira looked up \"Misunderstanding?\" \"look im not into getting my feet kissed, and Gray probably not into kissing them, he wanted to kiss me on my lips... /starting to blush/... I misunderstood him and pressed my foot on his mouth, Gray and I agreed it never happened... Oh my God why did I tell you all this, I shouldn't have I betrayed him he was so nice to me I thought we really strengthen our friendship, and I betrayed him by telling you all this, I'm so horrible!\"<br>\r\nMira giggled \"I see but you can only speak for yourself, maybe Gray was only shocked, or pretended to not like them, or it was because they weren't washed, but I get it now, you fell in love with him right? Getting all blushy talking about he wanted to kiss you, and starting to want to be prettier right after he tried to kiss you, no chance denying that, Yumi-Chan!\" I blushed in a deep red \"oh ah no that's a coincident, nothing more!\" my hearts racing is she right? Am I.. No.. Yes.. Maybe it's so weird \"Mira look I'm not, in love with Gray.\" yeah that's defenitely the fact \"you see I do not love him alright?\" Mira started to tend to my toenails again \"you know he might like your feet when they're all pretty, from your looks he will fall for you, if he hasn't been fallen already. As you tried to deny it 3 times in a row I guess I'm right!\"<br>\r\nI really can't think straight right now \"maybe you are right.\" I let her do her work after she's finished she touched my legs, thigh \"what are you, MIRA!\" she grabbed my ass and than my waist and moved her hand up, she gently pressed my boobs together, and fondled them for a few seconds \"MIRA WHAT ARE YOU YOI.. /I giggled because it tickles/.. STOP THAT!!\" Mira ignoring me walked towards her closed and took a black dress out of it, \"it's 3 years old but it should fit your measurements, your clothes are cute, but you go out to kill now!\" I blushed I never wore a dress like that, Mira grinned at me \"so off with your clothes, Yumi-Chan!\" what right now uhh, as I hesitated Mira unbottened my shirt, exposing my upper body, I couldn't believe her, I wanted to say something but didn't know what instead Mira spoke \"Yumi, your body is in an perfect shape, if things with Gray don't work out you know I would take you instantly!\" I don't know why but I got all blushy \"Mira I what?\" Mira giggled as she took of my shirt \"I'm kidding, but still you've got a great body!\" is she really joking? Probably, she is weird as everyone else seem to be, but might as well play along now. I slipped out of my skirt and took Miras dress, it's emberrassing \"how... Mira how?\" I couldn't say it I don't know how to get it on. But of couse she understood and helped me to fit in \"are you sure my measurements fit? It's hard to breath!\" Mira giggled \"that's totally normal Yumi.\" she started to bound the lose strings on my back, this caused my boobs to be pushed up a bit, and to be pressed together gently. I looked down and see my presented cleavage and of couse blushed again \"I it looks good, does it?\" Mira adjusted the dress so it sits perfectly \"you look brilliant Yumi-Chan!\" I nodded slowly, it is weird to wear this, but Mira knows best, what to wear and how to appear. As I was to grab my socks Mira stopped me \"well no you need something more elegant, and who knows Gray might like to take a glance at your feet, socks would destroy that!\" as I told her already Gray isn't, oh whatever. Mira took out some black high heels, probably part of that dress I'm wearing, she kneeled before me and slipped my feet in. After she was done I wanted to walk out, but I couldn't hold my balance luckily Mira, catches me \"Yumi are you alright?\" I nodded \"how is one supposed to walk in those things?\" Mira still holding me \"well you know many would find it cute to see you struggling to walk, but as I said I sent you out to kill, you should walk around here a bit before going outside, don't worry I'll catch you if you fall!\" I smiled at Mira, although I don't know how all that turned out, I wanted to have a bit make-up for starters, and now I'm in a black alluring dress all made up practicing to walk in high-heels, to hit on Gray? He already wanted to kiss me isn't this a bit to much, less would work to or not? Now it doesn't help it I try to learn to walk I have to be catched several times by Mira before I could walk more then 3 steps in a row. There I'm an s class wizard of fairy tail, a dragonslayer trained by the creature called Sutakira, unable to walk in these shoes. I sighed \"maybe this was a bad idea to begin with, this all this it's not me.\" Mira looked a bit confused \"you don't have to change your personality it's just showing, that it's important for you, to look good and imagine Gray knows you for years, you never wore this you never made your nails like this, you never brushed your hair so long! He would question why, why is she doing it today? what reason might she have? You go to him and ask him on a date, or to go out for walk to restaurant whatever. Gray will have his answer, for me? I she doing all this for me? She really wow she did it for ME! that's what happens than!\" my hearts racing again would he really respond that way and did she say date! \"Mira really sorry I love how I look but I don't think it's what I want!\" I was to walk out but again I lose my balance, Mira catches me again \"Yumi, I never thought you would give up so quick, you don't have to be emberrased I'm the only one that sees you here, and I'm not laughing at you never will!\" is she right am I giving up because I'm embarrassed? Maybe now it's gotten so far alright, I will walk! As I Start to practice again Mira smiled and walked besides me if I lose balance again, after 2 hours my feet hurt but now I'm able to walk with them, slowly but good enough for Mira to approve. \"am I ready now?\" Mira took my hand \"no, you look perfect, you walk at least not like an elephant, that you may practice the next days, but one thing you need, the last touch! This will do two things: firstly you'll be able to do the last hit to kill, as you won't be to shy on doing the last needed hit, secondly it makes sure your last hit is a success!\" what is she talking about, last hit to kill, guaranteed success, I watched confused as I saw Mira put on her lipstick on her own lips, how is that supposed to help me? As Mira was done she turned towards me \"Mira what is this about? I mean how is thi.... Mmmhhg!\" Mira kissed me!!! She hugged me tightly, I was so shocked I didn't move, why is she... What.. And moreover why do I... Her lips are soft and taste sweet its like, Strawberry? I don't know why but I hugged her back, in that second Mira stopped \"well that's a surprise, I wanted to know how long you would let me do that, but that reaction, wow I joked at hitting on you now I might, but it wouldn't be fair, Gray was so long with you now go!\" emberrassed at what happened, still I wanted to know \"and.. Uhh how did that, do the last touch?\" Mira smiled at me \"firstly the first kiss I mean the first real kiss, ice is broken, so you have it easier to kiss Gray, secondly even if your not 'well trained' at kissing you will give him something very nice, it looks like your not having anything on your lips, so he will be surprised by a gentle taste of strawberry!\" oh my how far does she think I go \"I I uhh never said I kiss him or something like that did I?\" Mira smiled \"just go now Yumi-Chan!\" I started to tremble, now others can see me like this! I'm walking and walking.I hear Mira giggle \"I know your not so fast in these shoes but don't walk backwards!\" with that she pushed me out of her room and closed her door, no way back now!</span></div></div>",

Slowly, suddenly I heard someone behind me \"Oh my, what happened to you!\" I frightened, which caused me to lose balance, but the person behind me cached me, it was Bisca \"what happened to you?\" great now she will laugh, it does look silly seeing me like this! \"You look BRILLIANT I wonder who is the lucky guy?\" huh? She isn't laughing? Not only Mira thinks it looks good? Bisca helps me to stand straight \"wow Yumi, I mean you always looked great but this is just wow, I wonder if alzack wou... Uhh forget about that alright, whoever you going to meet, he would be a fool not to fall for you!\" why does she know I'm going to \"Bisca why do you think I'm going to meet someone?\" Bisca smiled \"well you've never been one to care much what she's wearing, and your hair, your eyes cheeks hand finger, everything what reason would you have to do that, if not that?\" I blushed even more, so everyone who's going to see me, will know I want to ... Oh God I snapped back as Bisca spoke \"Yumi how did you do that, I mean you've never, how did you do it?\" I calmed down a bit \"Mira, she.... Helped me, or moreover did everything.\" Bisca nodded \"oh I might have to talk with her than! Oh and good luck!\" as she walked away she gave me a wink. After that I needed 10 minutes to start walking again but this time with a bit more confidence. I walked through the corridor as I saw Levy standing infront off me, Staring in disbealive \"Yumi is that you?\" I nodded at her nervously \"yes, Levy it's me, looks funny right?\" Levy blinked at me \"are you kidding? Your not looking funny, you look great! I've always been kind of jealous of your body but THIS! I can't believe it, Yumi whoever it is you made that for is very lucky!\" she smiled at me \"well it's not like I did it, it was Mira who made me change that way.\" Levy nods \"hmm you think she could help me too, well at least a bit I don't have so much to expose anyway.\" I remembered my cleavage being a exposed it's so weird, if you've told me a week ago this would happen I would have killed you. \"ohh Levy, don't be like that, I'm sure Mira can do much for you as well!\" am I a walking promotion? Levy nodded \"you really think that? Alright asking wouldn't hurt so much, and you'll do it I believe in you!\" as I stepped outside I heared a familiar voice I'd rather not like to hear, It was Evergreens \"oh hoh what do we have here, a little girl, wanting to play the adult game of beauty, haha you look like a slut if you ask me, the real fairy queen!\" I knew she wouldn't say anything nice, so I shrugged it off walked further, but she stepped infront of me \" Oh the slut doesn't know how to walk probably?\" I shrugged \"what do you want Evergreen?\" she laughed \"well maybe you should wear more decent clothe for starters, or you need a tattoo on your breasts, how much thay may cost for one hour, how you present them probably not so much huh, slut!\" normally I could just threaten her, but this time I don't want to ruin the dress, and even if I know I can't take her words for full, it still does hurt. \"Ever please let me go!\" she shrugged \"it's no fun with you anyway bitch!\" she walked away, well if she's here that means Laxus is here as well, that could be really bad, why are they here right now dammit! But still I walked further, it got a bit easier to walk at least, there I am standing before the guild hall wondering how they all would react, and how Gray would react.... </span></div></div>",

Until \"WHAAAAAT, WOOOW... WHAT DID HAPPEN TO YOU.....HOW BEAUTYFUL.... NEVER THOUGHT TO SEE HER LIKE THIS.... ISN'T THAT MIRAS OLD DRESS?.... DID THE ROOM HEAT UP ALL OF A SUDDEN?\" in a guild where peoble like Mira or Erza are, to hear peoble be surprised by my looks, I feel proud, in a very very weird way, I gulped and looked around, where is that dork? As I couldn't spot him I walked towards gramps \"good mor... No its afternoon already, uhh I mean good afternoon Master, uhm do you know where Gray is?\" Makarov looked at me up and down \"I see, I'm sorry but he isn't here, the thing is natsu broke the rules and took an s class quest, Gray tried to stop him but it seems he couldn't, now Erza is on her way to bring them back, and to execute the punishment.\"................................................................ ...<br>\r\n............................................................................ .......<br>\r\n............................................................. I turned around and started to walk back, as Makarov stopped me \"anyway Mystogan asking for your help again, here is the letter, without a word I took the letter and left the guild hall, like I go on a quest now, how I'm in these stupid clothes and my stupid looks and that stubid situation, I took off that stupid shoes and walked normally back to fairy hills. As I entered the building I saw Bisca and Levy talking to Mira, who noticed me \"Oh no, Yumi your back..... Way to soon, what happened?\" I smiled at her \"nothing... I mean really nothing, nothing at all, as he wasn't there.\" I walked into my room, Mira quickly slipped in as well before I could close my door \"Mira I don't want to talk now.\" Mira nodded \"I know but it's my fault I shouldn't have overtook it with you, I mean everything's perfect, to not consider he might not be there to see you.... I'm so sorry Yumi!\" I remain smiling \"you don't have to be, everything's fine, today was only the first and last day I dress that stubidly with stubidly brushed hair stupidly made nails and....\" Mira hugged me, I instantly started to cry destroying the make-up by my eyes and on my cheeks, Mira tightens her hug \"sssshhhhh Yumi, you know it's not your neither it's Grays fault, sometimes bad things happen, I'm here everything's fine.\" while still crying in Miras shoulder I hear Levy \"Yumi I don't know what happened but I'm here if you need me.\" she hugged me from the side, and then Bisca \"I know we haven't had so much to do with each other, but you can count on me to!\" Bisca hugged me from behind. They're all so nice but there was another voice this time a loud one \"YUMIII-Chwann YOU CAN'T JUST.. UHH.. ENTER THE GUhicsILD LIKE THAT AND hicks THAN.. UHH...OHH JUST RUN AWAY.../the voice got quiet and serious/.. wait are you crying, Yumi what happened, doesn't matter if everyone's hugging you, I'll do as well!\" it was Cana she was hugging my other side, now I'm sorrounded by 4 people that care for me, I couldn't stop my tears to run down my cheeks, they didn't talk, they didn't move. It was clear they wouldn't go as long as I cryed, and it took a long time.... After 2 hours I stopped to cry Cana and Bisca silently leaved my room, Levy leaved as well but before she did she said \"you know what, Yumi... I want you to know.... You can rely on me no matter what!\" I nodded at her which made her smile with pride. Now I'm alone with Mira again \"why Mira, why is this happening to me!\" Mira gave me a smile \"sometimes such things happen, but that's no reason to give it up, you know.\" I shrugged \"I was serious this is the last day I'll walk around like this, I'm humiliated, hurt, fuck I feel so stupid.\" Mira had a sad expression \"well sometimes it helps to distract yourself do you mind if I make your face pretty again? If it's the last day you walk around that way do it proberly!\" I nodded alright she quickly washed away, the flown make-up. And then put it back on \"well now you need something else to disstrackt you.\" I nod \"well I do have that letter from Mystogan...\" Mira immediately jumped up \"perfect, you should read it, maybe a quest together alone in the moonlight while you're this beautyful!\" what after Gray wasn't there she's already trying to make me jump on someone else? Well I should read the letter anyway:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi I'm sorry what happened last time, but as you're the only one who knows about me, I can only talk to you about this, I will be at the hills behind the city for 2 days. After what's happened thanks for at least reading the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't notice Mira stepped besides me \"the hills, and he waits 2 days for you! How Romantic.\" is she serious \"Mira you just can't read this letter, Mystogan tries to stay hidden, secondly it's not like that, we seen us only once and it is probably another dangerous suggestion.\" Mira gave me a gentle shove \"don't worry my lips are sealed, and I know that Mystogan don't ask for help in anyway if it's not important, but still you look just perfect, who knows!\" I can't believe her! I sighed \"look mira I'll meet him, but there will nothing happen like this, we barely know each other!\" Mira smiled and kissed me again????!!! I was not as shocked as the first time, but still it's confusing, I hugged her again why?! This time Mira didn't retreat, she still kisses me, after few more seconds I pushed her away, Mira giggled \"just in case something happens now your lips are having that gentle taste again!\" Mira is very strange, but still she does it out of a kind heart, I guess. \"even though it won't happen, thank you for helping me. A shame Gray wasn't here.\" Mira hugged me \"A shame for him! Not for you, you still showed the whole guild, how perfectly your looks are!\" Mira stopped her hug I smiled back at her \"I guess so, well better change into something more practical.\" Mira again gently pushed me out my room \"not gonna happen, 1 day you said nothing less.\" she closed the door and I hear a *CLICK* wait did she, yes she did, how did she got my key? \"Mira, that's not funny I can't do anything in these clothes!\" no responses........ </span></div></div>",

Uhh did I disturb something, with someone, sorry I couldn't know you had a date.\" even Mystogan knows thinks that immediately \"NO, no you're the only one I meet tonight!\" he remain silent for a few seconds still holding me, before he pushed me away \"I... I am, you look great, but what I wanted to talk about. The Anima, I can't hold it for much longer, one day it will try to, suck up all magic of this world... /he gives me some pills in a bottle, he gave me one the last time I tried to eat the Anima/... If it comes to that take one pill yourself, and give one to all your guildmages when you see them. Don't do it now wait for the Anima to activate, alright!\" I nodded a bit nervous because of my appearience and him still holding me with one arm, he noticed that and quickly helped me to stand up straight again \"are you alright Yumi, if you have a fever, you should go rest now!\" as he touched my forehead, my heart raced, why didn't I wanted to be with Gray? Or is it just the feeling to be admired that makes me feel that way? He said I look great, didn't he? \"would you.. Let me see your face again?\" what a silly question Yumi, real smooth... Huh? He removed his mask \"I guess no one's here at night.\" he is very handsome! What no I shouldn't feel that way towards him he's mostly a stranger! But still \"You have such a pretty face, Mystogan.\" as I told him that he slightly blushed \"Yumi I don't get it why are you saying this.\" well that's easy \"it's the truth that's why!\" Mystogan stepped close to me \"Yumi I.. You look nice, great no I mean you look beautiful!\" I blushed is this even happening right now I responded nervously while playing with my smooth hair \"thanks.\" that is all? More I can't say... How weird \"Yumi we shouldn't, I'm not from this world, I mean you look like you're from another world, but I'm literally not from here.\" what? What is he thinking we would do? \"Wait what shouldn't we do?\" Mystogan looked at me \"well I thought you... I mean we.... I was wrong than luckily so to speak, for a moment I thought we would kiss, well that would have been bad, because of this Anima stuff!\" wait, Gray wants to kiss me, Mystogan thought we would do that, Mira well she did it twice!\" how would it feel to kiss him? Is he really glad it didn't happen, why am I thinking about it right know, Gray.... Mira I'm thinking about her too? </span></div></div>",

Now our body's are pressed against each other, he's returning the kiss! He brought his left arm around my waist and his right hand was now on the back of my head pulling me stronger against his mouth, now I was unable to stop the kiss on my own, Mystogan alone could decide how long this kiss will be! I feel powerless, I fear to feel this way, I start to tremble, he doesn't seem to notice. Also I do like... No love that kiss the fear of being powerless made me trying to stop, but I wasn't able to or my body didn't wanted me to free myself. After minutes the fear overtook me I start to cry, that second Mystogan immedietly released me \"I'm what.. I'm sorry I did I hurt you? I shouldn't have done this the first place but.. You did it and I was so overwhelmed! This light sweet taste and, I shouldn't talk about it anymore!\" wow that was something! It was so nice, s I stepped towards him and planted a second kiss on him \"you didn't hurt me, Mystogan I loved how you.. You know it's just I felt powerless and this made me.../he kissed me back/... I guess that's how it is now, are we... Uhm in a..... Relationship now?\" Mystogan didn't respond \"Mystogan?

I realized I kissed a person that name I didn't know off, but it was great! I hugged him and whispered \"Je-ra-ru.\" smiling, how did all this happen, after a few minutes he kissed me again \"well, I have to go now.\" he has to go? Of course he has to, I forget about this Anima stuff, but we'll I can't change that \"and you know how often we can see each other?\" he tightened the hug \"I don't know, but whenever I find the time I'll give Makarov a letter, then you can decide if you meet with me alright?\" I nodded \"I guess that's how it is.\" he departed but didn't go away, I gave him another last kiss \"go now it's, ok.\" he smiled and walked away.

MYSTOGAN!!!! Mystogan was amazing.\" I started to explain how wen ended up kissing and how he holded everything, of couse nothing about Anima. Mira was done \"I'm very happy for you, but also a bit sad for Gray, it wasn't his fault Natsu took that quest! But as long as your happy I'm as well!\" Gray...... Right everything I did for him, I forgot about him while I was with Jeraru! But that shows that I haven't had feelings for him right? Well I guess it doesn't matter \"thank you Mira.\" she smiled \"always!\" she gave me a quick hug and then leaved the room. I just smiled there I was laying on my back, my Heart calming down finally, wondering when I will see him again! As midnight falls upon me I started to make myself ready for bed, as I realized it's not only taking on but also taking off the dress that I can't do! So I had to ask Mira to help me, I hope she doesn't mind waking her! So I walked to Miras room, I knocked on the door, the door opened and Mira yawned \"what, Yumi? It's a bit late but come in.\" I followed Mira she was only wearing black underwear, every single part of her body show's why she was able to let everyone notice me like that. Mira spoke in a sleepy voice \"so what can I do for you sweety?\" I shouldn't get any problems with it, she already helped me getting this thing on \"could take off this dress?\" Mira smiled \"oh forget you would need help with that, but you know it's a bit like cheating on Mystogan, letting yourself undress from the girl that kissed you twice!\" what, is that the case? Is this really cheating? \"no Mira it's alright, your just helping and it's not like one of us loves the other so it's alright!\" Mira started to lose the knots behind my back, \"who are you to judge that, you don't know what I feel, Yumi.\" I shrugged \"your kidding again I get it.\" Mira took of my dress, as we stood there now both only in underwear, Mira hugged me \"I love you Yumi, I really do!\" what but but, I blushed \"but why would you shove me to meet with Gray, and then with Mystogan, why Mira?\" Mira giggled \"Yumi there are more than one form of love, I told you, you're like a little sister for me! Therefore I love you, and want you to be happy in every way, just like I want Elfman to be happy as well! Although I wouldn't dress him up that way.\" I feel a bit dump but also very good, Mira is really someone you want as a sister. As she released me from her hug, she wished me a good night, and slipped under her blanket \"Good night to you too! And I love you too Mira!\" Mira stayed quiet, guess I should go back to my room now. As I leaved Miras room, I closed the door quietly, and run to my room, after all that happened today its very easy to fall asleep, the next morning I decide to</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I imagined what Sutakira would say, if she known I'm all happy, and haven't trained for a week. \"I'LL KILL YOU!... TWICE!\" yeah that would be it, First for being happy and second for not having trained! I feel her shadow looming over me every time I got too happy, but I won't let her destroy this! I made myself ready and took on a training suit, as I was walking outside I saw Mira, Levy and Bisca sitting on the table again, they didn't notice me, they're clearly asking Mira about Beauty stuff, as I couldn't care less about it, at least as long as I'm not meeting Jeraru that is. So I let them be for now, I jogged to my typical training, It was a lake inside the forest. \"first things first!\" I sat down to meditate, remembering Sutakira \"FIRST RULE YOU VERMIN, ALWAYS STAY CALM, IN A FIGHT OR I'LL BREAK ONE OF YOUR BONES!\" I have to admit to stay calm really helps in many fights! I just remained silent breathing, I smell the earth, the trees, plants and the water, I remain that way for few minutes. Now I'm going to do some training for my pure physical power, sit ups, push ups 400 times each, that took some time as well, after that I stand on one hand for 30 minutes before changing to stand on the other. After I'm done with that I stood up on my feet, now I will focus on magic training, I gathered magic power and released it around me, this caused the lake to shake I repeated that for hours until I couldn't do it anymore, I got on my knees, it feels nice to get all out, I closed my eyes for a moment, I lifted my legs to the air and stretched them, I holded them in this position, Sutakira only allowed to pause in that position. Don't know why I still do it I 'paused' as long as I could hold my legs up there, after 2 hours they've had a burning in pain, so I opened my eyes and stood up again, it's afternoon right now. My body arches in pain, but in the meantime my magic recovered a bit, so again gather and relieve!.... On and on.... After im all nearly out, this should be enough for now! I walked back home to take a shower, as I entered my room. I saw a lot of dresses, shirts even underwear on my bed, and shoes on the ground before it, on the top of the dress pile, is that black dress Mira made me wore yesterday, why are they all here? I shrugged it off, and took the shower, as I was done I looked at the clothes on my bed, are those all from Mira? Should I put something on, from her these all seem to fit me, why does she have those clothes anyway, her boobs alone are way too big for them. I took some red mulberrysilked underwear its thin and in some places you can look through! Wich makes a pattern on the visible parts, they feel very nice and smooth on my skin. As I saw myself in the mirror, I blushed this thong and bra its like wearing nothing! I gulped and looked at the other clothes, I took a black business skirt, and short white shirt it was open like a jacket, but there weren't any buttons as well, just a string on both sides, so I figured they have to be tied together in a knot. So I did after I was done dressing I look at the mirror \"you can see through the shirt too!\" why would anyone wear these outside, I wonder if Mystogan would approve.... Mystogan where is he. I remembered Mira telling me I should practice to walk in high heels, a few of the shoes are these type. Put a pair on ND started to walk my room up and down. This is harder than my training today. My legs still hurt and now my feet do the same... </span></div></div>",

And look here what's with those!\" Mira took a normal black shirt and a blue jeans from the top of the cloth pile to the left. She was right of couse. Mira continued \"admit you decided to wear these on your own accord, and judging to the bra I can imagine what's under your skirt!\" my face turned into a deep red color I turned away, Mira laughed \"Yumi I gave you these clothes so you wear them, don't be shy around me!\" I started to talk and ask questions \"Mira, why are you giving me your clothes, why do you have such clothes in the first place, what have I done that you consider me a little sister, why are you here????\" Mira smiled \"first: my old clothes don't fit me anymore, and in the past I always gave my clothes to lisanna, we haven't had much back in the days. Second: did you forget I'm a model for sorcerer weekly, the more skin showing clothes are from there, and I guess I couldn't bear to throw them away. Third: nothing, I just decided on my own to see you this way. fourth: I'm here because I wanted to thank you, for last night you said you love me too and it's the first time I think someone said that with honest feelings.\" after my questions answered I calmed down \"you don't have to thank me for that, I do love you it's just the truth.\" Mira happily hugged me \"well I'll leave you to explore your more womanly characteristics now!\" and that, she did leave my room, it's not like I can wear those clothes somewhere anyway undressed the shirt and skirt, I layed the clothes piles on the ground, my closet has not enough roo for all this, and then layed on my bed, relaxing.... </span></div></div>",

His fist was hitting the air now, but instead of letting him fall I catched him. He must've thought it was a fighting move as he struggled but I just hugged him, soon he stopped struggling as he realized that \"Yumi, what is going on!\" I tightened the hug \"silly you are silly, taking an s class quest, did you expect I wasn't worried you idiot!\" Natsu seemed to be ashamed \"Everything worked out, good so it's alright, but I promise not to go on an s class quest anymore, at least as long as I'm not one!\" if he hadn't promised that I would have slapped him \"than it's alright for me.\" after I'm done with natsu. I turn towards Happy, and stroke his head \"I'm also happy you're healthy, following Natsu to that island, your one brave Cat!\" He was very happy about that. Natsu however \"why am I silly, and Happy brave, we did the same thing?\" ignoring his statement he started to argue with Happy. I myself turned around to face Lucy \"I know we haven't talked so much with each other, but still I'm happy you're back as well, mind if I hug you?\" Lucy smiled \"you're hugging a lot, I guess it's alright.\" with the permission I quickly hugged her \"thanks for keeping an eye on Natsu!\" I hear Natsu again \"AS IF SHE HAS TO PROTECT ME!\" Lucy nodded \"true it's the other way around.\" I shrugged \"can't remember saying anything about protect, just keep an eye on him.\" Lucy nodded smiling, while Natsu mumbled something. Erza looked at me with cold eyes \"I don't need anything from you, just let me out of your hugging worried stuff!\" she's always like this, but now I'm going to do something about it. \"Erza, is this your weakness I nice little hug?\" Erza stood there with hate written on her face \"don't you dare.\" I started to back of, I thought, hugging her could maybe help but than again, it's way to dangerous. I was tortured by a dragon but still fear Erza.... That's something, Erza walked away. I turn towards Gray, should I pretend nothing happened? Does he know I asked for him, as I was all dressed up did someone tell him? Does he have feelings for me? Do I have for him? No, and even if Mystogan.... What should I do, before I could decide Gray grapped my arm and calmly said \"would you please come with me.\" I did follow him, what is he going to do? He wants to talk outside the guild?.... In privacy? Oh God he's not going to, I'm with edolas Jeraru now! But why am I thinking he would do that, do I want him to? We stopped at the river that's inside the city. Gray sat on the ground, I sat besides him. He isn't talking, why? Can't he just say what he wants?..............<br>\r\n................. <br>\r\n............... <br>\r\n\"Gray look if you have to say something, do it.\" Gray remained silent..........<br>\r\n............. <br>\r\n........... <br>\r\nUgh that's silly, as I wanted to stand up he finally said \"Deliora.\" huh? Why is he saying that name? \"Deliora was there at Galuna island, an old friend more a former brother of mine tried to release him, and succeeded, but he was already dead in that ice. I wanted to talk to you about that. You know I faced my greatest fear!\" after hearing this I didn't thought about anything, I hugged him as tight as possible \"oh my God, Gray I'm so sorry I wasn't with you, I'm supposed to be your best friend, and you had to face that thing without me!\" Gray quickly responded \"Yumi it hurts.\" I remained hugging him \"I know, if I had to see Sutakira I would as well....\" Gray yelled \"NO I MEAN YES BUT YOU'RE HURTING ME!\" what? I stopped hugging him, I wanted to ask him how I hurt him, but he was trying to catch his breath, than I knew how I hurt him \".... Sorry...\"  Gray grapped my shoulders \"don't be, as I wanted to tell you I faced my fear, and it's time to tell you. I love you!\" oh no, that's bad my hearts racing why? Fuck I.. Mystogan I'm with him am I? Gray started to pull me towards him, Is he going to kiss me no I can't let that happen I grap his Jacket and</span></div></div>",

Would have done that you know.\" he thought I dressed for him! Strangely it is true and I wanted that, he confessed his love and I feel somewhat great about it, but I can't my heart races but why?

And clearly you don't love me so, stop hugging me, please Yumi this is torture for me!\" I f he would have been there as I was... I would have but now I can't, I wanted to touch his shoulder but he evaded quickly \"stop just stop, I can't please leave me be.\" I can't leave him \"I'm your teammate Gray I won't leave you, after you've encountered Deliora, you seriously thinking I would leave you?\" Gray got angry at this \"are you kidding me, stop caring you weren't there as everything happened so stop talking like you do know anything!\" this made me angry, it's not my fault that he wasn't here as I.... And I wasn't with him as he faced Deliora. \"oh yeah say is it my fault you go to an s class mission without me, your teammate you know what's funny I'm an s class wizard your not gray, natsu either, can't judge Lucy don't know her that much, but it is very funny!\" Gray looked down than back at my eyes \"I only tried to stop Natsu, he trapped me I couldn't do!\" I stepped closer to him \"are you kidding me Galuna island is a fucking island, I bet you got there on a boat, yes no opportunity to stop Natsu, I can't see any fucking opportunity!\" he stood there silent, as I said in more cold voice \"but it doesn't wonder me, you failed Gray.\" the air got colder now \"I see how much faith my so called best friend has in me, you won't leave because your my teammate alright, I Team up with Natsu Erza and Lucy now therefore leave me now!\" *SMACK* I slapped him so hard he falled into the river, and walked back to the guild without saying another word. As I enter the hall Natsu spoke up to me \"how is that ice guy doing?\" I looked at him with hate in my eyes \"he's fine do you UNDERSTAND, he is fucking fine!\" Natsu trembled a moment and then \"AYE SIR!\" Lucy however only said \"another Erza, better not talk to her now.\" Lucy wanted to talk to me? I should ask her later about what. Erza leaved the guild \"better check up on Gray.\" with whom I should talk, I need a new teammate after all, or maybe a whole team, whom shall I Join? There are Levy's squad, Elfmann (you're a real men!) cancel him from the list, Cana, Max he seems to be descent but not so capable, Bisca and Alzack, Mira sad she doesn't fight anymore we would rock, and then of cause there's Laxus, don't know if one can join his thunder legion, even if I wouldn't mind Freed he's a nice guy, don't know much about Bickslow, but defenitely Evergreen will be a problem. Maybe go out a bit alone, could be good to. Mira walked up to me grapped my arm and moved me in the kitchen, no one's in the kitchen \"tell me what's going on, Yumi?\" I quickly sum up what happened with Gray. *SMACK* Mira slapped me? \"Yumi you have no right being mad at poor Gray! don't get me wrong I understand your situation but he didn't do anything wrong, you however, lied, insulted him, and slapped him, I understand you had to lie for Mystogan sake but still the rest wasn't necessary, he confessed his love that takes bravery, I think you should at least apologize!\" I was shocked Mira reacted like that, did I screw up? \"but you said, I should meet with Mystogan, and you know!\" Mira gave me an displeased look \"I only said you should go meet him, see what happens doesn't mean get into a relationship!\" irritated I said \"but you where glad that...\" Miras face turns more and more serious \"I was glad for you, but to be mad at Gray becouse you made a decision isn't right, apologize to him and then leave him be, than come back in here, this is the last word in it, Yumi!\" this is all so strange Miras really mad right now, so I decided it would be better to play along. I walked back into the main hall and saw Erza, Lucy and Gray sitting at one table, I walk up to it \"Gray, I'm sorry about what happened, you know? I won't stop you and I won't hold a grudge for anything!\" Gray looked at me pissed \"I did nothing to grudge me, but alright as long as you leave alright!\" Erza smiled at that, Lucy looked confused and a bit sad. I walked back to the kitchen, Miras waiting there \"Now you're teamless, any ideas?\" I recount what I thought earlier about it. Mira stepped closer to me, \"aren't you forgetting someone, with whom you perfectly fit in a team?\" I shrugged \"no clue.\" Mira whispered \"well, he's an s class wizard, just like you, he likes you very much and think how romantic it would be, living in the nature wandering to several places, fall asleep in each other's arms!\" I remembered that time as Gray and I fall asleep and I ended up sleeping on top of him, he was hugging me. That felt very nice actually, no don't think about Gray pull yourself together! \"teaming with Mystogan could be very nice but even than I don't know where he is?\" Mira gasped \"you don't? Yumi I hope he's faithful to you!\" why wouldn't he \"its normal no one knows where he goes.\" Mira hugged me \"I hope so for you, I mean he should trust you from now on so a little area at least he should have been able to tell you!\" yeah maybe that's true, with Gray I would have one always around me, with Mystogan someone I barely know! But still I need to make a decision what I do now</span></div></div>",

The only option to take some serious quests, would be Laxus but even if he let me join his squat, I would rather not. Well I guess it's decided than I'll go kick some ass alone! I walked upstairs and looked at the s class board, one quest seemed to be very Interesting \"investigator needed, informations are given personally at the magic council, tell the secretaries this number 47-89-12-45-78-05 and show your guild sign everything else will be explained then.\" Fairy tail does had a few problems with the magic council, if I help them maybe it brings a better light to fairy tail. I showed gramps the quest I'll take, he warns me that the council is not to be trusted hundert peecently, and that they are able to twist your own words. With that I started to walk for a 3 days travel.... Alone. In the evening I made camp as I sat by the fire I realized I made two sleeping places.... To sit alone at the fire is boooriiiing as hell, it's so quiet, as I wasn't sleepy I couldn't sleep this away, one more point Mystogan would be a nice partner, he could make me sleepy with his magic! That would be creepy if we weren't but are we still in a relationship if we never see us? It's only 2 days pull yourself together girl it's not like he hasn't some important buissnes to do! This Anima is chasing him around after all! But it was a weird kiss and only a few minutes of talking together, now I know why Gray asked silly questions like \"what's your favorite color?\" imitating Grays voice, I wanna know Jellals favorite color as well! Now I'll have to at least try to sleep \"Good, night dork!\" why did I say that, I feel silly luckily no one's around or is it unlucky? Sometime later I falled asleep. The next day I gathered my stuff, and started walking th next two days I instead of making camp started to train in the evenings, I arrived at the magic council, the building is quite impressive, I entered and talked to the frog in the entrance \"47-89-12-45-78-05\" I showed my fairy tail mark, the frog responded \"number selected, personnel guest of master</span></div></div>",

No matter first I need to go home, 3 days wandering, evening training, and nights sleeping I finally got back, as I stepped to the Guildhall I see</span></div></div>",

I have to admit I have the same opinion in this as Natsu. Erza then spoke to Makarov \"what will be the next cause of action?\" he drunk his beer \"we will make sure, no one walks alone in case there is an actual attack.\" so all teammates have to stay together, wait I don't have one! Again Mira tapped me \"I will of course go with Elfman if you wish you can come along.\" I nodded \"thanks, Mira.\" I remembered Lucy wanted to talk to me before I walked to the magic council, \"Lucy?\" she was a bit surprised I spoke to her \"Yumi?\"....... \"I thought you wanted to talk about something?\" she nodded \"yes but how do you know? I smiled at her \"does it matter?\" Lucy blinked but than shrugged \"well it's a bit silly but I wanted to ask you a question.\" I raised an eyebrow \"than ask, Lucy.\" Lucy started to blush \"well its just you know, you brought me to Levy where we listened to her talking about a book right?\" I nodded \"yes I do remember that!\" Lucy finally asking me the question \"Levy was to shy to ask you, would you talk to Makarov if it would be able to, open an included book club?\" that's it? \"now is not the time for that, but when things calm down I'll do.\" Lucy smiled \"thanks.\" after everyone gathered in teams we leave the guild hall, after a little while we came to a little house, Elfman spoke up \"That's the house of a real men!\" Mira smiled at him, while I rolled my eyes. As we enter we see there are 4 doors Elfman explains \"the from the left: first is the bathrom, second is the kitchen, third is his sleeping room and the last room is lisannas former bedroom.\" they explained that before lisannas took her own work, they couldn't afford the rent in fairy hills. I nodded \"well I guess that's my room for now than.\" they both smiled in a sad way \"yes.\" they say almost at the same time. Then I entered the room, it's very much the room of a little girl, irmts very good holded clean and everything's in place, I feel sorry for them, what happened with Lisana it must kill them. However I talked with these two for a few hours, until late evening. I than walked back in the room and started to undress, before I was completely ready the door opened and Mira stepped in \"Yumi-Chan, you know Elfman is a more huge person, well there is no space, do you mind if I sleep next to you, I mean we did once!\" I smiled at her \"I don't mind, Mira.\" Mira starts to undress, as I couldn't avert my eyes she looked at me with a smile, and now she undressed a lot more slow, it took 4 minutes before Mira was ready \"liked the show, sweety?\" now realizing that I watched her I blush, why this can't be, why did I watch?

Jellal or whomever, that I shouldn't tell her. \"nothing preticular, as I have to admit I couldn't solve the quest. You sure understand that I don't want to talk about it now.\" Mira stayed silent, I wondered why so I turned around to see, Mira eyes closed already sleeping! Guess that means she understands, alright than I should sleep as well.................. The next morning I was waked up by Mira, shoving my shoulder \"come now Master, will be sick with worried if we don't go to the guild early.\" I had to yawn first, and than I was still half asleep \"what, now.. Uhh I was, another 5 minutes, than I'm all up!\" Mira giggled \"so sweet, but sorry we have to make us ready to leave.\" I only shrugged and was close to drifft off again, as Mira put on a casual voice \"alright than, slepp well while I tell Gray that you actually dressed up only for him.\" I immediately stood up \"DON'T YOU DARE! BESIDES I WAS JUST CONFUSED BACK THAN NOTHING MORE!\" Mira smiled \"now that your awake, go put your clothes on, we need to go.\" why did I reacted that harsh, I mean it didn't mean anything so, sometimes I do hate Mira for this! But than again I can't. As I was to put on my clothes I heard Elfman  \"is everything alright, in there?\" is he going to open the door now, oh God I hope not! I quickly cover myself with the blanket, but strangely the door didn't move an inch. Mira however giggled at me \"he would never do such thing Yumi, Elfman everything's fine Yumi still has to put on her clothes so don't come in.\" I was a bit surprised, she knew her brother wouldn't come in? \"well alright Sis, I'm waiting outside for you two.\" after that I started to put on the rest needed clothes. \"Mira how did, you know that Elfman wasn't to burst in because of my screams?\" Mira gave me a confused look \"isn't it obvious? He's a real men! A real men would never storm into a women's bedroom without permission!\" well I didn't expect that, I thought he's only talking about strength when he calls himself and others a real men. I should start to give him more credit for his living moral. \"I see, thanks for the explanation.\" Mira just shrugged it off \"come now.\" and with that I followed outside, Elfman waiting there smiling at us \"did you two sleep well?\" Mira was quick to answer \"I had a nice sleep, but our sleepyhead here must have had, a much better sleep!\" well until you woke me up, that is. Now Elfman turned towards me \"nice to know you slept well, now let us go!\" as we started to walk towards the guild we see a, crowd gathering in the park, as well as master Makarov who is on his way there, he seems furious, I mean he was angry rarely but like this.... </span></div></div>",

We now walked slowly behind him, in the crowd around the tree are already a few of our guild. They exchange faces of disgust and hatred! As gramps came closer they all took one step aside creating a path for him. In this second I saw Levy, Jet and Droy stuck on the tree by some iron, my eyes wandered to Levys belly. The guild mark of phanton lord was painted all over it! Now I understood there faces and Masters wrath, Natsu stood right behind him \"Gramps we can't let them get away with that!\" Makarov gave him a slow mod \"and we won't, destroying a hall and objects is one thing, but involving the children, JOSE THAT'S A DECLARATION WAR!\" as he said that he crushed his own staff, I ws angry as well but also happy, now we can show those bastards what they get, I'll make sure to give them a few punches for Levy, Jet and Droy as well! As the other members started to get them down, Master turned towards me, still an angry look in his face \"Yumi, come with me, we need to talk!\" what? He never spoke with such a serious voice towards me, must be because of team Shadowgear. However I just followed him silently, I noticed Mira giving me a look full of pity. Why would she do that? After we where back in the Guildhall, he told the peoble who are still there to leave. \"so you want me to do something in the upcoming fight, against those phantom lords? Or why am I here?\" Makarov stared at me and then sighed \"yeah the special thing I ask you to do is..... </span></div></div>",

Elfman stepped right behind me \"hey now thats no way to talk to my big sis!\" I ignored him \"I mean seriously Mira between us you're more merciless you play the innocent wife material but I know you MB any in the guild knew how you treated everyone before that monster behind me killed Lisanna oh another point Natsu got into this depression state after her death, you want him to be happy give him Lisanna back.\" the whole guild was instantly silent Mira started to cry and Elfman hugged her immediately.

Sniff.. Sniff I.... You're awake?\" Makarov who was sleeping until now sighed \"Selena would please come with me?\" I nodded and followed him upstairs. However there was also another person upstairs Laxus the grandson of Makarov \"HAHAHAHA the little cat got a spicy tongue, but for real I think you're right Selena don't let the old man tell you you're wrong.\" Makarov looked furious as Laxus just vanished as a thunder. \"Selena..... How do I put this right... What you said and what you've done..... I'm not going to intevere to much but listen well if you don't start to respect others more it will be your downfall.\" I don't even look towards him \"I haven't killed my sister but I'm the evil one yeah right.\" Makarov raised his voice \"Selena stop it, it isn't his fault it was an accident.\" this time I yelled directly in his face \"OH AN ACCIDENT PFF SURE AND THE TINE I SAID HE KILLED HER WHAT HE DID I SAID THAT ACCIDENTELY SO IT'S FINE RIGHT, OH OH I KNOW I'M GOING TO TRAIN ROMEO NOW AND ACCIDENTELY SNAP HIS NECK NACAO WONT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE IT WAS A FREAKING ACCIDENT EVERYTHING'S FINE IF IT WASN'T INTENTIONAL RIGHT RIGHT???!!!

This type of Requip also gives the user the ability to use, and gain resistance to, natural elements through the use of certain armors and mix and match weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunner form: Allows the user to store Magic guns in different pocket dimensions so he or she can easily summon them at anytime when the user requires it.However, there is a limit to the amount of items that can be stored in his or her pocket dimension, which is usually connected to the user's own Magical ability.
