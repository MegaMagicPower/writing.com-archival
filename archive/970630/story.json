            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is James Howe, a 21 y/o bartender. You're 6'3, brown hair, brown eyes. Up until recently you have had a great life. For most of your life you have known this wonderful girl named Rae. She has always been the most beautiful girl in your school, in your opinion. She stood 5' even, with soft beautiful brown eyes, long silky brown hair with hazel highlights, and the perfect tan. She was 100% Korean, and had a nice chest, just shy of a d-cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour years ago, when you were freshmen, in fact, the two of you started dating, and you dated all through highschool. After graduation you had plans to move in together and start your lives...But things changed, and this is your story:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a couple of months since Rae dumped you, and she's been seeing other guys. Every time you see them together, it kills you. you have tried everything you can think of to get back together with her, to no avail. You have refused to let her go, and in doing so you turned her totally against you. She had wanted to be your friend, and she tried, but you would have no part of it, you wanted to be back together with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sunny day in the later part of June, and any other time it would have been a good day for you, because it was your birthday...but instead, you sat alone in your room, looking at pictures of Rae, and missing her greatly. Youi remember going out last year for your birthday, and the two of you spending the day at Disney World...but that was a much happier time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3:15pm- The phone rings. You answer it in a lack-luster tone \"Hello...?\" you mumble into the receiver. After a moment's silence, your heart skips a beat as you hear the person on the other line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James?\" it was Rae, \"I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday. I realize that we've gone through a lot lately, but I still like to think that all our time knowing eachother wasn't a waste\" She sounded sincere...looking back now you should have realized it was all a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation went on like this for about 20 minutes or so, as she proceeded to invite you to come over. She said she had a \"Birthday Surprise\" for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all you needed to hear. Your heart leapt with joy at the prospect of being with her again. maybe the two of you would get back together! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4:00pm- You arrive at Rae's house, dressed in your best attire, and ring the doorbell. You waited anxiously for her to answer the door. Slowly the nob turned, and after what seemed like an eternity the door opened. There she stood, in all her beauty and wonder. She was dressed beautifully. Her hair framed her face perfectly, he soft lips pursed in a smile as her eyes looked you over with a glint. She was wearing tight cargo blue jeans, a tan shirt, and, what caught your eye the most, a nice pair of black leather boots with a 3inch heal. Your jaw almost fell to the floor at the sight of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly invited you inside, and you wasted no time accepting her invite. \"I missed you\" you whispered, but she quickly cut you off as she placed a soft finger against your lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh\" she whispered. For the first time today you could smell her scent. A mix of perfume and lotion. a smell that you loved on her. \"No talking, let me show you your surprise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn silence, she walked you up the stairs and into her room. It had been a while since you had been in here, and it was still the same. Posters everywhere, hard-wood flors with a nice throwrug over it. Her dirty clothes lay strewn on the ground; a mix of socks, underwear, bras, pants, shirts, and shoes. Her room was large, and very cluttered with her furniture, but most importantly, animal cages. One thing you loved about her was her love of animals. She worked at a local pet store, and always brought home new pets and supplies. She had more pets than you remember, but the thing that caught your eye most was one cage in particular. it was a semi-small hampster cage with what looked like a tiny make-shift couch, some ripped tissue as bedding, but most importantly, what looked like a dirty sock. Other than that, the cage was empty. No aniaml.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the empty cage for?\" You ask, a hint of confussion in your voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\" she said suddenly, her voice no longer holding the compassion it had earlier. In fact, her voice was much colder and more demanding. you turned immediatly to face her, laughing slightly, only to see her wearing a serious face. \"I've grown sick and tired of you harrassing me and refussing to leave me alone! a wile ago you said you refussed to let me go...well guess what, now it's I who won't let you go; EVER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh slightly while taking a step towards her \"What on earth are you talking about, Rae?\" You ask, dismissing the whole thing as a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" she stated almost evily as she pulled out a hypodermic needle and stabbed the tip of it into your arm, injecting a warm liquid into you arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!\" You scream, pushing her away and grabbing your arm \"YOU CRAZY BITCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer only response to you was a cold laugh as she tossed the used needle into a trashcan and picked up an ordinary looking TV remote. \"What that was,\" she said, moving past you and over to the bed \"Was a microscopic receiver for your new remote. Within a matter of moments, the reciever will attatch itself to your spinal chord and will allow me to fully controll you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you talking about Rae?\" you mutter, looking at her like she's crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you see for yourself? The receiver should be attatching itself any second now, and then I can controll you completly. I can controll your size, and your shape. I can make you microscopic, or turn you into a mouse, or anything I want...Oh, and don't worry; the process WILL be painfull.\" She laughed at your expression. Obviously you didn't believe a word she was saying. \"I see you still don't believe me. Well then, how about I just show you?\" With that, and no other words, she pushed a few buttons on the remote before aiming directly at you and pressing the \"Enter\" button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, a red beam of light errupted from the remote and struck you square in the chest, sending you back a few inches. A warm feeling rain through your body, followed by searing pain, it was only now that you finally believed her. \"Wh...what are you doing to me?!\" you cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm....\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm shrinking you, James! I'm 'cutting you down to size' as one might say!\" She at you. You could only watch in horror as everything grew larger and larger, and your clothes grew baggier. The pain was slowly dying down, but your shrinking was no where near complete. before long your pants and boxers fell to the ground, and your shirt was large enough to cover your whole body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your perspective, she was a giant; from her perspective you were a baby. And you were still growing smaller! Soon you shirt became a tunnel of cloth; a large tent with no support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it seemed the shrinking had stopped. You had no idea how tiny you were. Your heart was racing, your breathing was heavy. You could see nothing because of the giant tent that was your shirt that was now smothering you and covering your entire body. The floor beneath your feet was also cloth: your boxers and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could this be? This wasn't possible, people don't just shrink \"Help me!\" you scream out. how small were you? How big was she now? Ice ran through your mind at that thought...if she was truly this mad at you, at her size what could she do to do? What WOULD she do to you? You could hear an thunderous, muffeled laugher from outside your clothes as your entire world began to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh buggy!\" You heard her call in the scariest voice \"Where are you my tiny insect?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no!' you thought 'She's going to find me...and then what?!' you struggled as hard as you could to get through the thick material of your gigantic shirt, getting caught up in the folds of the fabric at every turn. It was no use, though, before long the mamoth sized tent lifted far into the air and was tossed aside with force and strength that made you stare in awe. But the amazement was short lived as you realized your perdicament: you now stood, naked and tiny in fron of your ex girlfriend, who was angry with you and was now in control. Once again your heart raced as you swallowed hard and turned to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of you was a mamoth black rounded wall that raised twice your height. You recognized it immediatly as the toe of Rae's knee-high boots. Judging by this you were no larger than a bug. The very though of it scared you almost to death. You truly were a bug to her now. She could easily lift that boot and place it down on top of your tiny, insignifigant body and crush your flat under her sole...and the worst part about it: She wouldn't even feel you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner did you think this than did the giant black wall in front of you begin to moved and raise into the air. Fear gripped you as you could do nothing but watch. \"I see you can't take your eyes off my boots! I always knew you had a thing for feet and shoes! Maybe I shouldn't bother keeping you! maybe i should crush you under my boot and finally be done with you, you insignifigant little worm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe words chilled you, as still you could not move, but only watch as her boot raised higher and then slowly came over your tiny body. 'Oh my god!' you thought 'she's really going to crush me!' now you could think of nothing to do but fall to your knees and bed...and that is exactly what you did. You dropped to your knees and begged and pleaded for her not to crush you. even as you begged her boot came closer and closer until it was resting on top of you \"PLEASE! PLEASE I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU ASK! I'M SORRY, PLEASE! JUST DON'T KILL ME!\" you sobbed \"I'll do anything!\" you continued to cry as you kissed the sole of her boot in a last didtch effort to save your pathetic life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of pressure, the boot finally lifted into the air as she laughed loudly \"You are so pathetic! I wasn't going to crush you, bug! I just wanted to see you beg!\" As she spoke you slowly began to look up at her through tear stained eyes. It was now that you got your first view of how tall she was to you. She rose to dizzying heights, as your eyes moved slowly up her legs, past her knees, past her croth. You could see slightly up her shirt from down here, seeing her beautiful tan, fit stomache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you continued upwards, stopping for a moment on her beautiful, and now enormous breasts. From down here they were an amazing sight to behold. It was almost as though they were the end of your world, for you could see nothing past them. You watched as they slowly moved up and down with each breath she took, and were amazed at how they bounced slightly when she laughed. As amazing as they were to you now, you were curious to see her huge face, and before long, you got your wish. With amazing speed the large figure squatted down, her knees know casting an imense shadow over your body, her beautiful, enormous face coming into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer beauty held you captive, as you almost forgot your perdicament. You watched in silence as her soft lips continued to move as she spoke, were amazed by her shimmering dark eyes, and could hardly believe how her long dark hair looked so much like a cluster of vines as it fell around you and to the floor, creating a partial room around you. Even from the couple foot distance from you that her face was, you could feel her warm breath was over you, and smell her now strong and iontoxicating scent. For a moment, the whole world disappeared as you stared up and this goddess who was once your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DID YOU HEAR ME?!\" her thunderous yell snapped you out of your trnace \"I said that you belong to me now, and that since you just said you would do anything, you WILL do anything that I ask you! If you EVER fail to do anything I ask, I will step on you like the worthless insect you are! DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!\"</span></div></div>",

Do you understand me, bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my goddess\" you answer grudgeningly. You look up at her, while still bowing at her foot. What could she possibly have in store for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How pathetic\" She laughs \"Imagine, once you were a person with a life, a good job, family and friends, and now...Now look at you...You're nothing more than a pathetic insect. A worthless bug at the mercy of your ex girlfriend...I could crush you like a grape and not give it a second thought. And believe me, I will if you EVER disobey me! Don't think, for one minute, bug, that you have any rights or any say in anything. And don't think you will be living your live all the time as a human. I controll you, and you will be what I want. Sometimes you will be human, sometimes a mouse, sometimes even my damn sock, is that understood?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivers at the thought of her wearing you in her shoes all day, being nothing more than a sock, soaking up her foot sweet \"Yes, goddess\" you gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what to do with you first, worm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, all that came out was a feeble squeek. White fur began to cover your entire body, as you can no long support yourself on your hind legs, and fall forward onto your hands and knees. A horrible pain ran through your body as something began to petrude from your back end. A tail!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you saw your entire world dissappear, you realized you were being turned into...into a mouse! But why?! Finally, everything stopped, and you sat there, scared and breathing heavily, trapped under your clothes. Once again you try to cry out, this time for help, and once again all you hear is a tiny squeak coming from your little mousey lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, your entire world opened up as your ex lifted your shirt off of your tiny body and laughed down at you. As fear gripped you, you stood and started to run away, entire worlds from your massive ex stopped you dead in your tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!\" Her voice was loud and echoing to your new form. \"WHAT GOOD IS IT TO RUN AWAY? YOU CAN'T BE GOING TO GET HELP...I'M THE ONLY PERSON THAT KNOWS YOU USED TO BE A HUMAN. EVERYONE ELSE WILL SEE YOU AS A MOUSE AND NOTHING MORE. HOW LONG DO YOU THING YOU WILL LAST WITHOUT ME? HOW PATHETIC WOULD THAT BE? TO DIE AS A WORTHLESS MOUSE. FOR YOUR DEAD BODY TO BE KICKED ASIDE, OR THROWN AWAY, OR FED TO A CAT, NO ONE KNOWING WHO YOU REALLY ARE. SAD REALLY\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she was right. She was your only hope, and she didn't seem too intent on helping you that much. \"Good little mouse\" she whispered down at you. \"Now COME HERE!\" she demanded and stomped her booted floor on the floor, causing a slight quake. Fear pulled you toward her more than hope as your slowly walked closer and closer to her. She seemed to get even larger the closer your got to her, but you knew it was only a matter of perspective. \"Now, my little pet\" she whispered, as she set the empty tank on the ground, laying it on it's side with the open top right in front of you. \"Show me just how truly PATHETIC you are, and walk into your new cage.\" You look up at her for a moment before moving forward and walking into the tank. As soon as you get inside, she wastes no time tipping it back up, putting a screen lid on it, and setting the tank on her dresser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How sad you truly are\" she said, her beautyiful asian face slightly distorted by the glass \"To be nothing more than a pathetic, worthless rodent trapped by your ex girlfriend. And to show you how much more your life truly sucks, tomorrow I get to decide your fate...You see, I don't want you. I want you OUT of my life forever, and that's why I did this to you...My two friends Emily and Olivia know about this whole thing, and tomorrow they will both be over here. Either I will give you and the remote that controlls you to one of them, or we will all gather around and watch as I feed you to my snake.
