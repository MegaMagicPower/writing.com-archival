A short shelf in the corner of the living room containing a handful of old and bizarre relics. \"Hey Amy! When did you get these?\"<br>\r\n\"OH! Those are souvenirs from some of our adventure. I wanted something to remember all of the wonderful places we've been.\" <br>\r\n\"Huh, That must have been before we started dating.

Leaving sonic by himself. He looked down at Amy's dress. He loved seeing her in this dress and her big red boots. He stood up admiring his new body. The body of his girlfriend. He walked to the bedroom and gazed at himself in the full length mirror. He shifted his weight to one side and put his hands on his hips like Amy. \"Amy sure is a cutie. I hope she hasn't gotten into any trouble with my body.\" He twirled around in her skirt. \"Ohh Sonic your soo fast\", he giggled at himself saying that. \"I hope she comes back soon, but in the mean time.\" I think I'll have some fun.</span></div></div>",

He notices that the lab coat she's wearing show her curvy body, those wide hips, and nice big ass.  Sonic quickly snapped out of it and got up behind her and said, \"Hey Tails.\"  She drops her test tubes but Sonic gets them before they hit the floor.  \"Thanks Sonic, but don't ever do that again!\" she yells at him.  Sonic stares at her body and sees she has D-cup breasts and that her backside didn't lie.  \"What are you staring at?\"  \"Your sexy body Tails.\"  When she hears this she blushes hard enough for Sonic to see it through her fur.  \"Wait hear Sonic and we can discus this further.\"  So Sonic waits for a few minutes and Tails come back dressed...</span></div></div>",

Tails dd a twirl to obviously show off her body to Sonic and Sonic just now notices Tail's long beautiful hair that goes down to the small of her back.

Like I'm somebody else. but still the same, if that even made sense....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I'm for myself to blame. Why else would I be here, glumly sitting in this tree, admiring the relationships everyone had? Just looking to my left, I see that accursed Bat clamoring all over her little jewel. That Echidna....what was his name? Chuckles? Something like that. It pains me to think that romance comes so fluently to them. For someone like me, it would be like climbing a mountain with no help except for my teeth. I observe some more, wondering to myself why it's like this, why my miscreant friends have love in the air all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sorry, I'm getting a tad ahead of myself. You see, we're at a picnic, a small little gathering before we all set our opposite ways again. I have my own house in the very thick of Station Square, I don't use it that often as I should. Which somehow made me think of one certain being at this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho else but Sonic The Hedgehog? He loves traveling. Heck, he's on perpetual vacation when he's not roaming the planet stopping evil. Evil....Can't believe I used to be evil. Just thinking about that word brings a soft chuckle to my lips. Too bad I'm not evil anymore, it was fun, but it had its ups and downs. For example, if I wasn't evil, I never would of met him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. Where did that even come from?? I'm sitting here, thinking about love, then HE enters my mind. Well great, now I'm panicking. I can't see straight. I become very close minded when I can't focus or see, I almost automatically shut down when something like this happens. Plus add to the fact that I haven't been feeling very good at all. I think I may have gotten sick over the course of last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHnnnghg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah...That was the ground. I forgot what it felt like. I guess its good enough that the ground is covered by soft grass. The initial impact hurt worse then when I got my first shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I hear footsteps. \"Shadow! You okay?!\" And that was Sonic himself.  Well, gee faker. I just fell from a tree, I'm not responding, what else could be going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing I know, I'm being turned over and the sun's in my eyes, I squint them shut hard and grit my teeth. I could feel his hands on my forehead, he removed one glove and placed it on my head. Was it just me, or did his hand feel soft and cool?.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Shadow, your burning up.\" Well, I guess so. I felt like I was in a steam room right now. Add extra hot-rocks. Then I could tell he was trying to feel for any cuts or bruises on my torso. Now, with the current situation, I wouldn't mind this If it was a medical situation, maybe it was, but thats when I realized he was getting a little to close for my own comfort to one area of privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't think he noticed, or at least pretend to not notice, but I could feel his hand getting to one spot right when the bottom of my stomach was. Oh no, if he keeps going, he's going to find out....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly jerked under his grasp, opening my eyes with great force on my part, and suddenly rolling onto him. I glare into his eyes with my crimson iris, his shell-shocked green ones staring right back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm so sorry Sonic, I have to do this....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the reddest of red hells are you doing, Hedgehog?\" I rasp out, fatigue evident in my voice. I could see he was trying to come up with an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was trying to see if your okay! Why-\" But I felt a pang of regretability when I grasped a scruff of fur with both of my hands, lifting the upper half of his body with my strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hear me clear? Don't ever touch me again. I'm fine.\" I drop him to the ground with force. I had to make it look believable. That's when his pink harpy entered the scene, furious that I touched her 'Sonikku'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow! What was that for?! He only tried to help you, and you repay him by shoving him to the ground? You should grateful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth was, I am grateful. Really, but I had to keep my secret, I can't let them find out. \"Really. Of course you'd say anything to protect him. you hated my guts from day one. I can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look back at Sonic, peering up at me with his elbows propping himself up off the ground. His mouth hung open. I could only guess he was thinking I just pulled a Double Whammy on him and his 'Grifriend'....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......I'm hanging around him too much.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going home, you'd better not follow me Faker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start to walk away, my eyes peering off to the side if he did follow me or not. Well, Guess I should get home. Then again, he could just follow me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So I called him over. \" Hey, you wanna close out this game because we are winning 17-1.\" I asked him. \" Sure Alex, I'll close it out.\" he replied. So he struck out  robots in a row and I slapped him on the back and said,\" Good job man.\" \"Thanks.\" SIlver replied. Then Blaze came up to him. \" You impress me.\" she said in a flirting tone as she rubbed her chest fur with her finger. Silver blushed.\" Uhh.. what does that mean.\" Ohh I don't know just you impress me.\" Then she kissed SIlver's ear as his ear twitched. She then giggled and told Silver,\" I like you SIlver, you're so cute when you're naive and I don't want to be just friends.\" \" Umm.. uhh. I've always liked you too Blaze.\" \"Aww SIlver.\" And hugs Silver.

As always, show me your moves! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHi guys! I'm updating again because today, a user named Mdizzle suggested the use of crossover pairings so if anyone likes crossover pairings, let me know and for now, I'll allow crossover pairings but I need to be convinced if this is a good idea for this project so I need your input.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHi. I just came to say that I'm testing something out but it involves bumping up the rating so if anyone is oppose to this, respond to me by e-mail.</td>",
