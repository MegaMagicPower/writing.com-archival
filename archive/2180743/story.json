Despite her hesitation, she accepted since he asked her personally despite his engagement to Caeda. Her crush on Marth wasn't exactly hidden, and a quite a few people liked to tease her about it. Est, in general, loved to bring it up in conversations and the like to play around with her. Thoughts of how her unrequited crush was so well known out of her head aside, Catria set out on her mission. She would have preferred to have Palla and Est with her, but currently they were still returning from their mission to build up relations with Valentia and its new King. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a focus, she set out. Her pegasus soared high in the sky as she scouted the area looking for signs of the cultists' activity. \"Come on, steady girl.\" Catria said as she felt her pegasus start to get antsy since she was nearing the cultists camp. Landing nearby, Catria decided to go by foot from there due to how antsy her pegasus was. Hiding in some bushes, Catria watched the area. It seemed deserted. There was a lone temple in the area which seemed to be quiet. With that said, she was only told to scout a group of cultists and their location. While she found the camp, it seemed almost dead as if it was abandoned by them recently. So the question was, should she go in deeper and explore more? Or should she report back to Marth and Jagen? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was lost in her thought, she never noticed one of the cultists sneak up behind her till it was too late, as she was slightly singed by a fire tome. \"Tch\" Catria let out as she quickly faced the person who attacked her. They were garbed in a black and blue dress, wearing a blue cloak over it. The black hood they wore covered their face which blocked Catria's view of the person's identity. \"By orders of Prince Marth, you are asked to lay down your arms and surrender peacefully!\" She said looking at the mage. Though it seemed her cries went to deaf ears as she was attacked once more. However, due to being more aware, she was able to successfully dodge the incoming attack, although with some difficulty. She wasn't used to fighting on the ground, preferring rather to fight atop her pegasus left her in a difficult situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriking back, Catria was quickly able to turn the tides as her spear finding and piercing her foe, wounding the mage in the arm. However, her victory was short lived as she overextended herself causing her to be hit once more by the magical fire that was sent her way by the mage. Though as soon as she was about to attack once more, she was stopped as the mage pulled out a new tome. This one felt different to her and it was definitely not one she had seen before. (Merric would be interested in this) she thought, wondering what kind of magic would be cast. However, nothing came. There was a bright flash of light and an odd sensation of something entering her body but after that, nothing. Her thoughts were interrupted however by the mage casting another blast of fire forcing her to dodge as the culprit ran off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up the chase due to her injuries and the odd tingling she was now feeling in her body, Catria returned to her pegasus and headed back to the castle. There was much she would need to tell Marth but she would also need to rest. She was tired, and whatever was cast felt like a Nosferatu tome sapping her of her energy. Either way, as she mounted her pegasus she headed back, not noticing the odd sensation that overcame her as she set back to the castle. Tired and worn out from her journey, she quickly reported back to Jagen who promised to bring the news to Marth right away and she quickly went to her room after. She was tired as she quickly unbuckled her chest plate and let it rest on the floor as she sat on her bed. Tired and drained, she felt an odd tightness in her chest. She ignored it, not knowing that this was just the beginning of her problems that would affect her as time passed. </span></div></div>",

Contents of Chapter unchanged.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatria sat on the bed, tired and a little bit worried as she felt the sensation in her chest get stronger and stronger. She also couldn't be for sure, but she could swear her breasts felt a bit heavier as well. Though quickly struck that thought from her mind, as there was no way that was possible right? Catria tried to focus, but the more she sat down the more her breasts felt heavier. It was starting to bug her, but she did her best to ignore it as she looked out the window, seeing some of the new pegasus knights training. As she watched the new members train, she sub-consciously started to pull lightly on her dress and bra. Her breasts started to swell slightly as it began to dig into her flesh as they slowly grew. What Catria didn't know was that her breasts were becoming heavier due to the fact that they slowly began to produce milk, and her breasts changed to accommodate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nipples began to swell a bit, and they began to darken. Catria was reaching the point where she couldn't ignore it. Though she tried to play it off, the odd sensations in her chest was starting to demand more and more attention as she ended up pulling more and more at her bra. She tried to adjust it to accommodate her breasts. \"This better not be shrinking...\" She muttered to herself as she pulled at her bra again, loosening the straps. She wasn't one to buy fancy clothes or the like but disliked the idea of clothes shopping for under things. Est always got a bit too grabby at times. Having had enough of the odd sensation, Catria wearily got off her bed and she made her way to the mirror in the room. Blushing a bit, she closed the door as well as closed the curtains to make sure that there were no peekers. Confident that she was alone and there was no way for people to peek, she slowly unzipped her dress slightly to reveal her lacy blue bra which was containing a set of growing breasts. While she never had much in terms of breasts, what she saw shocked her. Hanging from her chest was a good small handful of breast. Almost a B cup if she was to give it a size. Normally this would be a cause of concern, however Catria refused to believe what she was seeing. \"This isn't real...and even if it was, it could just be some minor swelling! Palla had that happen to her before, so it could be just that.' She said trying to comfort herself with little success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried to comfort herself, her breasts were still growing larger and larger, pressing more and more against her bra. \"It's getting so tight...\" She said as she looked at her bra to see it straining to contain her immense breasts. \"H-how did this happen!?\" She cried out in shock as she started to struggle with her bra. \"Nnngh this is getting too tight!\" She said as she struggled with the hooks. More and more it grew harder to unlatch it due to her growing breast flesh. As it began to overflow the cups of her bra, her pale breast flesh peaked out as she struggled with her bra. In a herculean effort, she managed to rip her bra off, causing the offending fabric to fall on the floor without a care. \"Nnngh they are so heavy...\" Catria muttered to herself as she almost tipped forward due to the weight of her now large breasts. They stood large and proud with dark pink nipples capping them standing impressively large as if they were containing a great force back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at her breasts, and they seemed to grow faster now that the bra holding them back was gone. She watched as it continued to swell, getting larger and larger until it was larger than she has ever seen on someone. They were large and round and were pretty heavy as shes bounced them gently in her hands. She would also swear she could hear something sloshing as she did that but that was probably her nerves speaking. Looking at the mirror, she stared in shock. Her breasts had grown to a gigantic size. They were large handfuls when she cupped them, sending a shiver down her spine due to how sensitive they become. However, that wasn't the only surprise, as to her shock a single white drop seemed to form at the tip of her nipple, and she gently squeezed them with her arms. In shock, she stepped back as she found out exactly why her breasts felt so heavy. With this development in mind, she began to panic. What should she do? Go to the healers? But than someone could see her and her naked chest. Go to the bathroom to relieve the pressure perhaps? But if she did that, what would be the consequences? Either way, she had to make a choice, and fast before they decided to grow again. </span></div></div>",

All the while her breasts continued to grow as they swelled ever larger. Catria didn't know what to do, as the pressure seemed to increase. She let out a slight moan. \"I-I gotta figure out what to do.\" She said, panting as she paused at the door. She knew she should go see the healers, however she didn't exactly want others to see her in this state. What would her sisters think? Or worse, Minerva! Her career could be ruined if that happened! These thoughts caused her to panic as she paced back and forth in front of her room's door trying to figure out what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeep!\" Catria let out as her nipples brushed slightly against the door due to her pacing, causing her to shiver at how sensitive her breasts had become. She couldn't wait anymore, and she opened the doors and headed out. She had enough! The immense pressure that was building up behind her breasts was too much. She headed out to the bath area and closed the door shut. Panting she leaned over a empty basin, she rested her large breasts on the edge. \"G-got to do something about this pressure!\" She said as she tried to massage her breasts to ease the pressure, but it did nothing to ease the pressure she was feeling. Frustrated, she looked at her swollen breasts and shivered at the thought. \"I-I'm not a cow....\" She said, trailing off refusing to entertain the idea. Her breasts continued to swell, getting larger and heavier in the process. The pressure Catria was feeling only got worse as time passed and her breasts swelled larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-h-ha I gotta do it! I can't take it anymore!\" She said as her hands made their way to her swollen taught nipples and squeezed gently. Her actions were soon rewarded as a small white droplet formed at the edge of her nipples before falling into the basin with a resounding splash. \"I-I- can't believe it.....\" She said as she continued her actions in a attempt to relieve the pressure she was feeling. Her repeated actions was soon rewarded as she was steadily lactating the large amount of milk her breasts struggled to contain, slowly letting it out. The relief she felt was soothing. Though she would soon be caught unaware as a heat began to build in her body as she felt her legs move back and forth as if trying to scratch a itch. Her hands were busy with her nipples and caused her to rub her legs back and forth as the heat grew stronger the more milk she let out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I wish someone was here to help...\" She muttered softly to herself as she continued to let out her milk more and more. The sheer sensation turning into a pleasurable one as she continued. \"I-I can't believe myself but...I want to experience this more..........\" She whispered to no one as her milk splashed into the basin more and more, causing her to lose herself in the pleasure she was experiencing. What was once worry was now replaced with eagerness as she started to eagerly milk herself, pumping and pinching her nipples in a attempt to coach out more milk. The sheer fact she was now beginning to enjoy the sensations should have worried her, but it didn't. She was lost in the sheer pleasure she was experiencing. </span></div></div>",

It was a gift from Alm, something he found while exploring one of the abandoned temples of Mila. It was a silver pendant with flashes of gold here and there and a ruby inlaid in the middle that seemed to sparkle in the light as if a fire was trapped inside. She just felt so giddy she couldn't help herself as she twirled around watching her the pendant sparkle in the faint sun. She smiled as she held it in her hand. It was nice and warm to the touch. She could feel a faint touch of Mila's energy in the pendant and she loved it so much. As a priestess of Mila even being able to have something like this was special. Though added to the fact that it was Alm who gave it to make it priceless in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica smiled as she collapsed on her bed still giggling. \"I should give Alm something in return for this later,\" She said smiling as she felt the pendant rest heavily against her chest. She smiled as she laid on her bed the warm sun beating against her body as she smiled just laying down on her bed. She felt so giddy and she couldn't describe it. Maybe it was seeing Alm again? Maybe it was the fact Alm decided to find something to give her for whenever they were to meet again? Either way, she felt so happy at the moment. Beyond that, Alm had a few days of rest and at Mae's insistence, she decided to do the same. Smiling she stifled a yawn as her eyes felt oddly heavy as she soon found herself beginning to doze off on the bed basking in the warm sunlight. Celica smiled as she fell asleep starting to take her more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica woke up early the next day her she felt oddly energized but well-rested as she slowly sat up rubbing sleep from her eyes. Smiling at Alm who embraced her from behind as she smiled gently. \"W-we did it right? It's over its all over now yes?\" She said asking as she leaned into his arms smiling. \"Yes, my love, it's finally over\" He replied softly as he gently caressed her cheek before gently kissing it. Celica smiled as she sighed comfortably in his arms. Blushing as she felt his hands start to slowly undo her dress as he slid it off her shoulders. \"A-alm what are you doing!\" She cried out in shock as she felt him start to cup her supple breasts. While they weren't the biggest they were a solid b cup. As she moaned as she felt his hands gently pull and tease her nipples. \"A-alm please stop y-you know my breasts are s-s-sensitive\" SHe cried out as her lover continued to gently tease her breasts more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all good my love just let it happen.\" She heard Alm say as he slowly began to pull her dress down even more showing off more of her pale skin she shivered feeling Alm's hands trail down her body from her breasts. More and more he pulled down her dress leaving her in nothing more than her silken panties which were white as fresh snow. Soon though she felt Alm hook his thumbs under her panties bands as she soon began to pull down those as well! \"A-alm please stop, I'm not sure I'm ready for something like this,\" She said, blushing deeper as she heard Alm chuckle behind her. As he knocked her down to pull them off her legs in a single movement. Leaving her as nude as the day she was born. \"Don't worry my love I won't do anything you aren't ready for\" He said with the same gentle smile that made her feel like she was melting under his gaze. \"V-v-very well\" She stuttered out her face red as a tomato as she felt Alm lean down to kiss her. Before she began to shiver she was sweating a bit heavier as Alm came close and closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore jumping up with a start. Panting Celica looked around seeing a familiar wood cabin-like room. \"I-It was a dream,\" She said in relief. She said in relief as she sat up slowly. Her heart was pounding still from the dream as she looked at herself in the mirror her face was flushed from earlier. \"G-gotta calms down I-it was only a dream.\" She said blushing as she waited for her heart slowly began to steady its beat. \"T-that was something else though,\" She said with a sigh as she leaned back slightly stretching. Her hand went right away to the pendant still fastened to her neck as she clutched it. \"I-it felt so real though I-Is that really what I want from Alm? She asked as she felt a bit warm the sensation seemingly increasing as she clutched the pendant tightly in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica sighed as she got up and walked to the full body mirror that was in front of her bed as she tried to smooth out the wrinkles that formed in her white dress. \"I-I gotta get a hold of myself,\" She said  her mind was still in turmoil from her dream. It was honestly quite intense for her and still driving her loony. \"G-gotta gets a hold of myself,\" She said as she patted her cheeks to try and take her mind off things. She kept it up as she sighed in relief as she felt a bit hot. The warm sensation she was feeling only increasing as it grew stronger and stronger. She wasn't sure what was going on. \"I g-gotta remain strong,\" She said once more as the heat continued to grow as she let a small moan escape her lips. \"I-it feels soo good w-why though'' She muttered quietly to herself. She panted as she squirmed a little her clothes were feeling oddly tighter. \"W-w-what's going on\" She cried out unaware of what was going on as her body suddenly started to grow. It was small at first her breasts swelling large in her bra growing bigger and bigger as it began to slowly overflow her bra cups. Her panties soon joined in on the sensation as it grew tighter over her modest posterior. \"O-oh M-Mila please make it stop\" She cried out as the sensation kept on growing stronger! Her breasts grew larger and larger as did her rear as her dress grew tighter as she started to panic and she pulled at her dress to try and pull it off to see what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnap...snap...! RIIIIIIIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas heard as she finally got a purchase on her dress's zipper and pulled it down in a hurry revealing her new body for the world to see. Her breasts were large being firmly around d cups being large and plump and was overflowing her bra! Her panties were beginning to rip as well as it struggled to contain her ass! Where she once had a modest ass she now had a larger plumper rear that would draw attention no matter what. This wasn't her only change though as her hips were quite a bit wider as well to accommodate her larger posterior as her thighs were a bit plump as well. As this happened she sighed in relief as her panties flew off as a loud Rip was heard causing her larger ass to jiggle slightly from the action as the heat in her body died down causing her to sigh in relief. Unknown to her the glow of her pendant died down as well as the heat that flooded her body died down as if it wasn't even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica blushed as she slowly unhooked her bra causing her large bust to sag down slightly without the support of her tight bra. As she breathed in relief. Where once she had a modest body instead she now had a bombshell of one. Her breasts looked large and supple with hips slightly wider than her shoulders and a large ass. There was no way her body wasn't going to be stared at now. Though it did leave her with one question. \"What do I do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It has been three months since the fall of Duma, and Alm and Celica have ascended to become the King and Queen of Valentia. Now wed to each other, the pair ruled over the land with ideals and honor to keep peace across their kingdom. The various members of the Deliverance moved on to help the new King and Queen rule Valentia by becoming close consultants and having high positions in the King and Queen's eyes. However, there was one member of the Deliverance that did not have the same honor as Alm and Celica. That person was Faye; One of Alm's childhood friends, and his personal stalker. Faye had loved Alm for as long as she could remember, and she was willing to do anything for him, or to have him. ANYTHING. Faye was...not happy when Celica came back into the picture. Although she tried her best to take Alm for herself, even during their childhood, she would always lose him to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye sat lonely on a large rock outside the royal castle, both longing for Alm, and mourning that she'll never have him as long as Celica's there. Suddenly, a lightbulb flashed in Faye's head as she brought her head up with widened eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>As long as Celica is still there...</b></i>\" Faye whispered to herself. If she could take Celica out of the picture...she could have Alm to herself! There's also an issue of Clair, but she'll cross that bridge when she got there. However...she mentally slapped herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that! Not only will I be killed for taking Celica out of the picture, Alm will hate me! And that's worse than death!\" Faye said out loud, although no-one was around to hear her. She brought her hands around her neck and took off a flower necklace Alm had made her. That was so long ago, back when they were children in fact, but she treasured it more than anything else. She stared at it with sadness...before a steely determination built within her. This was for Alm. The only thing she ever cared about. If she could do it...discreetly, and without getting caught, maybe she could pull this off! Faye put the flower necklace back around her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is for you Alm...\" Faye said to herself before walking off. She had an idea of how to do this without being seen. She walked away from the castle and marched towards the town where many of the old Deliverance members lived. Aside from Alm and Celica, who lived in the castle, most of the teams were happily living here. She strolled through the village until she reached Delthea's house. She looked in through the window and noticed that Delthea wasn't home. When she was planning on how to enter without being seen, a voice called out for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye! Long time no see!\" The voice said, causing Faye to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaah! Oh...it's just you Tobin.\" Faye said, clutching her chest. The man that called out to her was another one of Faye's childhood friends that lived in Ram Village before joining the Deliverance. He wasn't the most \"aware\" person ever, in fact he was rather dense.  If she played this right, he wouldn't be suspicious at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's just me.\" He chuckled. \"So what are you doing here? Haven't seen you in forever! Also is there a reason you're looking into Delthea's house?\" Faye tried to think of a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...well...\" She said, scratching the back of her head. \"I'm trying to look for her. I need to ask her something important.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well you won't find her here. She's usually hanging around the castle this time of day. Speaking of, I need to head to the castle to talk to Alm. You want me to help you find her?\" Tobin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks.\" Faye responded immediately. \"I'll find her myself. I need to pick up a few things from the town anyway.\" She said, looking away. (Come on...fall for it!) Faye thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright, I'll leave you to that then. I'll be heading off. Nice seeing you again after all this time. We should get everyone together for a day out!\" Tobin said, walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love that! Heheheh...\" Faye laughed falsely. Her expression immediately turned serious once again and looked back into Delthea's house. There were two entrances, and they were both locked. However, one of the entrances towards the back wasn't locked very well, and was out of sight from most of the villager's walking around. Seemingly out of nowhere, Faye pulls a hairpin from within her outfit and begins fiddling with the door. After a few seconds, the door unlocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect...\" She said with an angry smile on her face. She entered Delthea's house and immediately turned her attention to her bookshelf. It was filled shelf by shelf with tomes. Faye really only needed one, and she didn't care which one it was. So she picked out a random tome from the shelf, and left it looking like nothing had happened. She quickly left the house and locked the door as shoddily as it was initially to cover her tracks. No one had seen her enter or exit the house, and Delthea most likely wouldn't notice one tome would be missing in an entire bookshelf of them. She essentially ran back towards the castle to find Celica. On the way, she opened the tome and attempted to read it. She was never very well versed in reading tomes, since she was a Pegasus Knight in the war, but she was able to make out a word or two. Faye flipped through the pages and found one spell that seemed to have art of a lightning bolt on the page, probably the result of using the spell, and decided it would be PERFECT. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Faye returned to the castle perimeter, luckily for her, Celica was alone in the garden. She was picking flowers, most likely to give to Alm as a sign of affection. Faye hid in a patch of nearby bushes and simply watched her for several minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheh...goodbye Celica.\" Faye said coldly. She readied the spell in her hand and blasted it at Celica. Before Celica could react to the blast coming towards her at full speed, it struck her, and sent her back a few feet. Oddly enough, Celica didn't fall over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Huh. Seems like she can take a blast better than I thought.) Faye thought to herself. Celica immediately took out her signature Ragnarok tome and lit her hand on fire with a furious expression on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there? Show yourself!\" Celica commanded. Faye decided to stay motionless in the bushes, as Celica did not even know she was there. She frantically looked around, wanting to catch her aggressor, before she suddenly felt an odd feeling overpowering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh...what is this...?\" Celica asked. Faye simply chuckled as she watched, liking to see Celica squirm like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her hands to her chest in discomfort. What surprised Celica and Faye both...was what the spell <i>actually</i> did. Celica felt immense pressure build up in her breasts, and soon enough found them pushing against her hands! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?!\" Celica exclaimed. Her...her breasts were growing! Faye's jaw dropped to the floor. Celica always had average sized breasts. Nothing remarkable, but definitely not flat. But now, her breasts far outgrew everyone in the Deliverance! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's happening?! Why are my...breasts growing?!\" Celica exclaimed to herself. Her breasts started to fill her usual outfit quite quickly, and more and more of Celica's cleavage was showing, her breasts packed into her top. Celica let off a soft moan, although quickly caught herself. This wasn't the time for that! No matter how pleasurable it may feel, this was a problem! Her breasts quickly ran out of room in her outfit, and Celica felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh...! Too....tight...!\" Celica yelled. She grabbed her breasts and awaited the inevitable. And surely enough, it came. Her breasts ripped straight through her outfit and left her in a black bra that was being stretched far beyond it's limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyyyaa!\" Celica exclaimed. Soon after however, her breasts stopped growing. They were now each a little bigger than the size of her head, and a LOT of it was showing. Her bra didn't do much to cover them. And she brought her hands to them in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh my...\" She stuttered. \"They're...massive...\" She said in disbelief. Every time she touched her new breasts, Celica could barely contain a moan. It seems her breasts got a lot more sensitive too when they reached this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?! Who did this?!\" She yelled to herself. She quickly looked all around herself in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye could not believe what she was seeing. She...she made her tits bigger?! That's what this stupid spell did?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't supposed to happen!\" She cursed at herself. Why would Delthea even HAVE this tome?! She simply stared at Celica with a look of anger in her eyes. Instead of taking her out of the picture, she only made her more attractive! Well, she made her tits bigger at least. This was literally the complete opposite of what Faye wanted! There's no WAY Alm would be with her now! Not with Celica sporting the biggest boobs she'd ever seen! And by her own doing she may add! Faye had to do SOMETHING. She started to think of what she could do. Luckily, Faye was still completely hidden in the bushes, and Celica had no idea she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Faye do?</span></div></div>",

She liked seeing her in a blind panic like this, and to think it's because of her tits. She decided to reveal herself to Celica just to toy with her. She got up and walked out of the bushes towards her. Celica didn't even notice her until....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Celica.\" Faye said with a smile on her face. Celica stopped in her tracks and slowly looked towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye? W-What are you doing here?\" She said, embarrassed. She attempted to cover up her enormous chest, but failed rather miserably. Faye smiled maliciously, and decided to play innocent for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Celica! Long time no see!\" She said. Celica forced a worried smile on her face while she continued trying to hide her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes it has been a while h-hasn't it..?\" Celica said with a forced chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong? You seem worried.\" Faye said with a malicious smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, nothing's wrong!\" Celica said. Faye smiled and pointed towards Celica's huge bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a reason you're covering your chest?\" Faye said, visibly seeing Celica swallow in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Er...I mean, no. Not really.\" Celica replied. Her eyes darted all over the place for a way out of this situation, and Faye started to feel glad that that spell didn't kill her. This was <b><i>muuuuuch </i></b>more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You're not feeling any...<i>bigger</i>?\" Faye said deviously, and brought a hand her face to chuckle at her. Celica's eyes widened as she realized what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Faye?! You did this?!\" Celica yelled, letting go of her breasts. They jiggled hypnotically back to their resting position, and even Faye had a hard time looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh. Yeah, it was me.\" She chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why would you do...this?!\" Celica said, a blush starting to form on her face as she grabbed her breasts. Faye chuckled. She wasn't going to tell her the REAL reason, for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just wanted to see how you'd react. And I'll be honest, I'm amused.\" Faye said, taunting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you got bigger than I thought you'd get.\" She said, technically not lying. She pointed towards Celica's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Can you shrink them back down? I can't let Alm see me like this!\" She said in a panic. \"I can't let <b><i>anyone </i></b>see me like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye brought her finger to her chin with a wicked smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I think I'll leave you like this. I can't wait to see <i>Alm's</i> reaction to your bloated boobs!\" Faye taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?! You...\" Celica said in both frustration and shock. Celica's face reddened even more just thinking of what Alm would say. Faye had Celica right where she wanted her. This was gonna be fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you even DO this?!\" She yelled, her anger and embarrassment growing. At any moment someone else could stumble onto her and her massive boobs. She considered herself lucky her bra didn't snap off, but with how much of her cleavage was showing, it kinda balanced it out. Faye took out the tome and dangled it in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just used this little thing to do it. Quite a nice spell don't you think? You went from having average breasts to having the biggest pair in Valentia!\" She taunted. Celica's face reddened deeper than ever as she continued to look around, hoping no one was nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Celica's eyes widened as Faye opened the tome again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...! Wait!\" Celica pleaded. She attempted to approach Faye to stop her, but her huge boobs made it a bit difficult to reach her in time. Faye was enjoying every second of this. Before Celica could reach her, Faye blasted her at point blank with the spell again, sending her backwards, but like before she was able to keep her footing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" Celica said, realizing she'd been struck. \"M-My breasts are gonna...!\" She started before being overwhelmed by the same feeling as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh...!\" Celica groaned as she grabbed her breasts. She gasped in worry when she felt her breasts swelling outwards again, pushing her already on thin-ice bra far beyond any comprehensible levels. Faye smiled as she watched Celica glance around in panic before looking back at her own growing mountains. Celica tried to hold her boobs back from snapping her bra off, and it provided Faye with a most generous look at how absolutely MASSIVE Celica was, and is still getting! Her bra quickly ran out of room during her growth, and Celica could hear the strain her giant tits were placing on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no..! No...!\" Celica said, attempting to hug her boobs close to her to avoid snapping her bra off. \"B-Bra...too...tight!\" Unfortunately, her efforts were futile as her bra snapped off not a moment later, flying off towards Faye and landing at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyyaaaa!\" Celica exclaimed, her now completely exposed breasts dangling free from her body. Celica attempted to cover up her modesty with her hands, but her breasts just keep growing...and growing...Celica looked at Faye, who simply smiled deviously, enjoying watching Celica's predicament. She quickly adopted an angry expression on her face. A sharp burst of pleasure from her growing boobs caused Celica to let out a moan involuntarily, in which she immediately covered her mouth and looked at Faye. She had a shocked expression on her face, before sinisterly smiling. Damn! Why did she do that?! She'd make Faye pay for this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute of growth, it became clear that Celica's breasts weren't stopping. They've more than doubled in their previous size, and now are about twice as big as her head, EACH. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How big am I going to get?\" Celica asked Faye in worry. She simply shrugged and didn't answer. Soon after, her breasts finally stopped growing. They were now around 3 times the size of her head each, and the single biggest pair of breasts in history. Faye wasn't kidding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By Mother Mila...I'm gigantic..!\" Celica said in shock, trying to cover as much of her tits as possible. Faye chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel to be this huge? I bet <i>Alm </i>is going to faint when he sees you!\" Faye taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop talking about Alm!\" Celica snapped. She looked at Faye with a furious expression on her face.  \"Shrink my breasts down, NOW!\" She commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! Not a chance!\" Faye teased. Celica's breasts were starting to get heavy, and she knew that if she tried to get the tome back from her, she'd fail because her boobs would get in the way. Celica sighed in relative defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope no one sees me like this...\" Celica sighed. Her breasts were obscenely large at this point, and completely exposed for the world to see. Celica tried her best to at least cover her nipples, but she had difficulty doing so. She continued to look around, praying to Mila herself no-one approached them or saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It was her lucky day after all! She looked at Celica and noticed her grow more panicked by the second. She couldn't let Alm see her like this! With these...massive boobs! What would he say? She was lucky that they stayed in her stretched out bra, but where she <i>wasn't</i> so lucky was that <i>HE WAS COMING OVER TO THEM</i>! Before Celica could think of what to do, Alm approached them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Faye, Hey Celica!\" Alm said, happy to see his friend and wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Alm!\" Faye said affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi Alm...!\" Celica said, panicking. She covered as much of her enlarged chest as she could, and turned her body slightly away so he couldn't see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Is...something wrong Celica?\" Alm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! Don't worry! Nothing's wrong! I...I have to go!\" Celica said before running in the opposite direction. Alm noticed something odd while Celica ran away. He noticed something...jiggling as she ran. In reality, Celica's breasts were bouncing with every step she took while running. And even though she tried to hold them close as best as she could, they still bounced wildly. She ran into the back entrance of the castle and disappeared from sight. Alm turned back to Faye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to her? As soon as I ran up she left!\" Alm said, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not sure if Celica's feeling alright at the moment.\" Faye said with a controlled smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Is she okay? Do I need to grab the clerics?\" Alm said, worried about his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I don't think so. It's just...this psycho came and blasted her with this spell, and it...well...\" Faye began. She put her hands to her chest and blew air out of her mouth as she simulated her breast growth. Alm tilted his head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Alm exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...\" Faye began, she grabbed her chest and then put her hands out a bit further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't follow.\" Alm admitted. Faye sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spell made her boobs bigger Alm!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-He made her breasts grow? What kind of person...who would even make a spell like that?\" Alm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Delthea apparently...) Faye thought. She simply shrugged. \"I dunno. I was able to take him out, and I have the tome with me here in fact.\" She said, taking out the tome to show Alm. \"She was <i>super</i> embarrassed about it. She was worried about letting you see her in that state.\" She said deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celica...\" Alm said, looking towards the castle. Faye sighed to herself. If only he worried about her as much as he did Celica...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to help her get back to normal.\" Alm said, looking back at Faye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? She doesn't even want you to see her in this state.\" Faye said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Alm said, bringing his hand to his chin. \"Is there any spell in the book that can shrink her back down?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Checked every one.\" She said, lying. She could only make out a word or two in the tome at max, but Alm had no reason to distrust her, at least not yet, so it was extremely easy to lie to him. Mila help her when Celica tells him...but she was already good at not being seen. She wanted to keep this up as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmm...\" Alm grunted, unable to think about what to do next. He looked towards the castle again with a worried expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go find Celica. You keep reading that tome and see if there's a way to reverse the effects of the growth spell, got it?\" Alm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Faye said, faking happiness. With that, Alm ran off towards the castle, and went through the back entrance much like Celica had. He looked around and couldn't see her anywhere. He thought to himself where she could possibly be, and decided to knock out the usual places one by one. He'd start with their room. Alm went up the castle stairs and down the hallway to the room where they slept. However, as he approached the door, he could hear...crying coming from the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica was sobbing in the room by herself, not wanting Alm, or anyone else to see her with such...massive breasts! Alm took a second to ready himself, before he got a boost of determination to help Celica feel better. He knocked on the door extremely lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celica?\" Alm called. Celica's tears stopped in a second, and a large gasp was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alm! D-Don't come in!\" Celica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celica, I know what's wrong. I came up here to try and help.\" Alm said rather straightforwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't let you...\" Celica stuttered, tears flowing from her eyes again. She really, REALLY hated this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celica...you and I are closer than family. I promise, I'll love you no matter what you look like. Please...open the door. Let me help you.\" Alm said sadly. After a second, and a couple sniffles, Celica responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...come in.\" She said. Alm opened the door to see Celica still standing with her back turned to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celica....\" Alm said, approaching his wife. She slowly turned around to show Alm her huge breasts. They were still barely being contained by her stretched out black bra, since none of Celica's other clothes could help her in the slightest. Alm's eyes widened, and a blush formed on his face. However, he quickly looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow...\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...they're massive.\" Celica said, placing her hand on her right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd...be lying if I said they weren't beautiful.\" Alm said, his mouth outrunning his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alm...\" Celica said affectionately. All previous traces of her sadness had vanished. However, Celica looked away, a small blush forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These things are...disgraceful...\" Celica said to herself. Alm walked over to her, and turned her towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Al-MMM!\" Celica exclaimed. Before she could finish, Alm had kissed her passionately on the lips, making Celica's eyes shoot open in response. The two kissed for several seconds before Alm eventually broke the kiss. Celica felt...odd. She wanted to keep going. She'd never felt like this before, but she was able to restrain herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you Celica...\" Alm said affectionately, gently caressing her face. \"I love you. No matter what you look like.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Alm!\" She exclaimed, burying her head in his chest as she gave him a hug. He happily returned the hug. When they broke, Alm snuck another look at her massive breasts, and Celica noticed. But...she wanted him to look? Just a few minutes ago, she didn't want ANYONE to see her like this. Why...has it suddenly changed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alm...you don't have to look away.\" She said affectionately. Alm's blush deepened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'W-What?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to look away. If you want, Y-You can look at them...\" She said, her own blush deepening. Alm looked back at Celica and stared at the absolute SIZE of his wife's chest. There was no doubt she had the biggest breasts in Valentia now. Celica giggled at her husbands reaction, and brought him closer...she embraced Alm again, this time, her breasts were in such a position that they squished against Alm's body. Alm felt this, but was able to keep his cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Alm.\" Celica cooed affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Celica.\" He replied just as affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey broke their hug and smiled at each other, his hands in hers. Alm took another glance at Celica's chest subconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Faye was the one who did this to me!\" Celica said, putting her hands on her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Faye did this to you?!\" Alm said, shocked. \"She told me some psycho came and made you...big!\" Celica's eyes narrowed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A psycho <i>did</i> make my breasts bigger. It was Faye.\" Celica replied rather coldly. Alm knew that when Celica was angry, to not get in her way.

Faye said that there was no real way to shrink you down, she'd checked the entire book.\" Alm said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really going to believe her after she lied to you about who made me like this?\" Celica said, staring at Alm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" Alm admitted. Celica began to walk towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait! Are you sure you want to go out...like that?\" Alm asked, worried. Celica's new look of determination...or perhaps intense anger pierced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go out like this just to find Faye and have her shrink me! Come on. We'll go together.\" Celica said, grabbing a large robe near the door to cover her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Let's go find her.\"  Alm said, catching up to his wife. Celica turned to him, and the two smiled at each other before kissing each other softly.

They decided to check out the area they had last found Faye for some clues as to where she had gone. However...they didn't really need to search for clues. Faye was...actually still there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she is!\" Alm exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Celica beckoned, she ran past Alm and started speeding off towards Faye, her large breasts making it a little more difficult than it should of been. Alm followed close behind. She had her back turned to the couple, and when they approached, Alm made the first move to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye? You've got a lot of explaining to do!\" He said, rather upset one of his childhood friends had lied to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Faye said, turning around. \"What for~?\" Faye said seductively. Alm and Celica's jaws dropped when Faye turned around. She was...massive! Her breasts had more than quadrupled in size from the last time they saw her, which was less than half an hour ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh....!\" Alm said, staring at Faye's breasts before looking away. \"W-What happened to you Faye?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why are <i>your</i> breasts bigger too?\" Celica chimed in. Faye walked up to Alm and wrapped her arm around his shoulder, giving him a giant look at her exposed cleavage. Her outfit was in even worse shape than Celica's was, and that was because...she was BIGGER than Celica! Her breasts were notably bigger than Celica's were, and while Celica was able to keep her bra, Faye's bra had long since snapped off, with only shreds of her outfit remaining to cover what little dignity she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fufu...I did this for you Alm...do you like them?\" She said, shaking her breasts in Alm's face. Celica's face went red with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you doing?!\" She yelled. Faye looked at her with an evil smile as she broke her embrace with Alm. She took a step backwards and began explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you see, when I discovered that the spell I hit Celica with was a spell that made a girl's breasts bigger, I thought this would be the perfect thing to get Alm to notice me!\" She explained. \"So I cast the spell on myself...twice! And it gave me these giant...beautiful breasts, so I can give them to you Alm.\" Faye said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Are you trying to seduce Alm away from me?!\" Celica said, starting to shake from anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I am Celica. Why? Afraid you'll lose him to my giant, clothes ripping boobs?\" Faye taunted. \"And I think they have quite the effect on him don't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlm tried his best not to look at either Celica OR Faye at this point. How did he get himself into this mess? Not only were his two closest female friends fighting, they were fighting over HIM! With huge boobs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Face it, you're not the biggest girl in Valentia anymore! I am! When I let Alm see these big boobs <i>up close and personal</i>, he'll forget all about your tiny tits!\" Faye said, glaring at Celica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You...bitch!\" Celica said, the first time either of them heard her curse. She began to approach Faye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just walk up with your own giant breasts and just try to take a married man from his wife!\" Celica yelled, furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh trust me Celica, I <i>can</i>, and I <b><i>will</i></b>.\" Faye said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlm could only watch as Faye and Celica verbally attacked each other. What could he do? He tried his best to think of something fast, before this fight goes south quickly. He tried to think of something to break up the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She took out the tome again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Fine, if you're going to get in my way, I'll just have to make myself even bigger for Alm!\" Faye said. Alm snapped back to reality hearing that, and looked over at Faye holding up the same tome that started this whole incident. Celica simply stared as Faye opened the page to the breast growth spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Faye! Don't make yourself bigger!\" Alm pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is for you Alm!\" She yelled out. She turned her gaze to the book, and that's when Celica striked! When Faye shifted her eyes to the book, Celica ran up and tackled her to the ground! Faye, not expecting Celica to do this in any way, fell to the floor and lost her grip on the book. The book fell a few feet from the two, and Celica immediately fixed her gaze on it and got off of Faye. Faye had a difficult time getting up because of the size of her boobs, but she was eventually able to get up. When she rubbed her head and looked in front of her, her heart sank. She saw Celica holding the tome in front of her with a furious expression on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's a war you want Faye...\" Celica began, her eyes glared at Faye. \"...It's a war you'll get.\" Immediately after saying this, Celica recited the spell in the tome and blasted herself with the breast growth spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Celica?! What are you doing?!\" Alm exclaimed. Celica looked over at him and flashed a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm making sure Faye won't take you from me.\" She said sweetly. \"Ngh...\" She groaned, before a rushing sensation began to overpower her. Her breasts began to swell outwards again, and made short work of her stretched black bra. Her bra snapped off completely, and revealed Celica's bare breasts to the world. Alm's jaw dropped as he stared, and even Faye blushed slightly, before snapping herself out of it. She had bigger problems! Celica's breasts grew at a quite rapid rate, and soon overtook Faye's large breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...\" Celica moaned. She had to admit, the growth <i><b>did</b></i> feel quite nice. Her breasts continued to swell outward, completely destroying any last shreds of Celica's outfit remaining, as they passed triple the size of her head in no time. Alm and Faye looked at each other worriedly, before looking back at Celica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts grew...and grew...until they suddenly stopped, knocking Celica back to reality. They had stopped at around 4 times the size of her head, and started to rival pumpkins in size. She walked up to Faye and pressed her gargantuan breasts against her comparatively tiny chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. No there's no question as to who will have Alm.\" She said rather bluntly. Faye looked at Celica in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Celica...\" Alm said, staring at his wife. Celica looked over at Alm's blushing face and giggled sweetly. Faye's breasts, while extremely large under normal circumstances, paled in comparison to Celica's mountains, and she wasn't going to standby and watch Celica outgrow her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

They'd grown up together, they'd laugh together, cry together, get in trouble together...although that last thing was probably more of Gray and Tobin's thing. But...ever since she joined the Deliverance and fought with Alm, she noticed just how many girls seemed to like him. Celica, although thankfully she wasn't there anymore, Clair....and they'd probably find more. Clair was her biggest competition at the moment, and try as she might she'd never be able to match her body. Clair had a decently sized butt and deceptively large breasts underneath that outfit, but they weren't giant in any way. At least...they were compared to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her own chest and sighed once more. She wasn't flat, but she wasn't very big. The other girls in the Deliverance had bigger chests than she did, aside from maybe Delthea, but she didn't really care about any of the other girls. She didn't even care about Clair, she just wanted Alm. Faye picked up a nearby flower and started slowly picking the petals off of it, letting them float away in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do...\" She said to herself. She'd gladly spend every minute of every day working to make Alm happy, but if she couldn't compete with the other girls <i>physically</i>, would she even stand a chance in Alm's eyes? She wasn't even sure herself if Alm even CARED about such things, but if he did, she wanted to be the only woman in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alm...\" she said to herself. She closed her eyes and pictured herself with larger breasts, breasts struggling to stay contained in her shirt while Alm blushed at the mere sight of her chest. \"I love you...Alm...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt a rushing sensation in her chest, a wave of pleasure walling over her. She felt something odd...but strangely pleasurable in her chest. Her eyes widened as her breasts began to swell outwards, struggling to be contained in her previously small bra.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What...?\" She said, placing her hands on the log to avoid slipping off. Her breasts continued to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happen-\" Her bra snaps off. \"-ing...!\" Faye placed her hands on her growing breasts and felt a wave of pleasure course through her. W-Was this...for Alm? She smiled to herself and placed her hands back on the log, arching her chest out as her breasts grew bigger and bigger. Her shirt seemed like it was about to split open. A large tear had formed in the middle of it. Suddenly, they stopped growing. Her breasts were each about the size of her head now. Bigger than ANYONE in the army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow...\" Faye said, placing a hand on her breasts. She noticed she grew just as big as she pictured. This was amazing! Faye chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing! With these girls, Alm will only have eyes for me! And I'll make sure he never takes them off me!\" Faye said, her hands finding her way to her face, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I have to do is show him, and he'll fall in love with me!\" Faye said triumphantly, a wave of confidence entering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat your heart out Clair.\" She said wickedly. She giggled to herself as she rubbed her giant breasts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...should I go show him now?\" Faye pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Faye do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It has been two months since the fall of Duma, and Alm and Celica have ascended to become the King and Queen of Valentia. The other members of Alm and Celica's army had risen to become the King and Queen's close consultants and all having high positions in their kingdom. Delthea was one such member. She never liked work and loved being as carefree as she wanted, but ever since Alm and Celica became King and Queen, and the war ended, Luthier demanded she take a position training mages and sorcerers in Valentia's army. She begrudgingly followed his wishes, and to be fair, it <i>was</i> kinda fun training new recruits, especially when she got to beat the crap out of them when they underestimated her because of her age. Heh. Fun times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the end of the day, and the sun was setting on the Village near the castle. Most of the Deliverance members happily lived in that small village while Alm and Celica lived in the castle. Delthea walked through the front door of her house with a stressed out look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...another long day...\" Delthea groaned. She shut the door and locked it. The lock was a little messed up, but as long as it did it's job, she didn't care. Delthea walked towards her bed and threw herself on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lu...sometimes I really hate you for making me work so much...\" She said, bringing her hands to her face to rub her eyes. Despite it being fairly interesting, training the new mage recruits was pretty damn stressful. She laid on the bed for several minutes staring at the ceiling. She wanted something enjoyable to do to take her mind off of her day and let off some steam. Suddenly, she got an idea. She smiled slyly and brought herself up from laying on the bed. She stared at the bookshelf at the other side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-ho...that'll work.\" Delthea said, getting up and walking over to the bookshelf. She eagle-eyed one tome and grabbed it with a smile on her face before going back to the bed. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ooh this is <i>perfect</i>...\" Delthea said with a progressively more devious and desire filled grin. The tome she picked up was a...special case. It was an odd tome she found and kept to herself during the war that made whatever was shot with it grow. But instead of shooting food or something practical, Delthea kept it for...recreational purposes. Every once in a while she would shoot her chest with it and watch as her small chest rapidly expanded before her. The feeling she got from having her chest get bigger and bigger was unparalleled in her eyes. She used to do it regularly when she had the chance for fun and...<i>pleasure</i>, but with work being more and more stressful and time consuming, she hadn't had time to use it as much, if at all. She had an idea to use the pleasure from her expansion to help relieve some of her stress, and plus...she <b><i>really</i></b> liked doing this. Like...a LOT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelthea opened the tome and quickly flipped the pages to the spell she wanted. It was the same breast growth spell that she had used so many times in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is going to feel <i>great</i>...~\" Delthea cooed. She wasn't sure how big to make herself this time. It had been a while since she'd done this...but why not make up for lost time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big does Delthea make herself?</span></div></div>",

Her sisters were likely to be there, as were some of their old traveling companions.  Florina was especially hoping to see Mark.  She had never told anyway, but the mysterious tactician had won her heart during their travels and she'd never managed to say enough to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwith a slap of her cheeks, Florina decided today was going to be the birth of a new, bolder Florina.</span></div></div>",

Wonderful Pegasus related gifts from her sister and Hector, personal gifts from Serra and Lyn, and of course, the crown jewel in her opinion, a beautiful necklace with the image of a cresent moon with a pegasus rider inside.

Morgan knew that there was no real way out of this, and especially not with Robin's current mental state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...alright.\" He conceded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaay!\" Robin cheered, jumping as high as she could. Her breasts and rear bounced harder than ever, and while they jiggled, Morgan noticed the strain her bra was under. Her pants and shirt have long since ripped, but her bra and panties were trying their damn hardest to keep whatever shred of dignity Robin had covered. Robin quickly got onto her bed and rested on her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Morgie? I'm waaaaitiiing!\" Robin said playfully. Morgan was really worried about his mother now. This...didn't seem right to him. However, he did what he was told and got onto the bed in front of Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These first! Play nice now, you hear?\" Robin said, giggling. She all but threw her breasts into Morgan's hands, and he began softly rubbing them. Robin let out a moan of pleasure as she rested her hands on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...more Morgie!\" Robin playfully said. Morgan was trying to think of a way to snap his mother out of it, but with the sheer size and softness of Robin's boobs, he was having some trouble thinking. Her massive orbs squished together constantly, and Robin continued to moan like crazy. She was getting rather...horny. She wanted more of this. She giggled playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! I can take it! More!\" She said. Morgan picked up his pace as Robin began playfully jumping on the bed. They were slight jumps, since Morgan was still massaging her, but enough to make Morgan slightly jump as well, since the bed made him bounce. Her massive boobs bounced all the while, and Robin was laughing like a little girl. She was clearly getting into this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ooh, this was just the best! Having her precious little Morgie rubbing her huge, bloated boobs was just heavenly! Robin wasn't usually a woman who gave into carnal desires, but the powerful magic she'd used to swell her breasts and buttocks was affecting more than just her body. Her mind was literally clouded over by a fog of euphoria, the magic spell she'd used putting her in a near trance-like state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder normal circumstances, she would've been worried and concerned at the look of anxiety on her child's face, but she just couldn't focus on that right now. Not when her huge, bra-clad boobs were squishing and smushing together under his tender ministrations! Despite the unhappy look on little Morgan's face, there was still a deep pink hue to his cheeks, brought on by the wonderful sensation of the much bigger tactician's massive breasts squishing under his palms. They were so warm, so soft, so...big. He just wanted to cuddle up to them and fall asleep on them, the best pillows in the world... wait, what was he thinking?! He had to snap his mom out of this state! She clearly wasn't in her right state of mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't going to pay attention to anything that he said- nor was she likely to hear a word from him, with her moans as loud as they were. Between the pleasured cries and the constant bouncing on the bed, Morgan's soft voice would be easily drowned out by his mom's much louder tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut did he really have to stop this? It did feel good, after all. Feeling the humongous mountains (bigger than his head! Way bigger!) squishing beneath his palms, the doughy, supple flesh covered by the pulled-taut brassiere oozing out between his fingers... Ngh... No! He couldn't lose himself here. This was just another test, that was all! Just a test to see how he'd hold up to an enemy's seduction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was so caught up in his own thoughts, though, that he didn't realize his mother had stopped bouncing and rocking in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Morgan~~\" The tall, absurdly busty woman cooed. She was having the time of her life, and it looked like her son was too. After all, he still had his hands on her huge, bra-covered boobies! She giggled at the sensation, despite the fact that she was spilling out of the top, bottom, and sides of the undergarment, her pleasure was only heightened by the sensation of the white-and-black bra being stretched taut across her now vast bosom. Hee hee, talk about an improvement! She'd been an E-Cup before using the spell on herself the first time, but now she was so far beyond that it wasn't even funny. How her bra was still staying on was a mystery for the ages. What cup size was she now, anyway? Hmm... 'M' for Mama sounded about right. She'd gained about three cup sizes in the second growth spurt, so combining with the five sizes she'd gone up with the initial growth she would be right around an M-Cup... Nice! She was easily bigger than any other Shepherd. Tharja was the next biggest, and she was only about an I-Cup... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she might just be the \"biggest\" woman in Ylisse now! The only other person who was near her current size was Aversa, and Robin hadn't seen her sister in a few months anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some discomfort caused by the visibly-straining undergarment, however. The straps had been pulled taut and were digging into her soft skin at every opportunity, and it was actually pretty hard to breathe... her bra must've been reinforced with magic or something to still be holding on after being pushed so far past its advertised capacity! But even if there was magic involved, there was a limit to how much the undergarment's tensile strength could be reinforced. Through the fog of pleasure, the last rational part of Robin's mind hoped that her bra gave up the fight while there was still air in her lungs. That'd be a humiliating way to die, suffocated by her own too-tight bra... Originally the undergarment had comfortably cradled her slightly-larger-than-average pair completely, but now each cup was pulled perfectly flat across the surface of her breasts, the once convex shapes now being practically molded to each breast while leaving copious amounts of flesh exposed underneath and too the sides of each now-flat cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't like she was in any position to do anything about the drastically-undersized undergarment. Robin's body was fully controlled by her own overpowering lust, and that feeling was only heightened as she stared down into her son's frightened, nervous eyes (also something she would've made an immediate fuss over, had she been in her right state of mind). But right now, seeing his deer-in-the-headlights look only turned her on more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been doing such a good job making Mommy feel sooo good, now its time she gave you a reward. A nice, biiig hug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan barely registered Robin's words, his hands still pressed against the older tactician's massive breasts. His hands sank into the round mountains, each breast dwarfing the hand pressed to it as Robin's arms closed around her son like a coiling anaconda wrapping around its prey. Morgan squeaked as he was drawn face first into his mother's cleavage, the dark valley seemingly endless in its depth. Robin's strained bra saved her son from fainting here, the taut undergarment preventing Robin from drawing her soon in too deeply. Robin actually frowned in annoyance at that- stupid bra! Why did it have to be getting in her way?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, it wasn't easy for Morgan to breathe, and the warm, fabric-covered flesh became all he knew. The soft cloth smushed over his mouth and nose, and while Robin's valiantly-struggling bra prevented her from entombing him in her cleavage like she'd wanted, she was still able to use her hands to squish Morgan's head against the soft, rotund mountains, their titanic bulk threatening to squash him between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Robin's smothering goes too far. She suffocates poor Morgan unconscious with them! Playtime's over, time for mama to get her head on straight!<br>\r\n2) Morgan's not the only one short of breath! Robin's restricted breathing enables Morgan to free himself after a struggle.<br>\r\n3) Robin is still very horny, and after some smothering wants Morgan to massage her enormous, panty-covered rear!</span></div></div>",

Robin was clearly enjoying herself more than ever, and Morgan was slightly beginning to enjoy himself too. Although this was a serious problem, especially with his mother acting like a child, her breasts started to hypnotize him. He wanted to keep massaging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Robin perked up, and had a horny smile on her face. She reached behind her and unhooked her bra, throwing it aside. At least the bra met a merciful end rather than being snapped off. Morgan was then met with his mother's exposed giant mountains. Her nipples were extremely hard, a testament to how horny she was, and they bounced along with her breasts with every jump Robin did. Robin's face was far past red at this point, along with Morgan's as she continued to bounce her tits with her son. She felt an odd pressure in her chest, and it was building...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Morgie..! More! Something...is happening to me..!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Morgan said, worried about his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...more...!\" Robin pleaded, she bounced on the bed harder than ever, and both she and Morgan were bouncing like mad. The pressure in Robin's chest continued to build, as her moans became higher and higher pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...! AAAAAhhh...! Ngh...!\" Robin moaned. Morgan wondered if she was okay, but did what he was told and kept massaging her boobs. He decided to use his thumbs to pleasure Robin's nipples, and her eyes shot open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYAA! Yes! Morgie!\" Robin said. The pressure was building! It kept building...and building...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...gonna...burst!\" Robin said, Morgan's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Morgan yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYYAAAAAAAAA!\" Robin screamed, her breasts reaching their limit. Milk started to fly out of Robin's breasts, and started splashing Morgan in the face, along with trickling down her teats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What is...\" Morgan asked in shock. He noticed the white color and distinct taste as a few drops entered his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milk?\" Morgan asked. Robin giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah silly! Girl's boobies can create milk!\" Robin said playfully. She continued to bounce, so milk started flying EVERYWHERE. Robin grabbed her own breasts and started pleasing them herself. Morgan couldn't believe what he was witnessing, and Robin seemed completely carefree and happy about this! Robin giggled playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He knew it had something to do with the spell that changed his mother, he just didn't know what purpose this served.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgie how are you- Oh my god your face!\" Morgan heard Robin screaming right as the sensation intensified in his face. If he had a mirror he would've seen his eyelashes growing longer, and the eyes themselves changing to a bright blue instead of their usual brown. His nose and eyes shrunk a bit, while his lips got plumper. His hair grew out to below shoulder length, styled more like his sister Lucina than his mother, framing his now smaller and rounder face perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation intensifies again in his upper body and arms, fingernails grew out while the rest of his hand became slimmer and daintier. His arms grew shorter and his shoulders less broad. His torso and waist shrunk slightly and two bulges began to form on his chest. They quickly grew to a C cup size, big but nowhere near his mother's melons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changing feeling moved down for the the final time into his legs and feet. Some of Morgans lost weight from his torso would redistribute itself into his legs, making them longer and giving him some height back. Said legs became slimmer in some spots but a bit thicker at Morgans thighs. There was a loud cracking noise as his hips popped out and became wider, along with his ass growing substantially, matching his mother's before the spell. His feet became very slim as the last change approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of his stomach the tingling feeling shot up far more than the other parts of Morgans body, his anatomy was rearranging itself to become female instead of male. And with that change there was another sound and something disappearing from his groin region, fully signifying Morgans change into a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" Shreiked the new woman, noticing her higher pitched voice as another change. \"This body feels so weird and foreign I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I</i> think you look great like that Morgie, who knew my milk could do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan isnt quite sure how to feel, she...</span></div></div>",

She momentarily looked at Morgan, whose face was completely red, as he was wondering how he got into this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...how come I'm smaller than you Mother?\" Lucina asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin laughs and pats her massive chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Lucina, I can't have you outperforming Mommy.\" Robin said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough...\" Lucina admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin ponders something and takes her breasts off of Morgan's head. She walks to the other side of the room and faces her two children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I'll make sure to pay you back for this.\" Lucina said playfully. Morgan...couldn't tell what she meant by that. Before Lucina could walk out of the door to show Robin, she suddenly felt...odd. The same feeling as before was washing over her once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh...\" Lucina groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luci? Are you okay?\" Morgan asked, worried. Lucina clutched her stomach before the feeling went away completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...fine. I just felt a little strange.\" Lucina said, smiling with a worried expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange how?\" Morgan asked, curious. As soon as he finished saying that, Lucina's chest began to swell once again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha?\" Morgan exclaimed, Lucina remained silent, simply watching her growing breasts. Her outfit fought the good fight, but eventually lost the battle to Lucina's growing boobs. The outfit ripped open, and the sound of the ripping fabric snapped Lucina out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kya!\" She exclaimed, turning away from Morgan. Her outfit had a massive tear down the middle, and Lucina hoped Morgan didn't notice that she didn't exactly...wear a bra. A few minutes ago, she was as small as Cordelia in terms of chest size, and Lucina didn't really see the need for one, especially since they kind of felt uncomfortable. However, her predicament now was that her outfit was ripping open, and Lucina's ripped top was starting to cover less and less of her chest. Morgan tried to approach her from the side she was facing, not out of curiosity, but out of worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Morgan asked, unaware that Lucina's chest was still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine. One second...!\" Lucina said. With that, her chest completely ripped through the last remaining remnants of her top, leaving her gigantic orbs completely exposed. Soon after that, Lucina's chest stopped growing at roughly twice the size of her head now. She was by far the biggest girl in the Shepherds now. Lucina stared at her giant chest, before smiling. She grabbed the bottom of her boobs and hefted them upwards, giggling. She liked this. Any previous traces of panic have left her, leaving her to enjoy her bloated chest. She turned around to face Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I got a little bigger huh?\" She said with a smile on her face. Morgan's face went red as he looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem that way, yeah. You look like you have the biggest breasts in the Shepherds...\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...probably do!\" She realized. \"Mother...Lady Tiki...Aversa...even Noire! I-I'm bigger than all of them!\" She exclaimed in joy. Back then, she didn't really have a reason to be upset about her chest size, because she was fighting to save the world and her future during the war, but now that the war has long since ended, it had bothered her more and more, until now. She <i>LOVED </i> being this big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Lucina do next?</span></div></div>",

She couldn't put her finger on why, she just feels the need to have some fun with the one responsible for making her swell. \"Oh Morgan~\" she says in a playful yet strangely alluring voice. \"Do these look nice to you?\" She pushes her breasts up slowly as she looks at Morgan with a loving look in her face.

Knowing she's got him cornered, she places her hands on the wall on both sides of him as she leans forward, her breasts hanging below her and dangling in his face. \"Hehehe. You're so adorable when you're flustered~\" she says in a playful tone as she slowly moves her torso side to side, making her tits wobble alluringly. Morgan just stared with a bewildered look on his face. He's more concerned at the moment than anything else. Why is Lucina behaving like this? This isn't like her. Was it a side effect of the spell?

A soft moan escaping her lips in response. \"Mmmm.

It was an alteration of a healing spell, capable of replacing health with a body part and increasing the size of that instead. She clicked her tongue in frustration.<br>\r\n\"Healing magic...\" She mumbled. \"I can only use offensive magic... Wait... Nosferatu is offensive... what if...\" She then ripped out the page of the spell and that of Nosferatu, then flipped to a blank page, and got to work.

I wonder if Morgan is still guarding his desk.\" After slinking around and peering inside, she confirmed that Morgan had indeed left. His desk was completely open and inviting someone to sit down and begin, to which Lucina readily agreed. With speed enhanced by her unnatural desire, Lucina quickly hacked together a perverted, quite literally, version of Nosferatu, capable of taking the attributes of a target and apply half of it to the user.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfect!

A lock of her brilliant blue hair fell and came to rest upon those massive, sloshing orbs as the wind caressed them like a lovers hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight girlish noise escaped her lips, and Morgan stared. A bead of sweat trickled down his forehead as the most perfect, the most indecent naked chest he had ever seen dangled before his reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight clinking noise suddenly broke the blue haired princess from her trance. Morgan had stumbled back and bumped into something. His mouth was full of drool. Lucina looked down. Almost obscured by her massive breasts, a shattered vase was lying upon the wood boards of the cottage floor. And to her surprise, her own hands were lying upon her swollen bust. They had been massaging, rubbing, pumping her chest before the poor boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, her face finally turned scarlet. Her arms darted up over her nipples, unavoidably giving those luscious mounds one final delightful jiggle as they grazed against her milky skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh-ha-ha\u201d She tried to laugh, with awkward result. \u201cI, uhhh, I think - I believe I\u2019ll be needing a new uniform\u2026\u201d She turned her back to him, her heart pounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy mumbled a hasty affirmation as. He darted into the backroom. She heard the door lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA new uniform\u2026\u201d Her lips silently repeated. Thoughts of lingerie and cleavage bounced and jiggled in her heart. She saw herself strutting down the stairs of a royal ball as countless eyes peered down her deep swaying cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no what am I thinking\u2026\u201d She clutched her head, and her breasts plummeted and bounced as they fell from her mortified hold. \u201cI\u2019m-I\u2019m becoming obsessed-maybe-\u201d Her eyes spun around the room. \u201c-maybe this wasn\u2019t such a good...idea\u2026\u201d something registered within the corner of her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t know why she took it. They were already big enough, as far as she was concerned. Heart pounding, mind blank, she snatched it like a burglar and hit it within the lower part of her uniform. The part that hadn\u2019t been ruptured by that very same book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened. Morgan trotted out, holding a large size dress i one hand. His breath was faint, his face was deep red, and his clothes hastily redressed. It was obvious to both of them what he had been doing back there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-this should work.\u201d He stammered as he offered the dress to the blue haired titty princess. She snatched it like a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, she stepped out of back room herself. Morgan was sweeping up the fragments of the vase he had knocked from its perch.

Nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no proble-\u201d He began to answer in a squeaky voice, before he was interrupted by a sudden pop and a button flying through open space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress had burst open, revealing, indecent, slutty cleavage. Cleavage that seemed to reach all the way down her chest. Full, deep, perfect. It was no longer the pure, wholesome sight of bare breasts hanging in freedom. The dressed squeezed, too small, too tight. It squeezed her chest up and over. It squeezes her breasts together into magnificence as the two mounds strived to burst from the cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina looked down. Deep into that cleavage that was hers. For a moment she felt as if her knees were going to buckle, as if they\u2019d turned to jelly. She had to look away. It was like staring into the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019vegottago!!!\u201d She burst out, slamming the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran, she ran, she ran.

They sagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the book fall from the dress, from the hiding spot she had stashed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...what do I do now\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt something wickedly lewd stirring inside her stomach.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He brought his hand to his dropped jaw and attempted to put it back in place. Seemingly...well...no, DEFINITELY overnight, his wife went from having average sized, maybe slightly larger than average size breasts, to breasts the size of pumpkins! And not the tiny ones either! He could not believe what he was seeing. Her breasts took up more space on the bed than he did! Ricken couldn't look away. Hesitating, he reached out and gently placed a hand on one of Panne's breasts. It was the softest thing he'd ever felt, and he knew what cuddling with a Taguel was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm..!\" Panne moaned, reacting to Ricken's touch. Her eyes slowly opened, only for her entire vision to be filled with her massive boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Oh no, oh no no no no!\" Panne panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Panne! Calm down! I'm here!\" Ricken said, grabbing his wife's hand. She held on tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's never been this bad before!\" Panne said out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Ricken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see...I already told you our bodies change to attract Taguel males...\" Panne began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So our chests swell incredibly until mating season is over. But my chest has never gotten THIS big!\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You must be disgusted with me...\" Panne depressingly said. Her ears adorably drooping to cover her eyes, as if to cover her shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next wasn't a reply from Ricken, nor was Ricken going to walk out, or be ashamed of her...no. What happened next shocked Panne to the core. Ricken passionately kissed her on the lips. Her ears shooting upwards in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha...?!\" Panne exclaimed. Ricken stayed just a few inches from his wife's face and whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Panne...I said it before...I'll love you no matter what you look like.\" Ricken said, causing Panne to blush. Panne without saying a word grabbed Ricken and pulled him close. Giving him the biggest (and softest) hug he's ever had, before passionately returning his kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Ricken...I love you...\" Panne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Panne.\" Ricken responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm....\" Panne groaned, biting her lip suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Ricken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well...there was one thing I didn't tell you about the Taguel mating season. Along with our...changes\" Panne began, placing a hand on her enormous breasts. \"We also became a lot more...lustful.\" Panne whispered the last words to Ricken, who suddenly began to blush. Without saying a word, Panne pulled Ricken close, a smile full of desire forming on her face. \"D-Do you want to...\" Panne began, unable to finish her own sentence. Ricken kissed her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you my love.\" He responded, placing a hand on her breasts, causing her to moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Careful! They're more sensitive during mating season!\" Panne told him. With a small smile, Ricken began to softly knead his lover's immense chest, inviting more moans as a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ahh...Ricken...\" Panne moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, all Ricken wanted was to bring pleasure to his wife. Her facial expressions and rather high pitch moans were adorable to him. They loved each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She hides behind the corner to get a good look at who it is he's conversing with. Realizing it's one of the females of the group, Cordelia. Tharja became enraged to see him engage with a woman that isn't herself. Although Robin hasn't shown any signs of seeing Tharja as anything more than a comrade on the battlefield, she still obsesses over him endlessly. Spending almost every other day thinking of ways to gain his affection. Before Robin turns around to see her there, she turns the other way down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She enters her room, and begins brainstorming her next scheme to make Robin her own. \"Robin sure seems quite friendly with Cordelia.\" she mutters to herself aloud. \"Just what is it about her that he admires anyway?\" She contemplates for a moment, and remembers her chest plate. More specifically, how much it accentuates her female assets. Though Cordelia's chest is actually much smaller than her chest plate would lead one to believe, Tharja was not aware of this secret. And as such, had already decided on her plan. \"Well, if it's a large breasts he likes, then I'll be more than happy to give him what he desires~\" she says with a mischievous cackle as she begins work on her new scheme. She spends over an hour and a half trying to find anything in her tomes to achieve her desires, but none seem to have the answer. Annoyed, she tosses her books away. \"Fine! If nobody's made any spell or hex for bigger breasts, I'll just have to make my own!\" she says with determination in her voice. She goes to her shelf of assorted potions and animal parts to gather whatever she believes would be best suited for such a hex. Mixing them all together in a small cauldron, smiling deviously as she adds the finishing touches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hehehe~ This is sure to work!\" she says as she picks up her ladle to scoop up some of the contents and takes a small sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>How big will she get?</u></span></div></div>",

Sighing in dismay, she was about to say how much of a failure this turned out to be.

A wide smile forming on her face as she watches her fingers getting pushed outward more and more. \"Mmmm~ Didn't expect this to feel so good~\" she says in a lustful tone, groping and rubbing her breasts as they rise in both size and sensitivity. Once they reach cantaloupe sizes, her bra starts to become painfully tight. Digging deep into her skin, practically screaming for mercy. \"Nghh!! T-Too tight!\" she says in slight pain. \"Better take this off befor-\" but it was too late. Her bra finally reaches it's limit and snaps off. Revealing her bountiful fleshy orbs to the open air. \"Oof...well, it's not like I'd be able to wear that anymore anyway.\" she says almost coyly as her breasts continue their growth for another moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They finally stop once they each become nearly a size and a half bigger than her head. She simply stands and stares at the amazing girth of her breasts. Rubbing her exposed flesh softly, cooing from the pleasure they give her. Noticing the mirror nearby, she glaces into it for a better look at her new and improved body. She chuckles mischievously as she poses in different angles to get a better look at how her breast appear. Firm yet supple, perky and bouncy, and just the right amount of sag to show just how natural they are while maintaining a good round shape. \"Hehehe~ They're perfect! Robin will never be able to resist these!\" she says with elevated confidence. She was more than ready to claim Robin now more than ever!</span></div></div>",

Instead of giving the blue haired royal a proper answer, she just attempts to stand back up. Her boob weight making things more difficult then necessary. \"Grr, damn it!\" she curses aloud. \"I was hoping to find Robin here! Where else would he be!?\" As she stands tall, Lucina stares from below at just how large she had become. Her eyes widened with astonishment, and her face giving a slight blush. Once her amazement wears off, she gets back up to speak to the busty mage properly. \"Um Tharja? W-What exactly happened to your...umm...\" she tries to address the rather large elephant in the room, but Tharja interrupts her quickly putting together what she's thinking. \"Oh, these?\" she says as she places her hands beneath her boobs and lifts them up, jiggling slightly as they are lifted. \"Just the results of this new hex I put together myself.\" She lets her boobies fall back into a neutral position. They jiggle and bounce somewhat wildly for a brief moment, Lucina staring at them in amazement. Her jaw practically hitting the floor. \"W-Wow...umm...this is...quite an impressive development.\" she says, unsure of what else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tharja however is becoming somewhat annoyed.

But before she can make it very far, she is halted by Lucina as she grabs Tharja's hand before she can even take two steps behind her. \"Wait.\" Lucina starts, Tharja's annoyance increasing noticeably. \"Did you really do this to yourself just to appeal to Robin?\" she asks curiously. The busty mage sighs and answers \"Yeah, I did. Can I go now?\" Lucina begins to speak, but in a somewhat nervous tone. \"Well...if you don't mind me asking...whatever it is you did to increase your chest...umm...\" she tries to finish her question, feeling a bit afraid to even ask it. \"Hurry up! I don't have all day!\" Tharja barks at her in further annoyance. The remark scares Lucina into blurting out her question without a second thought \"C-Can you make my chest bigger too!?\" she says, immediately feeling the embarrassment as her cheeks blush a noticeable pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Tharja do?</span></div></div>",

The smell of the cauldron emanating around the room.

The smell was almost enough to make her reconsider her decision. But with her fantasy so close to becoming reality, she was not going to allow it to slip her grasp. She watches Tharja stir up the contents within the cauldron with her ladle, and scoops up a good amount of it. Handing it to Lucina. \"Here. Just keep in mind, I only took a small sip and got this big.\" she says as she pats her breasts, making them jiggle as she continues speaking. \"I don't know exactly how large they'd get with a bigger gulp, so don't go overboard with it.\" she informs her. Not that she really cares much for what happens to her, as long as it gets her to stop bothering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Resisting the urge to gag, Lucina brings the ladle closer to her lips and sips up a decent amount. \"Blegh!!\" she reacts as she drops the ladle on Tharja's foot. \"Hey!! Careful where your putting my stuff!\" she shouts at Lucina. Before she can apologize though, Lucina feels a strong ping in her chest, causing her hands to lunge for them. \"Nngh...T-This feeling...\" she mutters to herself as pleasure builds up. Her hands start to feel two small bumps forming on her chest, pushing her hands outward. She gasps as she looks down and sees her breasts expanding before her eyes. \"My breasts! They're growing!\" she exclaims in astonishment. Her fingers squeezing her chest as they reach the size of oranges and gain more mass. She moans softly from the squeeze, the feeling too enjoyable for her to stop. Tharja watches blankly as she realizes Lucina is enjoying herself. \"If you're gonna act like that, take it to your own room.\" she says, snapping Lucina out of her lustful daze. \"Oh! M-My apologies!\" she answers embarrassingly. She lowers her hands and just stares at her expanding bust. Amazed at not just how much they're growing, but by how her clothing is still managing to hold them in despite how tight they're becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is amazing!\" Lucina says excitedly. Her breasts expanding more and more, reaching Tharja's original size. \"Umm...when will they stop anyway?\" she says with mild concern in her voice. Tharja shrugs. \"You were smaller than me before, so I doubt you'd end up bigger than me if you took a small sip like I did.\" she answers. Lucina feels her bra tightening to almost painful levels. \"Nngh! It's g-getting a little...tight.\" she says beneath painful grunts as she strips her over shirt off and reaches beneath her under shirt. \"HEY!! I DIDN'T SAY YOU CAN STRIP IN FRONT OF ME!!\" Tharja shouts angrily. Lucina jumps back in shock from Tharja's sudden outburst. \"S-Sorry! M-My bra is getting too t-tight!\" she responds in a startled voice. Before she can unclip her bra however, her breasts become far too big to be contained, and burst out. Her bra falls out of her under shirt, landing in front of her feet. She blushes in embarrassment as her breasts are now unsupported, her erect nipples now prominent beneath her under shirt. As if to save Lucina from further embarrassment, they stop growing once they reach the size of cantaloupes. Realizing her growth has ceased, she lifts her breasts up to feel their full weight, and lets them go. Almost falling forward from the weight pulling her slightly. \"Whoa! They a bit heavier than I would expect.\" she says in astonishment. \"Yeah, you'll get used to it after a while.\" Tharja says. Lucina slowly fondles her newly developed breasts with a smile on her face. \"Mmmm~ They feel wonderful.\" she says in an aroused voice, cooing softly as she caressed her lovely mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, that's enough fun in here!\" Tharja says in annoyance. \"I finished my end of the bargain, now you heed yours!\" She  walks towards the door and opens it up, indicating to Lucina that it's time for her to leave. \"Oh. R-Right.\" Lucina replies. \"Thanks again for your help. I can't wait to see how the others will react to this!\" She leaves with a loving smile on her face. Tharja looks down at her own bust with a small blush on her face. \"Yeah. I know how you feel~\" she says as thoughts about Robin's reaction to her own breasts fill her mind.</span></div></div>",

Before she can even think about getting up to see who it was though, she hears the muffled grunts of a familiar male voice. She gasps silently as she recognizes this voice. \"Robin?\" she asks with a small hint of excitement in her voice. She lifts up her breasts and she gets up on her knees. Looking down, her assumption was confirmed. His familiar white hair and robes were immediately recognizable to the obsessed mage, and a smile formed itself on her face as she looked down at him. \"Ooh Robin~\" she says in a sultry voice. \"I was hoping I'd get to speak with you. Notice anything...different?\" She lifts her boobs up higher in an attempt to tease the tactitian with her allure. Robin stares up at her. His eyes wide open, gazing at the copious of underboob visible below the sheet covering Tharja's breasts. Most of it anyway. \"Tharja? Is that really you?\" he says in disbelief. Tharja's smile grew wider, believing that her plan had finally worked. She leans down, smothering his chest with her breast which were soft to the touch and squished nicely between their bodies. \"Oh yes it is, my darling tactitian~\" she says with desire in her voice. \"I've done this just for you! Now you'll never have to worry about finding the perfect woman. Because I've got more than enough softness for you to enjoy~!\" she continues, suppressing a moan from her lips as she squishes her breasts further and further as her face inches closer to his. All Robin can do is lay there, trapped underneath the buxom mage on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robin tries to speak, but has trouble finding the right words. \"Tharja, I....I don't know what to say.\" he says. Tharja started becoming more a bit more frisky as she grabs his hand and sits back up. \"You can say that you love me. Or that you love my new assets.\" she says in a lustful tone. \"You can even touch them if you so desire~\" she continues as she places his hand on her breasts. Pressing it firmly into her soft flesh, moaning audibly from the sensation. Robin however was not in the mood as he takes his hand back. \"Tharja! This is not the place for this kind of thing!\" he says in embarrassment as he tries his best to scoot himself out from underneath her. \"Oh, you're right my love. We should find somewhere private to have our fun~\" she responds as she stands up, ready to head to where ever Robin may want to go. Robin picks himself back up and dusts himself off before speaking. \"Sorry, Tharja. While I will admit your new...'developments' are quite impressive, I don't see that as reason enough to marry you.\" he says in a calm voice. Despite his calm demeanor though, Tharja's expression changes from a lustful grin to a bewildered frown. \"W-What!? After all that I've done to get these!? Do you not enjoy large breasts!?\" she asks in confusion as she picks up her boobs and jiggles them in front of him. Robin shakes his head in exasperation. \"Sorry. You look nice I will admit, but looks alone just don't cut it for me.\" he says trying to be as respectable as he can. \"Besides....I uhh...prefer bottoms anyway.\" he says in a somewhat shy tone as a blush appears on his face. Tharja just stands with a look of disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I better get going. Chrom wanted to have a meeting with me to discuss some things.\" he waves goodbye before passing by her to head his way to his destination. Tharja stands there, staring down at her engorged rack with a malcontent look on her face and sighs. \"Great. Not only did this not work, but now I have to buy new clothes that will fit my enlarged failures! There goes my savings...\" she says as she pinches the bridge of her nose in annoyance.</span></div></div>",

The memory of her breasts pushing against their chest during the incident still lingering within her subconscious. Her face blushing as she smiles. \"Oooh. This feeling...\" she silently whispers to herself as a soft moan escapes her lips. Suddenly, a warm pleasurable feeling emanates from her chest. At first she assumed it was her heart fluttering from the romantic thoughts she was fantasizing about her secret love. But then it grew stronger, and stronger. It was then she remembered the little known fact about manakete's. When aroused, their breasts grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her pulse speeds up as her face becomes flush with arousal. She looks down to see her already sizable breasts slowly expand before her very eyes. Her eyes widen upon seeing them swell. But while she was feeling mild shock and concern, those feelings were quickly overshadowed by her own arousal. More thoughts entered her mind about the Shepherd she had been obsessing over all day. Her dress tightens across her bust as they reach the size of her head, and continue growing. Her moans increase in volume as her hands begin to slowly caress them softly, her fingers sinking into the billowing skin. \"Mmmm~ I've never felt such bliss before\" she whispers in her euphoria of pleasure before letting out a more audible moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before she can really start enjoying herself though, she hears the doorknob twist.

I heard some strange noises in he-whoa!\" he comes in interrupting himself as he's greeted with an even bustier Tiki than usual. Tiki blushes in embarrassment, trying her best to cover her inflated mammeries with the sheets on the bed. \"R-Robin!! I-I'm...What are you...\" she stammers, failing to maintain her composure. Robin takes a moment to take in the sight he had seen. His eyes trying his best to maintain eye contact with the manakette, but they glance down towards her chest every few seconds. \"Tiki? What happened to your body? Did someone put a curse on you?\" he asks with concern in his voice. Tiki begins to speak up, still flustered from the situation. \"N-No. I..um....my body is...\" she sighs as she pauses for a moment to form her sentence in her head. \"I'm sorry Robin. It's just...when a manakette such as myself feels....aroused, their breasts grow.\" she finishes with a deepened blush in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robin stands silently, taking in what he had been told. \"So...this is natural then?\" he asks calmly and curiously. Tiki nods her head, her eyes looking away in embarrassment. Robin's expression changes to a mildly flustered one. \"Oh! I'm so sorry. I'll uhh...give you your privacy then.\" he says as he begins to turn to leave. Before he can exit however, Tiki calls out to him, \"Wait!!\" Robin halts, but resists turning around to remain modest. Despite already seeing her expanded orbs. \"Umm...C-Can you...stay for a moment?\" she asks in a soft timid voice. Robin turns to face her with a quizzical expression. \"Are you sure? You're still...you know.\" he replies. \"I know. But...there's something I've been meaning to tell you for a while now.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The tactician, curious about her statement, accepts her request and says \"Alright. What is it you need to say?\" He walks closer to her so that he may sit beside her. The closer he gets however, the more Tiki starts to feel anxious. Her soft breathing picks up pace as her face becomes redder. As Robin sits down next to her, her heart starts racing wildly within her chest. \"If there's something wrong, I'll do whatever I can to help.\" Robin says in a compassionate tone. The words cause Tiki's chest to resume expanding, causing her to gasp in surprise as they push the sheet covering them away. Robin reacting in a similar manner as he turns his head away, blushing in embarrassment while she readjusts her cover. \"Oh dear...\" she says with a sigh. She takes a deep breath as she mentally prepares herself to speak her mind. \"Well...you see, Robin. The reason my breasts have been so aroused is because...I...I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robin's head quickly turns back to her in surprise. \"What!?\" he asks. Tiki simply sits there with an embarrassed blush as her nipples make themselves pronounced beneath her cover. \"Y-Yes...It's true.\" she begins. \"You've always been so kind and helpful. And charming~\" she continues as her breasts grow again. Her face grimacing as she feels them expand. But there's no point worrying about that right now. Now she awaits Robin's response. Robin takes a deep breath, trying to regain his composure so that he may respond to her. \"Well, I'm glad you told me this Tiki.\" he begins saying. He then places his hand Tiki's. She looks up at him with a soft gasp and a curious look before hearing him say, \"Because I've actually felt the same way about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>What happens next?</i></u></span></div></div>",

Before she can say anything though, the feeling within her breasts intensifies far greater than before. \"Ahh!!\" she yelps in slight pain, which almost immediately becomes replaced with immense pleasure. Her breasts growth speeds up, gaining more and more mass with each passing second. Tiki moans loudly as she presses her hands into her swelling mammeries as Robin stares in disbelief. \"T-They're growing even faster? Just how big can they get?\" Robin asks in astonishment. Tiki just stares down with wide eyes as they billow out at a rapid pace. \"I...I don't know. Nnngh~ I-I've never been this aroused before!\" she says before moaning even louder and higher pitched as they become too big for the sheets to cover and begin slipping out of them. Tiki gasps in shock as she reaches her hands out to cover her nipples. Upon doing so though, they sent a strong wave of pleasure through her body, making her moan even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Robin was so amazed by all of this, that he couldn't even speak. The divine dragon he just confessed his love to is growing breasts the size of a pony. And they show now signs of stopping anytime soon. His face blushing, hands trembling. He's been trying to fight the urge to touch them this whole time. But now, he can't hold back anymore. Without even thinking, his right hand reaches forward and presses into the soft fleshy orbs in front of him. Tiki gasps as a massive spike of arousal rushes through her. Her legs trembling as it overwhelms her. After doing this, Robin regains himself and pulls back. \"Ah! I-I'm sorry! I-I didn't mean to-\" he tries to apologize but Tiki interrupts him mid-sentence. \"It's okay.\" she begins as she grabs both his hands and plants them firmly on her inflating chest. She pants heavily, smiling somewhat lewdly as she suppresses a moan so that she may speak. \"Y-You can do whatever you like. My love~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pausing for a moment, Robin takes this opportunity to wrap his arms around her massive bust as best as he can, squishing them against his body. \"KYAAAAAA~!!\" Tiki yells in ecstasy. Her panting increasing in pace as she starts to sweat from how hot she's feeling. \"Ooooh Robin~\" she says as she reaches far forward to grab Robin and pulls him close to her over her breasts, and they both fall back together. With Robin laying on top of her, Tiki begins kissing him passionately as Robin continues prodding and kneading her breasts like dough. They grow, and grow, and grow. Reaching the sizes of fully grown horses with Robin getting squeezed between them. Still kissing his lover lovingly. Neither of them even noticing the obvious creaking of the bed as the frame loses strength. A short moment later, her breasts finally stop growing, but they become too much for the bed to handle. The frame breaks, sending the mattress to the floor with Tiki and Robin falling with it. The impact causing Tiki's breasts to jiggle wildly like two giant blobs of jelly. \"Whoa!! Oh dear...\" Tiki responds in surprise. Robin just chuckles in amusement. \"Don't worry. This was an old bed anyway.\" he says almost jokingly. Tiki chuckles along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>What happens next?</i></u></span></div></div>",

Robin's eyes on Tiki's massive breasts. Now that their kissing has halted, he can actually see just how large she had become. And he is blown away by what he sees. \"T-Tiki! Your breasts are...huge!\" Robin says in amazement. Tiki giggles in response. \"I know. They must be about as big as horse now!\" she says as she pats her boobs lovingly. \"They'll shrink back down after a while though. But let's just enjoy this while it lasts, my sweet~\" she continues with hearts in her eyes. Robin was mildly relieved to hear they would revert to normal, as her gigantic breasts would no doubt be difficult to deal with if they were permanent. But seeing them this big gave him a rather interesting idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tiki, they look astonishing in this size. But would you mind if we tried something a bit different?\" Robin asks. Tiki tilts her head in curiosity. \"Something different? What could you mean?\" she asks. While unsure of what he was talking about, she had a feeling it would be something enjoyable for the both of them. So she had no objections to it. Robin ready's his magic, a strange light red glow emanating from his hands. And then, the resulting glow fires a magic shot towards Tiki. She flinched upon seeing it blast towards her, but she didn't feel any pain once it hit her. Her confusion rises from this, but her questions about it are quickly answered before she even had a chance to ask them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She feels the strange yet familiar growing sensation once again. But this time, it isn't coming from her chest. It's coming from her butt. She gasps as she turns her head back and looks down at her posterior, watching it surge outwards. \"Oh my!! R-Robin! Did you do this?\" she asks, already knowing the answer, but asks anyway just to confirm it. Robin blushes as he nods his head. \"Eheh. Well, as embarrassing as it is to admit, I've always had a thing for...large posteriors.\" he says somewhat shyly. While Tiki was surprised by this reveal, she didn't mind. In fact, she was enjoying her ass growth. So much in fact that she turns her body around, facing her billowing booty towards Robin. A sly smile forming on her face as she wiggles her hips alluringly, jiggling her inflation cheeks. \"Is this satisfying to you~?\" she says in a sultry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin simply smiles and gives her a thumbs up. Too invested in watching her butt swell to verbally answer. He's clearly excited to see just how big her butt gets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>How big does her butt get?</i></u></span></div></div>",

She's always had trouble talking with anyone. This was especially the case with boys, thanks to her large breasts always taking their attention away from her as a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then there was Morgan, son of Robin. The young tactician had traveled back in time along with the rest of them, and he was always so sweet to her. Sure, his eyes drifted down to her chest every now and then, but he never let that distract him from who she was inside. She felt her heart pumping at the mere thought of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to tell him how she felt, about how much she loved him, but every time she tried, she backed down out of fear that she wasn't pretty enough to fully catch his eye. Even if she was wrong and knew it, she couldn't help the thoughts always resurfacing. She needed a confidence booster. Something that will let her march into his tent, look him in the eye, and tell him how she felt,  and she knew just the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking into her mother's tent, Noire was on the hunt for a particular book. \"Purple back, heart on the cover.\" She muttered to herself. Sure enough, right next to Tharja's bed was the tome she was looking for. Checking to ensure the dark mage in question was nowhere near, Noire grabbed the book and bolted out of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja had told her about this particular book. It was full of spells meant to affect physical attractions. She didn't want to literally entrance her soon-to-be lover, but there was a particular spell in here that she knew about that could help with her confidence problem. Flipping through the book, she found the right page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. Okay then, here goes nothing.\" She then begins to chant the ritual in the book. As she chanted, she could feel her bust growing larger by at least two cup sizes. She could feel the buttons on her top begin to pop off as they could no longer hold their cargo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and done, Noire felt up her new assests. Just a simple poke flooded her with pleasure, and continuous rubbing almost made her cum right ther in her tent. \"Perfect. If these don't catch his eye, nothing will.\" With newfound confidence, Noire was sure she could do it this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do next?</span></div></div>",

And she kinda wanted to see how Morgan would react to seeing her already large breasts had gotten bigger. She got up and left her tent to go look for Morgan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, she passed through the camp to go find Morgan. Gazes from all over fell upon her as everyone she walked past stared at her quite enormous chest. Not to mention the shirt she was wearing could barely contain them, and were just a button or two away from exposing her entirely. Noire actually didn't notice all of the lustful stares of the boys and the jealous stares of the girls. Hell, if Severa saw her right now, she'd get so jealous she'd probably storm off immediately. However, there was one set of boys that caught Noire's attention. As she passed through the camp. Inigo, Brady and Owain were sitting at a small table playing cards, when Inigo saw Noire walking by, and immediately noticed her....boosted assets. However Brady was the first to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot damn, look at Noire! Did she get bigger or something?\" Brady said, pointing towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it seems like her shirt can barely keep them in.\" Inigo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, bet you'd like to feel those in your face huh Inigo?\" Brady said, nudging his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up Brady.\" Inigo said, not admitting the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in Missiletainn's name are you talking abo-....\" Owain says as he turns around and sees Noire walking towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear Naga...\" Owain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Noire walked past, she noticed the trio of boys staring at her, and knowing Inigo of all people, she knew exactly what he was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DO YOU FOOLS THINK YOU'RE LOOKING AT?!\" Noire yelled, her other personality taking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pang of fear overtook the three boys, and Owain instantly turned around while Inigo and Brady looked in opposite directions to avoid her piercing gaze. Noire simply smiled when she saw the boys' reactions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Noire said, continuing to walk. She wanted to find Morgan before <i>more</i> people started gawking at her chest. A desire that was already impossible to fulfill. In no time, she disappeared from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are the beautiful ones always crazy...?\" Inigo said rather depressingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to walk until she found Morgan's tent. She cursed the fact that their tents were on literally the polar opposite sides of camp, but she made it. With her confidence still high, she made her voice known to Morgan inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan? Are you in there?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds passed before she heard a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah. I'm in here, come in.\" Morgan responded. She instantly opened the tent and walked inside. Morgan was a rather average sized boy, around 16 to 17 years old, much like the rest of them. He had black hair and wore a similar outfit to his mother Robin. Noire already felt her heart pang in love just from the sight of him. She slowly walked towards him as he got up from his desk and turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Noire, how's i-....\" Morgan said, being cut off instantly. His eyes fell upon Noire's giant breasts. She smiled, noticing his stare. Seems like her little plan was already working! Morgan soon snapped himself out of it and looked Noire in the face, trying to avoid glances towards her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey Noire. What's up?\" Morgan said, clearing his throat after. He tried everything in his power to avoid glancing at Noire's enormous tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Noire do?</span></div></div>",

You're always so sweet and kind. I would never fear taking on the world with you by my side.\" He declares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoire was so happy. She wanted to kiss him again and again until the sun burned out, but she couldn't help but get distracted by wanting to giggle at Morgan's embarrassment and attempts to avoid staring. It was something she loved about him, yes, but right now she <b>wanted</b> him to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stare at them all you want Morgan. After all, I grew them bigger just for you.\" This takes him aback a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You didn't have to do that for me. I loved you just the way you were.\" He responds, but with a little less hesitation to look with her permission. Noire decides to tease him a little for saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending over, she ensures that as much of her milky cleavage is visible to Morgan as possible. \"Oh? You mean you <i>don't</i> like them?\" She asks while putting a finger to her lips for extra seduction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, it's not that! They look great. It's just that you shouldn't have had to do that just for me.\" He explains with red face renewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. I certainly don't mind a little something like this to make you happy. So, now that we know that we're in love and that you like the new me... let's have some fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

And I would do it again and again, if I had to!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped up and down, making her head sized breasts bounce wildly. It was an almost hypnotizing sight. Morgan wasn't sure if her clothes would survive another bounce like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If that's the case, what would you think about making them... even bigger?' He still sounded nervous, but you could hear the entusiasm in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Even... Bigger? I-if you would like that, I'll do it. I even have the tome right here.' She pulled a tome from somewhere (Morgan wasn't really paying attention to this, since he wanted to see the spectacle himself) and then she cast the spell on herself again. Immediatly she felt the sensation of growing again. Her already much too tight top started to strain even more,her breasts overflowing on every opening they could find. The fabric started to tear, and you could see more and more creamy white flesh by the second. Morgan couldn't help himself anymore, and pulled the still growing woman in front of him into a kiss. Noire was so shocked at this, she didn't even notice him already groping her growing mounds with his right hand. She returned his kiss passionately, and still her breasts grew bigger. When Morgan released the kiss, her top was long gone and her breasts where reaching down to her hips. She was still longing for her beloved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, what's next?' </span></div></div>",

He was staring at her inhumanly sized breasts. Noire crawled towards her new boyfriend seductively and spoke in a soft affectionate voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you and I are together...I-I want to be the perfect woman for you.\" Noire said lovingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, but Noire, you're already per-\" Morgan said before Noire put a finger to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No. I want to be the <b><i>perfect</i></b> woman for you.\" Noire said again, a bit more forcefully. She reached around to her butt and rubbed it softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I want to make this just as big as these. J-Just for you.\" Noire said. Morgan's heart all but stopped at that moment. S-She wants to make her butt just as big as her COLOSSAL breasts?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What...?! Y-Your....\" Morgan stuttered. His face went several shades of red, and Noire couldn't help but giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee! Do....do you want that?\" Noire asked affectionately. Morgan was such at a loss for words for what was happening all he could do was nod his head. In a rush of happiness, Noire hugged him tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh Morgaaan!\" Noire exclaimed. Her heart was beating a million miles an hour, as was Morgans. They had just confessed their feelings for each other, and they were already making Noire bigger and bigger. She passionately kissed him just as he did to her not a moment before, her love for Morgan overriding her usual timidity. Noire's soft, mountainous breasts pressed quite intensely into Morgan's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmn..~\" Noire moaned softly into his mouth. Morgan's eyes shot open so wide he's surprised he didn't hurt himself. Eventually Noire broke the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm ready Morgan.\" Noire said with a massive blush on her face. She decided to get up and turn around. When Noire got up, her gigantic breasts jiggled like no tomorrow, which Morgan could <i>not</i> take his eyes off of. Noire cast the spell to make her butt grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaahh...!\" Noire exclaimed, and her butt began to expand, tightly packed into the bottom of her Archer's Outfit. Noire's butt wasn't exactly small, but it paled in comparison to her breasts, even back when she was normal sized. Her breasts got most of the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Morgan said, taking his eyes off of her breasts and to her butt. \"Aaah!\" Morgan exclaimed, watching it grow. There were already rips and tears being made into her bottom. Some strange feelings began to arise in Morgan. He was beginning to feel a little....<i>excited.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Morgan...\" Noire moaned softly. He looked up at her, who in turn used her hands to rub her growing ass softly. Was...she asking him to...? Morgan went up and began to rub her growing rear. Not long after he started, her butt RIPPED out of her bottom, and she was left in her adorable black panties that was the same color as her hair. Based on the sounds Noire was making, it seemed she really enjoyed this. And Morgan did too~ *wink*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, Noire's ass got so big that her panties were all but flung across the room, and Morgan was left rubbing Noire's gigantic bare ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Noire...! You're...h-huge...!\" Morgan exclaimed. Noire looked back with a blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's all for you my love...~\" Noire said softly and affectionately. Eventually, Noire's ass got so big, that it effectively matched her equally ENORMOUS breasts that reached down to her hips. Morgan crawled back on the bed to get a good look at this curvy goddess he now called his girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Do...do you l-like it...?\" Noire asked, admittedly quite worried about his answer, even though she really <i>shouldn't</i> have been for several reasons. Morgan once again could only nod his head. Noire jumped softly, her heart skipping a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh Morgaaaan!\" She began to rush him down and hug him again. Her gigantic breasts squished into his body again, and her butt was so inhumanly big that he didn't think any pair of panties in the world could cover them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, it dawned on Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severa!\" He exclaimed. Noire smiled and brought a finger to her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Why her? I'm not against the idea, but I'm curious!\" Noire said with a giggle. Noire was good friends with Severa, even before she boosted her confidence, so she was interested as soon as Morgan suggested her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Morgan began. \"I've always kinda wanted to see what Severa was like with bigger...well...\" Morgan said, pointing to Noire's gargantuan breasts. Noire giggled and grabbed his head. She shoved it into her breasts with a devious laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With bigger what Morgan~? You have to be specific~!\" Noire said affectionately. Morgan fished his head out of Noire's cleavage, and regained his composure, with a heavy blush on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Bigger boobs..\" Morgan said. Noire giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so <i>cute</i> when you blush..~\" Noire said, causing Morgan to blush harder. \"Severa it is then!\" Noire got up from the bed, her gigantic tits jiggling like mad in her obviously too small shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to lie, Severa was always jealous of my bust size, even before I made them bigger!\" Noire said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Morgan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she said something about me having 'freakishly huge tits', but also said I was 'lucky' in the same sentence.\" Noire giggled. She bent over slightly to give Morgan a look at her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think she'll react when she sees <i>these</i>?\" Noire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh man...\" Morgan said, staring right into her chest.

They smiled at each other before giving each other a soft kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked through the camp holding hands. Noire didn't care anymore that literally everyone was staring at them. It made Morgan slightly uncomfortable, because he KNEW why there were staring. After she and Morgan confessed to each other, she could care less if the whole world stares at her tits. They continued to walk together towards Severa's tent, and Noire and Morgan kept their grip on each other affectionately, as if neither one of them wanted to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She went back there to formulate a plan to get the breast milk she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uugghh...! Why did you have to make it so awkward Daddy...?!\" Severa groaned to herself as she walked back and forth...back and forth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered her options. She already knew that not very many ladies in the Shepherds had bigger boobs than her already.  In fact, besides Noire, she could probably only think of four others. And NONE of them were good candidates. First off was Tharja, Noire's mother. Tharja had a decent sized rack underneath that Dark Mage outfit. Guess that's where Noire got it from, even if Noire's WERE bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not gonna get myself cursed just for bigger boobs. Even I'm not that desperate.\" Severa said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was Aversa. Like Tharja, she was rather...dangerous to try and milk, and she didn't know <i>what</i> would happen if things went south with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Aversa was Tiki. Tiki, rather unknown to everyone despite her open top, had utterly gigantic breasts. However, she was also the daughter of Naga, and she'd be utterly screwed if she was caught. Even if Tiki may have been the most understanding of the candidates, Severa knew even SHE had her limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally after Tiki was Sumia. Out of the question. How was she going to milk the Queen of Ylisse without getting caught? She quickly ruled her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...! Noire's the only one with even a fraction of a chance for this to work! Gawds! Why does everything have to be so difficult?!\" She groaned out loud, throwing herself on her sleeping area as she tried to formulate a plan. She needed Noire's milk for this plan to work. At least if she was caught, she and Noire are good friends anyway, so it wouldn't have the same repercussions. Plus, Noire was bigger than most of the other candidates, so her milk must be more potent or something right? Gods, anything to have tits like hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Severa end up trying to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Severa decided that she'd take a small nap to wait for nightfall. She planned to sneak into Noire's tent while she slept, and milk her then. If she was discreet and quick, she wouldn't wake up right? Severa sighed and rolled over on her sleeping area, trying to think this plan through. No, as if someone WOULDN'T wake up if someone was playing with their gigantic tits...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking of other potential options she had, which were...not many at all, she was essentially forced to fall back on milking Noire in her sleep. It wasn't a foolproof plan by any sense of the word, but it at least had a fraction of a chance for this to work. After an admittedly sleepless nap due to obsessing over this plan, Noire's tits, and how big her own would be after this, night finally came and she heard many of the Shepherds return to their tent. Severa's eyes opened as she slowly heard the noise in camp fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...let's do this.\" She said to herself. She walked across her tent and picked up a small glass bottle to hold the milk, and a pair of gloves...just in case. She sighed as she looked in the mirror in her tent, and softly ran her hands across her chest. She was by NO means flat. She was actually quite busty all things considered, and leagues ahead of her mother Cordelia, who was as flat as a board. Severa smiled in the mirror knowing that if absolutely <i>nothing</i> else, she was at least on top of her mother at <i><b>SOMETHING</b></i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steeled herself up and walked towards the exit of her tent. She first poked her head out to see if anyone was there, and she found several night-watch patrols out and about. Figures...nothing's ever a cakewalk is it? Severa quietly exited her tent and began to sneak around the camp to approach Noire's. Thankfully her tent wasn't across the camp, but it was still a decent distance away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far so good.\" Severa said to herself. Suddenly, she heard two talking voices from behind her, and she instantly recognized who they belonged to. They belonged to her good friends Inigo and Owain, who were having a chat while on night-patrol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and then I jump off the cliff, strike a pose when I land, and completely NAIL the presentation before our battle!\" Owain said rather excitingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh. You've been spending time with Cynthia haven't you?\" Inigo said with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! She shares the same love for theatrics and drama as I do! She's the perfect person to talk to about this!\" Owain said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like you've taken a liking to her quite a bit haven't you?\" Inigo said in a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up...\" Owain said, looking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit...they were coming this way! There's no WAY they would miss Severa walking around this time of night if she didn't hide! Without thinking, Severa sneaked into a nearby tent and waited for Owain and Inigo to pass. Eventually, she saw the two pass by the tent and eventually heard their voices fade away. They were gone. She let out a sigh of relief before she heard snoring coming from behind her, and looked back. Her eyes widened at the sight. It was Tiki! She had unknowingly snuck into the Divine Dragon's tent, and she was a perfect candidate for Severa to milk! She had ruled Tiki out earlier, but now that she was sleeping...it was a whole different story. Tiki was known for being quite the heavy sleeper, and others in the Shepherds joked that an earthquake wouldn't even wake her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiki had much bigger breasts than Severa did, and she wondered how the hell she was able to fit those gigantic things into her top, but somehow she did. Her milk would work perfectly, but she also considered leaving the tent and getting Noire's milk as planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" She said to herself as she brought a finger to her chin to think. She could either attempt to milk Tiki here and now, or let the dragon sleep and sneak into Noire's tent as originally planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Severa do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the notion of milking Tiki here and now was tempting...Severa decided that it would probably be better to milk Noire instead. If she for some reason got caught, she'd have an easier time explaining to Noire than the Divine Dragon. Severa turned around to let sleeping Dragons lie, and snuck out of her tent after making sure no-one would see her. She didn't see many patrols, and Owain and Inigo's conversation wasn't audible, so she was in the clear. She quickly made her way to Noire's tent so she wouldn't be nearly spotted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the tent, Severa breathed a sigh of relief. Well, getting here was one thing....the next part was arguably the tougher part. She turned around to see Noire sleeping on her sleeping area soundly, in a much too small nightshirt. Her Archer outfit was neatly folded on top of a small desk for morning, and Severa stared in awe at how utterly GIGANTIC Noire's breasts were. She definetely had the biggest breasts in the army no doubt, and the fact that she attempted to stick those utter mountains into such a small nightshirt made them look even <b><i>bigger</i></b>. Severa's jaw dropped at the sight of them. She was used to seeing her immense tits on a daily basis - they <b><i>were</i></b> friends after all - but seeing them in that poor shirt made Severa even more awestruck and slightly envious than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph...some of us weren't so lucky...\" Severa whispered to herself sadly. She mentally slapped herself as if to remind herself why she was here in the first place, and slowly and quietly walked forward to where Noire was sleeping. Luckily for Severa, Noire was sleeping on her back rather than on her stomach or sides, so her huge breasts towered straight up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\" Severa began to have second thoughts on the whole ordeal, and a soft blush crossed her face as she looked at Noire's sleeping face and immense breasts that heaved with each breath. But after her good old friend <i>jealousy</i> came roaring back into her mind despite not WANTING to feel it, she steeled herself for what she was about to do. She softly moved Noire's nightshirt downwards, and her breasts all but popped out with a cartoonish *BOING*, happy to finally be free from their prison. Severa noted how absolutely massive her bra was as well, and thought to herself that Noire may have had to custom make her bras. She'd never seen ones this big in stores or anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft touch, Severa lifted Noire's bra and shifted it upwards, letting her absolutely GIGANTIC breasts out on display. Severa blushed quite hard at the sight. While, like said previously, she had been used to seeing her immense tits, she had never seen them....<i>bare.</i> Without thinking, Severa took her glove off and placed it on Noire's right breast, causing the sleeping girl to gasp in her sleep. Severa instantly took her hand off and PRAYED that Noire didn't wake up. Luckily for her, she didnt. Severa took off her other glove and opened the bottle quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls...work your magic...\" Severa said to herself. She softly placed the bottle onto Noire's right breast and started softly trying to ease milk out of it. After about a minute of her gentle touch, she got results. Noire's milk began to drip into the bottle! Severa smiled as she saw this. This....was actually working! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She continued to gently knead Noire's admittedly pillow-soft breasts as the milk poured into the bottle. Noire's breathing occasionally got funny, and when it did, Severa stopped moving until she heard her next snore. After about 5 minutes of kneading her breasts, the bottle was full. Severa smirked as she put her gloves back on, tightened the bottle and looked back at Noire. She softly placed her bra back onto her breasts and shifted her nightshirt back into place as well. It had looked like nothing had ever happened, and Noire would be none the wiser. Severa chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheh....next time you see me Noire...\" She started, looking at the bottle and then Noire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be the bigger one anymore~\" She said deviously. She made sure she didn't leave behind either glove or the bottle and quietly shifted out of her tent, leaving Noire to sleep soundly, not noticing a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera almost ran to her father's tent in excitement, but she knew the night patrols would hear her if she did. She was content with speed walking to Henry's tent instead. Luckily, Severa had passed by Henry's tent on the way to Noire's, so it was on the way back anyway; And it didn't seem like she ran into any patrols, so everything was coming together. Once she entered Henry's tent, her excitement took hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, daddy! I got it! I got the breast milk!\" She shouted maybe a <i>little</i> too loud, but no one aside from Henry heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah...? What's that sweetie...?\" Henry said, getting up and rubbing his eyes. Oh. He was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got Noire's breast milk! Now we can bump up my girls just as big as hers! Or bigger...~\" Severa said with a sly smile. She held out the bottle and shook it in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow...that was fast! You actually got the milk from the source huh? I didn't knew you were so...sneaky!\" Henry said with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee...guilty as charged.\" Severa said smugly. \"Now c'mon! Can we do this thing?\" Severa said, putting her hands to her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tome slammed on Henry's desk, and he let out a soft yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm excited you got the milk and everything sweetie, but couldn't this have waited until morning...?\" He said, rubbing his eyes. Severa giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry daddy, guess the thought of finally having even bigger breasts made me wake you up.\" Severa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother is going to kill me, but I don't get to test out these spells that often on things that aren't Risen!\" Henry said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother's just jealous~\" Severa said with a smile. She didn't mean to be bitchy with that comment, but that was the ONLY thing Severa beat Cordelia at, so she treasured it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me...\" Henry said, somewhat seriously. \"But don't worry about that sweetie, I'll handle Cordy so she doesn't get on your case! I'll take the blame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, thanks daddy! You're the best!\" Severa said, giving Henry a big hug. Severa sat on the sleeping area, not being able to sit still in excitement. She couldn't <i>wait</i> to see the look on the boys faces when she's grown! Henry started a small fire under an equally small cauldron, and dumped Noire's breast milk into a small concoction. Henry cackled like a mad scientist, and Severa playfully rolled her eyes. He at least loved what he did in life. Henry chanted a small dark magic spell on the concoction, and it began to glow a dark purple rather than the natural white of the milk. He grabbed a stirring device (also known as a stick) and stirred a few times before grabbing the bottle Severa brought Noire's milk in and pouring the concoction into it. Severa noticed that only half of the cauldron was empty after Henry poured the bottle. Interesting....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Sev, this should do it!\" He said, shaking the bottle. He handed it over to Severa. She took it and immediately downed the whole bottle, which made Henry so shocked he actually opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sweetie?! What the..?\" Henry stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...hey you know it kinda tastes pretty good.\" Severa said, not responding to Henry's shock until she looked over at his shocked expression. \"What?\" She said with a shrug. Henry snapped himself out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err....nothing. Anyway, that potion takes a few hours to take effect, so odds are you'll grow overnight. You may want to get some sleep, since it's not going to happen right away.\" He said, beginning to clean up the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Hmph. And I wanted to <i>watch</i> myself grow!\" Severa said, playfully crossing her arms. Henry chuckled. As he picked up, Severa had an idea. She slowly made her way to the cauldron without Henry looking (he was organizing his ingredients and tomes) and emptied the other half of the cauldron to re-fill the bottle. She sealed the bottle tight and hid it in her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'll go to bed now daddy. Thanks again for helping me!\" Severa said, hugging Henry once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem sweetie! Good night!\" Henry said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night daddy!\" Severa said, leaving the tent. Henry immediately faceplanted back onto his sleeping area. Once Severa was out of the tent, she pulled the potion out of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can never be too sure...\" Severa said to herself, gripping it tightly. She calmly made her way back to her tent and entered it. She placed the bottle semi-hidden on her desk with some of her cute accessories and changed into her sleeping outfit. It was nothing special, just a plain red nightshirt, the same color as her hair, and a comfy bottom that's amazing for sleeping. She looked at herself in the mirror one last time before bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh I can't <i>wait</i>! Morning can't come soon enough.\" Severa said, cupping her breasts under her shirt. She smirked and slid into her sleeping area, getting one good look at her old breast size before falling asleep. The potions effects worked their magic while she slept, and she would see the effects in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Severa discover in the morning?</span></div></div>",

She ran over to the mirror on her desk and her jaw dropped before adopting a smug smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh yeeeeaaaah it did!\" She said happily to herself. Her nightshirt <i>by some miracle</i> survived her growth during the night, and Severa instantly took it off and threw it behind her to get a good look at her breasts. They were....GIGANTIC! Easily twice the size of Noire's, if not <i><b>bigger!</b></i> Severa let out a devious chuckle as her hands came up to touch them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehehehe! Gods look at me! I've never seen boobs this big!\" She smirked as she began to fondle herself. She had to bite her lip to not let out a moan, as it seems they also became a <i>lot</i> more sensitive when they grew. Severa undoubtedly had the biggest breasts in the Shepherds now! Possibly even biggest in Ylisse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaah....~\" There was the moan. \"These f-feel...fantastic...~\" Severa said. She squished them against her mirror, losing herself to her pleasure. However, she quickly regained her composure and cleared her throat feeling embarrassed, even though she was alone in her tent. However a smirk crawled onto her face yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to show these babies to Noire! And to the others around camp~\" Severa said with a giggle. \"Oh the reaction on her face is going to be priceless!\" She laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" Severa began. \"...how do I get out of here...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera walked over to her wardrobe and noted that all of her outfits weren't big enough to contain her mountain sized breasts, and there was no way in HELL any of her bras would fit now...but she didn't care about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...what am I going to wear..? As much as I want to show these off, I'm not going to walk around topless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Or...not yet...)

She suddenly remembered her nightshirt she threw behind her while she was looking in the mirror. It was just laying next to her sleeping area now, inside out. It...seemed to survive her growth initially, so it's gotta be big enough right? Severa walked over to it and picked it up, before putting it on. It...fit! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gawds that actually worked...\" She said, looking at herself in the mirror with her dark red nightshirt on. \"Well, if nothing else fits, this will be fine...\" She sighed. She put on her bottom and looked at herself in the mirror one final time with her gigantic tits taking up all of her attention. Severa couldn't help herself from groping them through her nightshirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmnnnn...~\" Severa moaned. \"Heehee..~\" She giggled. Severa's breasts were absolutely gigantic. Possibly bigger than Noire and Tiki combined! While she was looking in the mirror to see if she was ready to leave her tent, a dark purple gleam in the reflection caught her eye. She gasped and looked behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-The second potion!\" She said out loud. Right! She had swiped the other half of Henry's concoction last night! If she drank it...she could possibly become even bigger!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sumia hummed to herself as she was picking flowers in the castle garden by herself. She had a great life. She was married to the love of her life Chrom, had two beautiful daughters in Lucina and Cynthia, and helped the Shepherds destroy Grima once and for all so the world could live in peace. And peace there was, there hadn't been a war or major conflict since Grima's destruction, and everyone in the Shepherds was relieved that it was finally over. Most of them went on with their daily lives, and kept in touch with her and Chrom. Most of them happily lived in the nearby Capital Town, but some of them like Lon'Qu, Basilio, and Flavia returned to Ragna Ferox soon after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was fine, they had lives to return to back home, she thought. Perhaps she and Chrom could organize a reunion for the Shepherds so they could see all of their old friends again. However for now, she was content picking flowers, and attempted several times to make a flower crown to give to Chrom. It uh...didn't go too well. Several discarded and slightly broken flower crown attempts were strewn about close to her, as she tried desperately to make the perfect one. It was Chrom and Sumia's anniversary today, and Sumia wanted to give Chrom this flower crown as a token of her affection towards him, along with one of her trademark pies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after an hour and a half of trying, Sumia did it. She made a perfect flower crown for Chrom! She held it up triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I did it!\" Sumia exclaimed to herself. \"Now to give this to Chrom! I hope I don't trip...\" Sumia said to herself. She walked slowly out of the garden, clutching the crown close to her, but not strongly enough to break it. She watched the floor like a hawk, looking for any potential tripping hazards, but luckily there were none to be found. She walked up to their bedroom and opened the door slowly. She wanted to surprise him with it as he woke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when she entered, she noticed he wasn't in there. She then heard a voice call out from behind her that made her jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumia!\" The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waah!\" She exclaimed, startled. She jumped involuntarily and let go of the flower crown. After reaching out for it and failing to catch it several times as it bounced out of her hand, she caught it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew...\" She said. Chrom had walked up to her and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry dear I didn't mean to startle you.\" He said, walking up to kiss Sumia. She returned the kiss happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Chrom. Thankfully I didn't drop this.\" She said, holding it out to him. \"I made it for you for our anniversary. It took so many attempts...I hope you like it!\" She said sweetly. Chrom smiled affectionately and bowed his head, allowing Sumia to put it on, which she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee...you look great with it on!\" She said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so? Perhaps I'll wear it all day.\" Chrom said, half joking, but half serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd do that?\" She said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you Sumia, anything.\" He said, before hugging her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That reminds me.\" He said loudly, breaking the hug. He reached behind him and pulled out a small box, offering it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's my anniversary gift. I hope <i><b>you</b></i> like it Sumia.\" He said smiling. She took the box from him and opened it, gasping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a necklace of the most BEAUTIFUL make. It was a beautiful golden necklace studded with jewels and gemstones from all around Ylisse. She even noticed replica dragonstones in the middle to complete the look of it. It was the prettiest thing she'd ever laid eyes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...It's beautiful!\" Sumia said, her jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it. It was...nerve wrecking having this commissioned.\" Chrom said with a pained chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it!\" She said as she put the necklace around her neck. She ran up and hugged Chrom. \"Thank you! I love it....I love <i>you</i> Chrom...\" She said, trailing off. Chrom held her close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Sumia.\" Chrom said affectionately. Suddenly, Robin (Male) appeared at the other end of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrom!\" He called out, catching the two lover's attention. He turned to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Robin?\" He called back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost ready, I need you to give me a final check on this.\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll be right there!\" Chrom responded. Robin nodded and retreated back into the room he came out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Sumia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's a surprise. It's not ready yet, so I can't let you see it.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww..you know I hate those...\" Sumia said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but soon it won't be a surprise anymore.\" Chrom said, patting her head. Sumia giggled. Chrom held her hand in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back later. We'll spend the whole day together, okay?\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be waiting!\" She cheerfully responded. With that, Chrom ran across the hall at a quite fast rate, and opened the door Robin came out of, before slamming it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird...what could it be?\" Sumia pondered. She simply shrugged and walked into their bedroom. She wanted to look at herself in the mirror with this beautiful necklace on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the mirror and looked at herself. The necklace rested on her rather large chest. It rivaled Tharja's in size, and may have been <i>slightly</i> bigger. Nobody could tell from the way her armor was during the war, but she was always relatively busty. And boy was that armor a pain in the ass to put on sometimes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at herself from different angles, admiring the necklace, and noted that it looked amazing on her. Suddenly, she noticed something in the reflection. The necklace was...glowing? She looked down at the necklace and saw that indeed, it WAS glowing. It was glowing an...odd light. It didn't seem to stay one color for long. Red...Green...Purple...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow. \"What's going on? Is it supposed to glow like this?\" She asked. She'd ask Chrom about this later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the glow became more intense, and filled Sumia's vision with a blinding light. She gasped as she suddenly couldn't see a thing! It didn't last long. Maybe five or so seconds, but that was weird! When her vision returned, she let out a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, it's over. What was that....?\" She asked herself. The glow of the necklace completely disappeared, and she was left looking at herself and the beautiful piece of jewelry around her neck once again. Suddenly, Sumia began to feel an odd sensation in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh...what?\" She said out loud, softly grabbing her large breasts. The sensation was short lived, as Sumia quickly began to feel like her old self. She looked in the mirror and noticed nothing in particular was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I'll have to ask Chrom about this later. I'm not sure if it's supposed to do this.\" She said to herself. Unknown to her, the necklace had been cursed during production. And she was about to figure out what that curse did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

After that blinding light, she was a bit hesitant to keep it on, but kept it on anyway because it was an anniversary gift from her beloved. Unknown to Sumia, the curse placed on the necklace was...a bit of an odd one. Sumia's breasts began to <i>veeeeerrry</i> slowly swell, but it was too slow to be detectable. She didn't feel anything either, or at least she didn't at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" She brought her hand to her face to ponder what that light was. She told herself she would ask Chrom later, but she couldn't put the thought out of her mind. A knock at the door brought her back to reality with a small jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaah? One second...!\" Sumia exclaimed, she made sure she was decent, which she was, and walked over to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hello Cordelia!\" Sumia said cheerfully. On the other side of the door led the new leader of the Ylissean Pegasus Knights and Sumia's best friend, Cordelia. Cordelia always had feelings for Chrom, but buried those once Sumia and Chrom had gotten married. She couldn't be happier for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Sumia. May I come in?\" Cordelia asked. Sumia tilted her head a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Is something the matter?\" She asked. Cordelia chuckled and nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. Nothing's wrong. I just wanted to share these cookies I was given today.\"  Cordelia said, shaking the box she had in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Of course! Come in!\" Sumia said, letting her enter. She shut the door once again and Cordelia finally got a good look at Sumia's neck, and more specifically her necklace. The two of them sat on the bed together and Cordelia pointed to her necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...goodness! That's a beautiful necklace Sumia! Where did you get it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Chrom gave it to me for our anniversary!\" Sumia said with a soft blush. Cordelia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh did he? That's so sweet. Heheh.\" Cordelia said. Sumia couldn't read the emotion behind that statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks...divine! May I have a look?\" Cordelia asked. Sumia nodded and took the necklace off. Although the necklace was off of Sumia, the curse had already been bestowed on her, and her breasts continued to swell even with it off, however it still wasn't noticeable to either one of them. Cordelia took it and stared at it in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooow...\" She said, trailing off. Sumia blushed softly at her eyeing the necklace, but giggled softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Sumia liked a good cookie every now and then, even if she preferred pies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Sumia said happily. Cordelia opened the box and inside there was an assortment of different cookies inside. \"Oooooh! I think I'll try...<i>this one!</i>\" She said, picking up what seemed to be an ordinary chocolate chip cookie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I'll try this one!\" Cordelia said, picking up what seemed to be a sugar cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers! Heheheh!\" Sumia chuckled, knocking her cookie into Cordelia's. Cordelia smiled, but said nothing in return. Both took a big bite out of their cookie, and both seemed to like what they tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmnn...~! Not as good as a delicious slice of pie, but it's still quite good!\" Sumia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh. You always did love baking pies. Do you still do that now that you're Queen of Ylisse?\" Cordelia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Occasionally. I don't do it as often anymore, but whenever I'm free and have nothing else to do, I'll hop in the kitchen to bake a pie or two.\" Sumia responded. She finished her cookie and immediately went to grab another one. These were...really, <i>really</i> good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Pegasus Knights talked quite a bit while they continued to eat the box of cookies, and after a while, the box was about half empty. Cordelia shut the box. Sumia began to feel quite odd in her stomach, but she passed it off as her stomach asking for more cookies since she hadn't eaten all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think that's enough. I want to bring home a few for Severa or she'll never let me hear the end of it. Heheh.\" Cordelia said jokingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmnn...~\" Sumia moaned softly, still finishing the last cookie she grabbed. \"You need to show me where you got these, because I'd like to get some for everyone in the castle!\". she exclaimed. Cordelia chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't buy these, they were given to me. If you want I can try to find where they originated from.\" Cordelia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! That'd be great!\" Sumia responded with a giggle. However...she soon clutched her stomach softly. She began to feel really odd after eating the cookies, and unknown to either of them, the curse that was bestowed upon Sumia via Chrom's gifted necklace had a...strange effect on Sumia after eating so many. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh....\" Sumia groaned, clutching her stomach, Cordelia's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sumia...? Are you okay?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine...just a little stomach pain...\" She said, and as she said this, her stomachache began to intensify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnngh...!\" Sumia groaned loudly, Cordelia got closer in worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sumia? I'll ask again, are you okay?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems the effect of both the curse and the cookies was about to happen.

She went down to the nearest tailor to find one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching through the shop, she finally found the perfect outfit... sort of. It was not unlike the outfit Tharja typically wore, with mostly see-through fabric and very little actually concealed. Only rather than black, this one was white with gold highlights. Olivia blushed at the thought of others seeing her in such an outfit, but the shopkeep was very persuasive and convinced her to buy it. She left the shop, unknowing of the power her new outfit had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, after returning to camp, Olivia tried on hernew purchase. It was a perfectly snug fit, going around every curve of her body as if it was meant to be there. Sneaking out of the camp, she went to a secluded part of the woods and began to practice her new routine. She was too enraptured in her dance to notice her chest growing more and more over time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big does she get by the end?</span></div></div>",

Thinking that this was just some sick joke, she poked one to see if they were really hers. A jolt of pleasure ran through her body at that simple touch as she let out a soft moan. They were real alright, and they were why she was so off balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, though, the outfit seemed phased by the new proportions it had to hold. In fact, it seems to have grown to match them. Even one as unskilled at magic as Olivia could put two and two together and figure out that this new outfit had something to do with this.

He dropped the container he was holding, and the water spilled all over the ground. He was staring at Olivia before looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia. What...happened?\" Lon'qu said, just as...Lon'qu as ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I'm sorry!

While Olivia helped him tremendously in getting over his fear of women, it wasn't <i>quite</i> gone, and seeing his loving wife with breasts as big as her head didn't make things easier for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lon'qu, you're the only person I can trust enough to come to with t-these...\" Olivia said, placing a hand on her breast while she looked away, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I need you to help me...\" Olivia said, looking ready to cry out of embarrassment.

Lon'qu broke the hug, and made the mistake of looking at Olivia's breasts again.

Yes, for being one of the most skilled, if not <i>the</i> most skilled pegasus knight in all of Ylisse, she...had self-confidence issues about her body. More specifically, her flat chest. Cordelia hated the fact that she was as flat as a board, and every single one of her comrades (including her DAUGHTER for crying out loud!) had bigger breasts than her! Except for possibly Nowi. They were both flat. Even though she knew she had one of the biggest rear ends in all of Ylisse, (seriously it was HUGE) seeing everyone's chest orbs at places like the hot springs or at the beach made her feel lesser by comparison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Cordelia decided that she had enough. She didn't want to be flat-chested anymore, and wanted to get bigger breasts by any means necessary. Even...asking for Tharja's help. Cordelia was seen walking through the Shepherd's camp on a rather slow, quiet day towards Tharja's tent. She was going to hunt Tharja down and try to see what she could do to bump up her chest size. She didn't even know how much bigger she wanted them, but anything is better than being flat. Outside of Tharja's tent, she took a deep breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Here we go.\" She said to herself, before calling into the tent. \"Tharja? Are you in here?\" She asked. A second or two went by before she heard a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Come in.\" Tharja said. Cordelia entered her tent and noticed she was fiddling with a small cloth that seemed to have locks of white hair on it. Cordelia didn't pay much attention to this, since she knew how Tharja was. Plus, she was on a \"mission\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings you here? Not often I see the perfect pegasus knight walk in here without orders.\" Tharja said dryly. Cordelia felt a little self-conscious about asking for this, but she swallowed her thoughts and came right out with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...have a favor to ask of you Tharja.\" Cordelia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What is it?\" Tharja said, looking over to Cordelia. She turned towards her as she said this, and Cordelia got a good look at the mountains that Tharja hid under that dark mage outfit. She wasn't the absolute biggest in the camp, but she was damn near close.  However, seeing Tharja's large breasts made her even more nervous to ask for what she came her for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...um...\" She stuttered, scratching the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Spit it out.\" Tharja said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how I'm....\" Cordelia nervously began. She tapped her chest twice to signal what she wanted to say. Tharja raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tharja said. She knew what she meant, but she felt like toying with her a bit. She knew how self-conscious she was about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm....you know...\" She said, rubbing her chest this time. Tharja smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not getting you.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm flat chested!\" Cordelia snapped. Tharja chuckled dryly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes I knew what you meant. What about it?\" Tharja said. Cordelia looked at Tharja with an upset look, but swallowed that to ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always been flat-chested, and I feel...self-conscious when I see the other Shepherds and their breasts. They look like mountains in comparison...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like mine?\" Tharja said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes like yours.\" Cordelia said, rolling her eyes. Cordelia knew Tharja was having fun with this, but she bit her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, why do you bring this up?\" Tharja asked. Cordelia swallowed before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...wanted to know if you knew a way to possibly make my breasts...bigger.\" Cordelia said, sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger huh?\" Tharja bluntly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes..I don't want to be flat-chested anymore. Do you think you can help me?\" Cordelia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\" Tharja began. She DID have a spell to increase a woman's breast size, but she didn't know if she wanted to even help her or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Tharja agree to help Cordelia?</span></div></div>",

One that she absolutely couldn't mess up. She quietly snuck around, keeping her eyes and ears out for anyone approaching, as what she was doing was dangerous. For her that is. It was the dead of night and she was trying to sneak into her parent's room while they were out for a mission. Being Tharja's daughter many would say that stalking was in her blood. Though she didn't see it like that, in fact she was often caught by her parents when she tried doing this before. Seeing the coast was clear she darted towards her goal, quietly entering the room and closing the door behind her. The darkly lit room was decorated in black and purple upon her mother's firm insistence. \"Stay focused.\" Morgan said to herself as she lit a candle, taking it with her as she looked for the bookshelf that should be in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it?\" She said as she looked around in a rush. There was no time to dilly-dally. She quickly spotted a bookshelf on the other side of the room and she rushed to it. Looking through her books she quickly spotted a tome. \"This should be it! Father's tome on tactics!\" She said quietly, exclaiming in happiness as she headed out of the room hoping no one caught her. Clutching the tome to her chest, Morgan rushed out of the room to a more comfortable location to where she can examine the tome in peace. Her heart felt like it was pounding a mile a minute from what she did. She would apologize later. It shouldn't be too bad, this was one of the old tactics tomes that father wrote so it should be ok. She quickened her pace to her own little corner of the castle. It was often left alone, being formerly used to house the experiments from the mages in the Shepherds during the time of war, however since it was a time of peace it was left alone. It made an ideal place for her to experiment and/or study in peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching the tome, Morgan made her way down the hall into the large empty room she all but claimed for herself. Sitting down in her usual chair, the large pile of tomes in front of it also made it ideal to hide from others as well. \"Let's see...maybe this can help me beat father!\" She exclaimed happily as she looked through the tome, though she was in for a big surprise as she looked around and found that the tome was far from what she expected. \"T-this isn't the tome I wanted!\" She exclaimed in horror. The tome looked like the ones father used. The large plain maroon cover with gold bindings and the like. \"Oh well,\" Morgan said, a bit dejected as she searched through the tome. It looked to be one of mother's going by the hexes and the like that were written neatly in the pages. This was even better! Mother never let her look at her tomes so this was a major opportunity that she couldn't pass up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should try to cast one of these spells? She said aloud to herself as she looked through the tome. These looked like mother's <i>personal</i> hexes if she wasn't mistaken, which meant that unlike say a normal fire tome, it was filled with more than one type of spell or in this case hex. Looking through the tome, one caught Morgan's eye. It was said to be one that would grant a boon to the caster. That sounded good! As she read more on the chosen hex she looked through it more and more making sure that she would cast it perfectly, lest she fail and have to explain to mother what happened. With those thoughts in mind, she focused as she prepared to cast the magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She felt the energies build up around as a dark purplish aura surrounded her. \"Gotta stay focused.\" Morgan said as she concentrated more. The spell said that utmost focus was needed, so that's what she was doing. Her mother knew what she was talking about after all. Morgan's heart began to beat faster as the dark aura blocked her vision before vanishing, as the gathered energy was seemingly absorbed into her body. A heat began to build up centering itself in her chest as it began to slowly expand her formerly flat chest pushing out into small A cups. Morgan panted as she looked at the book. Whatever that spell was knocked the wind out of her and she leaned back wondering what exactly happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel any more powerful,\" She said, a bit disappointed but knew that when dealing with her mother's hexes, that things were often more than it seemed. Looking a bit disappointed Morgan leaned back in the chair as she began to try and figure out exactly what the spell was meant to do. The more she looked at it, the more Morgan got confused. \"A boon is such a broad subject matter, which is unlike mother<br>\r\n..\" Morgan said as she trailed off, her entire focus was so much on the book that she never noticed her breasts slowly stretching out her shirt. More and more Morgan's chest started to grow. It got larger and larger with each passing second. Already the size of small B cups and her lack of bra made it where her stiff nipples made odd tents in the fabric of her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A boon often means something that's helpful or beneficial,\" she said trailing off as she started to try and piece together what the spell could have meant, absently pulling at her shirt which started to lightly cling to her growing breasts. Morgan sighed as she stretched, placing the tome down to rest her eyes. When she soon noticed an odd weight on her chest. \"W-what!? W-whats going on?\" She asked as she looked down to see her breasts. She was formerly flat, and she now sported breasts that were around a small handful, probably around a large B cup. \"I-I-I-I-I'M GROWING!\" She exclaimed. Her mind raced a mile a minute before she started to piece together what could have caused it. \"T-the hex! It said a boon, and the odd heat that centered after it must have caused this!\" She exclaimed jumping. Her breasts bounced with the sudden jump she made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing still, Morgan watched in odd fascination as her breasts swelled getting larger and larger by the minute, stretching out her shirt by a good amount now. \"They are getting so big! I wonder if they will get as large as mother's? Or perhaps even Noire's!\" She said exclaiming in excitement as she watched them grow with a curiosity that consumed her being. \"Larger! Please grow larger!\" She said as she began to bite her thumb, watching her breasts swell larger and larger and looking more and more like her mother's own large breasts. Her breasts soon began to stretch out her shirt to its limit, her larger nipples making visible tents in the fabric as Morgan pinched herself to make sure she wasn't dreaming. \"They're so big...\" She said, cupping her breasts as if she couldn't believe their size or weight. \"Oof I get why Noire complained about how heavy they could get.\" She said as she looked at her breasts which were just as large as her mother's own impressive chest. \"I gotta show Noire!\" She said as she was about to run off to find her sister, but stopped last minute. \"Though perhaps I should cast that spell one more just to be sure.\" She said, a smile gracing her lips that definetely came from her mother as she gently bit her thumb. \"It would only make sense to experiment more right?\" She said to no one as she looked at the tome laying on the desk. \"Decisions Decisions....\" She said, trying to decide which she should do. </span></div></div>",

Now though, she has no such excuse has she and her siblings had to take charge and do their part to rebuild the two nations, and for Sakura, that meant attending large parties and dinners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer crippling shyness often found her making a fool of herself at such events. If she was ever going to match her siblings, she needed some way to boost her confidence and overcome this. Her siblings had each offered their own ideas, but none did the trick. She needed something... more if she was going to make this goal a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me... miss?\" She hears called out, snapping her out of her thoughts and turning to the source. She spots a lone merchant waving her over. \"Yes you, in the shrine kimono.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes sir?\" She hesitates, face going pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like someone that's going through some emotional trouble. Perhaps one of my charms can help you.\" He waves a hand across his stall, offering the princess a chance to browse. She stopped as one caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a silver necklace, and at the end of it's chain was a metal charm shaped like a peach. \"Th-this one, please.\" She asks, pointing it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good choice, miss. That one is quite special indeed.\" She paid the man and put the charm around her neck. Thanking him, she heads back to the palace, unaware of the tingling feeling going on in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

At least I have a cute new accessory.\" She mumbled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, down the hall, she sees her big brother Corrin walking towards her. \"Oh, Corrin!\" She rushes down the hall and embraces him in a hug.

This is certainly a surprise.\" She looked at him questioningly. \"You've never been one to just run up into a hug, even from your siblings. Looks like you're getting over your shyness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke the truth. She never acted like this, even to Ryoma and Hinoka.

The top half strained at her growing chest, even tearing a little down the middle to expose her now vast cleavage.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Corrin stood in front of his not-so little sister, stunned speechless. Sakura seemed to be frozen in exactly the same way; her eyes were fixated on him in a way that made him think of a dear that had just found itself staring at a hunter's drawn bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sakura? What just...happened?\" The prince motioned with his arms, waving the outstretched limbs at a ghostly pale Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't... What? My body is... Brother? Why am I... so... big?\" Sakura seemed to fumble over her words, her speech so fragile that Corrin was barely able to hear the poor girl's words. Corrin flinched at the look of abject distress in his younger sister's eyes. The young Hoshidan princess was on the verge of tears, her eyes already beginning to grow misty as her mounting confusion and fear made themselves known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig was right. Not just right, a bit of an understatement! Corrin would never admit it to anybody, but he had truly believed that his beloved sister from-another-family, Princess Camilla, had possessed a body unrivaled by any other woman on the continent. But Sakura, his petite, <i>adorable</i> little sister was now sporting curves just as voluptous as the doting Nohrian's. More than that, she'd positively shot up in height! While before he'd been roughly a head taller than her, Corrin could safely (and awkwardly) say that he unfortunately only came up to the center of her breasts now. So much for being the bigger sibling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, her outrageous curves and stunning height seemed more than just similar to Camilla's... Corrin sucked in a harsh gasp of breath- Sakura's body didn't just look similar to Camilla's, it was an exact duplicate! Sakura's now tearstained faced and rather short haircut had been unchanged by her transformation, but everything from the neck down exactly mirrored the overly-buxom Nohrian woman's figure! He'd been squished into that immense bosom more than enough times to recognize it at a mere glance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProblem was, that was something Camilla <i>enjoyed</i> doing. She took advantage of her unusual height, her massive bust, and her ample rear and used them to taunt and tease people as she pleased. This was Sakura, a shy, reserved girl who probably never even had the courage to flirt with anybody!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while Camilla typically had the majority of her wardrobe custom made to fit her body, Sakura's uniform but well-kept Shrine Maiden outfit was clearly made for a girl with a much smaller body. His poor sister was turning on her feet, almost dancing on the spot as she frantically tried to adjust her overstretched outfit to remain decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin knew he had to do something, anything, to calm his panicking sister. The poor girl looked to be on the verge of suffering a stress-induced heart attack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what could he say? This was a physical transformation, often something permanent and extremely difficult for magic users (even skilled ones) to reverse. And the sight before him was admittedly very distracting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura all but ignored her brother, momentarily forgetting his very presence only a few feet from her. Oh Gods, this was awful! She couldn't allow anyone to see her in such a state, she absolutely couldn't! Maybe a powerful, confident woman like Princess Camilla could take advantage of a situation like this, but not her! What would she do if somebody saw her like this? Tugging at her skirt, a distressed whine escaped Sakura's mouth. The garment, once reasonably-sized now barely came down past her inflated buttocks. How humiliating, she was sure that if she took strides too long or bent over even a little she'd flash the whole castle her big, fat butt! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that wasn't even mentioning her chest. She'd been average for her age but unremarkable when compared to the rest of the women who'd fought for Corrin in the recent war. But now? Her once comfortably fitting top was strained to its very limits! The poor garment had even torn down the middle a bit, exposing some of the Nohrian-style brassiere she was wearing beneath. She was sure to be the bustiest woman in all of Hoshido! Maybe that kunoichi serving her brother was near or at her size, but Sakura didn't know her particularly well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling to her knees and sobbing, Sakura buried her face in her hands. She looked like a freak! Her boobs were monstrously huge- she'd go so far to say that they were the same size as her head! And her buttocks were so large and round that they pushed out her skirt a good several inches more than it was used to! And that wasn't even going into explaining the rest of her unnatural body... Sakura had been preoccupied with the gigantic new size of her womanly curves, but the little bit of her mind that was still functioning rationally could tell that she was significantly more muscled. Nothing outrageous, like a bodybuilder or someone similar, but Sakura could feel that she had the strong arms and toned tummy and legs of a woman who was used to fighting with heavy weaponry and participating on the frontlines of long, drawn-out conflicts. Nothing like she'd originally been, a timid shrine maiden who was more suited for supporting at the back of the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day had gone from another casual, happy day to one of the worst in her life! She must have looked so silly to her brother right now; her outfit literally bursting at the seams thanks to her massive curves and underwear barely fitting her body. Continuing to sob into her hands, Sakura wondered if she'd even be able to leave the castle now. It wasn't like she had clothes that fit her now; her panties were stretched tightly over her immense backside, not quite being pulled into an embarrassing wedgie but certainly not comfortably fitting anymore. And her bra! So tight, so restricting! The well-made Nohrian undergarment had proved its mettle, holding up valiantly under the<br>\r\nimmense strain that would've easily burst traditional Hoshidan bindings... But this stretched out bra was certainly the only one that would fit her now! There was no way she'd be able to squeeze into any of the undergarments tucked away in her dresser!</span></div></div>",

Corrin had never actually been inside Sakura's room all that much, and he looked around at the extremely neat living area. He noticed a rack of healing rods on the wall, and a couple stuffed dolls on top of a box in the corner. It was very...Sakura. Well, more than Sakura herself was at the moment. What brought Corrin stumbling back into reality was a loud *CLANK* noise.

He didn't cause Sakura to get like this or anything, all seductive, confident and...well...b-big. Hell, five minutes ago she was the adorable, shy Sakura he always knew. Sakura giggled softly as she strutted slowly to her bed, letting Corrin take in her new body, and sitting down with a seductive smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Corriiiin...\" She said seductively. She beckoned him closer with a finger. Corrin walked forward slowly, his cheeks starting to flush. He was used to this from Camilla, but seeing Sakura of all people act like this...he didn't know what to think at that moment. He reached the edge of the bed where Sakura waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down~\" She said, pointing to her lap.  Corrin hesitantly obeyed, and sat on Sakura's lap. He shivered as he felt Sakura's hands start to massage his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...~ Don't be <i>shy</i> Corrin. Relax...~\" Sakura cooed softly as she continued to massage him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...what shall we do now that we're here <i>alone</i>~?\" Sakura asked with a giggle. Corrin was shaking softly, not able to give an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee...so cute...\" Sakura said, wrapping her arms around him and embracing him from behind.

Corrin began to softly move his hands across Sakura's chest, and she let out a soft moan of pleasure at his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmnnn...\" Sakura cooed.

Sakura laid back on the bed and ran her fingers through his hair softly while she was being fondled by Corrin. She smiled affectionately. With how Corrin's head was positioned, he could hear her heartbeat softly through her chest. Sakura's height had also increased quite drastically when she thought of Camilla, so she was now taller than Corrin, instead of the other way around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrin...\" Sakura moaned.

She was keeping her enlarged breasts covered with her hands, so Orochi didn't notice right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Kagero? I heard yelling and footsteps coming from this direction while doing patrol.\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Orochi, but I have a bit of a...problem.\" Kagero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" The diviner asked, an eyebrow playfully raised. Kagero released her breasts, causing them to bounce quite generously back into place. Kagero did not care that her breasts were completely exposed. Her shirt was ripped anyway. Orochi's eyes had stars in them as her jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooaah! They're huge Kagero!\" She said excitedly, grabbing one of Kagero's enlarged tits. Kagero was able to repress a moan of pleasure, since she didn't have the time, nor was this the place to do such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...know.\" Kagero said. Orochi continued to play with her breasts like a child, causing a slight blush to form on Kagero's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this even happen? You've always had some <b><i>meat</i></b> to them, but never this much!\" Orochi said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was on an espionage mission from Lord Ryoma. I was unfortunate enough to have been seen by Nohrian guards; I was able to kill most of them, but one shot off a blowdart into my chest before my shuriken hit them.\" Kagero explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was expecting some sort of poison, perhaps slight paralysis, but not...this.\" Kagero said, heaving her very large chest. Orochi squished her own admittedly large chest against the much larger ninjas. Kagero was not expecting this in the slightest, causing a small moan of pleasure to escape from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" She said, a frustrated expression on her face. Orochi simply laughed before removing her chest from Kagero's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh calm down will you, I'm just having fun.\" She said slyfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...\" Kagero began. \"I need your help. I cannot serve Lord Ryoma with...these...\" She said, grabbing her tits once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only are they incredibly distracting, but they're much too large and noticeable for stealth missions.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" Orochi said, her eyes glancing at Kagero's enlarged breasts every so often. (They were normally huge anyway...) she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to help me shrink these back down to their normal size. You must have a charm or spell that can do this right?\" Kagero asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Orochi pondered, bringing a finger to her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Come, I'll do it now.\" Orochi said, walking in the opposite direction. Kagero followed closely behind with her arms over her chest. She really didn't want anyone to see her like this. Orochi walked in front with a devious grin. In reality, Orochi did <b><i>not</i></b> want to shrink Kagero's breasts down. She wanted to make them <i><b>bigger.</b></i> Orochi had always loved Kagero's huge chest before this, and bumped into it as often as she could so she could get a feel for them, however brief. While Orochi wasn't exactly flat herself, she was actually slightly larger than average, Kagero's blew everyone else in Hoshido out of the water. Orochi had a fantasy where one day she would play with Kagero's huge breasts, and it led to some...interesting dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that this little...incident has happened, and Kagero's breasts growing so big that they could barely fit in her ninja outfit, she decided to jump on the opportunity and make them even BIGGER. Thankfully this part of Corrin's castle wasn't too populated this time of day, and she and Kagero walked back to Orochi's living quarters rather uneventfully. She had fortune-cards strewn about a small desk in the corner where she told fortunes to the other members of Corrin's army, a half-opened scroll right next to it, and a quaint sleeping area across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we're here. Let me find the charm that can shrink your breasts down.\" Orochi said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Kagero replied. Orochi looked through her collection of scrolls, charms and cards, and after a couple minutes of searching, found the charm she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah here it is! Okay Kagero, just read the text imbued on this charm and your breasts should shrink down to their normal size!\" Orochi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, let me see it.\" Kagero said, taking the charm from her. She quickly read the text on the charm, which didn't seem to have any significance, until the charm glowed a light blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, excellent, it's working. It may take a minute to kick in though. Heheh..\" Orochi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...okay.\" Kagero said, staring down at her chest. Orochi rubbed her hands in anticipation for what was going to happen next, and her eyes glowed like Mitama's. Suddenly, Kagero began to feel...odd. She clutched her chest and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orochi? What's happening?\" Kagero said, gritting her teeth as a weird feeling started accumulating in her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nghh...!\" Kagero groaned. Her breasts began to swell outwards, and Orochi clapped softly as she watched Kagero's already bloated breasts inflate even further. Kagero's ninja outfit ripped open entirely, leaving her in a bra that was getting much too small for her very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orochi...! I thought you said this charm would <i>shrink</i> my breasts down!\" Kagero said, staring at her growing tits. Orochi continued<br>\r\nto stare with a wide grin as her friends breasts strained her bra severely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I must have made a <i>mistake</i> Kagero, you know these things happen! Heheh...\" Orochi said. Kagero instantly saw through her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you trick me into using this charm to make my breasts even bigger?!\" Kagero said, a small amount of panic rising in her normally calm and collected demeanor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps...\" Orochi said deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Kagero those things are beautiful! Why <i>wouldn't</i> I make them even bigger?!\" Orochi exclaimed. Kagero groaned in annoyance as her breasts continued to swell. Orochi was having trouble keeping herself back from pouncing onto Kagero's tits and playing with them like there was no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She was getting extremely turned on by watching her grow, and the only thing she wanted was to play with Kagero's utterly massive breasts. Her breasts were a little bigger than double her original size, and were having trouble staying packed into her shrinking bra. Kagero groaned in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh...\" Kagero groaned. Orochi heard some strain being put on Kagero's bra, and waiting for her sweet, sweet reward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too...big...! Bra too...tight...!\" Kagero groaned as she brought her arms across her chest to try and keep them contained. However, she failed. Massively. Her bra straps snapped off in the most spectacular fashion, and her bra went flying across the room and smacked Orochi in the face. Orochi looked down at Kagero's snapped off bra and bent down to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this thing is gigantic! Even before all of this you had some <i><b>big</b></i> ones huh?\" Orochi said with a chuckle, examining the rather soft bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orochi, this isn't time for your jokes!\" Kagero said with a slightly upset expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh calm down Kagero everything's fi-....\" Orochi said, looking back at Kagero. Her chest was bare now, having ripped through her outfit and snapped off her bra. Orochi stared with a dropped jaw as Kagero's massive bare tits continued to get bigger by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Fi....\" Orochi stuttered, trying to finish her sentence. That's it, she lost her self control. Orochi pounced on Kagero and pinned her to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh?! Orochi what are you doing?!\" Kagero said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..can't hold myself back anymore! I...I need your breasts!\" Orochi said with a desire filled expression on her face. She placed her hands underneath Kagero's breasts and started heaving them and jiggling them lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...! O-Orochi stop this this instant!\" Kagero said with a blush forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do Kagero, I've waited long enough for this!\" Orochi said, continuing to play with her tits. She squished them together, heaved them from below, squeezed them softly, and pretty much everything else she could think of. Kagero noticed just how gentle Orochi was however. Despite having lost her restraint, she's still rather gentle. Orochi pressed her now greatly inferior chest up against Kagero's utterly enormous mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee...my breasts can just disappear in your huge tits Kagero.\" Orochi said deviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\" Kagero stayed silent, her blush deepening slightly. After nearly tripling in size, Kagero's breasts finally stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...it's over.\" Kagero said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..it seems the growth is....\" Orochi began, looking at Kagero. \"...but I'm not.\" She finished, starting to play with her tits again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm....aagh...!\" Kagero moaned. She...had never really done this before. A ninja of Hoshido had more dutiful responsibilities. Sure Orochi would occasionally touch and poke her breasts before any of this happened, but she was protected by her bra, and wasn't utterly mountainous in size. This feeling of pleasure and...arousal was completely new to her. Orochi continued to play with her gigantic tits, her and Kagero blushing deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Corrin (female) is busy training with Leo and Xander, and Camilla's busy tending to her wyverns. There didn't seem to be anybody else in the castle for her to play with. And to make things more problematic for her, now she's getting hungry. She sighs as she makes her way to the door. But just before she even takes 4 steps forward, a knock on her door is heard. \"Oh! Coming!\" she says as she walks a little faster to see who it is. But once she approached the door and opens it, nobody is seen. She looks to the left and right of her, but no sign of anyone. \"Anybody here?\" she asks aloud, hoping to hear a response. \"Hellooooo!\" ...but nobody answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She begins to feel that someone played a prank on her. While annoyed by this thought, the grumbling in her tummy took her mind off of this as she decided to focus on getting some food for now. One step forward however, she finds her foot taping against something on the floor, causing her to pull her foot back. Looking down, she sees a big bowl that seemed to be full of candy each wrapped in colorful paper. The blonde princess gasped in surprise as a smile appeared on her face. \"Oh yummy~! Candy!\" she says in childlike excitement as she picks up the bowl and re-enters her room. Closing the door behind her, she notices a letter laying on top of the candies. She picks it up and sees that it reads, \"Hope you enjoy the gift, little princess. May it bring <b>big</b> bundles of joy your way.\" She giggles upon reading the letter. Though she was curious as to who gave this to her and why. But that's something to worry about later she thought. Right now, it's time to quell her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Elise sits down on her bed as she picks up a single round piece of candy wrapped in a pretty pink paper. As she unwraps it, it reveals to her a delicious looking ball of chocolate. Just the look of it was satisfying to her as she licked her lips before tossing it into her mouth. \"Mmmm~ Delicious!\" she spoke to herself in delight as she chewed the delicious chocolate. Swallowing it down, she reaches her hand into the bowl for another, but just as she pulls out another piece, she suddenly feels a strange sensation overtake her body. \"A-Ahh! W-What is...\" she begins to say as she feels a strong warmth in her chest. She looks down and places her hands on her chest to see what's happening. Only to be shocked by the sight of her formerly flat chest now growing a pair of soft squishy breasts. \"WHOA!! MY CHEST!!!\" she yells in genuine surprise. How could she be growing breasts? It must've been the candy she thought. But how could candy cause this to happen? And how big are they going to make her breasts grow? As if to answer her last mental question, her breasts stopped growing once they reached Corrin's bust size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whoa. I can't believe it! I'm all boingy now!\" she says innocently as she places her hands underneath her breasts and bounces them playfully. She can't explain why, but she seems to be enjoying her new developments. Her eyes still wide in amazement, her jaw dropped mouth changes to an excited smile as she watches her breasts jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>What happens next?</i></u></span></div></div>",

She jumps up out of bed, feeling her breasts bounce uncontrollably as her feet land on the ground. She giggles in response and pats her boingy chest. She never had any reason to wear a bra before, but now that she has breasts, they bounce wildly without anything to support them. But she's too excited to show them to Corrin to even consider the need for a bra. As she exits her room, she heads down the hall looking for her big sis. Hopefully her training with her brothers is done for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She speedily skips down the hallways of the castle, bouncing both her adorable self and her jelly-like boobs. As she skipped towards her destination, she happily greeted some of the passing guards in her usual cheerful demeanor. They give her the typical polite greetings, but can't help but notice the newly formed lumps on her chest. They say nothing of it, but their eyes do drift down to look for a second. Elise doesn't notice this though as she's used to everyone looking down to even see her anyway. As she walks passed them and out the door leading to the roof of one of the many towers, she continues to Corrin and Xander's usual training spot. But before she can make it any further, she sees Corrin making her way back inside. \"Big sis!\" she exclaims happily and waves at her. Corrin smiles as she continues walking closer, waving back at her little sister. \"Hello there Elise. Couldn't help but want to spend time with me, huh?\" she responds in a polite tone. But as she stepped closer and closer to the young blonde princess, she noticed something curious about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once Corrin was close enough, Elise dashes forward and gave her a big warm hug. Her breast squishing tightly against Corrin's body. Corrin giggles sweetly in response as she returns the favor with her own hug. But it was during this moment she realized the extra squish in Elise's chest. \"Umm...Elise? Forgive me for asking something so personal, but...do you feel a little different today?\" she asks curiously. Elise giggles as she lets go and jumps back a bit. Causing a noticeable bounce in her chest to confirm Corrin's suspicion. \"Well I guess you could say I'm not much of a little sister anymore~\" she jokingly says with another giggle as she bounces on her heels to generate more jiggling. The older princess stares in awe at Elise's sudden developments. \"Oh! Wow, you've certainly grown!\" she says in bewilderment. Still staring at her boingy breasts, Corrin became ever more curious. Elise went from flat to having breasts as big as her own in just a single day? This can't be just a natural occurrence. \"Umm...Mind if I ask what caused this?\" Corrin asks with a hint of concern in her voice. Elise stops her bouncing and smiles joyfully. \"Somebody left a big bowl full of candy at my door. I ate one, and suddenly these grew!\" she says as she lifts her boobs upwards towards her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin, now even more curious, takes a brief moment to process what she had been told. Someone they don't know just randomly left her come mysterious candies that cause breast expansion. Who would even think to do such a thing, and why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>What does Corrin decide to do now?</i></u></span></div></div>",

Hopefully Leo works quick so she can get them back. Deciding that there was little to do now with her siblings all busy, Elise decides to leave the castle and walk around town for a while. She didn't even care that her new endowments still bounced free without a bra to speak of as she began to leave the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far from the main gate.

But her curiosity to see these candies herself proved to be far greater. \"So you say you were given candy that did this to you?\" she asks for confirmation. Elise just nods her head cutely. Corrin begins walking back inside the castle with Elise by her side. \"Alright then. If you don't mind, I'd like to take a look at thee things for myself.\" she tells Elise who smiles cutely as she skips beside her older sister. \"No problem big sis! If you want, I can even share some with you~\" she responds joyfully as her breasts continue bouncing with her step. Corrin was unsure how to answer to that. She never would've even considered expanding her own bust. Not to mention it would mean having to get new clothes and armor to fit them in. And yet, seeing Elise supporting a rack equal to hers was starting to make her curious about how it would feel to have them grow. Perhaps maybe just one wouldn't hurt, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As they make their way back to Elise's room, Elise opens the door and bounces inside to grab the bowl. \"Teehee! Here they are, big sis!\" she says as she turns around to present it to Corrin. She looks into the bowl to see the assorted candies in wrappings. She noticed there were pink one and blue ones. \"I see. So which did you eat fist? Pink or blue?\" asked Corrin. Elise picked up a pink one and waved it around slowly. \"One of the pink ones.\" she answered. \"I see.\" Corrin responded. \"So do you think all of them have the same effect, or do you think the wrappings indicate they'd do something different?\" Corrin's curiosity was clearly increasing. Though she was not yet sure if she wanted to try them out herself. Elise on the other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Why don't we eat one and find out?\" Elise says innocently. Corrin started to blush as thoughts of her own body expanding entered her mind. Would it even be her breasts, or something else? But before she could even give Elise an answer, she already unwraps the chocolate wrapped in blue and devours it. \"E-Elise!\" Corrin says loudly in surprise. \"What? We won't know what the blue ones do unless we try them.\" Elise responds. Just after speaking, she feels a warm feeling similar to what she felt in her breasts. But this time, it's coming from somewhere else. Her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A soft moan escapes Elise's lips as she looks back to see for herself what's going on. Though obscured by her dress, she could definitely feel the familiar growing sensation. \"I think my bottom is growing now!\" she says in surprise as she turns around for Corrin to see. And sure enough, she was right. Corrin watches in disbelief as Elise's butt grows before her. Bigger it grows, along with her hips and thighs. Giving Elise a very noticeable hourglass-like figure. \"My goodness! I...I can't believe such a thing is even possible!\" Corrin says in awe. Elise places the bowl back down on the bed so that her hands can reach back to feel her growing posterior. Tightening more and more within her clothing. Just as they were starting to wonder how big her butt would get, it stops at just the right size to where it's evenly proportioned to her breasts. As if Elise's new chest didn't already make her look like a mini Corrin, her new bottom helped complete the look flawlessly. Elise, while still stunned by the occurrence, was actually quite thrilled by this. \"Wow! I look more like you now, big sis~!\" she says as she giggles happily. While Corrin was having trouble finding the words to describe this, in her mind, she knew Elise's words were true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>What happens next?</i></u></span></div></div>",

Don't you find it a little odd that these candies even exist?\" she asks. Elise momentarily stops her actions, placing a finger on her chin as she thinks about Corrin's question. \"Hmm... You know, I was wondering who left them here for me.\" she answers. Still unsure as to who it could even be. But before they could think more on it, a knock is heard at the door. Both girls gasp in surprise upon hearing the knock. And following the sound, a familiar feminine voice is heard. \"Elise, deary. Are you in there?\" the voice says. It was clear that the voice was coming from the oldest sister, Camilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh no! We can't let her see you like this!\" Corrin says anxiously. \"Elise? Can you hear me?\" Camilla asks curiously. The door handle starts to turn. Corrin starts panicking as she tries to find a place to hide the boingy Elise. She opens the closet and pushes away the dresses within it to the side. \"In here! Quickly!\" Corrin instructs Elise. As Elise rushes in though, she forgets about the new weight on her body, causing her to lose her balance and fall over Corrin instead. The both fall to the floor as the door opens. It's too late for Corrin to hide her younger sister now! The lavender haired beauty enters the room, her plentiful bust jiggling with each step she takes. She opens her mouth to speak, but stops before she can utter her first word as she sees Corrin and Elise on the ground. \"Elise? Corrin? What's going on in here?\" she asks as she walks closer to them to offer them a hand. As she comes closer though, she starts to notice something odd about Elise's appearance. \"Oops. S-Sorry big sis.\" Elise says, still a bit winded from the fall. As she reaches out to grab Camilla's hand, Camilla gets a very clear view of the extra padding in her chest. \"E-Elise!? My dear little sister! What happened to you!?\" Camilla asks in shock. Elise just blushes in embarrassment and giggles nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Corrin, still picking herself up, decides there's no point in hiding the truth now that Camilla has seen everything. \"Well, this may sound hard to believe, but somebody left some chocolate that caused Elise to grow.\" she tells the eldest princess. Camilla's eyes widen upon hearing this statement. \"Oh dear! Is this true?\" she asks curiously. Her voice now less shocked, but still enough to be noticeable. Elise jumps towards the bowl on the bed and picks it up to present it. \"Yep! They're all right here!\" she says in her usual cheery tone. Camilla looks down at the bowl full of candy, tapping her finger on her chin as she thinks of what to do about the situation. \"Hmm.

Not only did the youngest princess in Nohr suddenly become as curvy as her middle sister, but the cause of it was some seemingly normal looking candy. And there seemed to be plenty to share. Camilla no doubt believed such a thing to be true, and prove was right in front of her. But now, she became curious to see just how effective it is. \"So exactly how much did you eat to gain such a body?\" Camilla asks as she picks up a single chocolate ball wrapped in blue. \"I just had two.\" Elise answers. Corrin then adds to her answer saying \"Apparently the pink ones cause breast growth, while blue causes rear growth.\" Camilla inspects the candy in her hand further. \"Hmm. You don't say.\" she responds as a small smile forms on her lips. Corrin recognizes that smile. It's the same kind of smile she usually makes when she has a rather...<b>promiscuous</b> scheme in mind. Corrin had a feeling she knew what was going to happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Camilla. You're not seriously going to eat some of these are you?\" Corrin asks nervously. Camilla was already the curviest of the three. Breasts almost as big as her head which she clearly had no shame in displaying for all to see. And an ass that curves in all the right areas, which sway alluringly with every step she takes. \"Hmm. No. I don't see any need for me to undergo such a transformation.\" she answers to Corrin. She already had a body that many would kill to have, and she knew this. Rather, she wanted to use this as an opportunity to give such a blessing to one who was less fortunate. Her eyes shift towards Corrin. While definitely curvaceous enough on her own, Camilla felt that she could definitely stand to have at least a little more curve to her. Elise and Corrin notice Camilla's glance. \"Big sis? Are you thinking what I'm thinking?\" Elise asks with a cute giggle. \"Oh, most definitely~\" Camilla responds with an almost seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Corrin's face switches into a fearful expression. \"S-Sisters...C-Can we not do this?\" she says nervously, trying to settle the two down as she tries to make her way to the door. Before she can make it close however, Camilla cuts in between her and her destination. \"Now now, dear Corrin~\" Camilla says in her usual sultry tone. \"We just want to test it out a little bit.\" she continues as she shuts and locks the door. Just as Corrin attempts to plead with Camilla, she shoves the candy in her hand into Corrin's mouth. The poor bare foot princess instinctively swallows it whole. \"Oh no...\" she says after a mild cough. Meanwhile, Elise unwraps a handful of chocolates, many of which were both wrapped in pink and blue. \"Now all of us will be <b>big</b> sisters!\" she says in excitement as she hands them to Camilla, then holds Corrins arms behind her back to prevent her from resisting. Though Corrin does try to break free, she's unable to resist the combine efforts of her sisters, as more chocolates are consumed by force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>How big will she get?</i></u></span></div></div>",

Little sister, you don't have to be so scared of us, we're simply trying to have some fun and help you out in the process.\" Camilla says while providing a small jiggle of her breasts.

A-Are you okay?\" Elise asks approaching Corrin slowly. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Corrin's gasps turned into muffled moans of pleasure as her breasts began to push against her armor more and more, causing her growing sensitive breasts to react to the tightness. And because Corrin was holding onto the wall, Camilla was easily able to examine the growth Corrin was undergoing in her posterior area. \"Little sister... You're growing into quite the woman in the back... But how are you doing in the front I wonder?\" Camilla walked up behind Corrin and grabbed her torso, bringing Corrin up close to Camilla, relieving Corrin of relying on the wall to stay standing. Camilla brought her hands up to Corrin's chest-plate and tore it off for Corrin, causing her growing mammaries to bounce around free from their prison. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Camilla fondled Corrin's growing assets while Corrin could no longer quietly contain her moans to her sisters.

She gave her ass a shake, having felt the new mass added. She then grabbed her own breasts sending instant pleasure through her entire body. \"T-This is MY body right?\" Corrin said in disbelief. Camilla showed off her own curves while responding excitedly \"Well, you could say it's my body, we both appear to be the same exact size.\" Corrin relaxed herself \"I've always been a little jealous of the gift you had Camilla... Although this could take a lot of getting used to... Everything feels a lot heavier...\" \"You'll get used to it sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho lusts for more growth?</span></div></div>",

This might be bad.  Sure, they had force fed Corrin some candy; but that was only five or six pieces, who knew what 20 would do to her... especially at her age and small size.  \u201cUmm Corrin... I think you might want to get back.\u201d warned Camilla. \u201cWhy should I?\u201d  Corrin snapped back; still a little peeved at her older sister.  \u201cElise might need our hel-\u201c She started; but froze when she saw the pile of wrappers Camilla was pointing at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cE-Elise!

I guess I w-was a bit jealo- Aahh!!\u201d  Elise barely managed to get out between moans as she started squirming and groping her boobs.  Pleasure and warmth quickly building in her chest area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Suddenly, as if a dam burst, all the pent up energy started flowing in waves directly into Elise\u2019s breasts.  She let out a pleasured gasp as her knees buckled from the sensations; her breasts started to fill like water balloons, and her small nipples doubled in size\u2014 hard as diamonds and prominently visible through her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Within seconds, the fabric of Elise\u2019s shirt was stretched taught and started growing more and more transparent as the candies did their best to pack every ounce of boob flesh possible into her straining top.  She was having a hard time breathing between her oversized breasts compressing her lungs and the continual jolts of pleasure coming from her sensitive breasts as she clawed at them, trying to release them from their prison.  If she had more coherent, she would have heard threads popping as tears started to form in the front of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a low guttural moan and the sound of ripping fabric, Elise\u2019s breasts spilled out of her top into her waiting hands.  Having never even needed a bra before, her breasts were now the size of Camilla\u2019s and far too big for her to handle.  They also were showing no signs of slowing down \u2014 if anything, they were growing faster now that they were freed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It didn\u2019t take long for their weight to overwhelm her slim arms; and she only had to lean forward slightly to rest them on her thighs.

Unable to contain them anymore because of their sheer weight and the coursing pleasure weakening her arms, Elise let her sensitive mounds roll forward off her knees; pulling the rest of her with them until she was half kneeling and half laying atop her breasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Elise\u2019s face was one of pure euphoria as her breasts continued to pulse out from her body.  Eyes wide and rolled slightly skywards, she moaned and squirmed about, groping as much of he breasts as she could reach while they gradually lifted her into a more upright position.  \u201cMmmmmm, yesss, b-bigger,  *gasp* mo-more!!\u201d  She gasped, becoming lost in the sensations.  Corrin was slightly taken aback by this\u2014 she\u2019d maybe expect a reaction like that from Camilla; but her sweet, innocent little sister...  that must be the pleasure talking.  She knew firsthand the growth caused great pleasure, but she couldn\u2019t even imagine what Elise must be feeling... she mused as Elise continued to beg for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 At three and a half feet, Elise\u2019s breasts had grown large enough that she could stand up.  Or at least she could have if her knees weren\u2019t buckling every few seconds in pleasure.  Her groping and moaning were growing more erratic as her breasts swelled in size and continued to lift her upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a sharp gasp, Elise threw her head back and her back arched as an overwhelming wave of pleasure hit her.  She couldn\u2019t hold on any longer; her eyes widened in shock and she squealed in orgasmic bliss as her hands shot to her crotch.  Her breasts pulsed nearly half a foot larger in a matter of seconds as her first orgasm washed over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Coming down from her high some 20 seconds later; Elise felt her pleasure beginning to wane along with her growth.  Finally coming to a halt at nearly five feet, her breasts were still several times as sensitive as they were before her growth, but she could at least somewhat maintain her composure... probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u201cI think *pant* it finally *nngh* sto-stopped.\u201d She managed, draped atop her two fleshy mountains; completely spent and breathing heavily.  Small spasms still occasionally shook her petite body because of here breasts\u2019 increased sensitivity and the slight breeze from the open window caressing her now now four inch long nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

From the first squeeze of her bloated nipples, her body was repeatedly bombarded with unrelenting waves of orgasmic pleasure.  She was a squirming, moaning mess until she passed out from exhaustion an hour and a half later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Surprisingly however, with each gallon Corrin and Camilla managed to milk out of their sister, Elise\u2019s breasts shrank.  When her breasts finally ran out of milk they were each the size of quite large grapefruits; and though her nipples had shrunk considerably, they still sat at a quite large two inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Being unable to do anything else for her, they decided it\u2019d be better if she slept in her bed rather than a puddle of her own milk.  Corrin kneeled to offer her back to Elise, while Camilla (with some effort) pulled her upright and draped her limp arms over Corrin\u2019s shoulders.  Elise\u2019s large breasts squished slightly as Camilla propped her against Corrin\u2019s back.  Even through the leather armor on her back, Corrin could feel Elise\u2019s nipples start to stiffen; eliciting a soft whimper from her sleeping sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Corrin was no stranger to giving her sister piggyback rides; in fact it was quite a common occurrence when they were playing together.  Today however, she briefly struggled to stand upright; probably due to the additional pounds of boob flesh Elise was now sporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she staggered towards the bed (Camilla was just watching with a mischievous grin on her face), Elise\u2019s breasts were being jostled around against her back.  With her little sister\u2019s head resting on her shoulder, Corrin could clearly hear her breathing becoming more labored.  \u201cJeez, her breasts must be REALLY sensitive....\u201d Corrin thought, as she reached Elise\u2019s bed and lay her down on it.  Luckily the bed had just managed to avoid Elise\u2019s milky escapade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHey Camilla,\u201d Corrin inquired.  \u201cDo you mind actually being helpful, and bring me that blanket over there?   Elise is going to catch a cold if she sleep in these wet clothes.\u201d  Turning back to Elise, Corrin got to work removing her milk soaked clothes.  She had a little trouble with the shirt on account of the two plump breasts sticking through the front; but after quickly transforming her hand into a claw, she was able to remove the last of Elise\u2019s clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Corrin\u2019s eyes lingered for a moment on Elise\u2019s breasts before she covered her with the blanket.  They were absolutely massive for her tiny frame, almost comically so, as thy stood proudly on her chest; slightly rising and falling with her breathing.  Corrin thought they were a bit large... but as long as Elise was happy with them, she was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As Corrin was tucking Elise in, her eyelids slowly fluttered halfway open.  \u201cTh-thank you big sis.\u201d She said weakly\u2014 too exhausted even to fully open her eyes.  \u201cNo problem, Elise.\u201d  Corrin responded kindly; gently squeezing her hand.  \u201cHave a good night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 After Elise drifted back to sleep; Corrin reluctantly left the room with Camilla\u2014 glancing over her shoulder as she left.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll be fine.\u201d  Consoled Camilla.  \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right.\u201d  Sighed Corrin.\u201d  I just worry she\u2019s too young to handle all this...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Elise handle all this?</span></div></div>",

Eyelids slowly fluttering open; she yawned, reaching to scratch an itch on her stomach, stopping when her arm met the sizable mounds on her chest.  Still a bit groggy, she briefly panicked before she recalled the previous night\u2019s events.  The specifics were all a bit hazy, but she did recall her breasts growing quite rapidly... and the overwhelming pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Struggling a bit to sit up; Elise threw her feet over the edge of her bed.  Sitting there; she could really feel the weight of her breasts putting extra strain on her back and trying to pull her forward.  She didn\u2019t have any bras, let alone one big enough for her newly grown breasts, so she cupped them in her small hands to offer some support.  \u201cMmmmmm...\u201d she moaned, a little shocked by their sensitivity, as they settled into her open palms.  \u201cThese feel sooo good.\u201d  She thought to herself.  \u201cI\u2019m still not as big as big sis Camilla though.  Wait... shouldn\u2019t I be bigger?  I ate enough candies right?\u201d  What happened after she started growing was still really hazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was subconsciously stroking her grapefruit sized mounds when a knock on her door snapped her from her reverie.

I\u2019m not dressed.\u201d  Sputtered Elise; quickly turning and throwing her blanket around her shoulders.  \u201cHah... Unh...\u201d She winced as the blanket roughly hit her nipples, causing them to instantly stiffen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be so shy, Elise...\u201d said Corrin; walking through the door and closing it behind her.  \u201c...it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve never seen each other naked before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cOhh... I see.\u201d  She sighed; noticing Elise blushing, and her stiff nipples clearly tenting the blanket she was wrapped in.  \u201cYou\u2019re at that age where you\u2019re still uncomfortable with your sexuality, right?  And then last night happened so quickly...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Elise just sat there silently, averting her gaze; her blush only deepening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes then.\u201d  Corrin said.  She set the clothes she was carrying at the foot of the bed, and sat down next to her little sister; her newly enlarged hips and thighs gently pressing against Elise\u2019s similarly enhanced thighs.  Putting her arm around Elise\u2019s shoulder, she attempted to comfort her embarrassed sister.  \u201cYou know I\u2019m here for you right?  ... Camilla too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a moment of silence Elise timidly asked, \u201cI always wanted big breasts like big sis Camilla, but I didn\u2019t know they felt this good.  Why does it feel so good every time I touch them like this?  Saying that, she let the blanket slip off her shoulders and gently tweaked her nipples in demonstration.  This elicited a small gasp from her; and Corrin noticed her squirm a little and briefly press her thighs together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cE-Elise; I know it feels good, but you really should control yourself...  that\u2019s not very princess-like; it\u2019s not appropriate to do in front of other people.\u201d  Corrin said nervously; slightly concerned with what was the candies had done to her little sister\u2019s body.  It seemed they had left Elise\u2019s breasts significantly more sensitive than her own recently enlarged pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThen what about you last night?  What exactly happened then?  It\u2019s all really hazy, but I thought I was bigger than this...\u201d.  Elise inquired; still blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cT-that was...\u201d stammered Corrin.  \u201c...Fine; but I\u2019ll only explain this once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Corrin briefly explained to Elise as best she could about these new feelings she was experiencing... and about how huge she grew last night, how her breasts filled with milk, and how she and Camilla had to milk her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cWell then,\u201d Corrin stated after several moments of silence.  \u201cI came here to tell you breakfast is ready.  As Crown Price, Xander is off on official business with our father; so only Leo, Camilla, and I will be there if you\u2019re feeling up to it.  I brought you a couple of Camilla\u2019s old bras and more *ahem* conservative tops if you decide to come.\u201d  Said Corrin, pointing at the clothes she put on the bed earlier.  \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about Leo; I\u2019m having Camilla make sure he doesn\u2019t ask any questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cFine, I\u2019ll go.\u201d Decided Elise after some deliberation.  \u201cI\u2019ll need some help with the bra though...

It was still a bit loose, having a bit of extra room in the cups, but it was the best fit they could find.  Luckily they had enough padding that they were able to reasonably hide Elise\u2019s large nipples.  Even when stiff, which they still were thanks to the attention her breasts were getting, a slight bump was all that could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Standing behind her while Elise put on a black and pink blouse she had picked out from the pile; Corrin couldn\u2019t help but notice that her breasts were large enough they could even be seen from behind.

Now with all the candies in Camilla's hand consumed, they finally let go of her. Corrin panting heavily as she's finally able to breath again, looking at Camilla with anger in her eyes. \"Camilla! Do you have any idea wha-Aahh!!\" she speaks until interrupted by the strong heat flowing over her body. Mostly in her boobs and ass. Camilla smiles as she notices the chocolates taking effect. While Corrin's breasts aren't noticeable underneath her chest armor, she does lift up Corrin's cape to take a look at her butt expanding outward. \"My my! You're filling out quite nicely, sister~\" Camilla says in an alluring tone. Elise simply stares, wondering just how big she's going to get. \"Hang on. Shouldn't we remove her chest plate? She'll get too tight in it.\" Elise says as she attempts to remove it for her. \"E-Elise!\" Corrin tries to object. But as she feels the increasing tightness take place within her armor, she realizes Elise is right. \"Oh! I-I'm sorry big sis.\" Elise says timidly. But Corrin sighs, and removes the armor herself. Revealing her inflating orbs tightly packed in her undershirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whoa!\" Elise responds in amazement. \"You're already as big as big sis Camilla!\" She pokes Corrin's growing boobs, eliciting a soft moan from her sisters lips. Her face turning red with embarrassment. And yet, there was a part of her that was enjoying this strange feeling. It was then that Camilla presses herself against Corrin's back, her breasts squishing against Corrin. Her hands reach around to grope the expanding orbs. \"Mmm, she's not kidding! They're getting so big! And they're so soft too~\" Camilla says as a blush forms on her face as well. Corrin feels Camilla's hands expertly caressing and kneading her breasts like dough. Still gaining mass as they remain tightly packed within her clothing. She tries to suppress her moans, but the feeling of her breasts being fondled in such a way becomes too much to resist. She lets out an audible moan as her eyes close shut, taking in the blissful sensations. \"Oh my~ Someone's enjoying this.\" Camilla says more seductively than normally. Elise watching, starting to feel a little second-hand embarrassment from watching her two older sisters playing with each other in such a lewd manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While everyone is so focused on Corrin's inflating tits however, her ass continues it's growth as it presses against Camilla's hips. \"Oh!\" Camilla reacts as she lets go of the inflating princess. She then giggles upon seeing just how big she's become on both ends. \"Guess you're the big sis now, Corrin.\" she jokingly says. After about another minute of expanding, Corrin's body seems to come to a stop. Panting heavily from the overwhelming pleasure, she takes this moment to calm herself down, and truly see just how much she's grown. \"Woooow! Corrin, you look amazing!\" Elise says in excitement. Curious, Corrin turns around to find a mirror to examine herself in. What she sees causes her to blush again. Camilla wasn't kidding. She truly IS the big sis now! Her breasts have become twice as big as Camilla's with an ass that's equally as big. Her hips and thighs now thicker to accommodate her increased bottom size, giving her an incredible hourglass figure. \"I...I can't believe this...\" Corrin says in disbelief. \"I'm huge!\" One of her hands reach up to softly press her breast while the other goes down to rub her hip. Cooing softly upon feeling her new sexy body. \"Looks like we'll have to find new clothes and armor that'll fit you, dear Corrin.\" Camilla says with a chuckle. Elise giggles with her as she approaches next to Corrin. \"I think you look great like this!\" Elise says with a cheerful wink. The two sisters seem to approve of Corrin's new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>But what does Corrin feel about this?</i></u></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While the two sisters seemed to enjoy Corrin's new look, Corrin herself did not quite approve of it. Though she was admittedly curious to try one herself, this was far too much for her liking. She looks at Camilla with a disapproving face. \"Camilla! What were you thinking!?\" she asks in a stern tone. Clearly expressing her dislike for these results. \"Oh dear. Do you not approve of your beautiful new body?\" Camilla asks in a concerned yet mildly confused tone. \"Many women dream of having a body such as this.\" she continues as she lifts up her own breasts for emphasis. \"Yeah! I know I did.\" Elise adds in. Their responses do not help in calming Corrin down. In fact, it just agitates her a bit more. But what was she to do? She would never intend to harm her own family, regardless if they were related by blood or not. But if they enjoy such curvaceous figures, then perhaps she could give them a taste of their own medicine. Or rather, a taste of their own candy in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Corrin puts on a fake smile as she notices a few more unwrapped chocolates in both Elise's and Camilla's hands. \"Well, I suppose unless there's some way to reverse this, I might as well learn to adjust to this new body.\" she says as she gets a little closer to them. Camilla smiles upon hearing her reply. \"Oh wonderful! I knew you would enjoy it~\" Camilla says happily. Elise giggles as she hugs Corrin. \"Yeah! We're all gonna be big sisters together!\" she says in her famous cheery tone. During the hug, Corrin manages to snatch Elise's chocolates from her hand. \"Huh?\" Elise releases Corrin from the hug, giving Corrin a chance place some of the chocolates in the little princesses mouth. But not just outright shoving them in as she doesn't want to be harmful despite her intentions. \"Hmmph!?\" Elise tries to speak, but the mouth full of chocolates muffles her words. And without even thinking, she swallows the chocolates whole. Almost choking for a second until managing to take it all in, panting mildly in response. Camilla looks at Corrin with a shocked and somewhat stern face. \"C-Corrin!? What are you doi-\" Before Camilla can even finish, Corrin repeats the action to Camilla, being slightly more forceful knowing she'd be more likely to resist. Once the chocolates enter her mouth though, Camilla surprisingly doesn't show any resistance. In fact, it almost seems as if she's caught onto Corrin's intentions and is accepting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before the two girls can utter a word to the middle princess, they both begin to grow. Elise's already tight dress tightens further and further. Before it was just a mild discomfort, but now it's becoming outright painful. Doesn't help that her breasts are becoming a bit more sensitive as they grew. Her lower body meanwhile curves outwards both in terms of butt and hips. Her thighs also becoming thicker and thicker to accommodate the new weight. More and more she starts to look like a miniature blonde Camilla. Speaking of Camilla, her already revealing outfit starts to reveal more as her body blooms into an even more hourglass-like figure. Her hands rub over her developing curves, as a soft moan escapes her lips. Was she...enjoying this? This can't be right. How can this be considered revenge if the person Corrin's taking revenge on is enjoying this? In fact, it seemed like Elise didn't mind it either. She watches her little sister bouncing her breasts gleefully as she giggles cutely. \"Hehehe. Looks like we're going from big sisters to <b>bigger</b> sisters!\" Elise says before resuming her playful giggling and bouncing. Suddenly, Elise's boobs tear a hole in her dress, causing her to yelp in shock. As if to prevent her dress from getting completely destroyed, her growth halts. Leaving her with a very eye-catching body, especially for someone as little as her. Camilla meanwhile completely tears through her bra, revealing her engorged breasts in full view. Despite her mild blush, she doesn't seem to have any major issue with her breasts being exposed. Shrugging it off with a playful yet seductive giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My my~ Thanks for the gifts Corrin~\" Camilla says teasingly as she wiggles her breasts left and right. Corrin just stands there dumbfounded by their enjoyment over this. This wasn't the reaction she was expecting to see from the two. \"Y-You're welcome...I guess...\" she says sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>What happens next?</i></u></span></div></div>",

What was she going to do with these two? Her attempt to make her two sisters see the errors of their ways via revenge scheme failed to work. Perhaps it's best to just let this be water under the bridge she though. \"Well, if you two are done, perhaps now we'd best find whoever caused this mess.\" Corrin said with a somewhat serious tone. \"Hmm. I suppose you're right. We've had enough fun for now anyway.\" Camilla responds. Elise looks over to the bowl of chocolates. \"Umm, can I have just one more please?\" she asks with a sweet look on her face, practically making puppy dog eyes. Corrin sighs. \"Sorry Elise. But I think it's best we cut you off on these for now.\" she says. Elise simply sighs with disappointment, but quickly accepts it once she realizes just how big she's gotten already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Camilla begins opening the door for them to exit, but just as she pushes it, a thud can be heard from the other side. The door hit somebody as she opened it. \"Oof!\" the mystery person responds, followed by another sound of them falling on the floor. \"Oh dear! I'm so sorry!\" Camilla responds with concern. \"Uh-oh. Who was it?\" Elise asks. Corrin tried to look over Camilla's shoulder to see who it could be. But all the girls can see is a cloaked figure. \"Huh? Who are you?\" Corrin asks. But rather than answering, the clocked figure rushes off down the hall. \"Wha..? HEY!!\" Corrin and Camilla both shout. \"Seems like we've got a spy in our castle. They must be punished!\" Camilla says with a rather threatening tone as she begins to sprint down the hall. But she doesn't make it far as her bust  weighs her down too much to make the mad dash she wanted to. Corrin and Elise both follow behind, but Corrin seems to run better due to having the least amount of boob weight to get in the way. Though it was still enough to be a bit of a bother. \"HALT!!\" Corrin shouts loudly. Her and Elise are both hot on the supposed spy's trail. Corrin looks back to Elise who is close behind, but is struggling to keep up. \"Elise! Do you have a spell that can stop them!?\" she asks. \"Yeah! I got one!\" Elise responds before thrusting her hands out, firing a beam of light that wraps around the clocked figure. Stopping them in their tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mysterious person falls over, struggling to break free. The three princesses manage to catch up. Camilla taking slightly longer, panting heavily as she finally catches up. \"Whew. Who would've thought these things would make running this much harder.\" Elise says as she wipes a sweat from her forehead. Camilla walks between the two and confronts the clocked person. \"Now then. Who are you, and what were you spying on us for?\" Camilla asks in a serious tone. The cloaked figure pauses before answering. Whether or not it was because they were intimidated by Camilla was up for debate. \"I...I just wanted to see...how well those chocolates worked.\" they answer. The three princesses look in surprise. They manage to find the sender this easily. \"So you were the one who sent me those?\" Elise asks as she jumps beside Camilla, her boobs bouncing wildly. \"Just who are you anyway?\" she continues as she reaches her hand out and pull the mystery sender's hood off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Who was the mysterious sender?</i></u></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On an off-day in Princess Corrin's castle, the young wolfskin Velouria was sitting underneath a tree alone on top of a small hill she frequently spent time on, reading a small book about the wonders and tales of treasure-hunting in Nohr. Velouria was wearing her signature red-hood and white button-up shirt, and hummed to herself softly as she took a small bite of meat from a basket she had brought with her. No one really came up to this hill, so she knew she had it all to herself. She liked spending time alone after all. Page after page turned in the book, and Velouria soon finished not only her novel, but the meal she had prepared for herself earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>*sigh*</i> Well, that's that...\" She said to herself. Velouria looked onwards to Corrin's castle not too far from her, and sighed once more. She was alone with her thoughts. The sun was beginning to set, and Velouria knew that eventually she'd have to get up and walk back to the castle before Daddy got mad with her. She opted to spend a few more minutes resting up against the tree...before something interesting caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>*sniff* *sniff*</i> Hmm...? What's that smell?\" Velouria said to herself, getting up. She attempted to sniff once more. A....rather sweet aroma was coming from the direction of Corrin's castle, and due to being a wolfskin, Velouria's nose was well adept to picking up scents. She rather liked the aroma, and continued to ponder what it could be, because it was oddly...unfamiliar. That's strange, she had already sniffed and memorized the aromas of every single member of Corrin's army. Charlotte liked to try and use perfume from one of the shops in the castle to attract a mate, Peri smelled like murder, (no literally, like, she smelled like the insides of the people she stabbed), Elise smelled like flowers, and Niles....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe don't need to talk about that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterested on what this new foreign smell could be, Velouria perked up, gathered her things and began to walk back to the castle. After a brief stop at her room to drop off the basket and book, Velouria wandered the halls of the castle, sniffing at the air to try and locate the source of the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>*sniff* *sniff*</i> Ugh...where could it be? I could've sworn it was in this direction...\" She said to herself. The location of the aroma seemed to be changing. Was whatever that was making it moving? Velouria began to feel odd the more she sniffed the aroma, but shrugged it off as possible indigestion from the meal she had earlier. The smell and food probably didn't mix. However, her nose twitched and her ears perked up as she let out a loud...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>*ACHOOO!*</b></i>\" Velouria sneezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehe. Bless you Velouria.\" A voice was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Velouria said, looking back to see Princess Corrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Corrin. It's you.\" Velouria said in her normal tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it's me. Hello Velouria!\" Corrin responded, cheerfully as ever. \"I've gotten word from Camilla and Odin that you've been frantically wandering around the castle. Is something wrong? Did you lose something?\" Corrin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I've been trying to locate the source of this odd scent I picked up.\" Velouria responded, crossing her arms in typical Velouria fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? An odd scent? <i>*sniff*</i>\" Corrin tried to sniff the scent, but couldn't pick it up. Admittedly, seeing Corrin try to smell the aroma despite not having a keen sense of smell brought a small smile to Velouria's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't smell a thing. You're more likely to pick up on that kind of stuff anyway. Heehe!\" Corrin said with a giggle. The odd feeling that Velouria was experiencing began to intensify, and soon enough Velouria began showing signs of \"distress\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Is...everything alright Velouria?\" Corrin asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...everything's fine, just feel a little...light-headed. I'll be fine.\" Velouria said, unsure of her own words. \"If you excuse me, I'm going to continue my search now.\" She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright. I wish you luck in finding that scent!\" Corrin said cheerfully, but still concerned. She walked away and Velouria was left alone in the hallway. She picked up a rather intense burst of smell of the aroma in the opposite direction, and decided to jump on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! Now I've got you!\" Velouria said, running off in the direction of the scent once more. When she arrived to where the scent had been strongest, she looked around and....nothing? All of that for nothing?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...this is so frustrating...\" Velouria said to herself. Deciding to stop trying for now to rest her feet from running all over the castle, she returned to her room and laid on her bed. That odd feeling never went away. In fact...it seemed to linger, and it was starting to affect Velouria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....nghhh....\" Velouria groaned, rubbing her body. \"What the heck is this feeling...?\" She said to herself. Suddenly, she smelled the scent of the aroma once more from her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>*sniff*</i> Oh not again...\" Velouria said. The feeling within her seemed to intensify. \"Nnnnnghh...\" She groaned. Unknown to her, the overwhelming aroma was about to have some...<i><b>big</b></i> effects on her. She felt the strange feeling begin to accumulate in her chest...and what would happen next would make her jaw drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Not knowing what else to do, Velouria placed her hands on her chest...only to feel it pushing back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?!\" She said in a slight panic. She looked down and saw her average sized breasts start to swell outward. She adjusted herself on her bed in order to sit upright and watched as her breasts continued to swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's happening to me?! Why are my....?!\" She said as she got up to look at herself in the mirror she had on her desk. While the desk itself was littered with dust bunnies, owl feathers and other random treasures she's found around Corrin's castle, the mirror was spotless. She turned to the side and watched as her breasts continued outwards. A very immense blush found itself onto Velouria's face as she covered said face with her hands. She didn't know what to do, or what caused it, and it was overwhelming her. However, before she could even form a single thought, a quite...unfortunate sensation caused her to look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah...! O-Oh no...\" Velouria said, beginning to legitimately panic. Her breasts were running out of room in her button-up top, and she could feel them still growing. They were beginning to strain her top, and it was only a matter of time before the buttons <i>*POPPED*</i> off. Velouria tried to calm down by taking a deep breath. And during said breath, she sniffed the smell of the strange aroma once more. Velouria's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This smell...! This must be whats making my br-...nnngh...so tight...\" Velouria groaned in dismay. Some of her breasts were visible between the strained buttons of her top, and she prayed that her breasts would stop growing before it popped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Her memory was rather foggy from the night before, lights and voices were distant memories yet familiar to the drowsy queen as she managed to sit up. Drifting her eyes down she noticed she was in a white dress that modestly covered her breasts with silk draping over the dress similar to her cousins own outfit. Shrugging she slowly got up on her feet and gracefully walked to the door as she rubbed her from the hazy night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to find comfort in this dress she came to a halt and brought her pale arms to her side as she looked back down. \"Maybe... I should change...\" She thought aloud to herself in the silence of her tree top abode before heading over to her dresser. Allowing her fingers to grasp the handles, she pulled the dark oak drawer outwards and began to search. Through repetitive fields of grey and white cloth, Corrin managed to find her silver and blue armor amongst the sea of inky blacks and cloudy whites. Smiling softly, she curled her fingers around the neatly folded clothes and hoisted them up to her chest where she bounded back to her bedside. Wasting no time, the princess began stripping herself of the odd attire, she quickly managed to apply her armor, wasting no time in prettying herself up for the day ahead as she then twirled around in the comfort of her own home. \"Now onto business. I need to buy a new dragon stone, resupply Mozu with better equipment, and perhaps I shall visit Lazlow or Subaraki for tea...\" She hesitated at the end, biting her lip slightly and scoffing to herself. Puffing up her chest she marched to the door and casted it open to allow the light in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquinting initially, Corrin came to smile at the outdoor setting before running down the smooth stairs. Gazing from left to right, her eyes picked up on the marvelous town setting she had established as her army populated the town with various streaks of color to compliment her colorful idea for the future. She gasped at the very end, forgetting how quick her stairs ended as she plummeted to the ground and stirring a cloud of dust into the air as she grumbled softly. \"Lady Corrin, are... you okay...?\"  Avoice hesistated nearby as the red eyed princess sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I'm fine, just wasn't paying attention...\" Corrin stalled for a name as she then looked up and finished, \"Anna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red haired merchant smiled and offered a hand before giving a sly smile, \"I can offer your a hand milady, but....\" Her voice trailed before returning with an upbeat tone, \"It will require a little bit of gold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Corrin got up on her and began to dust herself off before looking up at Anna, \"Maybe one day Anna, but by chance would you happen to be selling anything?\" She inquired as she resumed her stoic and noble pose, acting as if she had never fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost like magc the merchant nodded and held up a small sack to Corrin's face, disregarding personal space as she started, \"Well, fortunately I have this one of a kind stone you would be in the market for! Supposedly this stone has been refined far more than its counterparts and can even improve the user's human form. Now, whatcha say to that? I am willing to offer it for a mere fee of 3,000 gold!\" Intially unimpressed, Corrin frowned; negotiating with herself mentally about the potential purchase as she crossed her arms and tapped her fingers. Narrowing her eyes on the small sack in ther merchant's hands and sighed, \"Fine, I will take the stone. I expect a refund if it's a fake!\" She stated as she fished through her bag and grasped out the coin required for such a purchase. Clasping the cold coins in moments, Corrin quickly traded the gold for the bag and immediately began her walk in the opposiye direction, disregarding Anna entirely. Now a few paces away, she quickly began to open the tied bag to uncover a light pink stone, reminiscent of Kaden's Beaststone minus the shape. Instead it was identical to the dragonstones she had used before, aside from the slight warmth it made in her delicate hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the warmth, Corrin pocketed the orb in her pouch and resumed with her day. Dodging in and out of stores she went about her day happily, feeling a faint tingle in her chest but she was in a rush. As this continued the weary and fatigue began to grow on her as she began to stumble a bit from her running pace. Gasping softly and wiping sweat from her brow, she glanced around for a place to rest as she grew frantic. Stopping instinctively at an open hallway, the princess rushed in and followed the signs to a locker room as she sat down besides the lockers nearby. Hopefully no one would bother her, closing her eyes she leaned back and looked up at the countless folded towels above. The seemed so light and fluffy to her, looking perfet as could be as the relaxig warmth from the room next door began to persuade her into entering. She moved her hands immediately to her chest and began to pry her armor off, getting most of it aside from her snug breastplate. \"It was looser earlier!\" She whined loudly in a batch of frustration as she tugged relentlessly to slip off her brestplate. Her breasts resisting as the warmth began to throb again from her breasts as she managed to pull her armor off of her frame and casted it aside as she fell back to the bench. Huffing softly as she rested againsted the wooden racks behind her, she choose to stare down at her. Her once meager breasts were no blossoming, filling her under armor entirely as two meager nubs greeted her from dark mesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking no time to rest, she sprung up onto her feet, only to be met by the new heft of gravity as she stumbled forward. Catching herself halfway across the aisle, her eyes divereted back to her two ample breasts which bounced rather freely due to Corrin's lack of a bra. Trying to regain her posture , Corrin immediately went to search through her discard clothes and armor, frantically searching for the pouch with the stone from earlier; already deciding it was the culprit. \"You're doing this aren't you?\" She said to the stone as her hands came across the bag and opened it to find the orb sitting comfortably at the bottom. Wasting no time, she immediately dove in for the gem, grasping it and pulling it ouf of its den and into the warm steamy air of the locker room as she stared at her culprit. 'Now, I just need to get rid of-Ah!\" Being cut short, the gem pulsed causig her chest to heat up and tighten again. The feeling ended shortly but was followed by her breasts pulsing as they began to swell, her nipples throbbing as her legs came together as she clutched one of them. Fondling her breasts softl allowing soft moans to escape as she felt up her new rack rather warmly as she forgot all anger against her pink gem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the orb down, Corrin now wasted no time, shifting her body slightl so she could tear off her under armor so she could stand naked in the room by herself. Using this period of silence she immediately began to cup her new breasts together as she began to rub them. \"Maybe this isn't so bad....\" She cooed to herself as her red eyes stared down at the pale mass of flesh that rivaled Camilla's own as she licked her lips letting her vanity take precedent in this moment. Spinning around, Corrin's eyes began to eat up her new body in the nearby mirror as her womanly frame was now matched with two large breasts that wobbled and bounced with every movement. \"Perhaps, I deserve some relaxation....\" Reaching up to grab a towel, she grasped it and pulled it down and hesistated as she went to grab the pink orb. Cupping the orb within the towel, she walked ahead into the steamy pools ahead as she examined the empty room. Gaining a sly smile she immediately sat down and enjoy herself. Rubbing and cupping her breasts as she let out soft moans. the new found firmness of her breasts were fantastic as she squeezed her breasts. Absorbing herself wholeheartedly with her new found assests as the orb pulsd again, allowing her breasts to swell and grow again as she panted and moaned at the washing waves of pleasure that coarsed through her body as her paradise was interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Corrin?\" A voice asked as she immediately sat up to observer who intruded upon her. Her breasts now the largest in the kingdom as she covered her blossoming chest with a towel.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wasn't sure what they were fighting phantoms of sorts that suddenly invaded but things was different they were stronger than any enemy she fought so much so she was forced to try and draw more and more power from her dragon from despite Azura's protests on avoiding that. Corrin sighed as she tried to wind down from the battle but she couldn't her heart was still pounding in her chest she still felt a rush that she couldn't quite explain. Most of all she loved the thrill she felt while fighting and that thought almost scared her. Azura promised that these feelings would die down and it was a result of her reckless attempt of drawing more power than what she could handle while in her dragon form. Laying in bed Corrin twisted and turned as she sleep eluded her a heat was building in her slowly growing stronger with each ticking minute. Thoughts flooded her head as she tried to wait for a slumber that wouldn't come minutes soon turned to hours still she showed no signs of slumber. With an annoyed grunt she got up maybe someone could use that sleep staff they found awhile back on her so she could finally sleep. Either way Corrin knew that she wasn't going to sleep anytime soon as she headed out her body still felt like she was burning up as a blush overtook her face. \"S-so hot\" She muttered quietly to herself as she went out into the camp the cool air washing over her felt nice on her skin as she walked through the camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin could only blush deeper as a new feeling started to overtake her she needed something or someone as the heat she was feeling started to become to strong for her to ignore. Her hands kept trying to stray as she tried her best to focus on her goal in mind. As this happened Corrin started to grow slowly her breasts started to press slightly more into her white button shirt that served to protect her modesty and serve as sleep clothes. This wasn't the only change as her already substantial rear started to grow slightly as well pressing more and more into her black panties. Seeing as she wasn't finding anyone to help her she gave her current goal and hurried back to her room her breasts and rear swelling a more and more not that she was aware of any of it all. As she got back to her room she couldn't help but pull at her shirt more and more as it felt tighter than she remembered her breasts having gotten larger. Frustrated she collapsed on her bed as she laid un moving and doing nothing as she felt her breasts move up and down with her breaths. As she started to pull at her clothes due to their swelling size she was starting to get annoyed with everything but knew there was nothing she could do. She just hoped Azura was right and everything was just temporary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Corrin know was that what she was undergoing was a state of heat brought upon her when she called upon more of her draconic blood to aid her in battle it awakening instincts and the like that was long buried. Corrin had to bite back a moan as the heat filled her body filling her with lust and desire she had the urge to find someone to claim as a mate. These primordial thoughts that flooded her mind confused and frightened her she wasn't like this so what was wrong with her? \"I-it's just cause I pushed myself\" Corrin said to herself like Azura said she pushed herself to far and her draconic thoughts was surfacing and it will take some time before it stops. Nodding to herself in her attempt to comfort herself she never noticed how her breasts was starting to press tightly against her white shirt the buttons straining to contain her breasts. Nor did she notice how her black panties stretched across her now much larger ass as they struggled to contain it as well. Her body was growing and in her panic of her own thoughts these changes gone unnoticed. As this was happening Corrin had to fight the urge to give into those primal instincts. Just for the night than she could find Azura and have her to try to lessen the struggle. </span></div></div>",

She sat down onto her bed and sighed to herself as she began to ponder her mind about her pendant and how exactly it gains power from her singing. \"A peculiar thought, although it's something I've never actually considered...\" She said aloud to herself as she began to play with her pendant, and inspect it. The pendant then began  to glow with an odd light, but unbeknownst to Azura, this tiny light began to very slowly increase the size of her breasts. \"I should go and see how everyone is else faring after the battle, perhaps I may even find something interesting to do.\" Still donned in her slim, blue dress, Azura exited her quarters and wandered out into the kingdom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura hummed her signature song to herself while walking through the kingdom and greeted a couple of passerby's as she made it to the mess hall to indulge in a meal and replenish her energy. While she was enjoying her meal, she felt surprisingly warm and tight in her chest area, but she passed it off as the hot soup she was enjoying. Corrin approached Azura and sat down across from her at the table she was eating at and greeted her. \"Hello Azura! Feeling better after today's skirmish?\" Azura replied to Corrin with a smile, \"Yes, I thought a meal and some rest should be sufficient to rejuvenate me.\" Corrin responded \"That's good! If there's anything you need from me just let me know-\" Corrin cut himself off as he had noticed that Azura's breasts had seemed larger than they normally were. He also noticed that her cleavage also went deeper than it normally did. Azura's breasts had grown from flat, to an average, ample size. She then began to fan herself with her hand and started to pant a little. \"Im sorry Corrin, but what were you saying? It's beginning to feel a little hot in here...\" Corrin began to feel flustered at the sight of her new breasts and as they noticeably expanded while he stuttered in his response. \"Y-Yes im starting to feel quite hot myself... Azura are you sure you are feeling all right?\" Azura's panting increased and so did the speed of her breasts expanding. She rested one hand on her chest only to realize that she had breasts in the spot she normally did not. Upon feeling this new entity, she stood up and observed her breasts as they jiggled underneath her dress. \"I-Im sorry Corrin but I must go now!\" Azura spurted out as she ran back to her quarters as quickly as she could while avoiding anybody else that could see her in her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached her quarters, she shut the doors behind her and sighed heavily. After collecting herself for a few moments, she went to the closest mirror to her and began to inspect herself. \"W-Why are my breasts growing so large?\" She grabbed her breasts and an instant shock of pleasure shot through her causing her to release a muffled moan. The sensitivity of her breasts and being aroused, were both entirely new sensations for her. She stopped feeling herself when she felt her dress start to get even tighter around her breasts. The pendant around her neck also began to glow even brighter, and her growth sped up more. \"They continue to grow?!\" She exclaimed as she quickly reached a size that could rival Kagero and with more growth, even Camilla. While she was growing, her dress began to reach it's limits and it began to rip from the middle of her chest.The growth halted and the light on her pendant disappeared and she was at a level barely beneath that of Camilla's and Azura's dress was barely keeping her chest covered while the newfound tightness of her dress also started to provide her with pleasure. She added onto that pleasure by grabbing her breasts again and started to fondle them even more. The new weight and pleasure of her breasts caused her to fall onto her bed and she wondered, \"How do Kagero and Camilla put up with such large assets?\" </span></div></div>",

The problem was that this was a double-edged sword. She didn't want Camilla to dote upon her in a humiliating way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Kagero. She'd grown up with the Hoshidan royal family and their retainers. Kagero was one of the ones she came to trust the most.

Hinoka shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That works.\" She said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, he's usually training with his father at this time.\" Camilla motioned, Hinoka getting up and following close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the training hall in Corrin's castle, Takumi, Camilla's husband from Hoshido, was training their son Kiragi to shoot a bow with pinpoint accuracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...you're still off by one or two inches. Again.\" Takumi commanded, taking the arrow out of the dummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Father! I still hit the dummy! What's one or two inches going to make?\" Kiragi whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One or two inches may mean the difference between life and death on the battlefield Kiragi. I don't want to lose you, and I know your Mother doesn't want too either. Takumi said, sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright. Watch this one!\" Kiragi said, readying another arrow. He released and hit the training dummy dead center, causing the material to tear, with feathers flying out. \"Yeah! Bullseye!\" Kiragi exclaimed, raising his hand in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Nice shot.\" Takumi said with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Even better than you father!\" Kiragi said, smiling ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I wouldn't say that Kiragi.\" Takumi replied, loving playful banter like this. Takumi picks up his Fujin Yumi and manifests the bowstring. He walks towards his son with a sarcastic smile on his face, and turned his back to the training dummy. An arrow appears in the bow as Takumi shuts his eyes, and lifts his arm to fire the bow behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no way!\" Kiragi yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakumi released the bowstring and the arrow flew through the air and struck the poor training dummy dead center. After a brief chuckle, he turns around to face his son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that?\" Takumi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...I could never do that...without some practice!\" Kiragi said, taking an arrow to load into his bow. He turns his back to the dummy and lifts his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Bullseye, Bullseye!\" Kiragi said, eager to match his father. \"Fire!\" He yelled, releasing the bow. Unfortunately, he BADLY missed, and the arrow was sent flying into the entrance hallway to the training grounds where Hinoka and Camilla were seen walking through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out!\" Hinoka yelled, getting both her and Camilla out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...I think you missed.\" Takumi said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" Kiragi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...I think that's enough training for today.\" Takumi suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla and Hinoka walked towards the two boys, Camilla giving Takumi a big hug and \"accidentally\" shoving his head into her ample chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello my dear Takumi! I've missed you today.\" Camilla teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Camilla! Not in front of my sister!\" Takumi embarrassingly responded. A sly grin appeared on Hinoka's face. She'd have fun with that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...what's the matter? Embarrassed about showing love to little old me~?\" Camilla teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not funny Camilla...\" Takumi said, giving up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fufufu. You're adorable when you're flustered dear.\" Camilla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alright! I get it! T-This is getting embarrassing!\" Takumi stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Getting</i> may be an understatement.\" Hinoka said before chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway! Why are you two here? You're usually not at the training grounds at this hour.\" Takumi questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Leo sent me!\" Camilla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wanted me to tell you he found a new kind of pineapple that looks and tastes like a tomato! He wanted you to go see him right away!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! That's incredible! Leo you son of a bitch, you better not be lying to me!\" Takumi said before running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you later tonight Camilla!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look forward to it dearest!\" Camilla waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now onto you my little angel~\" Camilla cooed. \"Come and give your Mommy a biiiiiiiig hug!\" She opened her arms, and Kiragi rushed into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you mother!\" Kiragi said, in Camilla's arms. When the hug broke, he added \"And it's nice to see you too Ms. Hinoka!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinoka smiled and did a single wave with her hand to say hello. \"So what were you and Takumi doing in here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing much really\" Kiragi responded. \"He was trying to get me to shoot my bow absolutely perfectly, but when I was hunting, I never needed to hit every shot dead center! As long as I hit the game I was after it still counted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla ruffled Kiragi's hair. \"Oh don't you worry about your father, he's just a perfectionist is all. Even more than Leo is surprisingly...\" The last part of her sentence trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But anyway!\" Camilla sprang to her feet. \"I need something from you dearie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What is it mother? I'd love to help!\" Kiragi said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a little bit of your hair.\" Camilla said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...what?\" Kiragi said, his hand reaching to his purple-white hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need a few locks of your hair, that's all.\" She repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh....is this for one of Rhajat's spells or something?\" Kiragi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course! She's been busy lately, and she sent me to get some materials. The final ingredient she needs is hair from a little boy, so who better than my little adorable Kiragi?\" Camilla said. Hinoka turned to look at Camilla, although stayed silent. She never knew Camilla could be such a convincing liar. But she has her ways of getting what she wants...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! I'll give you some of my hair mother!\" Kiragi happily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent...\" Camilla said with a devious look in her eyes. She pulled her axe seemingly out of nowhere, which frightened Hinoka and Kiragi alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, what the?!\" Hinoka said, taking a step back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just turn around for me dearie~\" Camilla said, a hint of aggression in her voice. Hinoka could not tell if this aggression was an intimidation tactic, but whatever it was, it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...\" Kiragi said, turning around. Holding out Kiragi's hair, Camilla swiftly cut a decent size lump of hair off of Kiragi. It somehow still looked natural, and softly fell back to it's original position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And done! Thank you so much Kiragi~ You're such a good boy.\" Camilla cooed, turning Kiragi around to pinch his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy to help mother!\" Kiragi happily said, forgetting his terror from moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must be going now, Rhajat's not going to wait forever for this you know.\" Camilla said, lying once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come Hinoka.\" Camilla said, walking out of the room, motioning for her to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" She responded, leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! See you later Mother! Tell Rhajat I said hi!\" Kiragi said, waving at his mother and Hinoka leaving. Kiragi sighed, and loaded another arrow into his bow, turning around and lifting his arms up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...focus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, Camilla and Hinoka were in the castle \"bakery\", which was simply a side room in the Mess Hall, where breads, pastries, and other sweets were made. Camilla walked into the room with a rather large loaf of bread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Hinoka! This is it! This is a fresh batch of the bread that makes us Nohrians...~\" Camilla began, grabbing her ample breasts mid-sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big and <i>curvy</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinoka stared at the loaf of bread. It was an odd color, being entirely purple, but smelled divine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying this bread will make my...breasts bigger? This isn't some elaborate prank to make me eat a piece of hairy bread is it?\" Hinoka asked, wanting confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla bent over slightly to show Hinoka her generous cleavage, and puts her hand up innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess' honor!\" Camilla said, before letting out a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what are you waiting for? Eat up!\" Camilla said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinoka looks back at the loaf of bread, wondering how much of it she should eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Her poor shirt could only <i>barely</i> contain her new assets, and she instinctively brought her hands to touch them. She shivered in pleasure from her own touch, as not only did they get bigger, but they got waaaaay more sensitive. Hinoka had never done this kind of thing before, so when she began touching her breasts, she started blushing profusely. Suddenly, Camilla came bursting into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah so you're awake!\" She said cheerfully. Hinoka jumped backwards in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha?!

Upon closer inspection, she was right! Hinoka's boobs were even <b><i>BIGGER</i></b> than Camilla's! \"Looks like we're both the <i><b>big</b></i> sisters in Corrin's army, huh?\" Camilla suddenly squished her own impressive chest against Hinoka's, causing her to moan in pleasure. When she realized what she had done, Hinoka looked away, blushing harder than any human in history.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess...\" Hinoka said, still trying to process what was happening. If she's even bigger than Camilla...that means she has the biggest boobs in the entirety of Corrin's army!  Coupled with her rather HUGE butt, Hinoka had a figure she hadn't even dreamt was possible on her. Hinoka knew she had a bigger ass than Camilla, while Camilla was bigger up top, but now....that was all thrown out the window! Hinoka was brought back down to Earth when Camilla suddenly poked one of her breasts, causing her to moan in a higher pitch than she's ever done. She's never really...done this kind of thing before, so these sensations were all new to her. Her new breasts jiggled on her body from the poke until they came to a natural end, both Hinoka and Camilla entranced by the bounciness of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you'll have to get new outfits that <b><i>fit</i></b> you my dear~! That outfit must be on it's deathbed!\" Camilla teasingly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know!\" Hinoka said, her embarrassment and shock still not quite gone yet. Clothes were just the first issue. How was she going to contain these things? She had no use for a bra before, due to her being almost flat-chested, but now she'd need to get one made and fast...but if Camilla can do it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what do we do now?\" Hinoka said, lifting her big breasts with her hands.

Needless to say, she attracted a fair amount of attention from the opposite sex, though she paid nary any attention to any of them, being more content to enjoy herself. As it was right now, Linde was busy exploring the beach and collecting various seashells and starfish that had washed ashore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was exploring the area, she soon came across something a little more out of the ordinary... what looked to be a starfish with a bright emerald hue that was just ahead of the cusp of the tide. \"Huh, I don't think I've seen a color like that before... it should make for an interesting find,\" Linde said to no one but herself as she knelt down to pick it up. \"Ah!\" However, upon touching the emerald starfish, she felt a small prick on her fingers causing her to withdraw her hands away in pain. As soon as she did, she looked at her hands to see no cuts upon them nor any blood. Upon assessing the situation she looked at the emerald starfish and said to herself, \"I guess I should've been more careful.\" She then used a small part of clothing that made up her swimsuit top to carefully pick up the starfish and then put it in the basket that was filled with various other starfish and seashells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, looks like I've found all the unique starfish and seashells that I could find. Now to head back and enjoy some sun,\" Linde said to herself as she soon made her way back. As she was making her way back, she then felt a tingling sensation which caused her to stop in her tracks. \"Huh?\" She said as the tingling sensation emanating from two specific areas... her chest, and her bottom half, though more specifically her butt and hips. Before long, this tingling turned into a type of pressure as it then grew. \"Uh... ooooh...\" Strangely, once it changed, it felt rather... soothing... pleasurable even as it kept welling up inside of her. Though confused, she soon began to feel good from this sensation as it continued to well up in her causing her to fall to her knees on the soft sand with her long flowing brunette hair resting on her feet. The sensation in question felt like a warm embrace within the afflicted areas, which the light mage was thoroughly enjoying as it continued to grow. In that moment, despite being feeling immense pleasure from this event, she felt as though she heard a slight hissing noise... like something was being filled up. However, just as she was beginning to really indulge in the pleasurable feeling, it had slowly eased away and completely disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinde felt rather dazed from the few minutes of pleasure that she had unexpectedly experienced from the sensation that she experienced. After a moment or two, she finally managed to regain her senses as she looked around a little. \"That was weird,\" she stated as she soon went to stand straight up. As soon as she did however, she felt a very pronounced jiggle coming from her chest and hips that weren't as pronounced as before as well as her swimsuit straining to hold them in place. \"What is going o-Ah!\" When she brought her hands to her chest, she was shocked to find that her breasts were not only bigger, softer, and overall perkier, but that they were very sensitive to the touch. \"W-What happened? I wasn't this big before.\" She then gave them a second little squeeze to confirm things, and if the pleasure she felt from them was anything to go by, they were real. If she had to guess, she was about as big as some of the other heroes in the order like Sonya or even Loki. The way her breasts were straining from her swimsuit top looked very enticing as they displayed a massive amount of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that pressure sensation did this to my breasts, then my bottom...\" she said as she directed her hands to her swimsuit bottom. Just like her breasts, her hips had inflated outward as well giving her bottom a slightly more defined curve to them. Even her butt was sticking out a good degree more than what it would have been normally. Although they weren't nearly as pronounced as her breasts, they were very noticeable. Moreover, the larger improvements that she now had didn't really feel as heavy they should've been, but rather they felt much lighter. After giving herself a once over, she then took stock in the new sizes of her breasts, hips, and butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Linde react to these changes?</span></div></div>",

It took some work, but she managed to cover her much larger breasts, which now that she looked at them, was more to Kagero, Aversa, and Sonya's size, but falling quite short of Loki's own pair. Linde lifted her now large breasts a little before she gave herself a rather embarrassed smile saying, \"I knew that father said that I'd grow up to be a beautiful woman... but I never thought I'd do this much growing. It feels... nice.\" She then went and adjusted her swimsuit bottom, though thankfully it wasn't too much of an issue to fix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those issues smoothed out, she continued to make her way back to the main resort part of the beach feeling a little... happy with her new developments. She then said to herself, \"Though my chest and bottom are bigger, they feel much lighter than they should be... it feels good honestly.\" She could feel the new dimensions of her body as her chest bounced and her hips swayed and sashayed on her way back... she was embarrassed to finding this enjoyable, but not by much. From a distance, she could see many of her friends enjoying themselves in the sun. Even those who weren't summoned in swimming attire had managed to find such attire to wear when coming to the beach. Needless to say when she arrived, several heroes took notice of her new look in her swimsuit. Though some didn't want to say anything as it could be taken as being rude, others like Camilla and Loki (not the one with Veronica) praised her for... filling out her swimsuit the way that she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, she found a good spot to sit and relax on the beach while being fairly away from her compatriots to enjoy some peace. Giving her body another once more while giving one of her large breasts a small rub, she then said to herself, \"I wonder though, what caused my breasts and hips to grow in the first place... not that I'm complaining.\" She gave a look at her basket and thought about what had occurred before her assets grew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Linde turned, she saw Felicia looking over at her curiously. The slim pinkette was wearing a two-piece swimsuit with the top part being black in coloring with white frills adjourned to it while the bottom had a similar coloring with a transparent skirt layering it. She also was wearing two maid-like garters with one on her right leg and one on her left arm. Her hair was done up her usual long pink ponytail which went down to the small of her back. Though she wasn't as stacked or as curvaceous as some of the other members of the order, her slender figure and petite yet decent bustline gave her an interesting charm. Noticing that Felicia was staring at her, Linde then said, \"Oh Felicia, this is a surprise. I thought that you were with Corrin and Kana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia then looked over at the young man playing with a little girl over across the beach as she said, \"I was with Milo- with Corrin and my daughter over there, but I came over here because Sir Robin asked to know how you were doing.\" Linde smiled a little at that, given that one of her close friends from the world she came from had eyes on someone else, she was happy to have gotten to know the tactician from Ylisse. She looked past Felicia's husband and daughter to see Robin looking out at the sea with a book in his hand before he glanced her way and smiled. Linde turned her attention back to the pinkette as she then replied, \"I'm doing fine for the most part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia gave Linde a slight look, before she said, \"I'm... not so sure about that.\" Linde looked a little unsure about what Felicia was implying and was about to speak before she was cut off. \"I don't mean that you look sick or anything like that... but...\" she trailed off unsure of what to really say. Linde then picked up on what the pinkette was trying to say as she replied, \"You're talking about... these things right?\" Linde made a quick gesture by pointing out her assets subtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pinkette then gave a small nod before she said, \"Yes actually... a lot of people were saying how you look... bigger in those areas than you were when the day started. How did you get so big Linde?\" Linde gave a slightly sheepish smile as she then said, \"I'm not really sure. I was busy finding some seashells and starfish... the next thing I knew after finding so many, I grew to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia glanced at Linde's improved assets and then looked over at the basket full of starfish and seashells and noticed how many there were. \"Wow, there's so many Linde, that's amazing.\" She then noticed an emerald-hued starfish that was at the corner of the basket. \"Whoa... Linde that starfish looks so pretty,\" Felicia stated in awe as she looked upon it... feeling as if it was beckoning for her. Linde turned to the emerald starfish having almost forgotten about it. Soon the pinkette felt compelled to pick up the starfish as she leaned in and was ready to pick it up. It was at this moment that Linde remembered the sequence of events that had happened and realized what led to her own assets growing. \"Ah!\" But before Linde could say anything, the pinkette had already touched the emerald starfish and had reeled back her hands from being pricked by it. \"Oww... that hurt,\" Felicia said as she rubbed her hands to try and dull the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing what was going to happen next, Linde asked, \"Felicia, are you alright?\" Felicia, after giving her hands a once over to make sure that there was no bleeding, then replied, \"Ow... I'm O.K., just a little sore.\" Linde then stated to the pinkette, \"I just remembered something about the starfish... and the reason that I grew in the first place.\" Felicia gave the brunette a look of confusion before she suddenly felt a tingling sensation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much does Felicia grow?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Linde... I'm feeling some tingling going on... ooooohhhhh...\" Felicia said before she suddenly felt an immediate change as the tingling became a consistent pressure and pleasure began to take over. This caused the pinkette to fall to her knees into the sand and start moaning to herself. Knowing what was coming, Linde immediately set her attention on the pinkette's breasts and her hips to see if those changed at all. Right before Linde's eyes, Felicia's breasts began to grow outward causing her swimsuit top to look rather snug along her chest. Her hips as well were filling out and her butt was growing outward, though it was going at a slower pace compared to her breasts. The pinkette was trying to stifle her own moaning as to not make a scene, but it was getting harder the more she grew out. Through out this, Linde heard a distinctive hissing noise coming from the pinkette's growing set similar to when she heard it with her own growth. Though she knew now that the hissing sound and the growing were connected, she didn't know exactly what it meant. Before long, the pinkette's breasts had reached Linde's previous size which, like Linde, looked quite big on her slender frame... however, the growth of her breasts merely continued as her swimsuit top looked as though it was straining to keep her breasts in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin and Kana, who weren't too far away from Linde and Felicia compared to everyone else, heard the pinkette's moans. Knowing that something wasn't right, Corrin then said, \"Kana, I'm going to check up on your mother alright.\" Kana however, feeling worried for her mama, said, \"I'm coming too Papa.\" Robin, who was a short distance away, noticed Corrin and Kana heading over to Linde and Felicia's location and said to himself, \"I don't know what's going on, but it must have something to do with how Linde looked... bigger, I'm certain of it.\" With that he followed after the two, which garnered some confusion at first, but ultimately they didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia's growth was starting to slow down thankfully, if the sound of the hissing trailing off was anything to go by. However, the growth that the swimsuit-clad maid underwent had overfilled her swimsuit top as it threatened to snap off from the sheer volume that her breasts had gained. If Linde had to guess, the pinkette's breasts was close to her current size which was comparable to Camilla and Kagero's own set. Even her hips seemed to have a luscious curve to them now with her butt sticking out fairly well, which was straining her swimsuit bottom to a fair degree. Just as it seemed as though her swimsuit top would snap from her growing breasts, they had finally come to a stop along with her new wide hips and large butt. Felicia looked rather dazed from the pleasure that she experienced as she said, \"Whooooooa... I'm feeling light-headed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinde gave a look at the pinkette and commented, \"Felicia, I think you're going to give Camilla and Kagero a bit of competition here.\" Felicia then slowly came back to her senses as she took in the brunette's words. \"Linde... what are you talking a-... bout?\" Felicia started, before raising her hand and rubbing past her newly enlarged breasts, causing her to look down and stare at her own breasts for a brief. \"WAH!!\" Felicia yelped in surprise and jumped... however as soon as she jumped, she went over five feet off the ground, but she just stayed still in the air for several seconds. \"W-Whoa...!!\" Completely caught off guard at remaining airborne, Felicia merely looked about with an almost child-like wonder as her body descended back down. \"I-I'm so light... I almost feel like I can fly,\" Felicia stated in amazement before she looked at herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felicia, are you alright?\" Linde said in concern for the pinkette as she was inspecting her own changes. Felicia, after giving a small smile at her new form, then replied, \"I think I'm alright, thank you Linde... although, I feel so incredibly light and big.\" Linde merely replied back saying, \"I'll say. You're almost as big as I am... not to mention you were floating in the air for a few minutes.\" As Linde thought about Felicia's little episode with remaining airborne, she then made a small jump. Though she didn't go as high, she remained in the air for a much longer period that what she would've been. \"So I wasn't just imagining it with my breasts and hips feeling lighter... we're both lighter than we were before we came into contact with that starfish.\" Thinking about more, Linde then says aloud, \"Whatever that starfish did to us, its making us more voluptuous while filling with something that's making us lighter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either girls knew it, they heard something in the back of their minds. It was voice that was soft... subtle... and full of femininity. This voice was compelling them... to touch the emerald starfish again... to continue growing. For the two swimsuit-clad women, they soon became suggestible to the voice's call and were thinking of touching the emerald starfish again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Both males were wearing swim trunks (with Robin wearing his tactician's coat on his shoulders) while Kana wore a cute kiddy one-piece white and gray swimsuit. Corrin wearing gray set with the left side having white highlights and the right side with black highlights. Robin's swim trunks were black with purple highlights similar in design to his coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" muttered Corrin as he noticed his wife's new voluptuous form, which caused him to blush rather heavily. Kana took in her mother's new physique in awe as she went and said, \"Wow... Mama, you're almost as big as Aunt Camilla. How did you get so boingy all of a sudden?\" Robin meanwhile gave an appraising gaze toward Linde and cupped his chin while he stated, \"I knew I wasn't imagining things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia, now beat red flushed, hastily replied as she tried waving her hands in vain, \"Ah, Corrin, Kana. This i-isn't what it looks li-\" before she can get in a word more, she felt her swimsuit top straining and make something of a pulling sound. Corrin must've realized what it was because he had immediately lunged forward and hugged Felicia in a way that just barely kept her from being exposed just as her swimsuit top snapped off and fell onto the sand behind her. \"Ah, Corrin?!\" Felicia called out both out of surprise from his action and surprise from the pleasure she felt from her exposed large breasts, more precisely her nipples, colliding with his bare chest. Corrin pulled away slightly so that he could look at his wife's face as he then said, \"Sorry about that dear... I didn't want you to be exposed like that while we're trying to enjoy our vacation.\" The luminescent blush that she had practically went crimson... and yet... as embarrassed as she was, she was also enjoying this kind of attention from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kana, do you think you could fetch a towel please... and maybe ask Camilla if she has a spare swimsuit top?\" Corrin said with a near crimson blush on his face as he could feel his wife's much larger chest squishing into him. Kana quickly understood and immediately went to go search for what her father asked to get for her mother. \"Good thinking Corrin,\" Robin said as he looked on at the half-dragon covering his wife carefully. He then turned his attention to Linde as he asked, \"Linde what happened? I know for a fact that you weren't as... well, for lack of a better term, voluptuous when you went out to collect those starfish and seashells. Neither was Felicia for that matter when she went to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinde subtly shifted her arms a little unsure of how to answer, while they brushed slightly against her much larger breasts which made her aroused. Robin, who was keeping his eyes on her face, gave her a warm smile as he said, \"Come on Linde, after fighting alongside each other for so long, do you think you can trust me?\" She shifted again thinking about what to tell Robin as she said, \"It's going to sound a little unbelievable Robin.\" Soon Robin's smile turned to a light smirk as he replied, \"Well, no more unbelievable than when Tharja tried creating a curse to stop a common cold, and it ended up turning several of our friends temporarily into ducks and bunnies for a few days.\" This caused Linde to give a cute little laugh at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit thinking it over</span></div></div>",

Then as I was heading back, I started to feel a tingling sensation, followed by a pressure along with a strange noise like a snake hissing, and before I knew it I was... well, like this.\" She gestured to her exaggerated curves to make a point. Robin gave the emerald starfish a look while being careful not to touch it, \"I see... and then Felicia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa, I managed to find a towel.\" Turning to Felicia and Corrin, it seemed that Kana had just come back with a towel that they needed. With it, Felicia managed to quickly cover her new massive bosom and managed to gently ease herself onto the ground and lay the towel flat with her front laying on it in such a way that her nipples wouldn't be exposed. \"Aunt Camilla said that she might have a spare, but she wants to know why you asked Papa.\" Corrin gave a small sigh as he then said, \"She may need to come over just to see what I mean... Kana, just bring over Camilla if you can.\" The little dragon-girl nodded as she called out for Camilla's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Kana out of range, Felicia then stated, \"I was sort of mesmerized by how beautiful the starfish looked, and I went to scoop it up into my hands. It stung both of them, and like Linde, I just grew out... this doesn't make me look bad, does it Corrin?\" Corrin gave her a warm smile as he responded, \"Felicia, no matter what, you'll always be the same cute girl that I fell in love with, whether you're slim or close to Camilla's size.\" Felicia blushed red at that and gave a positively radiating smile back to her beloved prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinde cleared her throat before the two could continue their little lovey-dovey talks in hopes of getting back on topic. \"In any case, shortly after she grew she felt surprise over her new physique and jumped into the air... and...\" she trailed off a little before she said, \"She remained in the air for roughly twenty seconds... almost as if she was much lighter than she was before she touched the starfish.\" At that, both Robin and Corrin looked at each other after hearing that, before Robin turned back to Linde with a concerned look and a raised eyebrow. \"Is it the same for you too?\" he asked, seemingly wanting some bit of confirmation on the claim. At this, Linde nodded before she did a little jump into the air, and at that she remained airborne for about nine seconds, by Robin's estimation. \"O.K., that is far from the usual range of unbelievable... and yet, seeing it with my own eyes I can hardly deny it,\" Robin said as he then turned his head back at the emerald starfish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin, who was taking this all in, then stated, \"So whatever the starfish did to you two... it made you two fill out, and whatever is in you is probably lighter than air which is making you significantly lighter.\" Robin then gave a small hum before he said, \"Linde, I want to see what the starfish does to me if I happen to touch it.\" Linde looked rather concerned at Robin said and replied, \"Robin, I don't think that would be a good idea. We don't know what it could do to you.\" Robin then went to the basket as he turned to Linde and stated, \"I know... but we need to see what it could do to any male who touches it.

Robin turned to Linde and replied, \"I'm fine, but it appears that this starfish strangely doesn't affect males that touch it.\" To prove a point, he went over to Corrin and held out the emerald starfish as he said, \"I want you to hold onto it for a moment to test my theory.\" Corrin was a little hesitant, but he then nodded and took the starfish out of his hands. \"Did you happen to feel anything unusual?\" To which Corrin shook his head in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... then my theory's correct. While this affects any women that happens to touch it, men are completely unaffected.\" Robin summarized as he was handed back the starfish by Corrin. \"In addition to, it will cause any woman that touches it to experiences a growing sensation centered around their *ahem* feminine attributes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mama, Papa. I found Aunt Camilla.\" Robin was immediately brought out of his thoughts by the sound of Corrin and Felicia's daughter calling them as she ran back to them with Camilla sauntering over with a spare black swimsuit top with white frills that was more her size. Camilla practically giggled at her niece's antics, \"Deary slow down, there's no need to rush... it still feels so strange to have both a brother and sister that share the same name much less a niece and nephew with the same name.\" Right when Camilla got close she then noticed her step-brother and said, \"So, Corrin dear... would you mind explaining to me why you had Kana ask me for one of my spare swimsuit tops?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin's eyes drifted toward his wife who was laying on top of the beach towel topless as Camilla followed them to her... was her little bottom always that big? She then made a small glance toward Robin and Linde, looking a little confused that Linde was filling out her bikini top a bit more than usual. Though curious, she wasn't willing to pry just yet as to what was going on. She turned her attention back to Felicia and asked, \"Felicia, may I ask what happened to your cute swimsuit top?\" The pinkette looked positively embarrassed before she replied, \"Ummm... Uhhh... could you lean down here for a moment.\" Camilla did just that as both Robin and Corrin turned away with Kana watching curiously before Felicia carefully covered her nipples (which surprisingly didn't grow that much compared to everything else), and carefully leaned up to show Camilla her new breast size which was almost equal to that of Camilla's own pair. This practically floored the Nohrian Princess as her mouth was left completely agape at what she was seeing. On Felicia's slender build, her new larger breasts looked positively enormous on her along with her new curvy hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Camilla's shocked expression changed to a smile that was tied between both endearing and naughty as she said in a cutesy, teasing way, \"My, my... Felicia dear, I knew that you've been worried about your big sister-in-law stealing away Corrin before you two married, but to see you grow out so much... I suppose you don't have to worry about anymore.\" As if to emphasize that, she crouched and gave Felicia a very loving hug that startled the pinkette. \"I would be so jealous of you right now if I weren't so proud of you as your sister-in-law.\" Felicia who was being enveloped in the hug then said, \"T-Thanks Camilla... but could you give me the top... I don't want to be exposed on the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short couple of minutes later, Felicia was soon wearing the spare swimsuit top that Camilla had brought over... while slightly loose at first, a little help from Camilla ensured that it would fit snugly. Thankfully, though her swimsuit bottom was a bit more than snug, it was holding up fairly well. Camilla then took a step back to admire Felicia's new figure. Her chest looked nearly on par with her own set in the frilled black swimsuit top she had on, though on her slender frame they looked significantly bigger. When she turned to Linde, she noticed upon looking more closely that Linde's figure looked roughly the same as hers which then caused her to ask, \"I take it something happened to cause you two to grow out?\" Realizing that she had caught on, Linde then told her the truth saying, \"Kind of... it wasn't really intentional on our part to grow like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla then raised an eyebrow out of concern, but before she could ask, Kana then saw something green in Robin's hand and asked, \"Oh, Robin what's that green thing in your hand?\" Like a deer caught in torch lights, Robin forgot that he still had the starfish in his hands and was meaning to hide it away. Kana came closer to Robin and excitedly asked, \"Can I see? Please?\" However, Robin didn't want to take any chances considering what the starfish already did to Linde and Felicia... let alone the fact that Kana was still quite young... if not close to the same physical (though not actual) age as Tiki's younger self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Corrin was able to quickly ease things by saying, \"Kana, its a little something that Robin wants to give to back Linde.\" Kana gave her father a curious look and then asked, \"What was it Papa? Is it something special? Is Linde going to be Robin's special someone? Is she going to be Morgan's Mama?\" The last of which made the two blush crimson. Corrin gave a smile before he saw two familiar dragons girls playing in the ocean as he then said, \"Hey Kana, I think I see Tiki over there playing with Myrrh in the water.\" This caught the young girl's attention as she excitedly left to play with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed a little in relief as he said, \"Thanks for the save Corrin.\" Noticing what Robin had in his hand, Camilla then said, \"Deary, if I may ask, why are you holding onto that green... starfish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as Kana had already pointed out the starfish without realizing what it was, everyone decided...</span></div></div>",

Truthfully, I don't really mind being bigger and being lighter since it would ease my back a bit, but I probably wouldn't be able to fit into any of my other bikinis if that were to happen, much less my normal clothes.\" Camilla then gave Linde and Robin a curious look and asked, \"Though I do have to wonder... what are you going to do with that starfish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could do anything else...</span></div></div>",

Ow!\" Linde cried out as she reeled back from it, causing it to fall off her, as she soon fell onto her curved butt on the soft sand. Panicking over what just happened, Robin immediately went up to her and quickly asked, \"Linde, are you alright!?\" While Linde has no marks indicating her being stung, she however was sporting red tinged blush on her face as she then replied to Robin, \"Kind of... but... Oh no, not again. I think its starting to take effect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she said that, a hollow hissing sound reverberated in everyone's ears. Soon enough Linde's breasts and butt (albeit at a much slower pace than her breasts) began to plump up and grow very slowly outward again. Being hit by a lot of pleasure from growing again, Linde was doing all that she could to keep from visibly showing it... but to little effect as she soon began to moan in delight as her breasts and hips soon passed Camilla's own figure and approached Loki's size without showing any signs of stopping. \"It feels... too good... I-I can't think,\" Linde stated as a haze of pleasure soon began to overtake her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin then immediately said, \"Corrin, go find some help... something tells me this might be big, so I'm going to take Linde inside one of the shacks away from prying eyes.\" Corrin, though shocked by what he saw, quickly snapped out of it and nodded at Robin before he turned from the unbelievable sight he beheld to Camilla and Felicia and said, \"We need to find Anna... or at least someone who can help out Linde here. Robin, try to keep Linde safe.\" Both his newly curvaceous pink-haired wife and step-sister nodded and the three immediately went to find help. Robin then immediately picked up Linde, noting how surprisingly light she was despite her figure being as big as Loki's figure and growing, picked up and pocketed the offending starfish, and immediately ran to the nearest shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, no one was nearby and Robin had put Linde on a soft bed for her to remain comfortable. As he carefully kept watch over her, Linde was shaking in complete pleasure and continued to moan in delight from growing out once more. Her swimsuit top looked as though it was having difficulty keeping her breasts in place and as they were being compressed by the fabric as they grew much larger than Loki's own set and were about to approach the size of her own head. Before long, her breasts had slipped and bounced out of her swimsuit top, exposing them along with her cute small pink nipples, which for some reason didn't grow that much in comparison to the rest of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Robin to blush a deep crimson red in coloring while Linde remained semi-oblivious to what was going on thanks to the incredibly pleasurable experience that she felt from her growing assets. Thankfully, Linde's pink swimsuit bottom was remaining strong, though it was evident that strings the held it on were slowly untying themselves from her growing set of hips that she had. In her mind, unbeknownst to Robin, she couldn't help but relish her growing form... she could feel her whole body all over and how sensitive it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Robin looked onward, he noted that curiously her breasts were standing straight from the base of her chest looking practically round with a slight reverse teardrop look as they continued to steadily increase in size... as if they weren't sensed by gravity with her nipples pointing resolutely upwards. In fact, as he looked on carefully, it seemed like her ever-growing set were trying to tug at her body upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Robin kept a careful eye on her in the shack...</span></div></div>",

In fact her breasts, which were upright and perky from her laying position on the bed, seemed to have grown enough to where it was at least a fifth or so bigger than her head, if Robin had to guess (though despite having feelings for her, he didn't want to have such improper thoughts about her in that way). Her hips on the other hand seemed to be close to twice the circumference of her waist with her bottom sticking out several inches. Thankfully her swimsuit bottom was holding strong in protecting her modesty there, but for how much longer... well, he didn't want to guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin then turned his attention to the emerald starfish that he had put in the drawer before turning his attention back to Linde as he wondered how much longer she would keep growing. No sooner had he thought that did the hissing noise that was going on seem to be getting weaker, as though it was finally beginning to die down. And it was evident that whatever was causing her breasts, butt, and hips to grow was slowing down and slowly coming to a halt. This seemed to also cause Linde's moaning to slowly soften, although she was still blanketed in the haze of pleasure and was unable to respond as her aroused shaking subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as her breasts and hips were slowing in their growth, Robin noticed something completely out of the ordinary... Linde's extremely long hair, which she usually kept in a long ponytail, began to somehow rise up into the air and... float in a way that was almost as if it was underwater. \"Huh? W-what the-\" was all that Robin could only say as he saw the scene acting out in front of him. Then, unbelievably, Linde's back soon began to involuntarily arch upwards and was slowly lifting off the bed with her arms being lazily dragged along with the rest of her upper torso. Soon her newly wide and curvaceous bottom rose off as well, followed by her legs. Stunningly, Linde's whole body was slowly lifting off the bed as her she remained in a semi-laid position with her back still arched. It was then that she was floating in place in the air with breasts that were at least a third or so larger than her head overall, a set of hips that were almost twice as wide as her slender waist, and half naked for Robin to see. Seeing this was more shocking than not as he stated being nearly left speechless and unable to comprehend what just happened, \"She's... floating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinde soon slowly came out of her arousal-induced haze as she stated with a red blush, \"Ooooooh... that felt... so good.\" However, she soon noticed something off... strangely, she felt nothing touching her. She vaguely knew that she was on a soft bed even when she was in such an... aroused state that she was in. As she glanced around, she then saw the ceiling of the shack looking much closer than she thought it would've been. As she wiggled around, she found that her feet and hands found no bed or ground that to touch. \"Huh!?\" Linde exclaimed as she tried to look forward from her laying position and quickly noticed her significantly larger bustline which had her in awe. \"So... big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped out of it for a moment to then rub her hands along her hips to which she noticed that they were much wider than before and that her butt was much bigger and more plush. It was then that she noticed a couple of strands of her long hair seemingly floating past her face as she then tried to look down and noticed that she was a few feet off of the bed floating in the air. \"WAH! Surprised by this, Linde made a very sudden and jerky movement backwards and, to her complete amazement, she was somersaulting a little while completely suspended in the air. \"Whoooooa. N- No way... I'm floating! I'm lighter than air!\" Looking at herself again, oblivious to Robin's presence, she noticed how no part of her body was coming into contact with the ground. It was then she noticed a new feeling from just floating in the air untethered from the ground... that she was comfortable and almost as if she was on cloud nine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon taking in all of this, Linde...</span></div></div>",

Let me hear some noise!\" Anna said through a rather odd looking device that amplified her voice.  The crowd erupted in cheers as Anna smiled to herself. This was going to make her so much money, she knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also before we start, if you snuck in here without buying a ticket, you will be forced to buy snacks for the other members of the audience. You know who you are.\" She said. The crowd looked around to see if she was saying that to anyone in particular, and those who <i>were</i> guilty of that didn't want to speak up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone, get comfortable, the competition is going to start in five minutes!\" She said, the crowd cheering once again. Anna disappeared from sight as she went seemingly \"backstage\", even though they were outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the audience stands, many Heroes from across the different worlds were seated to watch the contest. A small group had formed at the top of the stands, where many, MANY Heroes were bantering with each other before the competition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who's in this thing again?\" Said Tobin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked Kagero to enter this competition. So we can have the honor of winning the first annual contest.\" Ryoma responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she react to that?\" Hinoka asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She accepted without hesitation.\" Ryoma responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you're looking forward to seeing a girl of her size in that swimsuit aren't you?\" Camilla teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Camilla, what kind of man do you think I am?\" Ryoma responded. Camilla didn't answer, and only chuckled teasingly. Next to Ryoma, Chrom sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both Sumia and Lissa entered as well. Lissa practically begged Sumia to enter.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright Chrom? You seem a bit worried.\" Asked Tiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright, I'm just not looking forward to the aftermath of this...\" He responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Tiki asked, tilting her head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because both his wife and sister are entering the contest together. And there's only one winner.\" Cordelia answered for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....\" Tiki groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celica entered the contest as well. And...I believe Delthea did as well.\" Said Alm, speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. She did.\" Gray confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how that's going to turn out. Seems like there's a lot of competition.\" Faye said out loud. \"(And I also don't want Celica to win...)\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It only seems like there's five entrants from what I see.\" Hinoka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tiki. Why didn't you enter the contest? I feel like you'd blow this competition out of the water.\" Asked Tobin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well...\" Tiki said, lightly blushing. \"I don't believe I'd stand a chance. I don't have the body to pull off such an outfit.\" She responded. Everyone aside from Tiki collectively looked at each other with knowing faces of disbelief of how false that statement was. The group of 10 continued idly chatting while Anna went \"backstage\" to check on the girls. She quickly walked to the room where the five girls were waiting in their swimsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, it's almost time, are all of you ready?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready as I'll ever be.\" Said Sumia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always ready commander.\" Kagero said dutifully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I need to check on something real quick, I'll be back in 2 minutes. You'll head out once I get back.\" Anna said, leaving the room. She shut the door and the girls were left to chat for a minute or two. Kagero was in a tight one piece swimsuit that nicely revealed her curves and had a slot in the middle for a generous amount of her very ample cleavage to be showing. Sumia was in a two piece suit with a butterfly design on it. The outfit showed a large amount of her large breasts, and showed just as much of her huge butt. Celica was also in a two piece suit, with a rather elegant pattern on both pieces. Her larger than average breasts perked up nicely, giving them a nice full look to them. Lissa was in a one piece suit that covered most of her body, but was admittedly adorable on her small figure. Plus the amount of thigh that she was showing really helped her case as far as she was concerned. Delthea was also in a one piece suit, which showed off her...admittedly large butt, and left a good view of her small breasts. The girls looked at each other, not knowing who would be the one to take home the victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think we stand a chance Lissa?\" Delthea asked with half shut eyes, not liking her odds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so! They may have rather huge bodies...\" Lissa said, pointing to Kagero and Sumia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you and I can pull off cute <i>way</i> better than they can pull off sexy!\" Lissa said with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...It'd be nice if we had both, so that way we can win this competition without contest!\" Delthea said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I agree. But I still think we have a good chance to win!\" Lissa said. Across the room, the other three girls were having a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why did you enter Kagero?\" Sumia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Ryoma requested I enter, I'm here to represent Hoshido.\" She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Heehe. Delthea and I are here to represent Valentia. I wish the best of luck to you both.\" Celica said to Kagero and Sumia. While waiting for Anna to return, Delthea had a light-bulb moment. She walked over to the other side of the room and looked at the bookshelf, she smiled and took a tome from one of the shelves. It was an exact replica of the tome she had at home for...recreational purposes. Although that one went missing a while ago. She couldn't find it. Anyway, this tome would expand whatever was shot with it. If she blasted herself with it, she could more than compete with the likes of Kagero, Sumia and Celica! Like she said, it'd be nice to have both cute <b><i>and</i></b> sexy, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Delthea smiled deviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, I'll explain.\" Delthea said, wrapping an arm around Lissa and bringing her as across the room as possible from the other girls. She spoke in a whispered voice so the other girls wouldn't hear, even though they were still conversing across the room. Delthea showed the tome to Lissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a special tome. What it does is that it can make anything shot with magic from it...grow.\" Delthea said to Lissa. Lissa's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Grow? How so? Like, does it make your head twice as big? Does it make you taller? Oooh if it makes you taller I need to see you after the competition.\" Lissa asked. Delthea chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. It makes <i>these</i> bigger.\" Delthea said, rubbing her chest. Lissa brought a hand to her mouth in a gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They make your boobs bigger?! T-There's a tome for that?\" Lissa asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Heehee...\" Delthea chuckled. \"And I was thinking, while we're undoubtedly the cutest girls in this contest, I don't think we have the bodies to compete with someone like Celica, or Mila forbid that ninja.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa crossed her arms. \"You're probably right...I don't have the boobs that Sumia does.\" She pouted. Delthea chuckled with a devious expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I think we should use this. It'll make our boobs big enough where we can compete with the other girls! And didn't I say it'd be nice to have cute <b><i>and</i></b> sexy?\" Delthea said with a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa ponders for a second. \"Yeah but....isn't this kind of cheating?\" She asks, looking at the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but when have you ever played fair in your pranks?\" Delthea said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" Lissa said with a puffed up cheek.

She turned back towards Delthea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's do it.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Now...let's see if I remember how to do this...\" Delthea said, opening the tome. \"Aha! Here it is!\" After chanting softly, a ball of magic appeared in Delthea's hand, and she shot it towards Lissa. It struck her right in the chest, and a wave of pleasure swept through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah...! What the? What was that?\" Lissa asked. Delthea chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels good doesn't it? Trust me, it'll feel a lot better in a second.\" Delthea said with a grin. True to her word, Lissa began feeling sharp waves of pleasure spread through her body. She let out euphoric gasps and soft moans as she felt the pleasure build in her chest. She brought her hands to her small breasts and gasped in awe...as they were pushing back! Lissa's breasts began to swell outwards! A blush started to form on Lissa's face as she watched and felt her breasts grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah...i-it feels so...good...!\" Lissa said between gasps. Delthea simply chuckled as she watched her friend's breasts grow. Suddenly, Lissa felt a constricting tightness in her chest. She looked down and saw her growing breasts straining her swimsuit rather heavily, as it wasn't designed to handle breasts this big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...they're going to rip through my swimsuit...!\" Lissa said, awaiting the inevitable....that never came. With a gasp, Lissa looked down and saw her breasts had stopped growing. Her swimsuit was still intact, and her breasts all but tripled in size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....\" Lissa said happily. \"They're as big as Sumia's now!\" Lissa exclaimed. She let out a sharp moan as Delthea grabbed her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!\" She exclaimed. Delthea chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they certainly are big enough to compete with the others alright!\" Delthea said with a giggle, jiggling Lissa's breasts in her hands. Delthea opened the expansion tome and started chanting the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me join you in competition!\" She said excitedly. She fired the blast at her own chest and let out a euphoric moan of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm....\" Delthea moaned, grabbing her chest as she felt it start to swell. \"Oh it's been too long...\" She said sensually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelthea's breasts grew at a rather quick rate compared to Lissa, and in less than a minute, was already straining her swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...! So...tight...!\" Delthea moaned. She grabbed her breasts again and gave them a slight squeeze, causing her to gasp in pleasure. Lissa watched with a blush on her face as she watched Delthea enjoy her growth...a LOT. Soon after however, her growth ended. She stopped growing at around the same size as Lissa, but since Delthea was smaller than Lissa initially, her swimsuit was under a lot more strain from her breasts. It looked like it could rip open any second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....Delthea, you're huge!\" Lissa said to her. Delthea looked at her with a wide grin and pressed her breasts against Lissa's, causing Lissa to let out a pleasurable gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so are you Lissa! We'll <b><i>crush</i></b> this competition!\" Delthea said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Lissa said, excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She despised the fact that Delthea and Lissa were cheating, and her anger was slowly but surely rising. She stared at Delthea and Lissa with a look of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm only saying the truth Lissa!\" Delthea said, wrapping an arm around her shoulder. \"You may as well give up now! Haha!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Delthea's taunt, Celica snapped. Her darker side won out. She approached Delthea and Lissa and anger, and forcefully pushed Delthea into the nearby wall, forcing her to drop the tome. Lissa watched in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! W-What the hell Celica!?\" Delthea yelled. Celica picked up the nearby tome and slowly walked a few feet away with her back turned to them. She let out an evil chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you two want to cheat huh?\" She said, turning to them. She had an evil grin on her face. \"Well so will we!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissa and Delthea watched as she chanted the spell and extended her hand to Kagero and Sumia. Two blasts of magic flew out of her hand and struck Kagero and Sumia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaah!?\" Sumia exclaimed. \"C-Celica, what did you do?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe she blasted us with the spell...\" Kagero said with a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?! So that means we're gonna...! Ngh!\" Sumia said as she felt a wave of pleasure wash over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...\" Kagero moaned as she felt the same feeling. Even with her rather stoic personality, she wasn't able to quite repress that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelthea and Lissa watched with shock as Kagero and Sumia's already large breasts started to grow.  Celica watched with a smirk.  Sumia wrapped her arms around her large chest with a blush on her face. She was attempting to hide her growth. Kagero showed no signs of panic, and only watched as her already huge chest started to strain her one-piece swimsuit rather quickly. Although a small blush started to form on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...t-they're getting too big...!\" Sumia said in a panic. Sumia's larger than average breasts now started to feel tight in her swimsuit, and it wasn't long until her top completely snapped off. More and more of her breasts were showing by the second. \"T-They're so tight...!\" Sumia exclaimed. However, as soon as it started, their growth ended. Kagero's swimsuit struggled to contain her gigantic breasts, as her one-piece had several tears in it. Sumia's swimsuit also struggled to contain her slightly smaller, but still gigantic breasts, as she felt that any sort of strain or movement would have her top just <b><i>snap</i></b> off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" Kagero said, staring at the ocean of cleavage sitting right below her head. Sumia did the same, but only blushed harder than any of them had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How am I going to explain this to Chrom...?\" Sumia said to herself. Lissa wondered the same thing, as she was sort of in the same situation. Having breasts that were triple her original size now. While Kagero and Sumia didn't triple in size, they more than doubled in size, and they were the biggest girls in the Order of Heroes now. Celica chuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that they've grown...I think it's only fair for me to grow as well.\" She said with a grin. She quickly aimed at her own chest and blasted the spell directly into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah...\" Celica moaned. She knew how this felt already, due to this being the same tome Faye used on her, but she would be lying if she said it didn't feel good. She watched with a smirk as her larger than average breasts started to swell. She turned to Delthea and Lissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a good look girls. Watch as your <b><i>advantages</i></b> get nullified by our growing breasts!\" Celica said. Delthea watched with an angry expression, Lissa with a blush on her face as they watched Celica's breasts fill out her swimsuit more and more, and they soon started to run out of room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...you're right Sumia, this <b><i>does</i></b> feel a bit tight. Heeheh...\" She says to herself. She looked down to see her growing breasts continue to grow and swell outward. However, like the others, the growth did not last long, but her breasts had more than doubled in size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...there we go.\" Celica said. She looked at Delthea and Lissa with a smirk. She didn't need to say anything to them. Her expression said it all, and she knew that Delthea was pissed. In the background, Sumia still tried to hide her giant breasts, and Kagero was trying to make sure they didn't burst through her swimsuit. Even with their utterly gigantic breasts, it seems like the relative breast sizes were still around the same. Kagero was still by far the biggest of the group, and Sumia and Celica were much bigger than Lissa and Delthea, now that all five of them had grown. Delthea stared at Celica with anger, knowing her plan had gone completely out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

What's fair is fair, and you all seem to have gotten quite a bit bigger!\" Anna said cheerfully. \"Plus...this can be a way to get every last coin out of everyone's pocket..~\" She said under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Delthea asked, raising her eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing!\" Anna said as cheerfully as ever. She cleared her throat. \"Now, are the five of you ready to go out and start the competition?\" She asked. Sumia blushed immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What? W-We can't go out there like <b>this!</b>\" Sumia said, lifting her arms from around her chest to show her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you all want to win right? You can't win if you don't compete!\" Anna said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give us the order Commander Anna, and we'll obey.\" Kagero said dutifully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I like to hear! Now let me think....\" Anna said, trailing off. The five girls stood waiting for Anna's order. Delthea's anger had mostly fizzled due to Anna's entrance, but she was still a little pissed at Celica. Kagero stood waiting for her orders, while Sumia was trying to get the courage to go out there with her...<i>enhanced</i> assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Anna want to do??</span></div></div>",

As she moved around, she came across a rather curious shop that had caught her attention.

In a that moment, she felt her bridal dress become a bit more snug around her incredibly modest chest... however, she was too enraptured by the smell to really notice that her breasts had grown outward going from small to decent sized. Once she finished, she then remarked, \"These flowers smell wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do look and smell wonderful, don't they?\" said a voice which startled Fjorm.

Fjorm didn't realize that she was staring at the beautiful young woman until a full minute after the fact. As soon as she realized this, she snapped out of it and said to the beautiful shop keeper, \"Oh, I-I-I'm sorry... I shouldn't have been staring like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop keeper merely gave a light little giggle at Fjorm's little display as she said, \"Don't be. I get that a lot whenever I've had to tend for the shop when my husband's out.\" This caught Fjorm a little as she asked, \"You're married?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman gave a warm smile as she flashed a beautiful sapphire wedding ring on her right ring finger and said, \"Yes. Been happily married for six years now, and we've been caring for eight beautiful children for seven of those years.\" Threw Fjorm for a loop as she looked at her in pure awe. She couldn't help but imagine herself in the woman's position as she wanted to enjoy having a big family herself once she got to marry... that is, if she married. However she quickly snapped herself out of those thoughts as she turned her attention back to the flowers and asked, \"I don't think I've ever seen flowers like these before. What are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop keeper gave Fjorm a warm smile as she said, \"This bouquet of flowers are known as the Bloom of Mila. These are a special kind of flower that symbolize longevity, health, beauty, and fertility.\" She then motioned Fjorm closer as she whispered, \"There are also a couple of legends about these flowers. One states that they were blessed by Mila herself, so any who possess these flowers is guaranteed a long healthy life. It is also stated that if a kind maiden in love were to receive such flowers, her beauty would be destined to grow and that her and her love's lives would forever be intertwined in joy and happiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis immediately had Fjorm thinking for a moment about the person that she was harboring her feelings for.

To be honest, I didn't look the way that I am now before I married my husband.\" This caught Fjorm completely off-guard from that statement, \"Y-You weren't!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop keeper's grin turned into a warm smile as she replied, \"Nope. In fact, I'd say that I looked a little bit more like you... petite, short-hair, and very pretty not unlike you. Maybe not <i>as</i> pretty as you look, but still very pretty.\" This gave Fjorm a light blush at being called pretty by the beautiful young woman. \"I... don't think I'm that pretty... am I?\" Fjorm said looking a little flustered. The shop keeper didn't give in as she said, \"No, you are pretty. So, don't sell yourself short on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFjorm gave a light nod as the shop keeper continued saying, \"In any case, my husband and I grew up with each other in a town far off from here and were pretty close friends. He was a member of nobility while I myself was a commoner, but nevertheless we became quick and best friends. However, when we came of age, he was constantly harassed by his parents to marry the noble girls of the town that we lived in who were of higher status than me and a bit more...\" She gestured the curves around her body a little before she continued, \"Mature to put it lightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice princess caught the meaning immediately and nodded as the shop keeper continued, \"His parents felt that both me and him were unfit to be with each other because of my status as a commoner and deliberately kept us apart and attempted to have others scorn me for my status. We weren't able to see each other for some time, and I was afraid that he would fall for those who didn't care for him. Then when I was about sixteen, I met beautiful woman who bestowed upon me the seeds that would grow into these flowers. She told me the name of them and, while vague at the time, told me that they would bring good luck to me and my beloved... which was a little embarrassing at the time. I was a little afraid that I would owe her, but when I asked her, she said that finding happiness and opening a shop would be enough payment. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometime after I bought and planted them, he came by and told me that he was sick and tired his parents trying to control his life and that he would discard his noble name so that he could be with me. He told me right then and there that he only ever had eyes for me for being the one person that wanted to be with him as his best friend and as the only person that didn't care about who he was other than that he was a good person. When he told me that, my heart felt as though it was on cloud nine... I felt that I couldn't have been happier. I knew right then and there that we were both in love with each other. He noticed the seeds that I was trying to grow, so I told him about the flowers that would come from them. He then asked if I wouldn't mind having the flowers that would sprout from them as my wedding bouquet, and I found it to be a wonderful idea. When they grew during my seventeenth spring I had taken to smelling them everyday for the amazing aroma they held. Then the strangest thing had happened... it felt as though my body was going through another growth spurt and a tremendous one at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Fjorm's attention as the shop keeper was reminiscing about this event, \"Soon enough, I noticed that I was outgrowing a lot of my shirts... and then my skirts, and even my very hair was flowing out like a cascading waterfall. My husband was shocked by this, and I feared that he might turn me away because I looked like the noble girls that were pining for him. But he never averted his gaze from me and said that I looked beautiful in his eyes. I did wonder for a moment if he still loved me for who I was or if was just for becoming more beautiful. It turned out that it was both with more a case of the former. He fell in love with me because I was kind, sweet, and always valued him as my best friend and as his own person. While I was already very pretty, he felt that me growing was my just my outer beauty reflecting my personality and my love for him. On the day that we married, I had become the most mature and prettiest girl in our  entire town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFjorm's mouth was left a little open in awe as she then asked while blushing deeply, \"So, if I were to have these flowers... then?\" The lovely shop keeper gave a warm smile as she said, \"If you're truly in love with someone and you are kind and caring, then your beauty will grow to match them... and possibly more come when you two are together. Such as when you have kids... believe me, my eight children can attest to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had Fjorm thinking it over... and she really did want to express her love to the person she held feelings for and to have a big happy family. But then she realized that she didn't check the price for the flowers, and she noticed that...</span></div></div>",

Then again, compared to most other things within the shop, it had good reason to be expensive. Seeing the heartbroken look on Fjorm's face, the beautiful woman then said, \"I think I might be able to work something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked around a little and then asked, \"How much gold are you off by?\" Fjorm wasn't sure about answering at first, but then she replied, \"I only have about five thousand gold on-hand..\" The shop keeper then gave her a light smile and stated, \"Tell you what, I can give you about seven of those flowers separate from the bouquet and some seeds to grow more of them for about four thousand gold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis threw Fjorm a little as she exclaimed, \"Y-You'd really do that?!\" The shop keeper replied, \"Of course. Though I do need you to do one thing for me.\" She paused for a moment as Fjorm took this in, wondering what she was going to ask and unsure if she could provide that. \"What I'd like for you to do... is to help me spread the word about our shop, if you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice princess looked confused for a moment as she asked, \"That's all?\" The shop keeper gave a small frown before she nodded and replied, \"We had only arrived here about a few months ago from the last town that we were at. We thought that we could get plenty of customers if we set up shop here since the last town we were at wasn't providing enough for our five girls and three boys... among a few other things that I'd rather not go into detail. Sadly, we've haven't been getting that many customers coming in. You are probably our eighteenth customer for the past few months.\" She looked to her entire shop and said dimly, \"I'm worried that at the rate that things are going, we won't make enough to make ends meet, much less care for all of our children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFjorm thought about it and she felt compelled to help them more than anything. Even if the flowers weren't offered, the woman's family needed something to help them out. Fjorm then decided...</span></div></div>",

You're Fjorm, Princess of Nifl, aren't you?\" This caught Fjorm a little by surprise since she never gave her name, but she nodded. \"I knew you looked familiar. I hardly recognized you with the beautiful dress that you're wearing. You and the Order of Heroes saved our lives during the M\u00faspell Invasion. We were in the town that got struck near the gate to Nifl and if not for you and your friends leaving that signal, we would've been their next victims.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile surprised by this, Fjorm smiled as she replied, \"I'm glad that you made it to safety.\" The shop keeper then continued and said, \"No. Thank you for helping us back then.\" She then gave a little thoughtful look as she then said, \"I think I'll lower the price for the Bloom of Mila that I offered to around two-thousand gold and give you an extra five flowers for you only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis completely caught the ice princess off-guard as she said, \"Wait, are you sure about that? Don't you need to still support your family?\" The shop keeper smiled warmly and said, \"Since you and your friends saved our lives from before, and its only right that I express my thanks to you.

I'd rather pay the full four thousand that you offered earlier to help your family as I have everyone spread the word of this shop.\" This surprised the shop keeper again. Despite being serene and giving such a generous offer for saving their lives, the princess refused to take it by putting her and her family's needs above her wanting for the flowers. Touched by this display of serenity from Fjorm, she teared up a little as she replied, \"You really are a kind young woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the time to dry her tears before she continued and said with a smile, \"Tell you what, we'll split it to three thousand and three hundred gold.\" Fjorm looked ready to say something before the shop keeper said, \"Please, I want to express my thanks to you through this... you yourself are kind and thoughtful to a fault for being concerned for my family's well-being. At least allow me to give this token of thanks for these flowers in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFjorm gave it a little bit of thought as she then replied, \"Alright, I accept.\" Soon enough, Fjorm paid the 3,300 Gold to the woman, and the woman gave her a dozen Blooms of Mila and several flower seeds of that flower for her. \"Thank you.\" Fjorm said as she gave a polite little bow. The shop keeper said in response, \"No, thank you. And call me Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fjorm left the shop, she took in the aroma of the flowers and quickly noticed how much more heavenly their fragrance was. Though, she hardly noticed that her shoulder-length hair had grown down to her upper back. Nor did she realize that her breasts and hips had puffed up further giving her form a much more defined and luscious curve. Thankfully her dress still held up nicely, but it looked like it wouldn't be long before she'd outgrow it. This didn't escape Sarah's notice as she Fjorm's form grow more voluptuous as she was leaving the shop. She then said softly to herself, \"It seems like she might become even more beautiful than I am now... then again, she's a sweet young woman so its not hard to see why the Blooms of Mila is affecting her so quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could think further she heard several cute little voices calling out for her, as she stated, \"Still, I'm content with what the flowers gave me and helped me obtain.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fjorm couldn't help but smile as she held onto the dozen Blooms of Mila that she had in her hand. Thinking about what Sarah said about the flowers bringing lovers together, she thought about the Summoner, Kiran. She thought about how he had saved her life when she was wounded when she had escaped to Askr during the M\u00faspellian war. By making a pact with her through Breidablik, her life was preserved and she was brought back from the brink. Since then, with help from him, Alfonse, Sharena, Anna, and the rest of the Order of Heroes, they had pushed back the war and ended Surtr's life. Though he later came under Kiran's control, which she vehemently didn't like at first after everything he did to her family, Nifl and everyone else, she found it strangely serendipitous that he had to follow Kiran's orders whether he liked it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought more about it, though he wasn't a fighter, Kiran never-the-less had done everything for her and she found herself forever indebted to him. Both of them held each other in high regard as really good friends after everything that had happened. Yet ever since the Bridal Festival and being summoned from there, she has felt a sense of longing for him. She felt that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him, and raise a family together... yet she hardly knew how to tell him and was afraid of being rejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was lost in her thoughts before she heard someone on her right say, \"Oh, Fjorm. You're back.\" This brought her out of her thoughts as she turned her head right to see the very person she was longing for, Kiran. She felt her heart flutter for a moment upon seeing him, before she calmed herself and replied, \"Kiran. What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran rubbed the back of his head a little and replied, \"I was just coming from attending little training session with a few of the other members of the Order of Heroes. I got into it myself with a little sword training... with some mixed results as per usual.\" The white-clad summoner soon noticed the flowers that Fjorm was holding and asked, \"Hey, those are some nice flowers. Where did you get those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFjorm looked a little embarrassed as she, though hesitantly at first, replied, \"O-Oh these? I-I got these from a shop that's around town. They're called the Bloom of Mila and they're supposed to promote beauty, longevity, and a lot of other things too.\" She didn't want to mention the other things that they promoted, as it made her embarrassed enough at being caught with the flowers by the person she had grown to love. Little did she realize that her hair was slowly growing outward reaching further down from the top of her back. Even her breasts and hips grew a tad bit more, with her steadily growing bust now displaying cleavage. However, she straightened herself out as she said, \"The were rather expensive, but the shop keeper let me have them for a more reasonable price and some flower seeds if I was willing to help her out by spreading awareness about their shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran's face lit up with interest from hearing this as he said, \"I see. I can ask Alfonse, Sharena, and Anna about this and see if we can help out. We do need to know where the shop is first, but once we know that, we'll have the order of heroes spread the word around the town.\" This earned a warm smile from Fjorm as she gave a small thank you to him. He then continued saying, \"As for the flowers, I'll find a vase for them so that they can be put in and cared for. As for the seeds, we can have them planted in the garden. Would you mind them being placed near Idunn's little garden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFjorm gave a light smile and said, \"I wouldn't mind, Kiran. Thank you.\" Kiran returned that with a warm smile of his own at the ice bride, before he said, \"O.K. then. I honestly can't wait to see how they'll turn out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to leave, but before he left however, he stopped and took another look at Fjorm. Curious as to why he stopped, Fjorm asked, \"Is something wrong, Kiran?\" He inspected her closely, and then blushed a little as he slowly replied, \"Uh... how am I supposed to say this without coming off as being rude. You look a little... different.\" She was confused a little before he stated, \"I mean, to elaborate a little...\" until he said in a slightly awkward tone...</span></div></div>",

Noting her confused response, the summoner continued this line of thought as he said, \"Your hair looks longer than it was when I last saw you... I mean, I can clearly see your hair going from blonde to blue.\" This had her perked up as she brushed her hair to be sure. True to Kiran's word, Fjorm saw a lock of her own clearly long hair. As an added effect, she noticed that her blonde hair was becoming bluish in coloring as it got further away from her head. If she had to guess, her hair was probably long enough to reach midway to her back. As Kiran looked on, he then stated, \"Actually, now that I look at you, are you going through a growth spurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then quickly remembered what Sarah had said about her growing all over and, seeing as what Kiran was trying to hint at, she then quickly yet subtly brought her hand up to her chest in a way that wouldn't look embarrassing, quickly realizing that she had grown out. If she had to guess, she was about as big as Caeda... which isn't that big compared to several of the other heroes, but it was still very noticeable. At this point she only now realized just how snug her dress was in both the chest area and also around her hips making her wonder that she grew in that area as well. Fjorm looked pretty bewildered by this development and wasn't sure what to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fjorm? Fjorm, are you there?\" said Kiran trying to snap her out of her daze. The ice princess soon was brought out of her thoughts and, remembering what Kiran asked, she replied while having a hard time keeping eye contact, \"I... I'm not sure. I guess I might be going through a growth spurt, but... I just don't know.\" She kept her eye contact off of him as he looked at her closely. She then asked, \"I... don't look bad, do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran gave a nice smile as he said, \"Fjorm, you've always been very pretty. Here though, you look so beautiful thanks to your growth spurt, which compliments the kind of woman you are. At least, that's how I see it.\" The ice princess turned to him in surprise and quickly blushed from the compliment. \"T-Thank you, Kiran,\" she said in a flustered yet elated manner. Neither really said anything in that moment as they had a silent appreciation for one another... until it dawned on the two that they were staring into the other's eyes a tad longer than they were meaning to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right then, let's get a vase and some water for these Blooms of Mila and I'll let the others know about the flowers you have and about the people you're trying help out,\" Kiran said in a quickly steadied tone. It didn't escape Fjorm's notice however that The Summoner was vividly blushing from what she saw underneath the hood of his white coat and that he was embarrassed from staring so long into her beautiful icy blue eyes. For some reason, it made her feel a little better that he was just as embarrassed as she was which calmed her down. She merely nodded and kept a lovely smile toward him as the two went on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evening was beginning to set in and despite being stopped by Kiran and him catching on with her new looks, it had been pretty uneventful for the rest of the day. As Fjorm was able to find time for herself, she took the time to find a mirror and inspect her body a little more thoroughly to see the effects that her little growth spurt had on her. Looking at herself in the mirror, it was clear that her chest and hips grew a bit more, but not by much more compared to when she first got the flowers. She cupped her breasts and admired their new size which was now slightly above Caeda's size. She ended up thinking about how big her older sister was in comparison. Though she had a feeling that she was going to need to find a really good seamstress to help her with measuring her new curves, before she ended up outgrowing her dress. Last thing that she wanted was to end up with no clothes to cover herself up. She remembered Oboro being such and figured that she could go and talk with her later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her hair however, when compared to her chest and hips which were noticeable if you looked a little closely, her hair was by far the most noticeable having grown out from barely shoulder-length down to her cute pert butt throughout the day. Funnily enough, Fjorm found some joy in seeing her hair growing out that she didn't think she'd have. Taking a few tresses of her now long hair to look at it, she admired how her blonde hair slowly turned to an icy blue in coloring as it got further away from her head. She took the tress of her hair and rubbed it lightly against her face admiring the soft, silky feeling that her hair was taking on. Just feeling hair own hair against her was making her feel warm and fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had met several of the other heroes and many of which were surprised by Fjorm's new look, with some even commenting on how beautiful her new hair looked and how it suited her. Others, when they got a good look at her, commented on how it seemed like she had matured a little. Sadly, she wasn't able to find her siblings during this time as Kiran had them attending a few missions for the day. Nevertheless, she was certain that they would be in for quite the surprise when they return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the veil of night began to settle in, Fjorm was going to head to her bedroom within the castle. \"Oh, Fjorm there you are,\" called out a voice which caught her by surprise. As Fjorm turned to the source, she saw that it was Kiran holding a vase with the Blooms of Mila in it. \"Ah Kiran, you finally found a vase,\" the ice princess said happily. The summoner soon gave an embarrassed grin as he replied, \"It kind of took a while to find where a good vase was for these flowers. Funny enough, the person who gave me the vase gave me one that had the design of Mila on it, see?\" Sure enough, there was a artistic picture of a beautiful and voluptuous woman wearing a decadent white dress with downy, draconian wings, a draconian tail, and long green hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFjorm looked on in awe of the design of the vase and the beauty of the woman on it, before Kiran then stated, \"That reminds me, Fjorm... would you mind coming to my room to talk?\" This caused the ice princess to blush as she replied, \"M-me? I... uh... sure.\" She soon followed Kiran down the hallways as she began to wonder what Kiran wanted to talk about. As they walked, she felt her cheeks burning a little from being close to him. Nevertheless, she followed and soon enough the two had arrived at his room as he opened the door and gestured for her to go in first. A little hesitant at first, she soon went inside to see how both subtle and unique his room was in comparison to the many other heroes that resided. It was relatively big, had a couple of tables and a few chairs, two bookshelves and another room with what she assumed was his sleeping quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran then took his hood off with revealing a rather attractive face showing that he wore glasses and dark hair. He then sat down at the table and carefully placed the vase down and said, \"Make yourself at home, Fjorm.\" She blushed upon getting a good look at the Summoner's face, though she nodded and then took a seat at the table that was nearby. Fjorm adjusted the wedding dress so that she could sit down in the chair provided as she said, \"I guess I'm still getting used to this dress.\" Kiran gave a little smile as he replied, \"Don't worry. Several of the other brides that came here also had a time trying to adjust to their dresses for combat and various other tasks. Though honestly, it makes you look elegant when you're using your staff to help everyone.\" Fjorm couldn't help but blush at the compliment that Kiran gave to her while her chest swelled both figuratively and, to an imperceptive extent, literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFjorm quickly snapped herself out of it as she then asked Kiran, \"So, besides the vase that you placed the flowers in, what did you want to talk about?\" Kiran took a moment to stretch as he then replied, \"Well... a few things. First, I was able to inform Alfonse and everyone else about the shop in question that sold the flowers. Anna was able to locate it and is willing to help spread the news about the shop starting tomorrow.\" Fjorm warmly smiled and said to him, \"Thank you Kiran, that means a lot.\" Her expressed gratitude toward him causing another small swelling in her chest and hips that barely went unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran then said to her, \"There is something else that I wanted to talk about.\" This had Fjorm's attention as Kiran stated...</span></div></div>",

Fjorm had a curious expression as Kiran then explained, \"I was curious about these flowers, so I after I found the vase and water for them, I went to the library to see if there was a guide on flowers throughout the different realms. Sure, enough I was able to find one.\" Fjorm looked a little surprised by this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I wanted to learn more about these flowers with you if you don't mind,\" Kiran said with a warm smile. While a little unsure of what was going to happen next, she gave a smile and said, \"I wouldn't mind, Kiran.\" With that, Fjorm brought her chair over to Kiran's side and sat close to him, causing her ample breasts to jiggle slightly. Kiran blushed upon seeing this and even Fjorm blushed vibrantly before she muttered, \"S-sorry Kiran.\" Kiran then quickly stated, \"N-n-no, No. It's fine Fjorm,\" with which the two stared at each other for short moment. They both snapped out of it as Kiran then said, \"R-right, let's see if we can find the flower in this book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the book and proceeded to look at the table of contents to gain any insight on where Mila's Bloom's description would be located. Looking at it, both Kiran and Fjorm quickly noticed it listed flowers in alphabetical order and decided to head straight to the page that has the flowers with names that started with the letter M. Upon reaching the page that starts off the flower names with M, Kiran quickly skimmed through the pages to Fjorm's awe as he was quickly sifting through page after page. \"Found it!\" Kiran stated as he soon found a picture of the light blue flowers with the words above it stating 'Mila's Bloom' in an extravagant font. Kiran smiled and then said, \"Alright, let's learn what we can about this flower.\" While Fjorm was a little nervous, she was admittedly curious to learn more about Mila's Bloom herself as she nodded at Kiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see here...\" Kiran stated as he soon began reading, \"Mila's Bloom is a rare flower that is found on the continent of Valentia/Valm. It is found in remote locations across the region, though it is mostly within the domain of Zofia. Vibrant light blue in coloring with an amazing aroma, it has long been rumored that the flowers were blessed by Mila herself when she first came to Zofia, hence the name 'Mila's Bloom'. The flowers are said to blessed and any who come into contact with the flower will be blessed with long, healthy and fulfilling lives.\" The next text that Kiran saw surprised him as he read aloud, \"Legends state that if a kind and generous maiden were to be around these flowers while in love, then her outer beauty would grow to match the depths of her inner beauty. Legends also state that if a bouquet of Mila's Bloom were to be part of a wedding ceremony, the wedded couple would be blessed with eternal happiness and a very large family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran, who was flushed red, turned to Fjorm who practically blushing a lovely crimson shade. Looking her over once more, it looked as though Fjorm had grown slightly more since he last saw her. Kiran took a look at the vase that held the flowers and back at her as he asked, \"Fjorm... be honest with me. Did the shop owner tell you about what those flowers can do?\" She looked positively embarrassed from this, but she nodded. \"T-to be honest,\" Fjorm started, \"I wanted to get them initially because they looked so beautiful, b-but after hearing about the idea of being bound to the one that I love for true happiness... I... I couldn't resist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiran, despite him still blushing from being embarrassed, gave a light smile and replied, \"Hey, there's nothing wrong in that. From the looks of things, I'd say that those legends are true. Honestly, you were very pretty before... but you look so stunning now. I'm positive that the man that you love is certain to give you a very long and happy life.\" This made Fjorm blush brightly against and, from Kiran's point of view, it seemed as though there was steam coming off of Fjorm from the embarrassment she felt. \"You don't have to answer if you don't want to, but I should ask...\" Kiran stated as he looked a little nervous to say it, but he steeled himself as he asked, \"Is there anyone in the Order of Heroes that you really like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis threw Fjorm for a loop as she blushed a vibrant crimson red. Her body also seemed to react as her hair grew an inch more, and her breasts, hips, and butt grew a few extra centimeters. Looking at Kiran, she wanted so badly to say it... but she was afraid to tell him fearing that he'd reject her. Fjorm took a deep shaky breath as she replied...</span></div></div>",

Since coming from the first year's Bridal Festivities, she had been waiting for when Marth, her beloved to appear within the Order of Heroes. After a full year, her beloved prince had come in wearing white on a pretty gallant white horse. He had apparently heard of the competition that was being held and wanted to join in the festival. When she asked who he was getting the bouquet for, her leapt with joy when he said that it was for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were dressed for what was to be a fun festival, both groom and bride wanted to spend their lives together. Though with all the fighting that was going on in Askr, neither had really found a good opportunity to announce their plans for marriage. Despite not having the time to set up for a proper marriage yet, both were still happy and even sought out advice from many of the other heroes. Throughout all of this, their love for each other merely grew from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaeda let out a deep sigh as she said to herself, \"I wish both Marth and I could be married here.\" She then looked upon herself within her own bride dress, lightly cupping her modest yet somewhat large breasts, and said, \"I'm certainly not the biggest girl here and I know that he doesn't mind otherwise. Although, I wouldn't mind if...\" before she sighed again. She thought back to earlier in the day when she asked Marth what he thought of her... and she was completely smitten when he appreciated every part of her personality, how beautiful she was, and even stated that he loved her with all his heart and that he'd be lost without her Thinking about how much she meant to him and vice-versa, she had a rose-like blush on her face as she felt herself falling deeper into love for her prince and husband-to-be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt warm at the thought of him gently holding her in his arms and them kissing each other deeply. Soon those thoughts shifted to him gently caressing her body... and then to more. \"Marth.\" While her thoughts enraptured her growing love for her husband-to-be, she hardly noticed the warmth that she was feeling starting to center itself into one place... her chest. As her thoughts soon turned to thoughts of having Marth's child, her breasts seemed to look a little more plump with her nipples looking erect. Those thoughts soon turned having a family with her beloved... and soon her thoughts changed to a scene where she had several children with her husband gently holding her and passionately kissing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her thoughts were engulfed in a happy future with Marth, her breasts soon began to slowly plump up... filling out the top of her bridal dress and adding more cleavage to it. Her loving thoughts for her sweet husband-to-be seem to be causing her mammaries to grow outward at a slow, but decent pace as her top began to feel snug. After a while of thinking of her true love, Caeda came out of it with a modest blush on her face... before she soon felt something quite off with her top of her bride's dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to find a mirror and upon seeing herself in it, she saw that her breasts...</span></div></div>",

Looking at herself, it seemed that her breasts were at least a few sizes too big to be fitted into the dress that she was wearing which was now displaying a good amount of cleavage. \"I... don't think I was ever this big before.\" Caeda stated as she soon gave a gentle touch to one of her breasts... feeling how soft and pillowy, yet firm and springy it was sent shivers down her spine. Loving the feeling of the new size of her breasts, she began to rub them more... before accidentally touching one of her nipples under the top's fabric in the process. \"AH!\" she yelped as she felt pleasure shoot through her body unexpectedly. \"These... are sensitive... yet they... felt so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for her to recover her composure before she decided to carefully pull down her top to better see how her newly enlarged chest looked. Doing so made her breasts jiggle around as they broke free from their confines. As soon as they came to a rest, she saw that they stood out a good few inches from her torso looking incredibly perky. If Caeda had to guess, her breast size had to have been on par with some of the largest grapefruits that she's seen... maybe even on par with Karla's breast size, if she really thought about it. \"They're so big... did I grow from... thinking about Marth?\" she muttered to herself as she felt a sense of joy from seeing the new size of her breasts. Modest as she was, she had to admit that having much larger breasts felt incredible. Yet it felt embarrassing to enjoy them as she had a feeling that she couldn't easily conceal them and didn't know how other people would see her as she is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was thinking of what to do next...</span></div></div>",

She was happy to hear him, but quickly realized that she was rather indecent with her large breasts on display... yet the thought of her large chest being bare in front of Marth didn't seem unappealing to her. Before she could say or do anything about this, she heard a knock on the door before Marth entered saying, \"Caeda, there you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then saw his lovely bride before him, except her breasts were exposed before him and were considerably larger than when he last saw her earlier today, which caused his thoughts to grind to a halt.

Marth turned to her, but seeing that her breasts were still hanging out, he visibly blushed before he averted his eyes and said, \"C-Caeda, it might be better to wait until you're decent first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her large chest was still on display, she completely ignored it as she replied, \"I know, but I'm not bothered by that.\" Marth still had his eyes averted from her exposed chest as he was able to barely look him in the eyes as he replied, \"B-but Caeda, I shouldn't be invading on your privacy like this... it was rude of me, and I'd rather not cause any friction between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaeda then pressed up to him a little as she brought his arm into her exposed chest, causing him to blush deeply. \"Marth, you are one of the nicest and most respectable people that I've come to know. You've valued me not only as an ally, but also as a best friend and lover... as an individual who values my trust and I his trust. It is why I fell in love with you and why I don't feel bothered being... well, a little indecent in front of you.\" She blushed when she finished saying that, which caused Marth to gape a little as he turned and looked her straight in the eyes at awe of her. Caeda gave a light smile as her blush lightened a little as she said, \"I wouldn't mind if you looked at them, but... I would like to know what sort of news you wanted to tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarth's willpower to not stare at his wife-to-be's larger endowments was certainly amazing and showed how much he cared about her as a person indeed. As he kept his eyes focused on Caeda's beautiful face, Marth replied, \"Y-yes, right. I just had a talk with Alfonse, Sharena, Anna, and the Summoner earlier today.\" Caeda then looked invested as she gave him a curious and questioning look. A smile escaped her husband-to-be's lips as he stated happily, \"As there have been few battles lately, they've said that we can hold our wedding ceremony here within Askr.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Caeda to gasp at what it meant as she asked, \"Y-you mean-?\" At that moment, her breasts had grown an inch more, though with how incredibly perky they were it was imperceptible. Marth's smile turned warm as he then said, \"Yes, Caeda. We're finally getting married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, tears could be seen in her eyes as she then hugged her husband-to-be, which had her large bosom squished firmly against his suit causing Marth to blush a deep red, as Caeda smiled and said, \"Marth, this means so much to me, I-... thank you. We're finally going to be together. We can even raise a family... oh, it feels like a dream come true!\" Despite being embarrassed, Marth held a soft smile as he returned the hug to her, as he too entertained the idea of having a nice family with his beloved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as they were in the middle of an loving embrace...</span></div></div>",

At this, both gave a loving kiss to each other before both Caeda and Marth felt something off. Almost as if there was more pressure being applied around-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaeda broke the kiss before she gasped and said, \"M-Marth, m-my breasts!\" Marth, while he didn't want to look upon his wife in fear of embarrassing her, he needed to make sure she was alright and was stunned to see that her breasts were slowly growing out. However, it seems that the shock of discovering her breasts growing had caused their growth to slow down from the visible push that they made until they came to a stop. However, the effects were already quite apparent before the two as her perky chest had evidently grown, now likely rivaling the Nohrian princess Camilla in size and volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaeda, surprised by her new bustline size, gave Marth an awkward smile as she said with an awkward laugh, \"Ahehe... I guess I grew some more.\" A small bit of silence passed by the two as, with an uncertain expression, she asked her husband-to-be, \"They... don't look bad, do they? By Naga, this is embarrassing.\" Marth merely gave her a light smile, \"I guess if it makes you feel any better, I'm a little embarrassed too. I don't mind if they grow a little... because they're attached to the woman that I love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised Caeda and ended up making her heart soar as she blushed a deep red in gratitude. However, she then experienced another minute growth spurt that, although short, had the two immediately take notice when her breasts looked slightly more plump and jiggled slightly. \"Ah, it... it happened again!\" Caeda said before she felt that same carnal desire... thankfully, she managed to force it back. Marth gave a slightly contemplative look as he then asked, \"Caeda, this is only a guess... but before I came to you with the plans for a wedding, what were you thinking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaeda blushed a red tinge as she replied, \"Well I... I was thinking about... about you Marth. About us... about getting married and raising a family... and about how much I love you for who you are.\" As she recalled that, her breasts seemed to plump up more... not really growing this time around, but looking much more perky and inviting. At this, Marth soon seemed to have thought of what it was and replied, \"I think its our mutual love for each other. Your -ahem- breasts seem to grow in response to your thoughts if you thought about me in any sort of romantic way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaeda looked at Marth with a little bit of awe as she then replied, \"So, if I begin to express my love for you either through my thoughts or otherwise... then-\" She looked at her breasts that seemed to be a smidgen larger than Camilla's bust size... by about an inch give or take. Although as Caeda thought to herself, she began to realize that she didn't mind being so big in the chest department given how her breasts remained perky. However, she didn't want to completely outgrow any dress that she would have to wear since her current one needed some work... much less be so big that she couldn't walk. Though, they didn't feel that heavy... which was good for her back and shoulders, but it was a little strange. She then said almost semi-consciously, \"My breasts will grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she again felt that same thing that she felt within her that made her want to act on her carnal desires. A part of her wanted to just grab Marth, take him to the bedroom, and then proceed t- She immediately snapped herself out of that noticing what her thoughts were becoming. Realizing this she then said, \"Marth, we may need to find someone who knows about my condition and soon.\" Marth had a questioning look at first before he shelved his question for later as he replied firmly, \"I agree. I don't want anything bad to happen to you Caeda if we leave this unchecked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth nodded before she gave a small hug to her husband before she attempting to adjust her wedding dress's top to be at least decent. She was able to manage, but it unfortunately resulted in a loud rip and a nice tear down the chest area which, while her nipples were thankfully well covered, her Camilla-sized cleavage was on full display. She blushed a little in embarrassment and awkwardly laughed a little as she stated, \"And we should probably talk to Oboro sometime later about getting a dress that properly fits me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two left the room and Marth suggested that they talk to...</span></div></div>",

Since this version of Loki was summoned by The Summoner, she was bound to assist the people of Askr per their request. Although, she tended to be vague at times when helping others about their personal problems and delighted in causing a little ruckus every now and again just to keep things from getting boring. Nevertheless, she was their best option since she was into such chaotic magic and she might things that the others would not. Though trying to conceal her now massive breasts could be an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing through the hallways thankfully wasn't too much of a hassle as the majority of the other heroes were busy attending other things elsewhere. Those that they did come across were too busy with other things. Finally, they had come across one of the rooms that Loki resided as Caeda knocked on the door gently. \"Oh? I wonder who would need me?\" Loki's sultry and feminine voice rang out as she came to the door and opened it to see who knocked. \"My my, the happy soon-to-be wed couple?\" she said with a playful smile as she gave them an appraising gaze before asking, \"Now why would you two come to see me? You know that not many of the other heroes are too fond of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaeda then gave Marth a worried look, before he nodded. She then slowly uncovered her chest for Loki to then see two breasts that were easily the size of honeydew melons... though they weren't much in comparison to her own set. \" I suppose you really wanted to give Marth here a good time for the honeymoon.\" She then looked at Caeda more curiously as she then said, \"I'm pretty sure that your breasts didn't just grow overnight on its own. Care to tell me what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaeda's face turned a little red as she explained, \"Well, it happened a bit earlier when I was just thinking about my husband Marth, and... as I was thinking about him, my chest just grew. It seems to happen if I show any loving affection for him, whether its thinking about him, or by sharing my love with him.\" Marth then proceeded as he said, \"We know that our mutual love for each other is making her grow, but we're not sure what caused this in the first place. We were wondering if maybe you knew since you enjoy seeing chaos take place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki gave the two an intrigued look as she then smirked a little and said, \"Well, I think I can maybe look into what's causing this... but I do need to see this in action. I won't know what it is specifically until I see it before my eyes.\" This caused the lovely couple to blush red at that. Marth and Caeda gave a look toward each other before nodding. Caeda knew the quickest way to do it, and she immediately kissed her husband-to-be on his lips... and both quickly got into the kiss as they felt that love for each other burn bright. As they broke the kiss, they smiled at each other reveling in the warm feelings they had for each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Caeda soon noticed the warmth in her chest and applied her hands delicately on it. She then felt her breasts pushing out slowly before coming to a stop, with her new size coming close to being equal with Loki's. Her eyes had glazed over slightly, but she managed to push back against those desires. \"Oh my, I hardly remember the last time that I've seen this type of magic.\" Loki said looking very invested in this development. Caeda tilted her head slightly and asked, \"What kind of magic is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki then brought her staff out to slowly take in what appeared to be a small magical pink energy from Caeda's being to examine it. She then smirked as she then said, \"Well, I never thought I'd see the spell used like this and be mixed with so many different other spells.\" Both Marth and Caeda looked concerned as Loki continued to delve into what the spell was. Soon she was appraising the pink energy, keeping it held up by her staff, as Marth asked, \"What did you find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Loki finished deciphering the spell...</span></div></div>",

Nearly any sign of affection that she shows or thinks of toward you will cause her breasts to grow proportionate to how strong those feels were... although, due to various other effects being added to this spell, it seems to be a watered down variation in that regard as your breasts won't grow so fast and it takes a while to grow large.\" Caeda gave a small sigh of relief from that before Loki held up her hand and said, \"However, that's merely the tip of the iceberg...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught both Marth and Caeda by surprise as Loki continued. \"It seems that the spell that's been inflicted on you also brings out your more lustful emotions. From how your eyes have glazed over, it seems that after each growth your carnal desire for your husband-to-be grows stronger, making your behavior a bit more assertive and sultry.\" Caeda then blushed a little as she stated, \"If I continue to grow at this rate, I may not be able to hold myself back from... oh my goodness,\" which had even had Marth blushing at the implications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki then chuckled a little as she lightly said, \"Well, I don't see too much of an issue since you two will be doing that on your honeymoon.\" She then stopped as she then stated more intently, \"But more to the point, you have a lot willpower Caeda, which quite very admirable, so I don't see this making you act on those desires unless you really wanted to. Though, the longer you wait and the larger you grow... you will sooner or later act upon them.\" She then turned a little serious as she looked at the energy again and said, \"There is one other thing that I've noticed... this spell seems to have an interesting effect that increases fertility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fertility?\" Caeda stated confused at first before she immediately realized what it meant as she and her husband completely froze them in their tracks with complete shock and embarrassment. \"Y-y-you d-don't mean...!?\" Loki then gave a small smirk and nodded as she said, \"Pregnancy. Motherhood. Child-rearing. I can come up with more if you want. In this case, it seems that the larger that you've grown from the spell, the greater those lustful desires will become, and the larger your eventual family will be, if you two are planning on having a family that is. In a way, I suppose this is a form of chaos as this spell's intent is to fuel your mutual love into growing you and for you two to give in before you marry. Speaking of fertility, I can already see that you're growing a lovely set of motherly hips down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaeda immediately gasped a little as she put her hands around where Loki indicated. Indeed, they seemed to have widened by a fair bit with her bottom sticking out an inch or two more than what she was used to. Having had that pointed out, only now had she noticed how snug her dress felt around that area. \"How...?\" was all that Caeda could mutter as she was dumbfounded at how she didn't notice this detail. She looked at Marth with worry as he returned a concerned look, before he turned his attention to Loki and asked, \"Is there any way to stop this magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me check,\" Loki said as she used her staff to appraise into the pink magical energy once more... and she found...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once she finished appraising the orb of pink magical energy once more, Loki rested her staff a bit and stated, \"Hmm... well, I have some good news and some bad news for you... which do you want to hear?\" Caeda and Marth gave a worried look before Caeda put on a brave face and replied, \"As much as I don't want to... start with the bad first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis garnered a little smirk from Loki as she said, \"My, my... I would've expected you to ask for the good first. I sometimes love when my assumptions are proved wrong.\" She then rested on a more neutral look as she continued, \"The bad news is that while there's a way to stop the spell from making you grow further, there's no way that you can reverse the effects... so whatever you grow to at upon breaking the spell, you will remain at that size permanently.\" Caeda gave a small little frown at this... she didn't mind being this big if Marth was happy about it and maybe grow a LITTLE bigger, but she didn't like the idea that she would continue to grow bigger and then be stuck at that size for good. In response to her fallen expression, Marth squeezed his beloved's hand a little to let her know that it would be alright... to which she returned a thankful nod. Marth turned his attention back to Loki as he asked, \"And the good news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoki then replied, \"It would seem that the spell is pretty simple to stop. It merely requires that you two complete your vows to each other in holy matrimony.\" She paused for a moment as her naughty smirk appeared, \"And for you two to consummate your love for each other within 72 hours after such.\" At that, both Caeda and Marth blushed a bright crimson at hearing this as they were sputtering incoherent words. Loki had a little chuckle at that, \"Hahaha, your reactions are so adorable,\" before she sighed and resumed with her smirk, \"But I'm afraid its true. You two will need to have your marriage and do the deed to absolve Caeda of any further effects from the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked up as if she was forgetting something, and then remembered as she then stated, \"Oh, this spell seems to have one more effect that I forgot to mention. Once you do consummate your love, you will be guaranteed to conceive... and from being conceived to when they are born, the time it will take for any babies born will go from your typical nine months to a mere three. So it looks you'll be having your little family sooner rather than later.\" Both Caeda and Marth were completely blanched at this news. Both knew that they wanted to have a family, but this... they would become parents with little time to be mentally prepared. Caeda looked at Marth with uncertainty, but he gave her a strong gaze and assured her, \"We'll get through this Caeda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill looking uncertain, Caeda replied, \"But Marth, I know that I want to raise children, but... I'm not sure if I'm ready for it to come this quickly. I'm scared that I won't be a good enough mother an-\" Before she could speak any further, Marth lovingly embraced her, catching her by surprise, as he said, \"Caeda... I'm not sure if I'm ready for this to come this soon either. The thought of being a father so fast scares me too. But I know that so long as you're with me and I'm with you, we'll be able to overcome anything. I chose to be with you for the rest of my life. I will never regret that decision and I won't ever abandon you.\" Such love from her husband left her blushing heavily from this, but it also left her completely starry-eyed as she smiled tenderly at how far he was willing to go for her. Even though she knew she'd grow from doing this, she affectionately returned the hug back to Marth in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, she felt her breasts grow and the bottom part of her dress becoming more snug from her growing mother-like hips. However, she hardly cared about such a state and focused on her love for him as they stayed like that for at least fifteen seconds. As much as they wanted to continue with the loving embrace to each other, they needed the spell to be broken first, or else she'd never stop growing. Once they broke the hug, Caeda took stock in her new growth, and it seemed that her breasts now rivaled Loki's in size, possibly being a tad bigger than them, and her hips seemed to have widened out by a fair amount. Loki gave her a little playful smirk and said, \"Never thought anyone would rival these bad girls. They seem to fit you quite nicely, Princess.\" She then lifted Caeda's breasts playfully causing her to yelp a little in surprise and embarrassment as she said, \"I do hope you'll have a size that you'll love by the end of all of this... if you weren't getting married, I probably would've taken you myself for a nice girls only time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left both bride and groom blushing crimson again as they sputtered their words nonsensically trying to make sense of what Loki had just finished saying. The Trickster merely gave a light chuckle as she said, \"I'm only kidding. Well, mostly.\" Her face softened into a light yet surprisingly endearing smile as she said,\" Still dear, I do hope that you'll have a size that you'll like by the end of this. I may like chaotic events much like my counterpart here, but I've grown fond of heroes like you two and I do wish you two the best.\" At that, both Marth and Caeda gave their thanks to Loki as she then told the two before they left, \"Whoever cast the spell probably wasn't intending for you to be the test subject for it. Most likely they had other ideas, but as to what I don't know. Anyway, have fun with your wedding and honeymoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both Marth and Caeda left Loki's room, the latter asked \"So what should we do now, Marth?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While it might have been better for them to see The Summoner and Alfonse's help, they knew that Caeda was in serious need of a new wedding dress considering her current one looked as though it wasn't going to hold much longer. Thankfully, finding Oboro wouldn't be too difficult as she was working with the local fabric shop that was in Askr selling new designs and such. Though the difficult part was was finding a way to conceal her newly enlarged proportions since she wasn't exactly decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marth...\" Caeda said with uncertainty as they went through the streets of the upper class town of Askr with a variety of people staring. Despite trailing behind her husband-to-be, part of her figure wasn't really well hidden. \"It is alright Caeda, we're almost there\" Marth assured her as they approached the shop. Soon enough they were inside, the bells on the door ringing that customers had entered, and Caeda managed to breath a sigh of relief that very few people noticed the little emergency with her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to our clothing shop,\" said a male voice as he said, \"The manager is currently out doing some chores so me and Oboro are holding down the fort for a- Wait a minute, Marth? Caeda?\" As the two looked in the direction of the voice, they saw Takumi at the counter. Soon enough he smirked before he called in the back room saying, \"Hey Oboro, we have some visitors!\" It didn't take long for Oboro to come out and quickly notice the lovely couple. \"Oh hey! Marth, Caeda, its good to see you two! How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaeda was first to speak as she replied with a smile, \"We are doing well Oboro. In fact, Marth has told me that we will be having our wedding ceremony here in Askr.\" This surprised both Oboro and Takumi quite a bit before the two gave their congratulations to the happy couple. However, after he gave a light little laugh, Marth then spoke up and said, \"As nice as it is to be congratulated, we are here for business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOboro then tilted her head to the said and asked, \"Oh, what do you need?\" Marth and Caeda looked at each other a little, before Caeda nodded. The lovely bride stepped forward past her groom-to-be and presented herself fully. Both Oboro and Takumi were completely caught off guard seeing Caeda's new figure being hardly contained by her wedding dress as the top was torn, and bottom around the hip area looked very taut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakumi turned away out of embarrassment, but he was the first to speak up out of shock as he exclaimed, \"Whoa! What happened? I'm pretty sure your dress was fitting just fine last time we saw you.\" Oboro herself was also rather shocked by this as she replied, \"I'll say... I know that some people can grow a little, but this is a little much don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaeda gave an embarrassed half-smile as she replied, \"Kind of. We don't know how, but a spell was cast upon me that makes me grow whenever I show any loving affection for Marth.\" This had Oboro and Takumi a little unsure of what to think as the former asked, \"So I take it that you need a new dress to accommodate your new proportions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaeda nodded though she said in embarrassment, \"And maybe some others in case I grow any more before my wedding day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, Oboro then proceeds to guide Caeda to the back of the shop for her to get measured and...</span></div></div>",

Caeda was soon in little more than her panties, and Oboro, once she got a good look at the princess, stated in admiration, \"Wow, Caeda. You look amazing.\" This caused the blue-haired princess to smile bashfully as she replied, \"Thank you, Oboro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Oboro prepared to measure Caeda, the seamstress then remarked, \"Tell me, are you and Marth planning on having any children sometime after you marry?\" This caused the princess to blush bright red as she said, \"W-well, yes we are.\" Although it was rather personal, Caeda knew that she and Marth were planning on having kids sometime after marrying... although with the reality of what they needed to do to break the spell placed upon her as well as what would happen after, neither really expected to have kids so soon after marrying of all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile measuring her waist, Oboro then remarked, \"If I'm being honest Caeda, given how modest and kind you are, I feel that you'd make for an amazing mother when you do decide to have children. And I'm fairly certain that Marth would make for a great father too in that same respect.\" Caeda's blush became a bright luminescent red that one could probably see from Embla at the compliments that she got. As she thought about what Oboro said, her mind began to wander toward her husband-to-be, Marth. She soon saw herself heavily, yet happily pregnant with many babies while she and her husband gently rubbed her huge pregnant swell. The scene then shifted to where she was a little older and surrounded with many happy and smiling children, while cradling a wonderful baby girl in her hands, with Marth standing behind her and gazing at all of them and her with a smile. He then held her gently and began whispering sweet nothings into her ear, before he leaned in to give her a kiss. This brought her into a state of pure, warm bliss as she was enveloped by these warm and loving thoughts toward Marth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caeda? Caeda!?\" Oboro shouted to bring the princess out of her thoughts. Caeda snapped out of her thoughts, only to soon realize why Oboro was calling out to her. That warm fuzzy feeling that she had from her imagine spot about her and Marth had caused her breasts, hips, and butt to puff outward. In fact, though it was going slow, she was still actively growing. From how big they were already, it was quite clear that her breasts were now eclipsing Loki's own set if she had to guess. Oboro was looking at the princess with fascination as she saw key areas of Caeda's body continue to push further and further outward. The experience was also erotically pleasant for the blue-haired princess as she was blushing heavily from it and trying as hard as she could to keep from moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long three minutes, give or take, the slow growth that she had experienced had slowed down and come to a halt. Caeda's breathing was heavy and laborious with her eyes quite glazed over from the sensual experience. \"Caeda, I'm so sorry... you were so mesmerizing to look at that I let my mind wander and I fell into a routine that I'd usually have when helping a bride, forgetting what the spell would do to you.\" Caeda managed to reel herself back from the depths of erotic pleasure, if but barely, before she then turned to Oboro and replied, \"It's alright Oboro... I guess this spell's effect on my body had created an effect on other people that neither Marth or I realized.\" She then looked at herself, and it was <i>very</i> clear that her breasts were considerably larger than they were when she arrived at the shop... yet despite how large they were, they still didn't feel that heavy or strain her shoulders and back by much, if at all. She had a feeling that the spell that was put upon her allowed for her to carry the weight with ease in some sense. As for her hips, they seemed to be passing by the length of her shoulders by a fair margin. Combined with a trim waist that she had, Caeda had what could probably be the very definition of having a very shapely hourglass body type. A little top heavy, but still a very shapely hourglass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOboro then cleared throat as she said, \"I'm going to have to re-measure you Caeda... sorry about that.\" The blue-haired princess quickly accepted the apology knowing that Oboro hardly meant for this to happen and allowed for her to measure her body. Oboro quickly started with her waist and then stated, \"Hmm... about 59 centimeters.\" She then measured her hips, noting that her butt stuck out quite a bit. Her eyes went wide as she then stated, \"Whoa. Caeda, you're measuring about 98 centimeters for your hips.\" As she took the tape away and jotted the numbers down, she then said, \"You know, I've often heard that wider hips allow for easier child delivery... so I guess there's some good in this.\" This had the princess blushing profusely as she then allowed Oboro to measure underneath her breasts before she then measured the fullest part of her breasts. Upon removing the tape around Caeda's bust, which were standing proudly high and perky off her chest, Oboro then remarked, \"Caeda, you've got an underbust of 71 centimeters with a bust of 122 centimeters. That's quite honestly <b>the</b> largest bustline that I've ever seen any woman carry. Not even Camilla or Loki would compare to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaeda was practically embarrassed by the whole ordeal. To know that her once modest breasts were now larger than any woman in the Order or any that Oboro had ever seen was something to behold. A part of her felt joy and even some pride in her growing figure, despite feeling quite embarrassed from the ordeal. Oboro then looked through her jotted down notes and then said, \"Oh dear, I'm going need a lot of fabric for your new body... possibly more if you continue to grow any larger.\" She then looked at Caeda and stated, \"I should be able to take your old dress as inspiration and have your new wedding dress taken care of within a few days tops, and I'll add a little something to help it withstand your curves in case you grow anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she put her notes away, she then continued, \"Though for now, the best that I can do for a temporary solution is get you a couple of dresses that were used to fit some rather... <i>(ahem)</i> large woman. I can add a few personal adjustments to account for your bust and hips so that you'll have something decent to wear until I have your wedding dress ready for your wedding.\" Caeda gave a light smile at what Oboro was willing to do and replied, \"Thanks Oboro, I'd appreciate it.\" She soon gave the hoshidan seamstress her torn wedding dress and they soon went through the clothing racks with Caeda's huge breasts jiggling about and her hips sashaying around in the most sensual of ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they looked around for through the selection of dresses stored in the backroom...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking through the extra clothing that they had, there were thankfully all sorts of dresses to choose from... though sadly it seemed that a good portion of them would not fit Caeda's generously curvaceous frame at all. Sifting through dress after dress, it looked as though they wouldn't come across anything that would be anywhere remotely close. \"Oh, I was certain that we had such clothing availab- wait a minute,\" Oboro stated as she soon spotted different sets of clothing from the usual that she saw. Upon closer inspection of the dresses, she smiled and said, \"Caeda, I think I've found them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Caeda came up to see, she saw the clothes that Oboro had found. Sure enough the dresses, which came in white, blue, cyan, and magenta and looked subtle yet beautiful, were certainly meant for some <b><i>large</i></b> women in more ways than one. \"I thought as much... now all I need to do is adjust the fabric of these dresses to fit your proportions better. With the notes that I've taken, it shouldn't take me too long to get the first one properly tailored for you.\" Caeda nodded at this as Oboro covered her with a blanket to preserve her modesty and said, \"I'll be right back.\" The Hoshidan seamstress soon took the fancy white dress to the other room to make her modifications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>~28 Minutes Later~</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all done with the first dress.\" Oboro called out to Caeda as she came out with the readjusted dress, \"Here's your first temporary dress. Try it on and see if it fits.\" Caeda took the dress with care and then went and put it on. While a little difficult at first to get on, once she did, she was amazed by how well the white dress to fit her generous curves snugly. Oboro then stated as Caeda was looking over herself, \"I had to make adjustments so that it could fit around your trim waist and still fit around your generous breasts and hips.\" It was quite evident of the effort that the seamstress had undergone to get the dress to work. Having just over a fifty inch difference between her underbust and full breast size showed just how big Caeda's breasts were. They would've hung down close to her navel if not for the fact that their sheer perkiness allowed them to stick out almost several good inches away from herself. Caeda adjusted the top part of her dress and noted that felt both loose and yet snug around her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaeda gave Oboro a look that held a question and the seamstress then stated, \"I had to adjust the dress so that in case you grew again, the dress could compensate for your growth in case you grow an extra several centimeters or so. I did the same thing to a lesser extent for the bottom part of your dress in case your hips grow out any more as well.\" Caeda brought her hand to her mouth in awe as she said, \"That's amazing Oboro.\" She then brought her hands to her breasts which were practically the size of fully ripened melons and carefully felt the soft fabric that held them in place. For reasons she couldn't think of, she was beginning to adore their new size. A thought came to Caeda as she then asked, \"Will the owners be alright with me taking dresses like this? Won't I have to pay for them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOboro gave a light smile as she said, \"Most likely, but I have a feeling that they'll be lenient with the prices given the urgency of your situation. They happen to be very understandable of stuff like this. Plus, they've been helping out the Order of Heroes in recent months and since I've been helping out as thanks, they tend to give us a discount.\" This had Caeda feel at ease from this fact. \"Anyway, I'll get the other three dresses made for you shortly, and then I'll make sure your wedding dress is perfect. Though if you happen to grow any more, don't be afraid to come back and let me know immediately. In case you do grow out more, I'll make the necessary adjustments.\" Caeda nodded at this as the two soon went back to the front of the store where Marth and Takumi were waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing Caeda, Marth and Takumi were thrown for a loop seeing Caeda's new size, as well as how well the dress that Oboro picked out and made looked on her. When asked about her new growth spurt, Oboro admitted that she did her usual thing and forgot about the stipulation that would cause Caeda to grow. Being the kind and understanding person that he was, Marth figured it was an accident and told Oboro not to worry so much about it. However, he couldn't help but compliment Caeda for looking so stunning in her dress. Thankfully, Caeda figured out how to control herself a little giving a light smile as she thanked Marth. It seemed that it was enough to not trigger another growth spurt for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOboro then asked, \"So, when is your wedding going to be held you two?\" Marth then realized that he hadn't yet told his wife-to-be nor anyone else about when the wedding would be held. With this, he replied...</span></div></div>",

The Order of Heroes and Hel's army had fought a long, grueling and bloody fight here not even an hour ago, and now, there were nothing but bodies of the fallen soldiers of the Order of Heroes' and Hel's armies. Loki had an evil smile on her face as she looked at the lifeless corpses on the ground, where a mix of both Heroes and Soldiers lay. She had an idea for these new...creations. R\u00f8kkr's. Giant, evil versions of the Order's precious Heroes that she'd send off to fight. They'd be utterly gigantic, and nearly impossible to take down. She'd use the fallen spirits that carried a grudge in life to create these R\u00f8kkr's, These confused, frustrated and lost souls would be the perfect base for her new creations. With her staff, and a ritual she devised herself, she absorbed several souls and mashed them together into one hostile soul. It glowed blood red in Loki's staff, and she chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe....this will surely be exciting to watch~ I can't wait until the summoner and his little army tries to fight <i>this~</i>\" Loki said, examining the R\u00f8kkr soul she had created. Suddenly, the soul began to shake her staff quite radically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What's happening?\" Loki asked, concerned. This was a new thing she had done, so she wasn't the most experienced at creating R\u00f8kkr's. At least not yet. She extended her staff outwards and fired the soul outwards into the ground several feet away. The soul floated upwards slightly and began shaking wildly. Loki raised an eyebrow in curiosity and confusion. Red mist began to surround the soul, and not long after, it dissipated. However, the soul was gone. What was there instead was...a person's body? The soul had taken physical form, and it became a woman with long blue hair and a white flower patterned outfit. She was standing motionless with her eyes shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh? So <i>that's</i> what it was doing~\" Loki said with a smirk. \"Hmm....I think I've seen this person before...Azura I think her name was?\" Loki said to herself. Immediately after Loki said her name, the R\u00f8kkr opened her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\" Azura stayed silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent~\" Loki said to herself. She began to walk forward towards Azura, and she grimaced creating a Sapphire Lance out of the same red mist that made her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S\u0334\u0357\u0319t\u0336\u0307\u0328a\u0337\u0300\u0322y\u0336\u0342\u034e.\u0334\u0309\u032b.\u0335\u0343\u0319.\u0336\u0342\u0317b\u0335\u034c\u0323a\u0336\u0360\u0328c\u0334\u0344\u032fk \u0335\u0310\u0316.\u0336\u0310\u0353.\u0335\u0300\u0329.\u0338\u0315\u0359\" Azura said.

To rot away alongside everyone else.\" She said, extending her arm to show Azura the wasteland of corpses. \"But I brought you back. I was able to help you <i>cheat death</i>.\" Loki said with a devious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......\" Azura stayed silent, looking at the corpses scattered along the battlefield. Loki decided to use this opportunity to get inside her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you've seen what they've done to you...don't you want revenge?

The frustrated and confused amalgamation of souls that became the base for R\u00f8kkr Azura wanted revenge on the Order of Heroes for abandoning them. Even if they all now thought and acted as one entity, Azura felt the combined resentment of all of them. She looked down at the comparatively small Loki with a fuming look on her face. Loki giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry my creation~ You'll have your revenge soon enough.

Loki chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go! Destroy them! Make them regret the day they left you for dead!\" Loki said with an evil smirk. Azura nodded and angrily stormed off towards the Order of Heroes' castle to begin her rampage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair! You're cheating!\" Mia said with an upset expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaat? C'mon, would a guy like me cheat at something like this?\" Joshua said while flipping a coin with his thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's either dumb luck or cheating kid, and you seem to have a <i>lot</i> of luck.\" Saber said, keeping his good eye on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty as charged.\" Joshua shrugged with a smirk. \"Hey old timer, what's the sights like out there?\" Joshua called out towards the window. The veteran knight known as Jagen walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kindly ask you to refrain from calling me an 'old timer'. And to answer your question, nothing of interest to report so far.\" Jagen responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, why don't you take a break and we'll play cards? Maybe we'll have a little wager.\" Joshua said with a grin. Jagen smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know your type. I'll have you know I know my way around your little card game.\" Jagen responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Prove it old timer.\" Joshua said, locking eyes with the Altean knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Mia, I believe it's your turn on lookout duty.\" Jagen said, sitting down while not breaking the intense staredown with Joshua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'll go right now!\" Mia said, excited as ever. Even something as simple as lookout duty she does with a smile on her face. She leaves the room to the lookout post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch and learn old timer.\" Joshua said. Saber dealt the cards and they began their game. However, before they could finish the first hand, the room shook softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err..\" Saber said, looking around. \"You guys felt that right?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...this better not be one of your tricks.\" Jagen said, looking at Joshua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For once, it's not.\" Joshua responded. They heard a loud scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GODS!\" The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia...? What's happening?!\" Jagen asked, getting up. Mia ran back into the room with a terrified expression on her face, and all of the color and excitement from her demeanor was replaced with terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got a BIG problem...!\" Mia said, panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are we being attacked by Hel's forces?!\" Jagen asked. Mia couldn't even respond, and shook her head. She pointed outside, and the three men walked outside, only to have a chill flow down their spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Azura...?!\" Saber said. True to word, the 30 foot Azura was on her way to the castle, and could be seen rapidly approaching. If her expression was anything to go by, she wasn't going to be friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she get so...big?!\" Joshua asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure, but we have to sound the alarm! Inform Prince Alfonse and Commander Anna immediately!\" Jagen said, his experience allowing him to act in a time of crisis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura had the castle in her sights. The travel to the castle wasn't long, especially at her size, and her anger hadn't dissipated at all since her growth. Once she finally saw the castle, she sped up in order to get her revenge sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T\u0335\u0308\u0324h\u0338\u030f\u032ee\u0335\u0341\u0353r\u0336\u0352\u0317e\u0336\u034a\u0320 \u0338t\u0336\u030d\u0324h\u0335\u035d\u0356e\u0337\u0312\u0348y\u0338\u0307\u032b \u0334\u0313\u0349a\u0338\u035dr\u0338e\u0334\u030e\u032b.\u0338\u0346\u0329.\u0337\u033f\u034d.\u0338\u0344\u032c\" She said to herself. With each step she took towards the castle, the tremors felt by the Order of Heroes grew stronger. She toppled over trees and destroyed the forest to make a path for herself, and didn't care in the slightest the destruction she was causing. Loki watched from a safe distance, not wanting to get too close so she isn't noticed by the Order of Heroes, and isn't caught in the middle of Azura's rampage. She rubbed her hands together in anticipation with a wicked grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for the show to begin~\" She said evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Azura reached one of the castle walls, she used her strength to completely topple the wall, and walked into one of the castle courtyards. People began screaming at this point, and Heroes and servants alike scattered. The angry look on Azura's face grew more intense, as the various souls within her became more restless seeing their old \"comrades\" again. Azura lifted her foot and slammed it down, crushing two servants under it into a bloody mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u0334\u0306\u0330'\u0338\u0344\u0355l\u0335\u0304\u0323l\u0335\u0313\u0322 \u0336\u0352\u033ck\u0337\u0303\u031fi\u0337\u0310\u034el\u0336\u0344\u032dl\u0336\u034c\u0319 \u0338\u0302\u0359y\u0336\u0352\u034eo\u0336\u0340\u031cu\u0338\u030d\u031e.\u0334\u0358\u034d.\u0336\u0352\u035a.\u0335\u035b\u0353I\u0334\u0302\u031f'\u0337\u0342\u031fL\u0335\u0343\u0355L\u0334\u0303\u0353 \u0337\u0360\u0320K\u0338\u033e\u0359I\u0334\u0346\u0348L\u0334\u031a\u0347L\u0337\u030b\u032a \u0335\u034c\u0329Y\u0336\u034c\u0324O\u0338\u0309\u0320U\u0336\u034c\u0349 \u0338\u0351\u032dA\u0338\u0360\u0355L\u0335\u0343\u033bL\u0338\u034a\u0326!\u0337\u030c\u0354\" Azura yelled. She used her strength to topple another internal wall, and began to walk deeper into the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince of Askr and the Legendary Summoner Kiran looked at Azura from across the castle with worried looks on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to Azura...?\" Kiran said with a dropped jaw. They watched as several Heroes tried to fire arrows and magic at the R\u00f8kkr, but their arrows simply bounced off of her or she absorbed their magical blasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not me.\" A voice said from behind. The two's eyes widened and looked behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azura?!\" They both said. She nodded, and Anna walked out from behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not her. I don't know what that <i>thing</i> is, but it's destroying the castle! We need to take her down!\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" Kiran asked, looking back at the carnage across from them. \"The Heroes' weapons aren't affecting her!\" Anna grimaced, knowing this was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to use our Magic Orbs! If we can concentrate all of our turrets on the giant Azura, we may be able to stop her!\" Alfonse said. Anna nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get on that.\" Anna said, rushing down the hall. Azura looked in terror at the destruction that \"she\" was causing. The expression on her evil self's face was one she didn't even know she was capable of making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention all Heroes! We need all hands on the castles Magic Orbs immediately! This is not a drill! Everybody concentrate fire on the giant Azura!\" Anna said through her voice-amplification device. The R\u00f8kkr Azura heard Anna and turned around, eagle-eyeing Anna from across the castle, and decided to make her way towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C\u0335\u031a\u031co\u0335\u0311\u0331m\u0335\u0350\u0333m\u0336\u0358\u0326a\u0334\u033e\u0320n\u0337\u0304\u0323d\u0335\u030d\u0322e\u0335\u0304\u0321r\u0335\u030c\u0332 \u0336\u033d\u034eA\u0337\u0308\u0339n\u0337\u034b\u0323n\u0337\u0340\u035ca\u0334\u0312\u031d.\u0336\u0300\u031c.\u0337\u0314\u0323.\u0338\u030a\u0327\" Azura said, striking fear into Anna's heart. Anna backed up in fear of the approaching Azura, and yelled another order through her voice amplification device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heroes..! Where are those Magic Orbs...?!\" She said, panicking. Sure enough, Linde, Leo, Mae and Tharja were seen manning four Magic Orb turrets aimed at Azura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!? FIRE!\" Leo yelled, and the four mages fired a hefty blast of magic simultaneously towards Azura. Azura turned around and saw the four blasts coming straight for her. There was no way she could get out of the way in time, and the blasts strike her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo the simultaneous blasts work on Azura?</span></div></div>",

Shaking her head of odd thoughts she blushed a bit as she explored the forest unknown to her already falling victim to a certain stones power. As she explored she spotted a soft pinkish glow deciding to investigate it she unknowingly came closer and closer to the stone.

As she approached it she soon spotted a rose colored stone almost like her beast stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntranced by the glow she never noticed how her body seemed to react the closer she got to the stone in question her body heated up stronger than before as her breasts seemingly felt tighter in her bra and shirt. Velouria blushed she felt hot and her clothes felt tight as she unconsciously pulled on her shirt due to her swelling breasts. Not only that she felt hot and a need burned deeply in her chest. \"P-pretty\" She said softly as she picked up the stone clutching deeply to her chest as she hugged to her bosom. Her breasts due to the close presence of the stone swelled larger and larger causing a button to fly off her white shirt followed by another one and another one. Revealing her black bra peaking through the the white shirt. As she looked at the stone Velouria became entranced it was so pretty it was definitely one of her treasures now. \"M-maybe i should show Selkie or the others?\" She thought to herself as she looked at the stone though another part of her wanted nothing more than to hoard it for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wanted none of that though she wanted to rest her body felt oddly lethargic since last night and it was driving her insane. Dismissing Hubert claiming she would look into as she bade him goodbye as she entered her room closing the door on his face as she locked it shut. Leaving no room for a rebuttal from her worried aide and vassal despite the insistent knocking on her door. \"Hubert if you will leave so I can retire for the day I am drained from the recent excursion,\" She said as calmly as she could. Thankfully the knocking stopped as Hubert left with his usual as you will. \"Finally peace and quiet\" She muttered to herself as she collapsed on her bed an overly plush bear resided on her bed wearing adrestian style armor a gift from her professor. Her body felt oddly heavy as she laid there not really sure what exactly was going on. \"I should visit the professor tomorrow she should know,\" Edelgard said to herself in promise as she slowly dozed off to sleep. Unknown to Edelgard her two crests were glowing brightly as she slept their power coursing through sending waves of hormones through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard didn't notice but as she slept breasts were swelling as her burgeoning breasts pushed against her bra more and more. Her white shirt was being pushed by her growing breasts. As the shirt started to flatten against her growing breasts before the buttons started to strain itself before stopping. Her hips were slightly wider as her panties tightened on her growing rear which was already pretty gifted only grew larger. As Edelgard slept soundly her body only grew larger her curves grew as her dreams began taking on a more lewd tone as well as she found herself dreaming of the professor as she slowly stripped out of her tight black outfit in front of her.

Hubert had just left her room to 'deal with someone'. Edelgard did not remember whom though. Her mind was somewhere else. A few months ago, she was saved by a young mercenary. Through some events, that she didn't understand herself, this young woman became the new Professor for the Black Eagles House gere at the monestary. Edelgard developed a kind of 'obsession' with her new professor. Before, she didn't even know she could feel like this for anyone, let alone for a woman, but now she knew. She wanted to spend the rest of her life with her. But she was a teacher. How would she get Byleth to notice her feelings?She spend so much time with the other girls in the monestary too. Every time she saw her talk to Bernadetta or Dorothea, Edelgard felt this burning jealousy inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her quest to win over her teachers heart, the leader of the Black Eagles stumbled upon something. Seteth's secret library, filled with the works he deemed 'inappropriate' for the library the students (and his sister Flayn) had access to. When she sent Hubert to get some interesting books for her, he brought her a small selection every night. It still took several weeks for Edelgard to find, what she had hoped to discover. A tome. On the cover it said 'A guide to the sensual arts'. This was exactly what she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had hidden the book in her room, and took lessons in dark magic from her professor (the extra time spent with her being a bonus), and now she felt she was ready. She took the tome out of its giding place and opened chapter 27: 'Transformation of the body'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe concentrated on her chest area and spoke the words. A sensation went from her brain, through her arm into her hand. Like electricity. Then her chest started to feel warmer. A pleasure like she never felt before was building up inside her ribcage. Her nipples went hard as diamonds, when she first felt her breasts move outward. <br>\r\nSlowly but surely they increased in size. Her B-Cup bra getting tighter, the pleasure getting more intense the harder her nipples got. Her jacket slowly revealing her midriff while getting tighter around her breasts, her bra cutting into her shoulders while her swelling boobs were overflowing the cups. She already surpassed everyone at the monetary, when her bra finally snapped. The buttons on her jacket were strained, and her midriff exposed. Her breasts had to be at least F-Cups by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pop* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first button went flying<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pop* *Pop*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others followed shortly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgards boobs were easily the size of her head by now, unable to be contained by anything the heiress had at her disposal. The sensation of the air on her now much more sensitive nipples almost bringing her over the edge. Her unused hand finding its way to her dripping wet womanhood, she started to masturbate while fantasizing about Byleth. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Garreg Mach Monastery, home of the Fodlan-renowned Officers Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocated slap-bang in the centre of Fodlan, it received visitors from all parts of Fodlan. The Adrestian Empire, the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus and the Leicester Alliance all relied on the monastery for trade and, rarely, a place where they could sort out any matters between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet the potential for war was the furthest thing from Hilda's mind as she strolled through the market, prized pink pigtails bouncing and swaying in the wind as she did so. Humming a pleasant tune to herself, her eyes darted from stall to stall, searching for... something. What it was, she didn't quite know yet. All she knew was her brother had sent her a bit of money for her birthday and she planned to spend it on her own hobbies, rather than hand it over to her Professor and have it spent on a new axe or something violent like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But what to buy?\" Hilda mused as she reached the end of the first street. \"So many accessories and components to choose from... Picking just one is going to be impossible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the locations of a few stalls with intriguing bits and pieces remembered, Hilda started down the adjacent street, eyes continuing to dart from left to right as she eagerly searched for something inspiring. With all the training she was being forced to do recently, her hobby of crafting accessories had ground to a halt, much to her annoyance. But with the Garreg Mach Ball coming up in a couple of months, she desperately needed something new, be it bought or crafted by herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hold there, young lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a man's booming voice cut across the din of the market, Hilda came to a stop and looked towards the source. Finding herself looking at a man standing next to a cart with the Adrestian Flag flying from it, she narrowed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Can I help you, sir?\" Hilda asked, folding her arms over her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mayhaps, young one, mayhaps...\" The man responded, stepping closer to her. \"You look like you're looking for something very particular. And without knowing what it is, I guarantee you I've got it! So why not have a look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly creeper out by his method of attracting her attention, Hilda was tempted to ignore him and move on. But then, she shrugged. What harm would there be in taking a look? Worst case, he had nothing for her. But best case, she found the cutest accessory known to mankind. Stepping around to the back of his cart, she peered into it, trying her best to ignore the salesman hovering over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wow, so messy!\" Hilda exclaimed, finding herself looking into a pile of stuff carelessly chucked into a cart. \"But, hold on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into the pile of junk, taking care to avoid the weapons that were scattered throughout, she grabbed a leather bound book and pulled it free, almost causing an avalanche of various ores and other books. Leaving the cart owner to deal with it, she inspected the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A DIY Accessory Book...\" She mumbled, flicking to a random page. As she did, her pink eyes lit up excitedly. \"Oh my Goddess! That's super pretty! And this one as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly turning to the owner, who had managed to right his mountain of junk, Hilda held the book up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How much?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmm... For you, my dear, a mere three hundred gold,\" He replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought about it, Hilda dropped the gold into his hand and, goal achieved, rushed back to the Monastery...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright! Let's have a proper look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the book on her desk, Hilda eagerly began to flick through it, looking at a few accessories that caught her eyes. Eventually, she reached a golden brooch with a vibrant pink stone, not unlike her eye colour, set into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, super cute...\" She said to herself, scanning the instructions. \"And I've got everything to make it right now! Wait... Requires a magical touch? What the heck does that even mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it for a moment, she shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whatever!\" She exclaimed, grabbing her box of components. \"I'll just have Lysithea do her thing on it! Now, begin with the golden inset...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda quickly lost track of time as she went about her work. But eventually, she was done. Well, almost. Lifting her creation into the light, she ran a critical eye over it, looking for any mistakes she might have made. Spotting none, she nodded and, brooch in hand, headed for her door. If she knew Lysithea, and she liked to think she did, she'd be in the library, studying Crests again. For some weird reason, the white-haired girl adored studying them, yet never explained why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her to the library, Hilda arrived a little later than she had expected. Initially, she was avoiding the Professor, who was out on one of their hunts to have students eat with them, but then she almost ran into Seteth, who was just as eager to discuss her work, or lack of, with her. Thankfully, she managed to avoid both and made it to the library, just in time to catch Lysithea leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lysithea!\" Hilda called out happily, earning her an irate '<i>Shush!</i>' from a nearby monk. \"Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hilda,\" Lysithea replied curtly. \"Can I help you with something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure can!\" Hilda responded, showing her the brooch. \"I need you to cast a bit of magic on this for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea eyed the ornament before looking up at Hilda with confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You want me... to enchant a bit of jewellery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda nodded happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um... Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Because the instructions said so, silly!\" Hilda laughed. \"Now, come on! Do your thing! Cast that magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea let out a sigh before holding out a petite hand. Gently setting the brooch in her palm, Hilda stepped back and let the unusually powerful girl imbue it with magic, which took but a second with Lysithea. As she took the brooch back, she noted the gem now had a bright glow to it, which caused the gold to glimmer beautifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks, Lysithea!\" Hilda said cheerfully, turning her back on the small girl. \"If you ever need me for anything, I'm your girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, right...\" She heard Lysithea mumble as she made her way back towards her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter avoiding the Professor, who was now looking for axe wielders for the Inter-House Tournament, Seteth and Claude, who seemed eager to discuss something with her, Hilda ended up back in her room, standing in front of her mirror. Holding her brooch up, she held in front of her outfit, trying to determine the best place she could put it. Eventually, she settled on a spot just over her left breast, which was a bit of a struggle considering the size of her bust and the tightness of her dress. But once it was attached, she smiled at her reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Looks perfect!\" She enthused, straightening her new decoration... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pleased with her new accessory, Hilda spun on her heel to face her door. So far today, she had been avoiding almost everybody, unless they could help her with construction. But now, despite the somewhat later hour it was, she wanted to get out there and show off her new accessory. She wanted the Professor to notice it, to comment on it and say '<i>Good job!</i>'. She wanted Seteth to see it and realise that maybe she did do work after all, as long as it benefited her somehow. And who knows, maybe somebody would ask her to make something for them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, I bet Marianne would look awesome with a golden hairclip!\" Hilda enthused, starting towards her door. \"Or maybe something for Lysithea? I do need to thank her for her magic touch... And Leonie! I could make something to replace that rather ugly necklace Captain Jeralt made her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hilda left her room, she stopped talking aloud about all the ideas she had, but continued to imagine them. Perhaps a golden ring with a deer etched onto it for Claude, a decorative button for Raphael that would be both nice to look at and functional. Lorenz would get something to replace that hideous flower he had attached to his uniform and Ignatz... She didn't quite know yet. But she was sure she'd find something for him in her new book!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the second floor, still deep in thought, she was passing the greenhouse when she heard a few voices from within. Peeking through th door, Hilda spotted Professor Manuela and Dorothea talking, though about what, she couldn't figure out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a great opportunity!</i> Hilda thought excitedly. <i>Both of them were part of that Adrestian Opera Company, meaning they're bound to know all about super pretty accessories! Lets see what they think of mine...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Professor Manuela! Dorothea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically skipping into the greenhouse, Hilda smiled at them in turn. Their conversation came to a halt as both turned to look at Hilda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hilda,\" Dorothea greeted her warily, which she expected, seeing as Dorothea was from the Black Eagle house. While inter-house relations were encouraged by the faculty, very few students actually partook in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Miss Valentine, is there an issue?\" Manuela asked, not quite so cautious of the pink haired girl. Being a Professor, she had to be ready to assist any students, not just those of her own house. But even so, Manuela tended to favour the Black Eagles, which was her house, over others. The only one that didn't show favouritism was Professor Hanneman, leader of the Blue Lions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nope, no issue!\" Hilda giggled excitedly. \"But I'd like to ask the two of you a question... What do think of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFraming her brooch with both hands, she watched eagerly as both woman turned their eyes to it. For a worrying moment, they showed no reaction to it but, thankfully, Dorothea stepped forwards for a closer look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's beautiful...\" She murmured, lightly poking the glowing gem. \"Where in Garreg Mach did you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I made it!\" Hilda replied proudly. \"So, it's kinda one-of-a-kind at the minute! But, if you really want one, I guess I could make another...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea let out an excited '<i>Oh!</i>', while behind her, Manuela nodded slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Truly great design and construction, Miss Valentine,\" She said, joining Dorothea for a closer look. \"While yours is unique in that it glows, I have seen a few like it while I was a performer. They were all mass-constructed, of course, not as striking as yours is. But if you are accepting orders, as it were... Well, I could use a new brooch myself! But another time. Edelgard wished to have a word with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her, Dorothea nodded, sighing as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I am afraid I must leave as well,\" She said heavily. \"Ferdinand wanted to speak to me about something. No doubt he's still trying to figure out my riddle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, both woman left the greenhouse, leaving Hilda alone with the Gardener. Glancing down at her brooch, she grinned and readjusted it. As she did so, however, she noted that it was a bit more difficult to do. Her dress seemed a tad tighter around her bust, making adjusting it a little harder. But she eventually got it and, pleased with her appearance, started for her next location; the Dining Hall...</span></div></div>",

After a moment of awkward silence, during which both women just stared at each other, Hilda finally spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H-Hi, Professor!\" She greeted, trying to sound as though she hadn't spent her entire day slacking off. \"I was just on my way to the Dining Hall! I'm super famished after all the work I did today! So if you'll just excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to turn around, Hilda froze when she saw her Professor's eyes narrow suspiciously. Being a woman of very few words, expressions were key with the Professor. And the one she was wearing was rare, except with Hilda. It conveyed clear suspicion, and was one Hilda saw almost anytime she had a conversation with the Professor. Turning back to the Professor, Hilda cleared her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, you see, I was in town for a few hours, looking for some... study materials,\" Hilda lied, slinging her arms behind her back and adopting the most innocent look she could muster. \"I managed to find them, came back to my room and spent the day going through them! I'm just taking a break for dinner, then I'll be heading back\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe received another suspicious glare. After a moment, the Professor's eyes flicked down to the brooch adorning her outfit, at which point the Professor folded her arms across her ample chest. Recognizing this as the advanced stage of suspicion, Hilda's mind raced to come up with something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"O-Oh, this old thing?\" Hilda asked, thumbing the brooch anxiously. \"This was... a gift from my brother! Yeah! The gem is from Almyra, you see, and he knows I like jewellery. So he had this made with it! Um... Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor cast a suspicious glance at her face before taking a second look at her brooch. Reaching out a slender finger, she lightly tapped the gem before glancing at her face and nodding. Hilda exhaled slightly, relaxing her body which she didn't even know had tensed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks, Professor,\" Hilda said with a grateful smile. \"If you want, I can see about making one for you! Err, I mean... Getting one for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda received another suspicious glare before the Professor straightened up and held a hand out. Looking at her palm, Hilda cocked a confused eyebrow. The Professor let out a silent sigh before gesturing at the brooch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, you want to see it?\" Hilda asked, gently unpinning it from her outfit and dropping it into her hand. \"Just be careful with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the Professor inspected the brooch closely, poking it lightly before flipping it over and looking at the back. Before handing it back to Hilda, she held it over her own chest, smiled gently and then handed it back. Nodding farewell, her Professor marched off, leaving a relieved Hilda alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, that was certainly scary...\" Hilda breathed, reattaching her beloved pin to her dress. \"For a second, I thought she was going to make me do work or something! Or worse, she didn't like it! Anyway, time for something to eat! Hope they've got fish saute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited for food, Hilda made her way into the Dining Hall, unaware that the gem was glowing more brightly, radiating a gentle heat that filled her chest... </span></div></div>",

You're looking cute today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the ginger-haired womanizer, Hilda briefly considered brushing his attempt at flirting off, but quickly decided against it.

Assuming it stemmed from pride at having her accessory noticed, she giggled and framed it with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This?\" She asked. \"I made this! Spent a few hours earlier putting it together! Glad you like it so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Like?\" Sylvain said. \"I'd go so far as to say I love it! The way it glows in the sunlight, how the gem matches your eyes and hair... It's perfect for you. A lovely bit of jewellery for a lovely woman\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her earlier thoughts of rejection, Hilda couldn't help but blush. As she felt her cheeks flush red, her chest swelled with what she thought was happiness and pride. A few seconds later, however, she realised that it wasn't so. Over the din of the Dining Hall and Sylvain's continuing comments, she heard the creak of leather and the almost inaudible *<i>ping</i>* of a button breaking off. Glancing behind her, she looked for Raphael, who was the usual culprit for broken buttons and stretched leather. Instead, she found herself staring at the back of Dedue's head. That was when she looked down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my... M-My chest!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda's hand almost flew to her chest, which was visibly swelling before her very eyes, when she realised where she was. Managing to restrain herself, she was about to leave the queue to sprint back to her room when -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Garreg Mach Meat Pie or Two-Fish Saute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda stared at the server behind the counter for a few moments, causing them to repeat the question. When she realised they were asking her what she wanted to eat, she managed to stammer something about a fish, resulting in a plate with a pristine white fish sitting on it shoved into her hands. Taking her meal, Hilda ignored her usual table, which had a few Golden Deer members sat around it, as well as Sylvain's friendly wave to join him at his table and made for an empty one in the corner. Taking a seat, she nervously glanced around before turning her attention to her chest which, thankfully, had stopped its abrupt growth. Lightly cupping each breast, Hilda estimated that, by the tightness of her bra and the tightness of both her cotton underdress and leather overtop, she had gone up by at least a cup size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But why?</i> She wondered, lifting her fork and digging into her meal. <i>Why did my chest start growing all of a sudden? Magic? Sudden growth spurt? Hmmm... Maybe I should ask Professor Manuela...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sitting alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain dropped into the bench opposite her. Leaning forwards, he flashed Hilda one of his signature sly grins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Any table would kill to have a beauty like you sitting at it,\" He continued. \"And yet you sit by yourself. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda let out a nervous laugh before shovelling around half her meal into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Bothin!\" She replied through a full mouth. \"I mem... Nothing! Just wanted some time away from the Golden Deer. Claude's being... Claude and Lorenz is being annoying... You know how it is, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain nodded, an understanding smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That I do. You know, just the other day, Ingrid was telling me -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sylvain could launch into his story, Hilda had shovelled the last of her dinner into her mouth and jumped to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hate to leave you, Sylvain, but I just remembered...\" Hilda struggled for a moment, trying to come up with a viable excuse. \"That the Professor is... checking our rooms soon! If you'll excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her back on Sylvain, Hilda rushed towards the exit of the Dining Hall...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In her rush to leave, Hilda completely forgot about a certain table that was populated entirely with people she didn't really want to see at the moment, but who hadn't seen her all day. As she drew level with said table, she froze as she heard a voice cut across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yo, Hilda! What's the big rush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Hilda turned to the speaker, forcing a nervous smile onto her face. Claude, the leader of the Golden Deer House and the grandson of Duke Riegan, the leader of the entire Leicester Alliance, grinned back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"C-Claude,\" Hilda stammered, a hand travelling to her brooch and fingering it anxiously. \"I was just on the way back to my room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But sure we all agreed we'd take the day to relax and, in the evening, get together as a house and discuss a few things,\" Claude reminded her, lifting a glass filled with water and taking a sip. \"We may be students, but it doesn't mean we can't ignore the Alliance. And as one of the more important nobles, we kinda need you there\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A-Ah, yeah, I suppose that's true...\" Hilda mumbled in response, rubbing the back of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Great!\" Claude said as he got to his feet, the rest of the Golden Deer copying him. \"Then let's head to the classroom. Should be empty, unless Teach is putting together their lesson plan for the week\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no viable excuses coming to mind, and the truth completely unbelievable, Hilda begrudgingly followed Claude and the rest of her classmates out of the Hall and towards the Deer Classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the classroom, the first thing the class spotted was a familiar figure, draped in black, hunched over a desk at the front of the room. As they filtered in, their Professor looked up and locked eyes with Claude, who shot her a friendly wave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, Teach!\" He called out. \"Hope you don't mind us using the classroom for talking about stuff in the Alliance. We'll be quiet, promise\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor nodded and returned to her notes, allowing the Golden Deer to rearrange a few desks to form a sort of round table, around which they arranged themselves in rough order of importance. Claude and Lorenz had a brief argument over who got a single bench to themselves, but after Lysithea threatened to hit them both with a Fireball, they quickly agreed that Claude should get it. Hilda sat on his right, while Lorenz sat next to her. Stuck between two guys wasn't an ideal location for her and her... new chest... but she had to make it work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, Deers!\" Claude cleared his throat and leaned forwards. \"Loads of fun stuff has been happening in the Alliance and, as the future leaders, it would do us good to know a bit about what's going on. So, Lorenz, how's Gloucester Territory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorenz sniffed dismissively before also leaning forwards. As he began to give his report, which involved something about bandits and the Great Bridge of Myrddin, Hilda zoned out. The Bridge was miles from her own territory, plus she had a slightly more pressing issue to figure out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They don't just grow bigger over the course of a day!</i> Hilda thought, casting a subtle look downwards. Her bigger bust filled her view, almost entirely obscuring her lap. Leaning back, she was nearly off the bench when her lap finally reappeared. Returning to a position that didn't make her look suspicious, Hilda hummed in thought. <i>Unless I've just been really oblivious lately... Or I've been putting on weight! Have I been eating too much?! Maybe the Professor had a point when she said I should train a bit more...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...And how about Fodlan's Locket? Hilda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda jumped as a hand rested on her shoulder. Looking over at Claude, she blinked, trying to remember what her brother had told her recently. Something about an attack? No, a scouting party...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um, yeah!\" Hilda said with a smile. \"A band of Almyran's attacked recently, but nothing to worry about! My brother chased them off before they came anywhere near the Locket!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude nodded, while Lorenz clapped slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, well!\" He commented. \"Seems she remembered something about her own territory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Knock it off, Lorenz,\" Claude told him. \"But yeah, good job, Hilda. The Locket's an important part of the Alliance. We're lucky to have Lord Holst looking after it. Now, Raphael and Ignatz! What's the word on trade routes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer time in the spotlight over, Hilda relaxed slightly. However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...Where'd you get it?\" Hilda heard Raphael ask. \"I wanted to get one for my sister. I'm sure she'd love something that pretty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the compliment reached her ears, Hilda felt warmth fill her chest again. Eye wide, she glanced downwards towards her chest. Spotting her chest swelling, she suddenly stood up, startling everyone at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hilda?\" Claude asked, looking up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um... Please excuse me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda started for the door. As she reached it, however, she found a woman standing in front of it, eyes narrowed suspiciously. Hilda ignored her Professor's stern gaze, however, and pushed past her. As soon as she was out of sight of the classroom, she broke into a desperate sprint a d headed for her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming her door shut behind her, Hilda quickly locked it. Taking a moment to catch her breath after her sudden sprint, she looked down at her chest. However, her outfit did a good job of masking the size of her chest, so she quickly stripped down to her underwear and stood in front of her mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>O-M-G!</i> Hilda thought in disbelief, cupping each breast. <i>They're like the size of watermelons! As firm as one as well... But seriously, what's causing this to happen?  </i></span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a few moments, Hilda stared at her reflection and lightly bounced her new breasts. She had always been on the busty side, much to the jealousy of almost every girl in the Academy. And now, if she wasn't the one sporting them, even she'd be slightly jealous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...\" Hilda giggled quietly, prodding a finger into one of her soft breasts. \"So soft... W-Wait! I need to figure this out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her back on her reflection, Hilda quickly redressed herself... Or tried to, anyway. After loosening her bra and releasing some of the pressure on her chest, she scooped up her shirt. Pulling it on, a grunt soon escaped her mouth as she tried her hardest to button up the white garment, but neither her shirt nor her breasts were allowing it. Eventually, she gave up and left the top three buttons undone, leaving her deep, pale cleavage on view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came her leather overtop, which was an even more difficult job. While her shirt, being made of fabric, gave her a little space to work with, the overtop outright refused to fit over her chest. After a brief and ultimately futile struggle, Hilda gave up on it, chucking it onto her bed and grabbing the rest of her outfit. As she pulled her boots on, she jumped to her feet, breasts bouncing lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Hilda hummed, returning to her mirror to inspect her new look. \"Not bad, but I do miss that top. Aw, well, some things just can't be helped! Anyway, should really start researching this. Maybe the library'll have some answers for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading for her door, Hilda froze, her hand on the handle. Turning back, she remembered her brooch, which was still attached to her overtop. Grabbing it from the crumpled garment, she attached it to her shirt and, outfit now complete, left her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! Finally made it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriding into the library, Hilda let out an exhausted sigh. Her earlier luck at dodging people had, unfortunately, run out, meaning everybody she had been hoping to avoid had just so happened to bump into her. As soon as she had left her room, Lysithea had appeared. However, the youngest Deer had faltered instantly as she found herself mesmerized by Hilda's bust. Before she could ask about it, however, Hilda had rushed off, leaving a very confused Lysithea standing outside her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter escaping from Lysithea and making sure the young mage hadn't followed her, Hilda choose to move through the Entrance Hall, where she hoped only Gatekeeper would be at, rather than move past the classrooms or the downstairs living quarters, where the chances of running into another student or professor were high. She reached the Entrance Hall without issue and, after ducking past Gatekeeper who was delivering a report to somebody, started up the staircase. Rather annoyingly, Seteth appeared as she was partway and dragged her into a conversation about her many '<i>illnesses</i>' designed to get her out of her assigned duties. She managed to bumble her way through their chat and, after a parting compliment on her brooch, Seteth vanished off in the direction of the Chapel. Unwilling to follow him, she hung around the Entrance Hall for a few minutes before resuming her journey, hoping to run into nobody else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Hilda's hopes were dashed as, while she was skulking through the Main Hall, she was spotted by the Professor who, due to her silent nature, didn't really question Hilda about why she was sneaking through the halls, but instead asked if she wouldn't mind paying more attention to how she wielded axes and wore heavy armour. Hilda nodded before rushing off, the brief thought of how she was meant to actually fit into a suit of armour passing through her head. Thankfully, the remainder of her journey was free from people, aside from a few Priests and Monks that didn't cast her a second glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, let's see what we've got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began browsing the bookshelves pertaining to magic, she noted that, at some point during her trip to the library, her bust had swollen yet again. The fourth button on her shirt was now straining, allowing a bit of pale flesh to bulge through. Doing her best to ignore it, Hilda sped up , determined to find something that would help her before her enhanced bust became too much for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"These books... might help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a few books at random, Hilda made for an empty table. Not having a grasp on basic magical theory made her job that much harder, yet if she wanted to figure out what was making her breasts swell at random, she was going to need to put in the work for once in her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Utilising magic to improve your appearance... Sounds promising!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it quickly turned out, it wasn't promising. All the book provided was information on how to use magic to remove skin blemishes, something Hilda had never suffered from. Pushing it aside, she moved onto the next book...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \"Man, this is soooo boring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda sighed and pushed away yet another promising, but ultimately useless tome. For the past hour or so, she had been stuck in this loop. She'd come across some book that sounded as though it could help her figure out her predicament but, upon reading it, she found that it answered absolutely none of her many questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Guess I'll give up for the day...\" Hilda mumbled, staring at the unruly pile of books laid out in the table before her. \"Don't really want to pull this stuff away... Ah, Lysithea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctant to find the correct places where she'd pulled each book from in order to not upset the new Head Librarian, Hilda had taken to glancing around the Library, searching for someone she could '<i>persuade</i>' to do so in her stead. As she had happened to glance towards the door, a small figure, comparable to that of a child, had strode in. Upon hearing her name, Lysithea's eyes had initially narrowed suspiciously but, upon seeing it was Hilda summoning her, that suspicion melted away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Would you mind doing me a teeny tiny favour?\" Hilda asked as the white-haired girl made her way towards her. \"See, I hurt my back recently and I need to put away all these heavy books! Now, I don't want to make my injury any worse, so could you help me with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hurt your back, huh?\" Lysithea answered, cocking a knowing eyebrow. \"By any chance, would that injury be related to your recent growth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda inhaled sharply, which was a mistake on her part. The fourth button on her shirt tightened immensely before giving way, releasing more of her full breasts to the world and causing Lysithea's eyes to bulge. The young girl stared hungrily at them for a few seconds before looking away, blushing vividly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"S-Sorry...\" She stammered before regaining her composure. \"But I have to know... How'd you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"D-Do what?\" Hilda stammered in response, trying her damnedest to play dumb. Sadly, it didn't work on the girl everyone referred to as a '<i>Prodigy</i>'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come on, Hilda! Your... Um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea looked around before stepping closer to Hilda and lowering her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your chest!\" She whispered before stepping back. \"It's obvious it's grown. Your shirt no longer fits, you aren't wearing your overtop, I heard Sylvain commenting on it and, while the rest of the Golden Deer haven't noticed it, both the Professor and I have noticed it! So, how'd you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda stared at Lysithea in disbelief for a few moments, considering whether or not to make a break for it, but ultimately decided against it. Lysithea knew where she slept and she was more than capable of breaking down her door to get answers. Kicking a seat out for her, Lysithea gratefully accepted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I... I don't know how they're growing!\" Hilda admitted, leaning towards Lysithea and lowering her own voice. \"They just started doing this earlier today! I thought it might be some kind of magic, but the only spell that's really affected me recently was whatever you casted on this thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda fingered her brooch, which still had a warm glow to it. Lysithea stared at it for a few moments, her brow furrowed in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It shouldn't be my spell, I just imbued it with a bit of magic,\" Lysithea told her. \"Plus, body modification magic is both extremely difficult and outlawed by the Church. It's considered heresy to modify the body the Goddess gave you, after all. But I wonder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell silent for a few moments, her eyes flicking rapidly between Hilda's chest, face and brooch. Eventually, she held out a hand and gestured towards the brooch. Hilda stared at her outstretched palm before realising what she was asking. Carefully unpinning her precious ornament, she dropped it into Lysithea's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmm... Craftsmanship is impeccable...\" She murmured to herself, holding it up to her eye. \"And just a hint of neutral magic, nothing that should cause any unwelcome effects...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinning it over her own chest, Lysithea waited for a few moments. When nothing happened, she shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I thought it might be related to the brooch,\" Lysithea admitted, folding her arms. \"But it looks as though my hypothesis was incorrect. Hmm... Perhaps you should raise this issue with Professor Manuela, just in case it becomes dangerous or some such\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, I suppose you're right...\" Hilda responded. \"You know, you look really good with that on! Maybe I should make you one as well... I think you'd look really good with some sort of hairpin. Oh, or perhaps -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"W-Wait, stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda trailed off as the young girl suddenly let out a groan. Her arms, folded across her chest, fell away, revealing two things. One was that the brooch, previously having possessed a rather dim glow, had a much warmer, more noticeable one that seemed to seep into Lysithea's chest, which was the second thing both girls noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce nearly flat, Lysithea's bust had swollen slightly, causing her Academy Attire to tighten across it. Had it been anyone else, the growth would've been nearly unnoticeable. But because it was the flatchested Lysithea, it was certainly noticeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H-How?\" Hilda wondered, while Lysithea raised shaking hands to lightly cup her expanded chest. She poked and proded her new assets for a moment before remembering that she was in a very public place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I... have a theory,\" Lysithea said after an awkward silence. \"I think that my magic is resonating with something else within the brooch and creating energy. However, that energy cannot be stored within the brooch as it's too small, meaning it's transferred to the nearest thing suitable for storage. In this case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off as both girls looked down at their chests. Hilda, pleased that she now had some sort of idea why she was growing, was in two minds about the whole thing but, judging from the expression in Lysithea's face, she had already made her mind up about her situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hang on... But what actually causes the growth?\" Hilda asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That... I'm not totally sure about yet,\" Lysithea admitted. \"But with a little more research, I'm sure I could figure it out!\"</span></div></div>",

But once you figure out what's causing it, I'd like it back! It took some very rare materials to make it, after all\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course,\" Lysithea answered, her hand idly playing with the golden decoration. \"But, can I ask something that might sound weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda nodded, causing the petite teen to sigh heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do you want me to figure out a way to reverse its effects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Reverse its effects? I mean, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda faltered. Reversing the effects meant she lost her bigger bust which, while it had been initially very inconvenient for her, was beginning to grow on her, both literally and figuratively. Did she really want to return her breasts to normal anymore? Or did she want to experiment a little more? After all, she had only made one bit of jewellery from that book. Who knew what the rest could do for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Take some time to think about it,\" Lysithea said, spotting Hilda's indeciveness. \"In the meantime, I'll... Urgh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Lysithea's turn to trail off. However, it wasn't a dilemma she hadn't an answer to that caused her to do so. Rather, it was a feeling that had lived with her for many years suddenly intensifying and filling her entire body with an uncomfortable heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lysithea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda jumped to her feet as Lysithea suddenly went rigid, her mouth falling open in a silent scream. Rushing to her side, Hilda had intended to grab the small girl and take her to the Infirmary but, as soon as she touched Lysithea, a painful shock ran through her body, causing her to recoil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lysithea! Just... Hold on! I'm going to get Professor Manuela!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hilda prepared to leave, she froze as she noticed something about Lysithea. Something a little more noticeable than an enhanced bust. Something the small girl secretly desired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you... taller?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea unfroze, slumping in her seat. Catching her before she slid off her chair and onto the floor, Hilda let out a grunt as she hauled Lysithea to her feet. Throwing an arm around her shoulder, she began dragging her to the Infirmary. As she did so, her earlier question was answered. Lysithea was indeed growing, and not only height-wise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the Golden Deer House, Leonie was the tallest, being around 5'4\", followed by Marianne at 5'3\". Then it was Hilda at five foot dead and, finally, Lysithea at 4'10\". As Hilda dragged Lysithea out of the Library, the two were now equal in height. And that wasn't all. The white-haired girls Academy Jacket creaked quietly as her bust swelled and, unbeknownst to both girls, her narrow hips and thin backside were beginning to swell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Professor Manuela!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the Infirmary, Hilda thumped on the door as best she could with Lysithea slumped against her. After a few more loud thumps with no answer, Manuela finally answered, but not from her own door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Miss Valentine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to face the door behind her, Hilda found herself looking at both Professor Manuela and Professor Hanneman. For a moment, the trio stared awkwardly at one another until Lysithea let out a groan, prompting both Professors into action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What happened?\" Manuela asked, moving forwards to open her office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know! We were just sitting there, talking about... stuff, when she just suddenly froze up! Then, she collapsed!\" Hilda explained, following Manuela into her office. Behind them, Hanneman also followed them in, concern on his aged face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lay her there,\" Manuela ordered, pointing to a bed. Hilda obeyed and, with Hanneman's help, she laid her on the soft bed. The young girl let out a groan, causing Hanneman to kneel next to her and lightly press a hand against her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmmm... I see... But what caused this reaction?\" He muttered to himself. \"They've never acted like this before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um, Professors?\" Hilda piped up. \"Will she be okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Professor answered her immediately, adding to Hilda's growing worry. Standing at the foot of the bed, she inspected Lysithea's body. The small girl could no longer be called '<i>small</i>', as she seemed to be an inch taller than Hilda. Her petite bust had swollen outwards, causing a button on her jacket to ping open, while her skirt seemed to have flared out slightly at the hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Strange...\" Manuela said to herself. \"My magic isn't picking up any anomalies. Yet she's clearly in pain. Hanneman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There seems to be an issue with...\" He trailed off, shooting Manuela a meaningful look. She seemed to pick up on it and nodded. Leaving Hanneman to whatever he was doing, she turned to Hilda and gestured for her to sit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Miss Valentine, I am going to need to know everything,\" Manuela asked, sitting opposite her. \"We can't identify what's happening to Miss Ordelia through magical means, but I'm hoping you can help shed some light on her situation, as well as your own\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda blushed as Manuela glanced at her chest. However, as her nervousness subsided, Hilda was left with a new dilemma. Should she tell Manuela about the brooch? Or should she keep it quiet? Telling her could possibly lead to it getting confiscated, meaning some sort of cure to her growth would never be found...</span></div></div>",

Manuela cocked a curious eyebrow before following her gaze. Noticing this, Hilda hurriedly looked away, finding sudden interest in whatever Hanneman was doing to Lysithea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, Professor Hanneman?\" Hilda spoke up, eager to direct Manuela's attention from her brooch, which still had a slight glow to it. \"Do you know what's wrong with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanneman gave an affirmative grunt, but didn't immediately reply. After running a hand over Lysithea's forehead, he stood and turned to face Manuela, his expression grim yet relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It seems the worst is over,\" He told her, causing Hilda to sign in relief and Manuela to nod. \"However, further research on my part is needed to determine what caused such changes. If you'll excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Hanneman rushed off towards his office. Hilda watched him go until she heard a bang from the opposite side of the hallway, signifying his door slamming shut. After that, there was an awkward silence as the two well-endowed women glanced at one another. Or, perhaps more accurately, at one anothers chests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So, Miss Valentine...\" Manuela broke the silence, clearing her throat meaningfully. \"Is there anything, anything at all, that might have caused this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping her gaze locked firmly on Manuela, Hilda pretended to think for a moment. Tapping her chin, she hummed to herself before shaking her head, pigtails swinging back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nope, nothing at all!\" She replied, forcing some innocence into her otherwise guilty tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see...\" Manuela stood and made her way to Lysithea's side. \"Then in that case, I'll keep Miss Ordelia here for a few days, just in case it happens again. As for you, it's getting late. Best be getting to bed soon\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking that as her cue to leave before Manuela figured something out, Hilda bounced to her feet and started for the door. Partway there, however, she froze, turning back to look at Lysithea's chest, where her brooch was still glowing with a warm light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um, Professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela turned her head slightly to look at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Can I just get my brooch back?\" Hilda asked sweetly. \"Lysithea just wanted to try it on and see if it suited her. We were discussing what would suit her best when all this happened\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReceiving a confirmatory nod from the former songstress, Hilda rushed to Lysithea's side and carefully unpinned her previous ornament. Repinning it over her own chest, she was partway to the door again when Manuela spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It truly is a beautiful piece of jewellery,\" She commented, causing Hilda to stop. \"Perhaps you would consider crafting one for me as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I... Um... Wouldn't mind?\" Hilda responded, feeling a familiar heat fill her chest. The fifth button on her shirt began to strain while her bra began to painfully dig into her massive breasts, causing Hilda to squirm uncomfortably. \"But, um... Goodbye for now, Professor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Hilda rushed from the Infirmary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming her door shut behind her, Hilda collapsed up against it and slowly slid to the floor. Once again, she had had a few unfortunate encounters on the way back to her room. Casper had gotten into a fight right in the middle of the Great Hall, which had attracted a crowd and slowed her down. Then, next to the Fishing Pond, Ignatz had tried stopped her. She stopped for a few moments, listening to him blabber on about paintings or some such, but once she had felt heat radiating through her bust, she rushed off, only to find the Professor standing right outside her room, an unhappy look on their otherwise expressionless face. She didn't say much, as usual, but Hilda got the basic gist of her visit. Don't skip tomorrow's lecture, as she had a certification exam to do. Hilda had nodded and, without saying too much herself, pushed past the Professor to enter her room, bringing her to now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's getting harder and harder to hide these things,\" Hilda groaned, staring at her breasts which were currently wedged between her thighs. \"And if they get any bigger, I'm gonna run out of clothes to fit them! Maybe I should've told Manuela about this thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFingering her brooch, she carefully took it off. Glancing at the glowing metal, a sigh escaped her mouth as she got to her feet and strode over to her desk. Setting her ornament down, she pulled her shirt off, leaving her upper half nearly bare, save for an incredibly stretched bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the days events, her breasts had nearly doubled in size. Cupping a handful of her soft flesh, Hilda spend a moment, giggling happily, as she squeezed and kneaded them. And as she did so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is this all that bad?</i> Hilda thought, a hand idly undoing her bra. Her heavy breasts bounced lightly as the garment fell to the floor. <i>I mean, who would be able to ignore my pleas for help with these? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBouncing her breasts lightly, Hilda's gaze fell upon her desk, where an open book surrounded by various bits of metal and tools sat. Her pink eyes glittered excitedly as an idea came to her. The brooch was only one small part of that book. If it did this to her, what would some of the other things do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's have a quick look, shall we?</i> Hilda thought, striding over to her book...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dropping into her chair, Hilda pushed aside some of her tools and pulled their book closer. It was still open on the page reaching her how to make the brooch which, despite only being this morning, felt like a lifetime ago. So much had happened since then, from countless meetings with classmates and staff, her disastrous meeting with Lysithea and, of course, the growth of her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, what should have scared her just didn't. Any rational person would've headed straight for Professor Manuela after their first growth spurt. Why she didn't, Hilda hadn't a clue. A part of her kinda desired a bigger bust, as it would make persuading men to her chores around the academy much easier. And a part of her hated the idea, as her breasts were already heavy enough. But now that she had them, Hilda loved them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay!\" She chirped, flicking to the front of the book. \"What other totally adorable things can I craft?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it a page at a time, Hilda slowly made her way through the guide, closely scrutinizing every detail of every page. There were some things that intrigued her, as well as things that quickly made her move on. There were cute accessories, and ones that looked like a blind person had designed them. Hairpins, belts, brooches, bracelets, rings, necklaces... The list went on and on. Eventually, she reached the end of the book, letting out a disappointed sigh as she leaned back in her chair. Her disappointment didn't last long, however, as an excited squeal soon burst forth from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So many ideas! I could spend the rest of my academy days in here, just creating cute jewellery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the book, Hilda grabbed a few loose pieces of nearby paper. While most things inside called to her, there were a few pieces that had demanded her attention with their outstanding beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a pair of rings, meant to be worn on opposing hands. They were both golden, however the gems set into them had to be a ruby for the right and a sapphire for the left. Why, Hilda didn't know. All she did know about the rings was that they were super cute. Oh, and that they also required a magical touch, much like the brooch did. Most things in the book did, with a few exceptions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second item was simple, yet Hilda had fallen in love with it as soon as she had seen it. A black leather belt, decorated with an ornate golden belt buckle that had a glittering pink stone set into it. Hilda wasn't known for her love of belts, yet she really wanted this one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, a simple silver necklace with a pendant attached to it. Apparently, the necklace would pick up on the wearers Crest and display it on the pendant, which sounded like a nice gimmick to her. As a bearer of the Minor Crest of Goneril, it would definitely work for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, so many choices!\" Hilda whined, letting out a huff and folding her arms beneath her bust. \"But, I suppose I'll go for...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hilda idly flicked between the three items, unable to decide which one would suit her best. Eventually, she let out a sigh and pulled a scrap of paper towards her. Scribbling the three items down, she then tore the paper into three and dropped them into a nearby pot. Shaking it around for a moment, Hilda set the pot in front of her and, with a deep breath, reached in and pulled out one of the scraps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's... the belt!\" Hilda announced to herself, a hint of disappointment in her voice. While the belt was super cute and would suit her perfectly, she had kinda been hoping for one of the other two. But, she had made her choice and she was going to stick by it. Dropping the pot onto the floor, she flicked to the relevant page and began to gather up her supplies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... The belt is shown as black in the book, but I think it would suit brown a lot more... Or even perhaps a dark blue?\" Hilda mused, inspecting her supplies. After the brooch earlier, her stocks had dwindled slightly, but she should have enough for the belt. Or she hoped, anyway. \"Okay, and the buckle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime flew by for Hilda, who was fully engrossed in her work. Crafting was one of the few things she truly cared for, meaning she put in maximum effort when it came to it. For reasons unknown to her, this seemed to upset various people in her life, such as her brother and her Professor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But once they see this, maybe they'll rethink me!\" Hilda muttered to herself, fingers nimbly attaching the buckle to the rest of the belt. With her belt completed, she carefully lifted it in two hands and inspected her creation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the belt shown in the book used black leather, she had opted for a dark blue leather, which would look slightly better over her black skirt. As for the buckle, she had used the last of her gold to create it, meaning it matched her brooch. The stone set into it glittered dimly, though it hopefully wouldn't stay that way for long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Final step, magic infusion!\" Hilda leaned back in her chair, belt laid out before her and hands subconsciously groping her chest. \"But with Lysithea in the Infirmary... Hmm... I think Marianne is still up. Maybe she'll help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering up the belt, Hilda made for her door. Partway there, however, she remembered that, currently, her upper half was completely bare. With a nervous giggle, she ignored her bra and grabbed her shirt, attempting to button it over her massive chest. Only a few buttons still fit and she couldn't be bothered struggling with the ones that took even a hint of effort to button, so the vast majority of her breasts were left uncovered. Completing her outfit with her brooch, Hilda stepped towards the door, noting, with a hint of pleasure, that her flesh wobbled with each step, mesmerising even her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing her gaze away from her chest, Hilda left her room and kneaded down the corridor. Both Marianne and herself lived on the second floor, meaning she didn't have to go far to find the solitary animal lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hilda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne slowly cracked her door open, revealing a wide brown eye. Its gaze initially rested on the mass of jiggly breast flesh before glancing briefly at the glowing brooch before finally moving upwards to Hilda's beaming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hi, Marianne!\" Hilda sung. \"Could I ask a quick favour? I need you to infuse this buckle with a bit of magic! I would ask Lysithea, but she's in the Infirmary at the minute\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne stared at the belt for a moment before slowly shaking her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I... I'm sorry, but I don't think it's a good idea...\" She said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aw, don't be like that!\" Hilda interrupted. \"Just a tiny bit of infusion won't hurt anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne mumbled something under her breath before sighing heavily. Opening the door a bit more to reveal half of her body, she held out a hand. Hilda smiled as she dropped her belt into her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you, Marianne!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarianne closed her hand and, after a brief glow, reopened it, revealing that the gem set into the buckle now had a glow to it. Squealing happily, Hilda snatched it from her hand and quickly pulled it around her waist. Tightening it, Hilda placed her hands on her hips and stuck a dramatic pose for Marianne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How's it look?\" She asked. \"Pretty cute, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-Yes, it's very beautiful,\" Marianne admitted. \"Now, if you'll excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marianne shut her door, a quiet groan escaped Hilda. Along with the familiar heat in her bust, she could feel something else...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Collapsing up against the wall next to Marianne's door, a quiet moan escaped Hilda's mouth. Not only were her breasts filling with a pleasurable heat, but that same heat was now steadily filling her backside and hips, making them, along with another part of her, tingle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmmm... N-Not here...\" Hilda gasped as a hand drifted downwards to the hem of her skirt. \"G-Get back to the room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing away from the wall, Hilda started for her room. She didn't get far, however, as she soon felt both her shirt and panties tightening. Pleasure slowly overwhelming her, Hilda fell to a knee, another long moan pushing past her lips. Never before in all her life had she felt like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"R-Room...\" Hilda managed to tell herself, getting back to her feet and pressing onwards towards her room. As she walked, another button flew off her shirt, leaving only three left. Those three did nothing to hide her swelling breasts, which bounced, wobbled and jiggled with each step. Spotting this in the bottom of her vision, a hand flew to them, her fingers digging into the soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, her other hand had pulled the back of her skirt up, revealing her steadily growing rear end and widening hips. Her fingers gently poked and prodded an ass cheek before also digging in and squeezing. Hilda let out a third moan, louder than the two before it, and fell up against the wall again. Chest heaving as her breathing sped up, Hilda shakily returned to her feet. She was so close to her room... Just a few more steps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"M-Made it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically falling through her door, Hilda kicked it closed behind her and managed to lock it. Hands still groping her swelling assets, she slowly shuffled towards her mirror, groans and moans freely escaping her mouth now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"O-Oh, they're... s-so... big...\" Hilda stuttered as she reached her mirror. \"Let me s-see them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her brooch and belt, both of which had a gentle glow to them, she carefully set them atop her desk before vigorously ripping her shirt from her body and, while not as eager, slid her skirt down her legs, revealing the full extend of her most recent growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her happiness, the brooch and belt had worked in tandem to expand her body.  She figured the belt, or rather the buckle on the belt, worked similarly to the brooch, reacting with Marianne's magic and creating energy which was stored in the nearest suitable container, which was her lower body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I look...\" Hilda paused, trying to think of the best word to describe her now. Beautiful? Cute? Awesome? Big? Huge? Massive? Busty? All of them applied to her, now more than ever. Breasts that easily eclipsed her head, that could easily be described as the biggest in the entire academy, that were soft to the touch yet resisted the pull of gravity to remain perky on her chest. And now, she had backside to match them. Turning sideways to her a better look at it in the mirror, Hilda gave one of her cheeks a hearty slap. It rippled and wobbled, the effect spreading to its twin on the other side. Her backside could be described as '<i>ample</i>' before this, now? Now it was comparable to Lady Rhea's, a favourite topic of discussion among the men of the Academy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to face her reflection, Hilda stared at her huge chest for a moment before a smile spread across her face. The entire corridor, She had been struggling to hold back her desire to touch herself, to play with her massive melons and grope her ass. But now, she was all alone in a locked room. There was no need for such restraint...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmmm... O-Oh, yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hand roughly groping her bust and the other giving her ass another slap, Hilda turned her back on her mirror and made for her bed. Collapsing heavily into her, she gently peeled her panties down her legs and began to enjoy her new body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh my, that felt great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda giggled to herself as she rolled off her bed. Her bedraggled hair, no longer in pigtails, hung down her back, tickling the top of her ass, while her thighs were still damp with her fluids. The same could be said for her bed, which was soaked through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll just ask somebody to wash it later!\" Hilda said with a shrug, turning away from it. \"Now, what time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing out the window, she spotted the moon still high in the sky. With little else to do, Hilda returned to her damp bed and fell back into it, not bothered about the wetness. Staring up at the ceiling above her, a hand idly returned to one of her breasts and fiddled with one of her nipples, which instantly hardened beneath her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh?\" Hilda noted this with an eager giggle. \"Or maybe I can do something else to pass the time...\"  </span></div></div>",

Professor wants us all in the classroom! It's Certification Day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got Hilda moving. Eyes opening wide, she sat bolt upright, energy rapidly filling her previously slumbering form. Even she wouldn't dare miss Certification Day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"J-Just a minute, Claude!\" She called back, unsure of who was even trying to wake her. \"I just need to get dressed, then I'll be right out, promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's great, but it's not Claude!\" A gruff voice shouted back. \"Claude's in the middle of his exam. It's Raphael!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"O-Oh, I see...\" Hilda replied, bouncing to her feet. As she did so, her breasts wobbled enticingly, almost distracting her from her task. Pushing the thought of groping herself from her mind, she rushed around her room, frantically searching for anything that would cover her enlarged chest and backside. After emptying every drawer she owned and coming up with nothing, she stood in the centre of her room, completely lost as to what she should do. She couldn't blow off her exam, not unless she wanted both Seteth and the Professor kicking down her door. But she couldn't go out as she currently was, as the same thing would happen, only for different reasons...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, you doing okay on there?\" Raphael asked. \"You're kinda running outta time to get to class\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh, just fine!\" Hilda lied. \"Just trying to... button my shirt, ahaha! Cleaners must have shrunk it or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, you too?\" Raphael asked. \"Mine are shrinking all the time! But I guess if you're putting on as muscle as I do, it's bound to happen, yeah? I can lend you one of mine, if you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I...\" Hilda hesitated, looking down at the tattered remains of her own shirt. It was missing buttons, it was slightly damp and she hadn't been lying when she said it must have shrunk while being washed. Anything, even one of Raphael's shirts, was better than hers. \"I suppose I'll have to. Just get me a clean one, okay? No weird food stains or anything\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Course!\" Raphael responded brightly. \"Be back in just a moment, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Raphael bound off down the corridor, Hilda gathered up the few bits of clothing she hoped still fit and began to dress herself. Pulling A clean set of white panties up her legs, she made a face as she felt the seat of them sink between her enlarged cheeks. Pulling them out, a sigh escaped her as it almost immediately sank back in, making itself comfortable in its new home. Doing her best to ignore it, Hilda dressed the rest of her lower body, beginning with a longer skirt that did a decent job at hiding her thicker hips and plump backside, followed by pulling her socks up her legs before finally pulling a pair of boots on. As she struggled to fit a bra around her massive tits, Raphael returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Got a clean shirt for you!\" He announced through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Great, you're a saviour, Raphael!\" Hilda responded, letting a relieved sigh and dropping her bra to the ground. Unlocking her door and sticking her arm out, she felt a soft shirt press into her hand. Pulling her hand and it back into her room, she relocked the door and inspected her shirt for the day. Unlike the one issued to female students, which had a bit more comfort around the chest, the male one was a simple white dress shirt. However, Raphael, being the size that he was, had the largest size the shirt came in and, while it didn't quite for his muscular frame, it did fit well around Hilda's breasts. Buttoning it up, she inspected herself in her mirror for a few moments before, satisfied that her shirt and skirt hid her new body well enough, unlocking her door and joining Raphael in the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You look great, Hilda!\" Raphael smiled. \"But we should really get moving. I think we're next for exams\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Hilda started to follow Raphael down the corridor. Partway down it, however, she remembered something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I forgot my accessories!\" She realised, pausing. Ahead of her, Raphael looked back, just in time to see her bolt back to her room. She was only gone for a moment, however when she returned, her brooch sat proudly over her right breast while a dark blue belt with a golden buckle was wrapped around her waist. \"Okay, I'm ready now! Let's go take a test!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, guys, listen up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away from Marianne, who she had been discussing accessories with, Hilda looked towards Claude, who stood behind the Professor's desk, usual goofy grin on his face and a stack of papers held aloft in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As Teach has a meeting with Lady Rhea, they left the announcing of results to me!\" Claude announced, waving the stack of papers. \"So, first up, yours truly! I took the Wyvern Rider exam and passed with flying colours! Second, we've got Lorenz, who took the Paladin Exam... Also a pass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hah, would you expect any less from me?\" Lorenz interrupted with a snide chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, settle down, Lorenz,\" Claude told him. \"Third up is Leonie, also taking Paladin and also passing Paladin. Fourth, Ignatz. You took the Sniper exam and passed with flying colours\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Just like Captain Jeralt!\" Leonie cheered, pumping her fist into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I passed? Great!\" Ignatz let out a relieved sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fifth, we have Marianne, taking and passing the Bishop exam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I... passed?\" Marianna whispered in disbelief, staring down at her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lysithea isn't here at the minute, but she took the... Valkyrie Examination?\" Claude paused for a moment, checking her paper again. \"Yep, definitely says Valkyrie. Well, whatever it is, she passed easily. Raphael, you passed your Grappler exam...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Haha, alright!\" Raphael clapped loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...And finally, Hilda!\" Claude paused for a moment, glancing over at Hilda. \"You just about managed to turn up to your Fortress Knight exam and, even though you probably did no studying for it whatsoever, passed. So congrats, Golden Deer! We all passed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room burst into cheers. They didn't last long, however, as the door behind them opened, revealing their Professor. She glanced around the room before smiling and nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...Good work, everybody...\" She stated softly, startling everybody in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, well, looks like Teach is finally finding her tongue!\" Claude stated, breaking the silence. \"Anyway, don't we need to head to the armoury, get our new gear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor nodded and, without another word, turned and left the classroom. The Golden Deer all hesitated before following her towards the Armoury...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \"Marianne! What was the Bishop exam like?\" Hilda asked excitedly, going to push past Ignatz to talk to the reserved blue haired girl. In the process of doing so, she felt her considerable bust brush against his arm, sending slight twinges of pleasure racing through her body. Shivering, Hilda managed to brush them aside and fell in step with Marianne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"O-Oh, well...\" Marianne hesitated, watching sadly as the small bird that had landed atop her finger flew off, frightened by Hilda's sudden appearance. \"It focused heavily on healing and assisting your allies in battle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sounds... great, I guess!\" Hilda responded. \"Mine was all about the best ways to swing an axe while wearing heavy armour! Not the most difficult exam if your brother practically raised you on the best ways to wield an axe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So, what you're saying is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn arm wrapped itself around her shoulder. Feeling a hand land atop her left breast, Hilda inhaled sharply. Since they had started growing, her breasts had been much more sensitive. As none of her bras fit around her hefty tits, Raphael's shirt, which was made of a slightly coarser material than her, rubbed against their tender flesh, leaving her nipples near permanently erect and her in a constant state of arousal. Thankfully, neither was visible, her nipples hidden by her thicker shirt and she herself masking her arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lord Holst did the exam for you!\" Claude grinned. \"Knew you didn't do any studying for it. Got Big Brother to give you the answers, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What! No!\" Hilda responded, unwrapping Claude's arm from her shoulder. Had his hand rested on her breast any longer, it was likely she would've jumped Claude and used him to relieve her mounting pleasure. \"Well, maybe just a little bit... But he didn't give me any answers! Just helped me understand the best ways to wield an axe while in heavy armour...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, I'm not judging,\" Claude said, holding his hands up. \"Honestly, I took a little advice from somebody as well. You might know them, actually. Stoic, doesn't talk much, great teacher... You actually don't turn up to many of her lectures!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda sighed heavily. She had made the mistake of letting her guard down, allowing Claude to get close...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Any particular reason for that?\" Claude asked, cocking an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course there is!\" Hilda responded quickly, her mind racing to come up with something. \"You wouldn't know, being a guy, but women have certain... issues they have to deal with every month. And when they come up, well... It's best that I just take the day off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh-huh...\" Claude didn't look particularly convinced by her lame excuse. \"I'll pass that onto the Professor. As a lady herself, she'll be a lot better at helping with those monthly issues. Anyway, at least try to turn up to class, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Can't promise anything, Claude, you know that!\" Hilda flashed him an innocent smile and hurried away from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golden Deer continued onto the Armoury, all of them chattering happily amongst themselves about their respective exams. Upon arriving at the Armoury, they discovered that they weren't the only house getting outfitted with new gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, if it isn't her Imperial Highness and her band of Black Eagles!\" Claude greeted Edelgard brightly, causing her to sigh heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Claude, please, just call me Edelgard!\" She told him wearily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whatever you say, Your Highness!\" Claude replied with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, Professor, I see the Golden Deer all passed their exams!\" Professor Manuela smiled at the Professor, who merely nodded in response before pulling Manuela off to the side. Hilda watched them, concern etched on her face, as they mumbled between themselves. She was no expert when it came to reading lips, but she saw '<i>Lysithea</i>' mentioned more than one time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, their Professor returned and, in her usual fashion, managed to order each of the Golden Deer to their respective outfitter with very few words. Professor Manuela did the same with the Black Eagles and, soon enough, Hilda was joined at the Heavy Armour outfitter by none other than Edelgard herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hi, Edelgard!\" Hilda greeted her warmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hilda,\" Edelgard's greeting, compared to Hilda's, was considerably colder. \"I see you too passed the Fortress Knight exam. I trust it wasn't too difficult for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Not at all!\" Hilda responded, turning her back on the Imperial Princess. It was incredibly rude of her to do so, but she's rather not have her stare at her bare breasts while squeezing herself into her new armour. And speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is my new armour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda eyed the hefty metal suit, disgust making itself known on her face. Her old suit had been tinged pink, as per her request. Her new suit, however, was a bland steel his. Numerous scratches marred the metal skirt, while one of the pauldrons had a chunk of steel missing from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That it is, Lady Goneril!\" Her outfitter piped up, doing her best not to stare at Hilda's breasts, which wobbled slightly as she strode around her new armour, inspecting it from every angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why is it so... damaged?\" She asked bluntly. \"And why does Edelgard get a brand new suit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over at Edelgard, who was being helped into a gleaming suit of gold and red, Hilda felt a twinge of jealousy. Edelgard's armour was and example of having armour that was both functional and attractive to look at. Hers... was neither really. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, Lady Edelgard's armour was specially crafted in Embarr,\" The outfitter explained. \"Unfortunately, we don't receive a suit for you, hence why you have this. But, as it now belongs to you, you can do whatever you desire with it. As long as you're the one doing it, that is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back down at her rank armour, an idea entered Hilda's head. She could do anything to it? Such as attach some accessories to it? A grin spread across her face as she ran a hand over the metallic chestplate. She could just imagine her armour now, gleaming with accessories, all specially crafted to enhance her attack, her defence and, of course, her body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Can... Can I take this back to my room?\" Hilda asked, grunting as she lifted one of the boots. \"I'd like to make a few modifications\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As long as you return it to the Armoury before curfew,\" The outfitter responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry, I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering up her armour, Hilda started for the exit, numerous ideas floating around her head...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \"Is the armour to your liking, Lady Edelgard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard nodded in response to Hubert's question. As soon as he had finished getting his new robes and he was sure she wasn't indecent, he had rushed over to check on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, Hubert, it fits nicely. A tad heavier than my old suit, but I'd be concerned if it wasn't,\" Edelgard answered. \"Remind me to thank the Palace Smith the next time I'm in Enbarr, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course, Lady Edelgard,\" Hubert bowed, hindsight hand across his chest and his left across his back. \"If you'll excuse me, I'll allow you to change back into your Academy uniform\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hubert left her, Edelgard heard loud clatter behind her, followed by another. Then another. And then, finally, a hushed curse. Curious, she turned to find Hilda, various pieces of her armour scattered around on the floor around her. If she had to guess, the newest Fortress Knight for the Golden Deer had attempted to carry her armour somewhere, only to drop half of it on the floor almost immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Dastard!\" Hilda hissed, dropping the only two pieces she was still carrying to place her hands on her hips. As she did, Edelgard's eyes widened in shock. Hilda had always been... rather well-endowed, not that she had paid that much attention to her, but as she stood there, hands on hips, it was obvious she had grown. Her shirt wasn't her own, probably belonging to... Raphael? That was his name, right? And her skirt wasn't its usual length. It was a slightly longer one that came down to her ankles, the one that Hilda had been rather vocal about in the Dining Hall one evening. She had made her feelings about that particular type of skirt well-known, and yet here she was, her lower body covered by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are... you okay, Hilda?\" Edelgard asked, tearing her eyes away from Hilda's wobbling bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Edelgard! Hi!\" Hilda crosses her arms across her chest , which didn't help her case. Beneath her shirt, Edelgard could see the slightly squashed flesh, bulging above and below her arms. \"I'm fine. Just carrying my armour back to my room for some modifications, that's all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurriedly gathering up her fallen armour, Hilda slowly made her way past Edelgard, who watched her go, violet eyes glued to her swaying hips. As Hilda rounded a corner, Edelgard shook her head. She was familiar with various types of magic, both from her time spent being experimented upon in the Dungeon of the Imperial Palace and from some private lessons Hubert had given her. And through them all, she hadn't heard of a spell that could modify one's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmmm...\" Edelgard stroked her chin in though. \"Perhaps this warrants a little more investigation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Hilda a fair amount of time, as well as dropping her armour more times than she cared to count, but she soon found herself back on her room, armour strewn across the floor in front of her. Dropping to her knees in front of a pauldron, she lifted it with a slight grunt, running her eyes over the worn armour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmmm... Too exposed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the pauldron, she moved onto the chestplate. Easily the heaviest part of the suit, and the one that had given her the most trouble on her way back from the Armoury, it was probably the best place to attach a few homemade accessories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think... Yep! That would be perfect!\" Hilda gushed, clapping her hands together happily. The breastplate consisted of two pieces, the first covering her stomach and the second covering her breasts. In the middle, just below her breasts, the two plates overlapped, creating a small area that was protected by the top plate. If she was precise, she could create a belt of sorts, hide it in that gap and attached whatever she wanted to it! Her brooch, her buckle, hang a necklace from it, sew a ring into it... There was no end to what she could do! \"Oh, I can't wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly bouncing to her feet, Hilda leant over her desk and began to flip through her book. The belt and brooch were great, but she wanted more. She NEEDED more. Even the mere thought of her breasts swelling, her ass becoming softer, was enough to turn her on. A hand drifted to her shirt, quickly unbuttoning it and dropping the garment to the floor, leaving her upper body bare. Grabbing a handful of her hefty melons, an ecstatic moan escaped Hilda's mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H-Hilda?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda froze, her fingers mid-grope. Slowly looking up from her book, she saw Edelgard stood in the doorway that she had completely forgotten to close. Her eyes, wide with shock, landed on Hilda's naked tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Edelgard... Uh... Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, Hilda tried to come up with some sort of believable excuse about her massive chest, which was impossible to hide without some sort of thick shirt. But she was so horny... All she could think about was pleasuring herself, groping and fingering her huge tits, slapping her fat ass, maybe get Edelgard in on the action...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She'd look good with a nice set of breasts...</i> Hilda thought lewdly. <i>No, what am I thinking?! Need to explain this!</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two girls continued to stare at one another, however the thoughts racing through their heads were completely different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How are they so big?</i> Edelgard wondered curiously, staring at Hilda's heaving chest. <i>Has she put on weight? Been cursed? Or is it something else?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, Goddess...</i> Hilda thought with an excited groan. <i>Her hands... I can feel them, touching me, playing with me... I want... I want her to...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Play with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard cocked an eyebrow. Hilda had mumbled something, but she hadn't quite caught it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Pardon? Could you please repeat that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Play... with... me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith speed that definitely didn't fit the standard of a Fortress Knight, Hilda crossed her room to stand in front of Edelgard. Before the Imperial Princess had a chance to react to her swift movements, Hilda had wrapped her arms around her narrow waist, pulling Edelgard in close for an intimate kiss. Feeling Edelgard struggle, Hilda tightened her grip, forcing her tongue into her mouth. As she ran her tongue over Edelgard's perfect teeth, she could feel their breasts pressing against each other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well?\" Hilda finally broke the kiss, a string of saliva hanging from her lose lip. \"You'd look great with a chest like mine! Perhaps you'd like to stay, find out how to get one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, Edelgard's eyes flicked down to Hilda's tits. She had to admit, she had always desired a bigger bust. But because of the experiments that had been conducted on her, it was unlikely she would ever naturally get one. She was destined to look like this for the rest of her life... Or so she believed. Maybe, just maybe, Hilda could fulfil her desires...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-Yes...\" Edelgard admitted nervously, her cheeks flushing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then close the door...\" Hilda purred, turning her back on Edelgard and making her way to her borrowed shirt. Stooping down, she grabbed her brooch and, after making sure it hadn't been damaged, presented it to a confused Edelgard. \"This is the secret. You wear it, and I'll wear this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A brooch?\" Edelgard asked, inspecting the golden accessory. \"And... a belt? Are you sure about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda didn't respond, instead pressing the brooch against Edelgard's chest and leaning on close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Trust me, you'll look great with it on...\" She breathed into Edelgard's ear, causing the Imperial Princess to shiver with pleasure. Pulling away, she grinned as a quiet squeak escaped Edelgard's mouth, her chest slowly expanding. The growth was negligible, yet it was enough to convince Edelgard. Pinning the brooch to her shirt, she breathed deeply, her shirt creaking slightly as it tightened around her bust. \"See? Now, follow me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing Edelgard by the hand, Hilda pulled her towards her bed. Spinning around, she gently pushed her new partner onto it, a sultry smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H-Hilda, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilencing Edelgard by pressing a finger to her lips, Hilda lowered herself down so she was sitting atop Edelgard's thin thighs. Lightly stroking her cheek, she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now, here's what we do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning down, she began to whisper into Edelgard's ear, causing her to blush a vivid red. Slowly pulling away, she nodded once before cupping Edelgard's breasts. As she did so, Hilda felt hands grip her ass, boney fingers digging into its plump cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's it...\" Hilda smiled. \"Repeat what I told you in three, two, one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You look positively ravishing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-You look positively... r-ravishing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaneous moans escaped the two girls as warmth filled their bodies. Edelgard could feel her chest swelling, filling with fat, while Hilda's ass and hips softened and widened. Their growth was brief, yet it was enough to break Edelgard's nervousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So... big...\" She murmured, a smile spreading across her face. \"This is wonderful... And so is your body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her ass swell, Hilda leaned down to plant a light kiss on Edelgard's cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And so is yours...\" She replied, watching closely as Edelgard's chest grew, the clasps on her shirt finally snapping, revealing a strained bra that was barely holding back two fleshy breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next while, the two girls whispered to one another, commenting on their growing bodies. As Edelgard's chest began to resemble Hilda's before she had gotten good of her new toys, and Hilda's lower body began to eclipse Edelgard's, the two swapped their accessories and positions. Dropping her brooch between her massive tits, Hilda smiled up at Edelgard, who was sat atop her pillowy thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And here we go again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well!\" Edelgard sighed, falling sideways off Hilda's thighs to lie next to her. \"That was certainly an experience...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll say!\" Hilda giggled, playing with her huge breasts. \"I don't think even Raphael's shirt will fit me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmmm... But perhaps it'll fit me instead?\" Edelgard suggested, stroking her widened hips. \"I know my own uniform won't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm sure we'll figure something out!\" Hilda said enthusiastically, bouncing to her feet and making her way to her mirror. Standing in front of it, she admired her new body, which had developed an exaggerated hourglass figure. Her hips were so wide that they had developed a dramatic sway whenever she walked, while her breasts were huge yet perky, taking up almost half of her torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I hope we do, as we can't walk around the Monastery like this,\" Edelgard responded, inspecting her own body. Her once pert breasts had swollen considerably, looking like a pair of watermelons, while her lower body looked almost motherly, sporting a pair of child-bearing hips and a plush rear end. As she stood, she stumbled slightly, her point of view seemingly higher. \"Am I taller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, Hilda found herself looking slightly higher to meet Edelgard's violet eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, you are!\" She said excitedly. \"That happened to Lysithea as well! Don't know why, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I... see,\" Edelgard coughed. She had an idea why, though she couldn't say for certain. \"Well, perhaps we can do this again sometime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda licked her lips eagerly, a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course... But first, let me just get that from you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her belt from Edelgard, she gave the taller Princess a light peck on her cheek, noting that she had to stretch up slightly to do so...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reluctantly turning away from Hilda, Edelgard bent over to scoop up her damaged top. As she did so, a yelp escaped her mouth as a hand gave her right ass cheek a hearty slap. Straightening up, she whirled around to face a giggling Hilda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please, don't do that!\" Edelgard tried to keep her tone firm, but it obviously didn't work. There was a slight waiver to her voice and, upon finishing, she couldn't help but blush, a hand drifting to her thick backside, her fingers lightly stroking its soft flesh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, Your Highness!\" Hilda responded brightly, intertwining her hands behind her back and thrusting her chest outwards, each breast wobbling considerably.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How very Claude of you...\" Edelgard replied with disdain, pulling the remains of her top on. There was no way the clasps would even come close to closing, so she left them open. Her room wasn't far, after all, and the chances of her running into anybody in the corridor were low. Everybody should been in class, emphasis on '<i>should</i>'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this was certainly an enjoyable experience!\" Edelgard said with a smile. \"Farewell for now, Hilda\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Edelgard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving farewell to the massively endowed Golden Deer, Edelgard started back towards her room. Along the way, she noted a number of things about her new body. The first, and perhaps the most obvious, was how her hips sensually swayed from side to side as she walked, her thighs lightly brushing against each other, the sensation making her feel hot and bothered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking the thought from her head, Edelgard did her best to ignore her sensitive thighs and turned her attention to her breasts. Within the Black Eagle House, it was obvious that Professor Manuela spotted the largest chest, but excluding her, Dorothea had the largest, followed by Petra, then Bernadette and, finally, herself. But now, her chest rivalled Professor Manuela's, perhaps even surpassed it, if only slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning into her room, Edelgard draped her damaged shirt atop her bed, making a mental note to get it resized at some point, and began to hunt for a larger top. After a brief search, she managed to find a plain white shirt, similar to the kind Petra preferred to wear. Pulling it on, she managed to get the majority of the buttons closed, aside from the top two. With no other options available to her, she left them unbuttoned, leaving a hint of her new cleavage visible to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore leaving her room for the Black Eagle Classroom, she made a quick stop at her mirror. Standing in front of it, she stared at her reflection, barely recognizing herself. It was rare for her to be seen wearing something other than black and red, yet here she was, clad in a snug white shirt, a black skirt that was dangerously close to revealing the bottom of her round ass, and a pair of crimson tights that clung tightly to her lower body, sinking between her thick cheeks, outlining her damp pussy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, Edelgard...\" She told herself, once again shaking the thought of blowing off class to play with her new body from her head. \"I wonder... Will I still fit in my armour? It wasn't designed with this kind of body in mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking a breast, she shrugged, not particularly bothered by it at the moment. Compared to the Golden Deer, who were nearly always out training or undertaking missions for Rhea, Seteth or even other students, the Black Eagles spent the majority of their time in the Monastery, which suited most of them fine. Sure, Caspar got a little restless now and again, but there was little need for combat training. Beyond fighting rogues and bandits, which they could all do well, Fodlan had no need for trained warriors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yet, anyway...</i> Edelgard thought to herself, a dark shadow falling across her face. With a final glance at the mirror, she left her room, making for the Black Eagle Classroom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing outside her classroom, Edelgard took a deep breath and almost immediately regretted it. She could hear her shirt stretching, the buttons tightening dangerously, as she inhaled. Letting out a long breath before her shirt exploded open, she nodded confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If Hilda can face the Golden Deer, then I can face them!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing open the doors, Edelgard strode into the classroom. Professor Manuela, who had been teaching something about Gambits by the looks of the chalkboard, trailed off, her eyes narrowing. She didn't abide tardiness to class, even by a minute, something Linhardt had quickly found out when he was late for her first class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edelgard, where have you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off as Edelgard approached her. Her seat was at the very front of the class, meaning she had to walk by every member of the Black Eagles to take her seat. As she walked past each row of desks, she could feel a new set of eyes glue themselves to her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my...\" She heard Dorothea mutter as she neared her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How intriguing...\" Linhardt chimed in with a yawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the rest of the Eagles kept their comments to themselves. Planting her plump backside on the normally uncomfortable bench, Edelgard bowed her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sincerest apologies, Professor Manuela,\" She apologised to a stunned Manuela. \"I swear to you, it will not happen again\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edelgard, I...\" Professor Manuela cleared her throat. \"Could I see you after class please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Professor,\" Edelgard nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, as I was saying, gambits are a necessary part of battle. There is a vast range of different formations...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Hey, Edelgard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard exhaled through her nose. She was doing her absolute best to focus on Manuela's teachings and not her bouncing tits, but there were a few factors that were making it difficult to do so. The first was her own body, which tingled pleasurably whenever she allowed her gaze to drop to Manuela's mature form. While she could manage that, she couldn't manage the urgent whispers from the person sitting next to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ferdinand, please!\" Edelgard whispered back, noting with some satisfaction that she was now eye level with him. \"I am trying to focus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that, but what happened to you?\" Ferdinand asked. \"Your body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Edelgard responded shortly, turning away from him, only for her eyes to be drawn to her Professor's firm ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, Edelgard... Nobody just grows like that!\" Ferdinand continued to talk, prompting Edelgard to look back at him with an exhausted sigh. Before she could lecture him, though, she noted that his hands were crossed awkwardly over his groin, attempting to hide a noticeable bulge. The thought of the two of them alone in a room, exploring one another's bodies, her ripping his trousers off while he gently unbuttoned her shirt, raced through her head, exciting her greatly and inciting a gasp from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem, Edelgard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing her eyes away from Ferdinand, Edelgard looked towards the front of the class, only for her gaze to be drawn to Manuela's wobbling bust. The same erotic thought invaded her mind, only it was now her and Manuela groping each other, their evenly sized breasts mashing together as they leaned in to kiss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Not at all, Professor!\" Edelgard responded nervously, her face flushing warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then perhaps you can tell me more about the Assault Troop gambit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of class was a tough affair for Edelgard. No matter where she looked, thoughts of her and her classmates invaded her head. Her and Petra, her and Dorothea, her and Linhardt, even her and Hubert, a man she had only ever thought of as a servant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's all for now!\" Manuela told the class, prompting the room to all stand and start for the door. \"Edelgard, a word please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Edelgard stood and made for the large desk at the front of the class. As the rest of the Eagles filtered out, Manuela cleaned the chalkboard, giving Edelgard a good look at her thick backside. She could just imagine what it felt like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Edelgard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard stood up straight, noting that she now maybe an inch shorter than her teacher, who was once a good bit taller than her...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, care to share what happened to you?\" Manuela asked, turning away from the now blank chalkboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I... Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard immediately faltered. She had expected that Professor Manuela would notice her growth and question her about it. She was the Academy's Doctor, after all, it was her job to do so. Yet, due to her unexpected lewd thoughts during class, she had failed to come up with any sort of adequate excuse. While Hilda hadn't asked her to do so, she felt obliged to keep the brooch and the belt a secret, which would keep them both out of the hands of the Faculty and in Hilda's hands, where they would be more easily accessible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Professor Manuela,\" Edelgard finally said after a momentary silence. \"I'm afraid I don't quite know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I thought...\" Manuela mumbled to herself, stroking her chin thoughtfully. \"Let's try a different question, shall we? You looked completely fine during your armour fitting a couple of hours ago. I was informed that you disappeared towards the end of it, sending poor Hubert into quite the mood. Where abouts did you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ah, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Edelgard didn't have an answer readily available. Resorting to another thoughtful silence, she found her mind and gaze wandering, both settling on her Professor's ample bust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Get it together, Edelgard!</i> She chided herself mentally, forcing her gaze downwards. This turned out to be a mistake, as when her own chest entered her view, the sight of her own cleavage was enough to cause her to inhale excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking away from her chest, Edelgard hurriedly shook her head, eager to get away from her well-endowed Professor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Not at all, Professor!\" She answered nervously. \"Just... Can't quite recall what happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Amnesia, perhaps?\" Manuela mumbled to herself. \"And she's the second to show up like this... An illness? Or the result of some sort of curse? Perhaps I should alert Lady Rhea, get a more experienced Physician in for a second opinion...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Professor?\" Edelgard anxiously raised her hand. \"May I be excused?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... No, not quite yet, Edelgard,\" Manuela replied, stepping around her desk. \"You are the second student in two days to have their body suddenly and mysteriously... grow, for lack of a better word. I'd like to take a closer look, see if I can't determine the cause. If you'd please follow me to the Infirmary...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela started for the door, Edelgard hesitating before dejectedly following her. As she followed her Professor, her violet eyes remained firmly glued to Manuela's swaying hips and plump backside, thoughts of her own hands gently groping it invading her mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are!\" Manuela paused in front of a set of double doors, reaching into one of her robe pockets and producing an ornate key. Inserting it into the lock, she unlocked the two doors and pushed them open, striding into the room. Edelgard, on the other hand, reluctantly slunk into the room, unwilling to be there. \"Please, take a seat on that bed\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObeying the order, Edelgard sat on the edge of a bed. Off to her left, she could hear Manuela rummaging around in some cupboards, her melodic voice humming a beautiful tune. And in front of her, behind a curtain, she could hear somebody snoring lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perhaps this is the second student?</i> She wondered. <i>I wonder who it is?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over her shoulder, she made sure that Professor Manuela wasn't paying her any attention before leaning forwards and sliding the curtain back ever so slightly. Peering in, she caught the briefest hint of somebody with a decent chest and pure white hair before she was interrupted by a meaningful cough. Letting go of the curtain, Edelgard sat back, her gaze dropping apologetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, I was just curious to see who the other student was,\" Edelgard answered truthfully. \"Is she... Did she grow like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she did,\" Manuela answered, standing next to Edelgard, her heavy bust tantalizingly close to her face. \"If you must know, it was Lysithea. However, her reaction to the growth was more severe than yours, hence the curtain. Not to worry, though, she is completely fine. Now, could you please stand for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Edelgard watched as Manuela, brandishing a length of measuring tape, began to measure her new body, starting with her height. Before her recent growth, Edelgard had been on the smaller side, both asset and height wise. But now, much to her pleasure, she was neither. And while she wasn't crazy about being stuck in the Infirmary, she did have to admit that she was curious to see just how much she had grown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to your Record Card, you were five foot and two inches tall when you joined the Academy,\" Manuela told her, double checking her measurement. \"Now, you are five foot, seven inches, making for a growth of five inches...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela turned away to jot this down on a new record card, leaving Edelgard to take in her new height. Five inches wasn't too bad a growth. She was now on par with the vast majority of males in the Academy, with the exception of a few, namely Dedue from the Blue Lions, and Raphael and Lorenz from the Golden Deer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, hold still please and try to keep your breathing even,\" Manuela asked, wrapping her tape around Edelgard's bust. Feeling her Professor's soft hands brush against her sensitive breast flesh, Edelgard moaned quietly. Pressing her legs together, she could feel herself getting damper down below. \"Hold still, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry, Professor!\" Edelgard gasped in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... A substantial growth when it comes to the chest...\" Manuela muttered, kneeling down. \"Not much longer now, just need to measure your waist\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard nodded, her mind continuing to be wracked by pleasure. Goddess, she was so, so... horny! She needed some sort of release, be it herself or somebody else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please hurry, Professor...</i> Edelgard thought, biting her lower lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, substantial growth around the hips...\" Manuela stood, a smile on her face. \"There, all done! If you'd please have a seat, I need to step out for a moment. Won't be long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cheery farewell wave, Manuela stepped out of the room, pulling the doors closed behind her. As soon as they clicked shut, Edelgard was on the bed, a hand roughly kneading her firm breasts while the other fumbled with her skirt, clumsily pulling them down before gripping her tights. Oh, how she was looking forwards to this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Edelgard...\" She heard a weak voice from behind the curtain. Eyes wide, Edelgard hurriedly pulled her skirt back up and let her hands drop to either side of her, just in time for the curtain to be pull back by a confused Lysithea. \"Wait, what happened to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Lysithea,\" Edelgard responded, trying to ignore her carnal desire for pleasure. \"I'd heard you'd been taken to the Infirmary. I presume it was to do with your growth, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing to Lysithea's body, Edelgard stood. While the Golden Deer's prodigy wasn't quite as tall as her, not was she as endowed, the changes to her once childish frame were clearly obvious. Two grapefruit sized breasts filled out her pyjama top, while her hips and backside filled out her bottoms nicely. Coming up to Edelgard's shoulders, she estimated her to be around five foot, four inches, a massive difference from her old four foot body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously,\" Lysithea replied dryly. \"And I'd warrant you were here for the same. You've been in contact with Hilda, right? And her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea trailed off, raising an eyebrow. Catching her meaning, Edelgard nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, only she's gotten a belt now,\" She explained. \"The brooch seems to grow people's chests, while the belt does the same, only to their lower bodies. And, for whatever obscure reason, it made me taller. I'm guessing that's what happened to you as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, taller... I do have a hypothesis about that,\" Lysithea responded, resting her chin on her fingers. \"However, it only really applies to me, because I've got...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two crests, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea inhaled sharply, stepping back in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How'd you...\" She stammered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I too was subjected to the same horrors,\" Edelgard answered with a heavy sigh. \"As soon as I saw you, I knew. White hair is not a natural occurrence, but instead one that comes around through magical experimentation. And the only experiment that causes it is that one\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...\" Lysithea cleared her throat, taking a moment to recover from her shock. \"Anyway, my hypothesis... I believe the brooch, and now the belt as well, are the cause. They take in energy from the surrounding area and attempt to store it. However, they have nowhere to do so, meaning they transfer it to the nearest suitable container, which would be us. However, our Crests, already an unstable mixture, don't like that, creating another reaction within us that results in us growing taller. It's the only explanation I've been able to come up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... What sort of energy is it?\" Edelgard wondered. \"Magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not quite. That's the part I'm still uncertain about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea broke off as the doors swung open, revealing Manuela. As she stepped into the room, spotting Lysithea, she smiled warmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Lysithea! Feeling better, are we?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better, Professor Manuela,\" Lysithea answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good... Now, with regards to your growths, I've brought a second opinion with me. Originally, I had intended to ask them for a second Physician, but imagine my surprise when they said they were one! Please, come on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela stepped aside, allowing her guest to enter the room...</span></div></div>",

This picks up where the last chapter ended, by the by, and marks the end of the first 'Paralogue' of the storyline.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA svelte woman, her womanly figure clad in a pristine white robe, stepped gracefully into the room, a gentle smile on her face. Her pale green hair swayed to and fro as she moved to stand between the two girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see now what you mean, Manuela,\" Lady Rhea, Archbishop of the Church of Seiros, said, her voice light and warm. \"A curious change to befall two students... And you say you cannot discern the cause?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lady Rhea,\" Manuela answered, moving stand beside her. \"Both Edelgard and Lysithea have demonstrated the exact same changes, increased chest and lower body mass, a sudden increase in height, yet I can't for the life of me figure out what caused it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm yourself, Manuela,\" Rhea said soothingly, reaching out a hand to rest on her shoulder. \"Please, step outside for a moment. I would like to inspect them for myself\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManuela swiftly left the room, leaving Lady Rhea smiling softly at the two girls. Lysithea shuffled uncomfortably while Edelgard stared back, her gaze firm. She knew what Rhea was, what she was capable of. It was the whole point of her being at the Academy. Yet now wasn't the time to strike, not in her current state. And speaking of her current state...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Goddess, she's so... so...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard's steely gaze gradually melted away as it stopped lower and lower, finally resting on a favourite topic of conversation among the males of the Officers Academy; Rhea's lower body. Eternally clad in her robe, which clung tightly to her entire frame, her hips flared outwards impressively. And while she couldn't quite see either of them due to her flowing cloak and aforementioned robe, Edelgard could just imagine her plush rear end, her pillowy thighs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In order to better understand the situation, perhaps we should start at the start,\" Rhea suggested kindly. \"Before your growth began, was there anything odd? A flash of light? A peculiar sensation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls exchanged a look. They both knew the cause, it being Hilda and her odd magical accessories, yet for whatever reason, neither wanted to divulge that information. Lysithea wanted to study it, see if the effects could be somehow applied to help her situation, while Edelgard desired it for herself, to enhance her own body and those of those she deemed worthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not, Lady Rhea,\" Lysithea admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Rhea frowned. \"If not a sensation, then perhaps a common person? Someone you both came into contact with? Or a magical item?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that we're aware of,\" Edelgard answered this time. \"The Black Eagles rarely social with those from other houses. This goes doubly for myself\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea lapsed into a thoughtful silence, leaving the two girls to their own thoughts for a moment. While Lysithea glanced around, clearly bored and eager to get out the Infirmary for the first time in a couple of days, Edelgard continued to sneak glances at Rhea's impressive frame, her body feeling increasingly warmer as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly curious,\" Rhea finally admitted. \"No common factors aside from the changes. And nothing like this has ever happened before... Perhaps it is best the two of you remain in the Infirmary for the time being. Doing so will allow us to run a few more tests and hopefully determine what caused these changes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But... Lady Rhea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That hardly seems necessary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls burst into protest at the thought of being confined to the Infirmary. Lysithea, for obvious reasons, while Edelgard was much more concerned at how she was meant to relieve her pleasure with somebody else in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I can think of no other alternative,\" Rhea apologised. \"We don't know if this is contagious or not. I would prefer to not have this spread. Now, if you'll excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final, sad smile, Rhea turned her back on the twin crested duo and left the room. Outside, Edelgard could hear her speaking to Manuela in a hushed tone, presumably telling her to keep them in the Infirmary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't stay here,\" Edelgard finally turned to Lysithea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" Lysithea responded with a nod. \"But how do we get out? Professor Manuela locks this door whenever she isn't here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... Then perhaps I could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting her mind back, Edelgard recalled Manuela fishing a key out of her robe pocket. If she could just get a look at it, she could maybe work something out. Maybe she could try to jimmy the lock, or perhaps Lysithea could use it somehow? Before they could even figure that out, however, they needed to actually get the key. But how would she even get it? Merely trying to pickpocket her would immediately fail unless she was distracted somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could...</i> A plan floated through Edelgard's head, one that made excellent use of her new body. The thought of it excited her greatly, making her feel very, very warm. <i>N-No, I couldn't...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even as she thought she couldn't, her body was already moving into position. Moving the side of the door, Edelgard waited patiently, her mind continuing to protest again her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Edelgard?\" She heard Lysithea ask curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush!\" Edelgard turned her head to look at her, a finger pressing against her lips. \"She's almost here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing footsteps, Edelgard braced herself. As the door swung open, she allowed herself to fall forwards, eyes fluttering shut. Blind to the world, she heard somebody emit a startled yell before Edelgard's body collided with them, sending them both crashing to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perfect!</i> Edelgard thought, feeling a pair of breasts pressing into her own. <i>Now, just find her pocket and get that key...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowing her arms to fall limply to her sides, she began to clumsily grope around for Manuela's pocket. Oddly, she couldn't find it, not could she even find the robe. Instead, she grabbed ahold of a silken cloak, causing her brown to furrow in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Professor Manuela doesn't wear a silken robe...</i> She thought before realisation washed over her like a Gambit. <i>This... isn't Professor Manuela...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking an eye open, she found her vision obscured by green hair. Looking upwards slightly, she could see an ornate headdress on the floor just in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>T-This is...</i> Edelgard felt her body tense. <i>Rhea!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edelgard?\" She heard a voice whisper into her ear. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lady Rhea...\" She mumbled back. \"S-Sorry... I just felt a little... faint...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of hands gripped her shoulders, pulling her to her feet with surprising strength. Staring up at Lady Rhea's smiling face, Edelgard blushed. While she had been searching for the pocket, her hand had come into contact with Rhea's considerable rear end. And not to mention their breasts, pressing warmly together...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that settles it,\" Rhea declared firmly, stooping down to retrieve her fallen headdress. \"Edelgard, you are to remain here until further notice. Lysithea, you will be allowed to return to class, however you must check in with Professor Manuela at the end of every day, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course!\" Lysithea responded excitedly. \"Thank you so much, Lady Rhea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelgard remained silent, an unhappy frown on her face. Not only was she now confined to the Infirmary with little hope of escape, the thought of her and Rhea, their hands exploring one another's forms, lingered in her head, making her wet once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, I suppose I now have the Infirmary to myself</i>, Edelgard thought, waving farewell to Rhea as she strode out. <i>Which means I have all the time in the world to... think about certain things...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ecstatic that she was finally allowed to leave the Infirmary after two days of being confined to the same bed and staring at the same plain ceiling above her, Lysithea wasted no time in changing out of her gown and into a new Academy Uniform that fit her newer body and, in the event of sudden growth, would accommodate a little extra mass. Smoothing out her skirt and giving her blue leggings a light tug, she started towards the door, a cheerful spring in her step, when a resigned voice stopped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose this is farewell for now, Lysithea\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to Edelgard, who was sat on the bed adjacent to the one she had used with a sullen look on her face, Lysithea smiled sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... But don't worry!\" She responded brightly. \"I'm sure I'll be able to figure out what's causing us to grow and stop it, maybe even reverse it! But until then, farewell, Edelgard. Try to keep yourself in check\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lysithea bounced out of the Infirmary, Edelgard fell back onto her new bed with a heavy sigh, her arms stretched out to either side of her. She had been so eager to be alone so she could play with herself and relieve some of that growing tension and pleasure from just seeing Rhea, but now that she was alone, she -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was rather endowed...\" Edelgard recalled, Rhea's motherly figure returning to her mind. She could see her hips flaring out, teasing her, begging her to free them from their form-fitting prison. With an excited sigh, Edelgard began to fumble with her skirt, struggling to slip it down her longer legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps this won't be so bad after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere in the Monastery, Lysithea was having an awkward time. The second floor had been practically empty, aside from a couple of Monks and Priests making their way towards the Library. They had paid little mind to Lysithea as she marched past them, which suited her just fine. After all, she despised being the centre of attention. But as soon as she entered the Courtyard just outside the classrooms, everything changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's that Golden Deer girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was she always that tall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, her chest looks great now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder how she managed it? Wouldn't mind a little extra height myself\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably one of her weird magic experiments...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea kept her gaze firmly on the ground in front of her, unwilling to make eye contact with anyone. It was bad enough to had to ensure these mumblings. It would be worse if somebody actually asked her to explain herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just keep walking, Lysithea</i>, She told herself mentally, sidestepping a couple of students that she just knew were staring at her chest. <i>Don't stop to tell them off, just keep moving. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, she managed to make it to the Golden Deer classroom with only one close call. As she had passed by the Blue Lions classroom, a tall boy with a head of fiery ginger hair had stepped out, '<i>accidentally</i>' bumping into her and forcing her gaze upwards. She had stared at Sylvain for a couple of seconds before hurrying onwards, ignoring him calling her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's just hope my class isn't as inquisitive as the rest of the Academy!</i> Lysithea thought, pushing open the double doors and stepping into the room. As the doors creaked open, allowing Lysithea to step into the room, everybody's gaze turned to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Lysithea's back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude was the first to break to awkward silence that followed her entrance, getting to his feet and smiling at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she? Alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaphael followed him, turning in his seat to reveal a big smile. The rest of the Golden Deer soon followed, all of them welcoming her back in their own ways and all of them, thankfully, skirting around the obvious Giant Wolf in the room. It wasn't until her Professor approached her did she finally have to discuss it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a single, yet rare, word, the Professor strode towards a corner at the front of the room, Lysithea following her billowing cape. It was obscured by a pillar and neither of the students that normally sat at the desk nearest it, Hilda and herself, were sat at it, giving them an ample amount of privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um...\" Lysithea swallowed nervously, unsure of where to start. Compared to Professor Manuela or Lady Rhea, the Professor was a difficult person to talk to. Her expression was always neutral and she rarely spoke. Yet, this helped Lysithea as she took a deep breath. While they were difficult, they never judged. They would wait as long as it took Lysithea to speak. \"I can't really explain this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured to her body, causing her Professor's eyes to flick down and inspect it. Had it been anyone else, Lysithea would've wasted no time in firing off a Miasma in their direction, but she trusted her Professor. Yet that trust didn't make her investigation any less... awkward. She could feel her gaze crawling up and down her body, resting on her chest and hips for a few moments before finally returning to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But rest assured, it will not affect my work!\" Lysithea declared. \"Additionally, I'm carrying out some research in my spare time to try and fix it. So apologies in advance if it seems like my mind is elsewhere\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor shook her head, a kind smile on her face. Gesturing towards her desk, Lysithea nodded, bowing her head gratefully before making her way to her desk, allowing the Professor to return to her own and continue with her lesson. As she did, however, Lysithea kept sneaking worried glances at empty seat next to her. Hilda's empty seat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I hope she hasn't gotten too crazy with those accessories while I was in the Infirmary</i>, she thought. <i>I'll check in on her after I've let Professor Manuela know nothing happened today...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Following Lysithea's return, the rest of class proceeded smoothly for the Golden Deer. The Professor, after a few personal tutoring sessions for a few students, then moved onto a lesson about various types of magic, a lesson Lysithea and Marianne both enjoyed greatly but left Raphael scratching his head in confusion. Upon finishing their magic lesson, which involved Lysithea being allowed to cast a couple of spells, they were then dismissed for lunch, the majority of the Golden Deer excitedly charging towards the Dining Hall. Lysithea, on the other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ignatz and Leonie left the classroom, chatting about the Goddess or some such, Lysithea meekly approached the Professor, who was busy rubbing the board clean of diagrams depicting the types of spells they had touched on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I stay in the room over lunch?\" She asked, glancing anxiously towards the door, which the Blue Lions were currently streaming past. \"With what's happened to me, I expect many people will have questions. Questions that I can't, nor particularly want to, answer\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor didn't immediately answer, instead choosing to vigorously scrub at a drawing showing a small girl with white hair, a ball shooting from her outstretched hands. As soon as it was gone, she turned to Lysithea, a slight smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two short words, the Professor made her way around her desk and started towards the door. Lysithea lingered at the front of the room for a few seconds before, against her better judgement, deciding to follow. Jogging towards the door, where the Professor was waiting with her usual stoic expression, Lysithea inhaled deeply before nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready to go, Professor, \" She said, prompting the Professor to nod and walk out of the classroom. \"But where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe received no answer. Frowning, Lysithea let out a huff before reluctantly following her, ignoring the whispers and glances from students she walked past...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing light footsteps behind her, Byleth continued onwards, Lysithea trailing slightly behind her. Every so often, the young girl would try to ask where they were going, only for Byleth to ignore it. Not because she was being secretive, but because Lysithea might object if she knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to see Hilda, Professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth came to a stop so sudden, Lysithea didn't have time to react. Feeling her youngest student's chest press into her back, Byleth spun around, grabbing Lysithea by the shoulders before she fell backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes,\" Lysithea said dryly. \"I've been meaning to go see her as well. I-I mean... Only because she was absent from class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth narrowed her eyes suspiciously. While Hilda's attendance to her class had been spotty and unreliable when she had started teaching, it had improved greatly over the past few months until a few days ago, when Hilda had mysteriously missed a class. Byleth had been content to let it slide,  Hilda had been making a lot more effort to turn up to class and actively participate, after all. However, the next time she had seen Hilda at the Fishing Pond, she was proudly sporting that new brooch and a slightly rounder chest, not that neither girl had mentioned it. And each time she had come into contact with Hilda after that, the pink haired girl's chest was noticeably bigger. The last time she saw her, which was yesterday at the armour fitting, her chest was massive, easily surpassing her own ample chest! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that wasn't all. People who came into contact with Hilda, such as Lysithea and, from what she had heard from Lady Rhea, Edelgard, all experienced the same change, along with a few extra ones. A larger chest was the common denominator, all three girls reportedly sporting one, however both Edelgard and Lysithea had gained a few extra inches of height and a curvier lower body. Given that no form of magic approved for casting by the Church could cause that, Lady Rhea had issued her an impromptu mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFind Hilda, determine what she was doing and then report back for further orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Byleth had accepted the mission, it was her duty to do so and, if she was honest with herself, she was curious to see what Hilda was up to. However, somebody else had taken interest in her new mission, though Byleth suspected her reasons differed wildly from her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cpgreen\">Come on... Hurry up already!</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA childish, slightly irate voice resounded through her head, inciting a sigh from the former mercenary. As she strode towards the Dormitories, a young girl, invisible to all but herself, materialised next to her, green hair and elegant robes flowing lightly in the breeze. Her arms were folded over her flat chest, while her thin legs were crossed, one atop the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cpgreen\">Could you walk any slower?!</span></i> Sothis demanded, frowning at her host. <i><span class=\"cpgreen\">I wanna know what that girl is doing! And don't you worry why I care! All you need to know is that I do! Now hurry up!</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another heavy sigh, Byleth broke into a light jog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor, w-wait up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom somewhere behind her, an embarrassed voice rang out. Glancing over her shoulder while she ran, Byleth caught sight of a red faded Lysithea, her arms wrapped tightly around her breasts. It took the mercenary a second to realise why she was clutching her chest in such a manner, but when she dod, she slowed down a little bit, receiving a grateful '<i>Thank you!</i>' from her student. However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cpgreen\">What are you doing! Hurry up already!</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth frowned. There was no winning with either girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hilda? You in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea tapped lightly on the door, Byleth standing behind her with her arms crossed. As she waited for a response, she couldn't help but notice that her once petite student was almost as tall as she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cpgreen\">Just kick down the door!</span></i> Sothis tried to order, only for Byleth to shake her head. <i><span class=\"cpgreen\">Urgh, fine... Wait, I hear something!</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Hilda's door swung open. As it did so, the three girl's mouths all fell open in shock as they took in the person greeting them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Professor!\" Hilda greeted her Professor with a smile. \"Oh, and Lysithea too! You're finally out of the Infirmary! How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hilda, what happened to you?!\" Lysithea asked, staring Hilda up and down. \"Y-You're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cpgreen\">She's so big...</span></i> Sothis mumbled in wonderment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Big</i>' was an understatement. Hilda's body practically filled the doorway, her gargantuan breasts and cow-like hips both brushing lightly against the frame. Her thighs were as thick as tree trunks and, while Byleth couldn't see it, her rear end was presumably just as hefty. Her curvaceous frame was almost completely nude, save for an incredibly stretched bra, her brooch haphazardly pinned to it, a belt with an ornate, glowing buckle and finally, a pair of underwear drawn so tightly around her lower body, she might as well have not bothered putting anything on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to talk\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth was the first to break to awkward silence, pushing past both Lysithea and Hilda to stride into Hilda's room. Stepping over a pile of damp clothing, she inspected the room, her eyes finally falling on an open book on her desk. As she stepped towards it, however, Hilda stepped in front of her, breasts bouncing heavily and smile plastered across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem, Professor?\" She asked, somehow oblivious to her changed body. \"Is this because I haven't been turning up to class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth nodded sternly, folding her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as you can see, nothing really fits me anymore!\" Hilda answered with a giggle. \"So I've decided to stay here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... How'd you grow so big?\" Lysithea asked from the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cpgreen\">Yes, tell us!</span></i> Sothis chimed in eagerly, not that anyone other than Byleth could hear her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that! You remember my brooch?\" Hilda responded, fingering the glowing accessory. \"Well, I made a belt to match it! One thing led to another, and here I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerforming a clumsy spin, Hilda's breasts collided with Byleth, knocking her backwards onto Hilda's bed. As the former mercenary sat up...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting on Hilda's somewhat damp bed, Byleth had a brief glimpse of Hilda staring down at her, a devilish grin on her face, before the world went dark, two incredibly warm and unbelievably soft masses enveloping her head. Her honed mercenary instincts instantly kicked in, arms shooting out to wrap around the pillowy objects in preparation for escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Professor...\" Byleth froze as somebody in the room let out a muffled moan. Fingers intertwined with hers, pressing her hands further into the soft masses. \"Mmm, just like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother faint groan escaped her captor. Gritting her teeth, Byleth pulled her legs up and, with a grunt, kicked out at her assailant. Her vision returned to her as Hilda stumbled backwards, her massive assets making her wobble dangerously on her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hilda, what are you doing?!\" Lysithea demanded from the doorway, seemingly reluctant to approach the giggling pinkette or even enter the room. \"You can't just smother people like that, especially a Professor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Lysithea...\" Hilda chuckled, one hand fingering her brooch and the other thumbing her belt. She had a devious grin on her face, one neither girl had ever seen before. \"The Professor didn't seem to mind. Did you, Professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wink, followed by a flirtatious giggle, was shot towards Byleth, the normally stoic woman blushing a deep red. As much as she didn't want to admit it, having her head enveloped like that, surrounded by a comforting and pleasant warmth... It had been a nice sensation, one that she wouldnt mind experiencing again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpgreen\"><i>Oh?</i></span> A curious voice in her head asked, a hint of amusement in their childish tone. <span class=\"cpgreen\"><i>You liked being smothered? I see what kind of woman you are now...</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth blushed again at her mental companion's words, something that didn't go unnoticed by Hilda. Taking her Professor's red face as a sign of acceptance, which it technically was, the massively endowed teen surged forwards, her arms reaching out to wrap around her prey's head. Once again enveloping her Professor's head between her breasts, Hilda let out a long, happy sigh. Her colossal bust wobbled as she shivered, the sensation of her Professor's warm breath brushing against her skin enough to make her damp once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hilda! Stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to stand idly by anymore, Lysithea started forwards. Reaching out, she intended to pry Hilda away from the Professor, only to have her plan quickly ruined by Hilda, whose own arms shot out with blinding speed to intercept hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, feeling left out, Lysithea?\" The pink haired girl smiled kindly, easily resisting Lysithea's attempts to escape her iron grip, homes from clenching the haft of an axe her whole life. Unfortunately for Lysithea, her struggles were in vain, something Lysithea was painfully aware of. Hilda was one of the strongest people in the Golden Deer House, only outclassed by Ralph. She had as much chance of breaking free from her as Ralph did at becoming a Warlock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hilda, what's...\" Lysithea grunted as she was yanked forward. She was mere inches from joining the Professor between Hilda's breasts, agate she was desperate to avoid. Trying to pull back, Hilda easily overpowered her, pulling her again and forcing Lysithea's ample chest up against the Professor's back, forcing the worryingly still woman further into her fleshy prison. \"What's gotten into you?! This isn't like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly Lysithea...\" Hilda giggled, releasing one of Lysithea's wrists to gently caress her cheek. The white-haired girl tried to recoil, only to be pulled even closer to her prison. With only millimetres remaining between her and Hilda's pillowy hell, Lysithea extended her fingers, allowing dark power to flow to her palm. She hadn't wanted to do this, but she was being left with no other choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Hilda...\" She mumbled an apology before pointing her palm at Hilda's trim stomach. \"Mias...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get to finish her spell, the swirling darkness contained within her palm sputtering out as its caster lost the ability to speak. A muffled groan escaped Lysithea as, with one final tug, Hilda pulled her between her tits, turning her world dark. Continuing her desperate struggle to escape, it didn't take long for Lysithea to submit to her fate. Hilda was just so, so soft and warm, making it harder to think rationally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, all quiet...\" Hilda purred as Lysithea finally fell still, her body still pressing against the Professor's. It was an odd feeling, entrancing two people with nothing but her breasts, but it was one she was proud of. Alternating gentle strokes through Lysithea's silken hair and the Professor's slightly rougher hair with one hand, the other snaked downwards beneath her breasts, blindly fumbling around before she felt her fingers brush against metal. Frowning, she began to paw at the armour. \"Who wears armour around the monastery? It's not like anybody is gonna attack you! Well, almost anybody...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling excitedly to herself, Hilda began to clumsily strip away her Professor's armour, eager to get to the soft, ample flesh contained within it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nByleth's mind, usually swirling with tactics, her students many issues and whatever Sothis happened to be complaining at at the time, was, for perhaps one of the first times in her life, a complete blank. Even her normally vocal companion was silent, save for an occasional sigh of happiness as she did... whatever she did in Byleth's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a hand run through her hair, working out knots and curls that she couldn't care less about, Byleth let out her own sigh. The sensation of having somebody care for her like this was completely foreign to her. Growing up with only a mercenary for a father, she had missed out on all the subtle things a mother would do for her child. Instead of getting her hair brushed, she got it cut off. If she injured herself, she was told to deal with it. All these small things had raised her into what many people would call the perfect mercenary, yet here she was, succumbing to a little bit of tender care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpgreen\"><i>Hrrmmm...</i></span> Sothis yawned, something she hadn't done in quite some time. <span class=\"cpgreen\"><i>Somebody... else?</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomebody collided with her Byleth's back, a pair of soft breasts pushing her further into warm softness. A pleased mew escaped Byleth as she relaxed both body and mind, the mew turning into a moan as she felt a hand yanking her armour away from her body. Had she been even remotely conscious, she would've answered this with extreme force, having been raised to wear it at all times. Yet she allowed it to be stripped from her, soon clad in only the clothing she wore beneath it: a black top that only really covered her ample chest, leaving her midriff exposed, a pair of black shorts, her lacy leggings and, finally, her boots. The rest was taken from her, chucked in an unruly pile behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, you're kinda soft, Professor!\" Byleth heard Hilda comment, her hand squeezing one of her breasts. \"But not as soft as me~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBucking her hips as a hand began to grope and knead her breasts, Byleth moaned happily, the sound muffled by her delightful surroundings. Once again, she had never been touched in such a manner, any man that had tried to do so being swiftly introduced to either her blade or her fathers. But now that it was happening, she found herself wondering...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy had she been so opposed to it? And why did it feel so, so good?</span></div></div>",

She was a particular fan of her Professor's chest, each of her breasts perfectly round and just the right amount of soft. She also adored Lysithea's new bust, although it was nowhere near the size of her Professor's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I wish this could last forever...\" Hilda sighed, cupping her Professor's right breast with one hand, her thumb gently stroking an erect nipple, while her left worked on Lysithea, lightly caressing her left breast. \"Hmmm... Maybe it could?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes lit up excitedly as an idea former within her head. Before she had been interrupted, she had been working on another accessory. One that wasn't for her, but for finding her people to... have fun with, so to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda hummed happily to herself as she shuffled her way towards her desk, taking great care to keep both her Professor and Lysithea trapped between her bouncing breasts. Thankfully, even in their dazed states, the duo had the sense to shuffle with her and, with only a minor incident involving her Professor's boot getting caught in a pair of discarded panties, they were all stood before Hilda's messy desk. Various materials and gems were scattered along the top of it, while a number of pristine books about strategy, obviously never opened, were precariously perched near the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this is almost done?\" Hilda mumbled to herself, lifting her latest creation. It was a beautiful, golden headdress with a silken veil and a gleaming pink ruby set into it. It was obviously one of her more expensive creations, though she didn't that mind too much. She had a small fortune of gold, built up from money from House Goneril and her rewards from Lady Rhea for services to the Church, a fortune she was more than happy to spend on her hobbies. \"Yeah, it just needs a little magical touch... But from who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting an elbow on her breast, Hilda tapped her chin in thought. She could utilise Lysithea again, but she was reluctant to remove her from her comfortable position. Her Professor, as far as she knew, was a Pegasus Knight, specialising in swords and lances with nary a hint of magical prowess. And she herself was reluctant to leave her room, which left her with only one choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Hilda took a deep breath, grabbing a book from her desk. \"I think I can do this! I mean, Lysithea makes it look super easy, so it must be easy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking through the book, Hilda stopped on a page she had bookmarked. It depicted a simple infusion spell, something akin to what Lysithea and Marianne had cast on her current accessories. With nobody else to cast, she was going to have to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so...\" Hilda rubbed her hands together. Magic began to build within her palms, making her sigh in relief. Because people saw her swinging an axe around and wearing heavy armour, it was assumed she hadn't an ounce of magical talent when, in reality, she did have a little bit of experience with it. Of course, she only discovered said talent after turning up to the wrong class on her day off, joining Manuela and the Black Eagles for an extra lesson on swords and white magic. She had tried to leave, only for Manuela to order her to remain. \"A little more... Little more... And... Perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the charge between her palms, Hilda transferred said magic to the gem set into her headdress. Feeling it flow from her and into the gem, she smiled happily, pleased that it had worked. Now she didn't have to search for anybody when creating new accessories!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's that!\" Removing her hands, Hilda carefully hoisted the headdress into the air, running a critical eye over it. Aside from a small blemish in the gold, she was happy with it. \"Okay, who wants to wear it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBouncing her head from side to side, Hilda pondered who she should grace with her newest creation. In the end, she decided on her Professor. Lysithea had already benefited from her brooch, even getting a few extra effects out of it that she couldn't figure out. It was only fair that her Professor, who had helped her and nurtured her skills, get a turn to experience her craftsmanship. With a careful hand, Hilda guided her Professor from her pillowy chest and, once she was stood before her, a dazed expression spread across her face, Hilda lowered the headdress down upon her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel, Professor?\" Hilda asked, spending a few moments making it sit right atop her head. Receiving the barest of nods in response, she frowned, hands atop her wide hips. \"Come on, Professor, I gave you a gift! It's only right that you answer me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies...\" Her Professor mumbled, shocking Hilda. \"It feels very nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Goddess!\" Hilda giggled, weirdly ecstatic that she had gotten her Professor to speak on command. \"Does this mean... Compliment me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" The Professor paused briefly. \"You are a beautiful girl, Hilda...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda clapped excitedly. Her Professor was obeying her commands, meaning only one thing! Whoever wore that headdress had to obey her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compliment my brooch!\" Hilda demanded, framing said brooch with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's truly a beautiful brooch...\" The Professor said, staring longingly at it. \"I wish I had one like it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother giggle from Hilda as she felt her colossal breasts swell slightly, her bra creaking dangerously. She already knew she had trouble fitting through doorways. Any bigger than this, and it would become a struggle to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my belt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It suits you perfectly...\" The Professor moved her gaze downwards, looking at the glittering buckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda's immense hips grinded outwards, her rear end softening and thighs thickening. She was now wider than your average door frame, something she took pride in. Running her hands down the sides of her body to rest them on her ass, Hilda moaned as she dig her fingers in, revelling in the sensation of it. She stared at her Professor, whose dark eyes stared back, her body awaiting her next command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the question was, what should she do with her?</span></div></div>",

Doing so caused her breasts and backside to wobble madly, their occupant groaning unhappily as she was forced to move as well. Yet Hilda continued her ecstatic movements, excited at showing off her control over her Professor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could just, like, not turn up to class and tell her it's fine! Or, I could have her automatically pass me in every class, meaning I don't have to go! Or...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin turned devious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We could have a bit of fun right now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Professor~\" Hilda licked her lips, eager to have the Professor play with her huge, soft body. She could already feel hands running over her chest, pinching nipples and flesh alike. She imagined the Professor pressing her pelvis into her fat ass, her hands kneading its expansive flesh. \"Come clo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda stopped, a pink brow furrowing in confusion as a small orb of light floated out from her Professor's chest. It hovered between the two girls before, with a blinding flash that illuminated every nook and cranny of Hilda's room, it exploded. Hilda toppled backwards, landing heavily on her ass, the impact causing her backside to ripple madly. Lysithea fell from her breasts, landing with a dull whump on the wooden floor. She remained there for a few seconds before sitting up, clutching her head, only to let out a groan as the light intensified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hilda...\" Lysithea shook her head, shielding her eyes so she could look at the nearly naked teen. \"What did you do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-This wasn't me!\" Hilda replied, likewise shielding her eyes. \"An orb or something floated out the Professor and did this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really expect me to believe that?!\" Lysithea shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">Yes, I do!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls exchanged an uncertain look. Neither of them had spoken, and the voice definitely wasn't their Professor's. It was much more childish than her gentle voice, with a demanding, haughty tone that implied that the owner just knew she was better than you. As the light began to fade away, their confusion only intensified as, floating a number of inches above the ground, was a green-haired child, her arms folded over her flat chest. Innately decorated, deep blue robes swayed in a non-existent breeze, her thin legs crossed, one atop the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">Whew...</span>\" The girl sighed, swiping a stray lock of her unruly hair behind her head. \"<span class=\"cpgreen\">My, it has been a while since I've materialised like this! I'm certain that Archbishop would have a fit if she saw me!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled to herself, obviously enjoying imagining Rhea's reaction to the long awaited return of the Progenitor Goddess. Her smile soon faded, however, as Lysithea bravely spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Who are you, exactly?\" She asked hesitantly, her fingers extended in preparation for casting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">Oh, dear... What are they reaching these days?</span>\" The girl tutted, shaking her head in disappointment. \"<span class=\"cpgreen\">Why, in my days, my name was common knowledge, known by all! My true name, that is, not the one that Church is named after!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would that name be, exactly?\" Lysithea shuffled nervously, darkness beginning to gather atop her palm. Hilda kept a close eye on this, more concerned that Lysithea's spell would destroy her room and everything in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">You didn't even try to guess!</span>\" The child sighed heavily, her folded arms falling to rest at her sides. They didn't remain there long, as they were quickly folded again before she continued. \"<span class=\"cpgreen\">My name is Sothis, though some call me... The Beginning</span>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea and Hilda exchanged another look, both shrugging in confusion. Looking past Sothis, who seemed to be waiting for somebody to respond, Hilda called out to the third woman who was in the room with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Professor? Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed with no response. Even Sothis, who now wore an offended look at being ignored after her introduction, spun around, curious about why her vessel had fallen silent. The trio soon figured out why the Professor was quiet as, spread eagle on the floor, was her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">Oh, for the love of...</span>\" Sothis exhaled heavily through her nose. \"<span class=\"cpgreen\">Why do I always catch you sleeping at the most inappropriate of times?! The Progenitor Goddess has returned to this world, and all you care about it catching up on sleep?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Progenitor Goddess?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysithea and Hilda exchanged their third look, one of disbelief and shock this time. This floating child was the one who had shaped Fodlan? The one who had created the entire world around them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">Finally, you realize who I am!</span>\" Sothis whirled around again, turning her stern gaze to the two Golden Deer. \"<span class=\"cpgreen\">However, as to why I am suddenly here... I know not. Perhaps it had something to do with that revolting headdress you forced her to wear...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda, who had been content to let Lysithea talk up until now, grunted as she stood. Even floating, Sothis was still smaller than her by about an inch, something that became obvious as Hilda stomped towards her, totally eclipsing the small girl with her gargantuan body. Yet Sothis didn't look worried in the slightest. Rather, she seemed more amused, wearing a slight grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My headdress is not revolting!\" Hilda argued fiercely. \"If anything, your headdress is revolting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">I quite agree, it is,</span>\" Sothis nodded, causing Hilda to falter. \"<span class=\"cpgreen\">Yet it symbolises me as a Goddess, therefore I wear it. The things I sacrifice for my divinity...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait, wait...\" Lysithea stepped forwards, shaking her head. Perhaps before all this, Sothis would've held a few inches over her. But due to recent events, the duo were on equal footing, if only due to Sothis hovering about a foot from the floor. \"You say you're a Goddess, but what proof do you have? You can't just float out of our Professor's chest, claim you're a Goddess and expect us to believe you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">Ah, somebody with a head on her shoulders!</span>\" Sothis nodded. \"<span class=\"cpgreen\">While I'd normally take offence to your words, I suppose I understand them... Very well. I shall demonstrate my powers to you</span>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSothis glanced around the room. Both Lysithea and Hilda followed her gaze, which landed on various bits and pieces around Hilda's room. The headdress atop the Professor's head, the brooch and belt adorning Hilda's form, the DIY book lying open atop her desk, her materials and tools...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">I think this should suffice as an adequate example of my abilities!</span>\" Sothis finally declared...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \"Oh-ho-ho-ho!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA haughty laugh echoed through the tunnels of Abyss, startling a few of the stray cats wandering the dank tunnels. With a number of irritated hisses, they hurried away from the makeshift classroom, just as an ominous green glow flashed from its doorway. However, the classroom's only occupant, a blonde haired woman clad in a worn dress, wasn't worried in the slightest. Everything was going according to her calculations...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Finally!\" She announced, clapping her hands together. \"After years of wallowing in dark tunnels, I, Constance von Nuvelle, will finally restore House Nuvelle to its former glory! With this one simple spell, everything will be set right! No longer will I shy from the sun's embrace! Tomorrow, I will welcome it with open arms and a smile on my face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes, Constance began to concentrate. Since the fall of House Nuvelle, she couldn't stand the Sun. Every time she felt its warmth wash over her, she was reminded of that day... The day House Nuvelle fell from grace. Anytime she was outside, she was reduced to a shell of her current self. But, finally, she had developed a solution to her dual personalities!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And now, there shall only be the Heir to House Nuvelle, the confident Constance von Nuvelle, genius spellcaster!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes flying open, she pushed her hands out in front of her, her palms glowing a pale blue light. Pressing them together, the light formed into a small luminous ball, which she slowly pressed into her chest. A gentle warmth spread throughout her body, heating her slightly chilly body. It persisted for a few moments before dispersing, the chill of Abyss gradually resettling in her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I certainly don't feel any different,\" Constance commented, inspecting her hands. \"But, I am sure that it... O-Oh... I-I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling as a sudden woosiness washed over her, Constance fell up against a nearby table, breathing heavily. She had experimented on herself numerous times in the past, with few ill effects. Never before had she felt so worn out, so exhausted, so... light-headed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-Yuri... Bal... Balthus... H...api...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a weak cry for her friends, Constance collapsed into unconsciousness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...Found her like this. You think she was experimenting again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course she was. It's all she does these days. She's a little obsessed, if you haven't noticed\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I dunno. Pretty admirable, her trying to restore her house and all\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning as familiar voices roused her from her unconsciousness, Constance cracked open an eye. She was still lying on the cold stone floor of the classroom, however something soft now supported her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, she's awake\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brown skinned face, framed by messy red hair, appeared above her. It was joined by two more faces, one showing concern and the other amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"About time, Princess,\" Yuri said, amusement morphing into a grin. \"Gave us quite a fright, you lying on the floor like that. Any particular reason for it, or were you just that tired?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning as she sat up, she looked around at her gathered friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My deepest apologies. Perhaps if I had checked my calculations more carefully, I would not have inconvenienced you all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three Wolves exchanged concerned looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why's she speaking like she's outside?\" Balthus asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good question,\" Yuri answered, stroking his chin. \"Let's see here... Hey, Princess, your dress is torn slightly\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at her dress, which did indeed have a slight hole in its work fabric, Constance merely sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, dear... I suppose it was damaged in my fall,\" She mumbled, a shadow falling across her face. \"Please, do not gaze upon me and my naked flesh. I do not wish to embarrass you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three exchanged another concerned look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Maybe a side effect of her magic?\" Hapi suggested. \"Like you said, she's always experimenting\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Best explanation we've got,\" Yuri said, reaching a hand down to help Constance to her feet. As he pulled her up, she apologized multiple times for inconveniencing him. Ignoring her, he turned to the other two. \"I'm going to take her to the surface, see if our usual haughty princess doesn't resurface. Take a look at her notes, try to figure out what she was doing here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHapi and Balthus nodded, turning to a nearby desk that had notes scattered across its surface. Yuri, still clutching Constance's hand, pulled her towards the exit to the Monastery. Along the way, her apologies persisted as she bumped into various people and objects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hopefully, she stops soon</i>, Yuri thought, signing as he felt her clip his heel and apologize twice for it. <i>It's getting on my nerves now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the duo a while, but they eventually reached the surface. As Yuri pulled Constance into the sunlight...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stepping out from the cool shade of Abyss' exit, Constance looked up towards the sky. Clear of any clouds, save for the barest whisp of one on the horizon, she could feel the sun's rays on her face, warming it nicely. Stroking her cheek with a finger, she continued to silently stare at the sky, a finger lightly tracing her cheek, until Yuri, concerned by her silence, finally spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" He prompted, stepping in front of Constance. \"Feeling like restoring a fallen noble house? Or still depressed that it fell in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConstance continued to stare at the sky for another couple of seconds, watching a couple of birds flit across it, before looking down at Yuri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps...\" She started to say, prompting a grin to spread across Yuri's face. However, it quickly faded as she continued. \"Perhaps it was best that House Nuvelle fell... The other families within the Empire didn't seem to mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she's still depressed. Fantastic,\" Yuri sighed. \"Come on, you. Let's hope Balthus and Hapi found something in your notes. While I'm not a fan of your other persona, it's slightly better than... whatever this is\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My deepest apologies...\" Constance apologised, bowing her head. \"I will strive to be a better conversational partner in the future. However, I think it best if you pay little heed to me. I doubt I will be of much use to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this state, yeah, you kinda are useless,\" Yuri stated bluntly. \"But I'm not giving up on you, Princess. Let's head back down\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri extended a hand out to her, however Constance didn't take it. Instead, she turned away from it, stepping away from the rough hole that was the entrance/exit to Abyss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hold on there!\" Yuri called after her. \"Lady Rhea and the Knights don't really like us wandering about up here! Not after that whole Chalice incident!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConstance ignored him, continuing onwards until she was standing in front of the Student's Quarters. From what she knew, which, in her opinion, wasn't a great amount, the entrance to Abyss was situated next to that Professor's room. It was just outside their door she was stood, staring up at the sky yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sun...\" She mumbled to herself, reaching a pale hand up. \"It... It warms me... Fills me with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off, basking in the pleasant afternoon warmth. By no means was she a fan of the sun or its warmth, associating both with the fall of her House, yet she was familiar enough with both to know that the heat of the sun didn't make your skin tingle, which it was currently doing to her. Reaching down to the recently formed tear in her dress, she gently poked her skin, recoiling with a slight gasp as the tingling intensified, if only for a brief moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it is the Goddess...\" Constance mumbled to herself, poking her exposed skin again. \"Punishing me for my failures...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on Fodlan are you blathering about?\" Yuri asked, appearing in front of her. \"Whatever, it doesn't matter. Let's just go already\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a gloved hand rest on her shoulder, Constance allowed herself to be gently pulled back towards Abyss. Before she was pulled back into the shade, she shrugged Yuri's hand off. The tingling seemed to be getting stronger the longer she remained in the sunlight. Perhaps if she waited long enough, the Goddess would deem her worthy of a reward? Or, more likely, she would continue to be punished, for why would she deserve any sort of reward?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please forgive me, but I wish to remain in the light a little longer...\" Constance told him. \"Doubtless, this is an inconvenience to you, yet I must remain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, for...\" Yuri took a deep breath, resting his head in the palm of his hand. \"Fine, do as you want. Just don't come crying to me if the Knights take offense to you wandering around without an escort\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final sigh, Yuri disappeared back into the hole leading to Abyss, leaving Constance alone to stare up at the sky and wonder why she felt the way she did. With each passing second, her skin tingled more and more. It was getting to the point where, even without being physically touched, it was rather pleasurable for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that cannot be true...\" She mumbled apathetically. \"I shouldn't be rewarded for my actions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving away from the hole leading to Abyss, Constance started towards the Greenhouse. As she walked, gaze kept low so she wouldn't offend anybody, she could feel people staring at her, muttering quietly amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's an odd uniform...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't think she actually attends the Officer's Academy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait, wasn't she involved in that incident in the Chapel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConstance ignored the hushed voices of knights, students and common folk. She deserved to be talked about, for the Chapel incident was partially her fault. Her fault for being a part of House Nuvelle, for bearing the Crest of Noa, for trusting Aelfric so blindly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Perhaps it was best that House Nuvelle fell...\" She mumbled again, pausing outside the Greenhouse. Inside, she could see a familiar amber-haired boy, the one who had helped them... Ashe, was it? He seemed to be tending to some sort of bright flower, a smile on his face as he did so. Unwilling to be seen by him, Constance turned away from the Greenhouse and made her way towards the Dining Hall, hoping that it was somewhat empty...</span></div></div>",

What would happen? How would they react? How would <b>others</b> react? This is a breast expansion interactive story detailing those events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><u><b>I'm giving 750 Gift Points to all story additions!</b></u></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. As if this wasn't obvious, only female characters are allowed to grow/expand; Multiple girls are able to grow at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. While this is a Breast Expansion <b>focused</b> story, Butt Expansion and GTS are allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The stories for the characters can be either comedic and silly or serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No OC's. Sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. For games with customizable avatars, such as Robin and Corrin from Awakening and Fates respectively, use their default design; Although you can incorporate both the Male and Female versions of them in the story. (Remember only the females can grow!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. For the sake of the story, please add a decent amount per chapter if you would like to post. If I notice a string of 1 or 2 sentence chapters, I will delete them for the sake of quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Please keep this story in English, and use decent grammar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. You can make the girls as big as you want, but please give detail and time for their growth. A.K.A, I do not want a character's breasts to go from normal to galaxy-sized in one chapter. (Basically no instant giga-size)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. If you need to use a \"Someone Else?\" branch to create another story/path, please use the second choice to add another \"Someone Else?\" so more characters can eventually get stories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Lewdness and 18+ stories / options <b><i>are</i></b> allowed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. Not really a rule, but be creative! As long as you follow these rules, you can do anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Thanks for reading, enjoy the story, and while you're at it, why not ADD to it? Additions are highly encouraged and appreciated!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPsst! Interested in Touhou and Breast Expansion?
