For whatever reason you couldn't place why you liked Luna so much, you just did. You had met her at the begining of the school year during your free period, at first she was just the girl that sat by herself and didn't talk to anyone but when you looked at her really looked at her you got this odd feeling. It was hard to explain, just something inside you that told you 'hey, we gotta know everything about that girl'. So it was that one fateful day you walked over to her and said hi, catching her by surprise but she said hi back. After that, well wow we're you two together. Texting after school, following each other in the hallways between classes, passing notes all that jazz. Yet you guys weren't together, mainly because you were too shy to ask and you knew Luna had eyes for Sly, who you were pretty sure really had the hots for Patty but just couldn't tell Luna that. You try flirting with her, nothing super flirty but enough for her to know you had the hots for her a little bit. Then now, on your birthday, you wake up to another day of school. Starting off your day right, at least to you, you text Luna <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">Good morning dork</span> You sent the message as you hopped off your bed for the shower. In only a couple seconds did you get a text back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Morning goofball, happy birthday :)</span> You read the text with a smile as you closed the bathroom door and locked it. You started slipping off your pajama pants as you texted <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">Sleep good? i kept waking up because my room was freezing :(</span> Sending it you set your phone down as you slipped off your sleeveless shirt and slipped off your boxers. Turning on the water to your shower you heard your phone go off again. Grabbing it you read Luna's message <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Aw i'm sorry (air hug) i'll make sure to give you a real one to warm you up at school</span> You chuckled at that as you texted back <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">Can't wait then, i'm going to hop in the shower so brb</span> You typed as you set the phone down again. Surprisingly Luna texted back practically as soon you sent it. Figuring what the heck you grabbed your phone to see the message that read...</span></div></div>",

It's funny, just a couple words from Luna that really didn't mean much and yet they caused you to smile and a warm feeling to spread through you. This is why you cared about her so much, in only a couple words could she make you feel happy just for knowing her. You stepped out of the shower and dried off your hands first to text Luna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">all squeaky clean lol</span> You texted as you dried off your head and shoulders before getting a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Better be lol</span> she said as you dried off your legs before going back to your room to slip on new boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">:P oh quite you</span> you told her as you slipped on your pants and your academy jacket<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Better shake a leg if you want to get to school</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">Don't gotta tell me twice, see you at school</span> you texted her as you slipped on your socks and shoes before running down your stairs and out for school. You made it, just barely but you were out of breath, If it was possible to over work your mouth from breathing then you had discovered it, you were heaving through your first period. You eased through the first half of school, lunch was okay nothing special. But then came the part of the day you loved, free period. You took your seat and waited for Luna, hoping she'd hold up on her promise this morning when you saw her walk in...</span></div></div>",

You'd been dueling her for quite some time, and had been winning every time. Sure, you yourself weren't perfect, but you were fast. You and Rio started walking away from the park as you kept thinking.<br>\r\nYou were fast, but not as fast as you'd like with her...<br>\r\nYou looked over to her. She was pretty, a bit shorter than you, but still pretty well developed. This wasn't the first time your thoughts had wandered off about her and you fought to keep your member still. Rio came to lean on a railing overlooking the city and you joined her.<br>\r\n\"You know, Shark's been giving me some trouble lately.\"<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n\"He worries. I guess I understand, but I really want some space... do you see where I'm coming from?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course.\" You place a hand on hers and smile. She smiles back and withdraws her hand, before walking away. You catch up, thinking quickly. <i>Was she shy?!</i> Rio was never shy!<br>\r\nMaybe this is your lucky day...

I'll buy you lunch!\"<br>\r\nShe brightened up considerably and you soon found yourself in a shopping centre. You gazed in awe and horror as Rio did her shopping, filling bags with merchandise and \"borrowing\" your money to do so. It was with relief that you accepted her offer to leave. <i>This in itself makes rape fair game</i> you though to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting pretty dark, surprisingly quickly and Rio asked if she could call Shark to pick her up. You replied in the negative and asked if she would like to take a walk to your house, where you could get her something to eat. As she was well aware of your rocky relationship with her brother, she agreed, smiling slyly as she did so.<br>\r\nThe two of you giggled on your way down the many roads of the city, and you realised that this was the longest you'd ever spent with her alone. You also realised that you were falling in love with, not just her looks, but her personality, which was why you began to keep an eye out for a lonely street or alleyway to do your business quickly, instead of the luxury of a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you were soon rewarded. You had almost forgotten about an alleyway that ran through a row of houses into your own neighbourhood, and you invited Rio down it, using the weight of her bags as an excuse. About halfway down, you began to peer behind and ahead of you. No sign of anyone. Of course, this part of town was scarcely populated anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at Rio, who had stopped and was looking at you, puzzled. \"Are you thinking about something?\"<br>\r\nYou looked at her, and how you wanted to see her naked, with your boner inside her... but you also wanted her to consent... Love was confusing! You opened your mouth to respond...</span></div></div>",

She took a tentative sniff of her glass, then a sip.<br>\r\n\"I've never tasted this before. What's in it?\"<br>\r\n\"It's a mix of the various fruits that grow in this place.\" Which was, in fact, true. Mostly.<br>\r\n\"The flavours are just, dancing, on my tongue.\" She took a larger sip with a look of contentment on her face. You smiled knowingly at her as you drank your own drink.<br>\r\nUpon telling her that you and Zaloog were old friends, and that he'd serve the two of you as much as you wanted, you were pleased to see two more tankards join the first.

Was she already taken?<br>\r\n\"Out there.\" She nodded towards the window. You turned and jumped to see a giant blue eye staring back at you. The sound of Kisara's loud laughter (unbefitting a woman with her wardrobe) brought you back to your senses.<br>\r\n\"O-of course. Blue-Eyes.\"<br>\r\nThe White Dragon took flight and faded away as you caught your breath.<br>\r\n\"So that was your friend?\"<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Just trying to have some fun...\" She placed her head on your shoulder. \"So. See more of me? When do you want to meet?\"<br>\r\nHer naivety surprised you. \"I have a house near here,\" you began \"if it wasn't too much trouble, could you grace me with your presence?\"<br>\r\n\"Very well.\"<br>\r\nUpon entering your home away from home you bolted the door, you turned to see Kisara sitting on the side of your bed, straightening her dress.

She brought the dress up to her thighs, revealing her long smooth legs. She stood up then, rotating around for you to see as the gown continued its journey up her body, until she finally pulled it over her head and onto the floor. She smiled at your expression.<br>\r\nHer panties, if you could call them that in this world, were pinkish white, and disappointingly modest, although they hugged her figure well. Her chest, however, was only shielded from view by a simple black cloth that ran around it. Quite tightly too. Kisara sat back down with a lustful grin.<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n\"That you're an absolute angel.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\nYou passed a hand back over her rump, this time squeezing it. \"I still think you're being too formal.\"<br>\r\nShe pulled you hand off of her. \"I think the same of you.\" She pawed at your chest. You smiled at her at began unbuttoning your shirt. It quickly joined her dress. You then stood up and pulled your trousers down. It occurred to you that the tent your penis had erected might be too much for the poor girl, but she merely smiled again. \"Is that why you were so happy to see me?\"<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Would you care to finish what you started m'lady?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I believe you instigated this encounter.\" She stood up with that dreamy expression on her face...</span></div></div>",

You gazed at her breasts, your time being cut short as she bent down and slid her pants down, kicking them behind her.<br>\r\n\"Was that so hard, missy?\" You relieved your dick and stepped out of your pants. She stepped forward to meet you, her hands resting on your chest. One of your hands caressed a breast while the other returned to her ass. Your lips met in a fierce kiss as your hands groped her assets - her hands responded likewise by resting on your ass and dick. When you broke apart you slid a finger into her pussy and was pleased to see it was wet.<br>\r\n\"I certainly wasn't expecting this this morning.\" She said in her dreamy voice.<br>\r\n\"Nor was I.\" You spun her round and she collapsed on the bed.

Kisara couldn't hold back her moans any longer and her eyes closed. She let you continue on as you kneaded the soft flesh in your hands.  <br>\r\nYour hands then moved closer, just to her nipples which had grown stiff from all the attention she was receiving. Her soft moans began to increase int volume as you lowered your head down and dragged your tongue over one. A shudder ran through Kisara's body as you began to suckle on her breast.<br>\r\nShe moaned in pure ecstasy, she clearly hadn't had any attention like this for a long time, possibly ever. After a bit her hands came up and rubbed your back and she opened her eyes looking at you, now having a tiny smirk of her own. <br>\r\n\"I think that's enough fun for you...\" She said as that lustful grin appeared back on her face   </span></div></div>",
