            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh was having a rough day.  He left his paper on the start of World War I on his desk and now he had to listen to his teacher talk to him about the responsibility he needed to have.  \"Honestly, I did it Mr. Jackson.  I just left it on my desk when I was running out the door this morning.\"  Josh apologized to his History teacher.  \"Will it be alright if I hand it in first thing on Monday?\"  He looked at his middle-aged teacher with the best puppy dog eyes that even his sister, Bri, would be proud of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Daniel Jackson brushed his hand through his bristly mustache that he loved.  His wife didn't really care for it too much, but he really wanted to try something new.  He thought about the offer that Josh gave him.  \"I don't see the problem in it.\"  Josh celebrated silently and was caught by Mr. Jackson fist pumping the air.  \"But only if you bring it to me before the start of school on Monday.  When the bell rings for 1st period and you're not here.\"  He drew an imaginary 'X' with his fingers.  \"You will receive an incomplete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Jackson, you have nothing to worry about.  It will be here on your desk.\"  Josh replied as he pointed to the cluttered heap of papers.  He smiled as he turned toward the door and left.  Since it was his last period of the day, he went over to his locker and went through it's contents.  <i>'I really need to clean this out.</i>'  He thought to himself, seeing something at the bottom of the locker from the second week of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you up to tonight, Joshie?\"  A feminine voice called out to him from behind and his heart did a leap.  For the past year, he'd been trying to get out of friend zone with her, but had little luck so far.  Josh turned around to see his good friend Jennifer walking closer to him.  \"I was thinking that we could study for that Biology test that's next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze, Jen.\"  Josh sighed as he slung his backpack over his shoulder and closed his locker door.  \"You're always wanting to study, besides we can do that next week and plus you can come later on so that we can watch the new movie that I got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer brought her hand up to get the hair that was on her face and brought it behind her ear and sighed.  \"I guess we can do that.\"  She answered as she glanced at her watch.  \"Oh crap.\"  She exclaimed as she brought the watch over to Josh's eyes.  \"If you don't hurry up then you're going to miss the bus.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the watch on her wrist and gasped.  \"Crap, I need to hurry.\"  He waved her good-bye as he quickly made his way outside to catch his bus.  He opened the doors leading to the area where the buses sat in a hurry, but only to see his bus driving away without him.  He groaned as he cursed the higher power that was in charge of ruining his life.  \"I guess I better start walking.\"  He sighed.  \"I wonder how this day could get any worse?\"  He grimaced loudly as he felt the first drop hit his forehead and instantly knew what kind of day it was going to be.  The rain soon began to pick up at a steady rate and Josh was certainly glad that his overprotective mom made sure that he had the umbrella.  \"My umbrella!\"  Josh yelled as he checked his backpack and soon found the item in his pack that would make his walk home much more enjoyable.  He got it out and opened it just as the rain started to fall at a quicker rate.  Josh couldn't help but smile as he walked down the sidewalk under the broad protection of his umbrella.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rain continued to fall at a significant rate with no appearance of quitting any time soon.  The constant pitter patter of the rain was only interrupted by the couple of cars that drove by.  But Josh walked on and soon found he was near a bus stop.  \"Too bad I don't have a bus pass.\"  He muttered to himself as he took refuge from the constant barrage of the rain in the empty, enclosed stop.  He furled up his umbrella and sat down in the enclosure.  Back a few years back, the city started to put on these plexiglass enclosures up after much of the community complained about the long waits for the public transportation and having to do so with the constantly changing weather.  '<i>At least, I can take a small break</i>.'  Josh thought to himself as he heard a squeaking sound.  The sound reminded him of the horrible carts at the big-box store Wal-Mart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this seat taken?\"  A gravely voice asked as Josh turned to see an older woman pushing a well worn walker.  Her hair looked like she had just got out of the shower and her clothes were sopping wet too.  Josh got up and offered her the seat.  He gazed out the opening, almost as if he was entranced by the white noise that the rain caused.  \"It's really coming down today, isn't it?\"  The older lady asked him, which caused him to shake his head and come back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded his head.  \"Yeah, it certainly is.\"  Josh replied back to her.  \"It's almost like it came out of nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and I can certainly feel it in my old bones.\"  The older lady said back to him.  Josh looked over and noticed that she seemed to be wringing her hands trying to alleviate some of the pain that the years of hard work caused in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some aspirin.\"  Josh announced as he began to rummage through his pack to find the elusive treasure.  He found it laying at the bottom of his pack and offered the well used bottle.  Even though students weren't allowed to bring medication to school without a doctor's prescription.  But as they always say, 'What they don't know can't hurt them.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you sweet.\"  The elderly lady responded back to him as she took the almost empty bottle and took out several of the round pills.  She popped them into her mouth and proceeded to swallow them without the need of refreshment.  Handing the bottle back over to Josh, she noticed the look of wonder on his face.  \"Oh, as you get older you certainly get used to taking medication.\"  She chuckled as she began to get back up.  \"I think I've doddled here long enough.\" Josh, with his years in community service projects, quickly made his way over to her and assisted her.  \"Why thank you young man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much farther do you have to walk?\"  Josh inquired as he stepped back to allow her the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think I have a mile left.\"  The older lady answered back to him with a smile on her face, it was almost like it was no big deal.  \"The bus system doesn't go anywhere near my house, unfortunately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down at his umbrella and back at the drenched elderly lady.  After feeling sympathy for her, he offered her his only protection from the deluge coming out of the sky.  \"Here, I think you will need this more than I do.\"  He replied as held out the umbrella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwestruck, the older lady graciously accepted the item that would increase her protection from the rain.  \"But won't you get wet?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I live just 2 blocks that way.\"  He answered as he gestured further down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're going to give me this gift.\"  She started to say as she began to look through her bag draped around her walker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't have to.\"  He began to say but soon found a handful of dust being blown into his face and started a coughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have given me this gift and I will give this gift.  You will be able to experience the way others live, but only with their permission.\"  She replied with a smile as she began to turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\"  Josh called out to her.  \"What do you mean experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I mean that you will be able to swap traits with another person, but only with their permission.\"  She replied back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really have to blow that stuff into my face?\"  He wondered as he turned to gather up his items.  Not hearing anything, Josh turned back around to the older lady and noticed that she was nowhere to be found.  Looking up and down the street in hopes to find his gracious gift giver, but only found the occasional stray animal wandering the rain soaked streets.  \"What the...\"  He shook his head in disbelief.  \"Well, I guess I better get back to getting home before Courtney and Bri worry.\"  With the rain coming down and no umbrella to be found, Josh found he made better time.  Several minutes later, Josh found his way back to the home and in the bathroom to dry off and put on some dry clothes.  Having found some drier clothing, he made his way to his room to see about getting his homework done.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh continued in his attempt to dry off and getting into some drier clothing before his overprotective mother caught him. He quickly found a blue, 'retro' looking 'School House Rock' T-shirt and slipped it over his head. Just in time too, because just then he heard a light rapping on his door. \"Yeah?\" He called out to the mysterious visitor behind the doorway. The door creaked open and in walked his younger sister, Courtney, carrying her clothes under her arm so that she can put them away in her room. \"Hey there Courtney, what's going on?\" He asked as he picked up the drenched shirt and tossed it into the hamper across the room.  As he watched it go in the hamper, he chuckled as he remembered back to his Middle School basketball days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so wet?\" She asked him as she eyed both him and the shirt that he recently tossed into the hamper. \"What happened to your umbrella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably wouldn't believe me if I told you.\" Josh sighed as he motioned her to his used office chair next to his desk. \"Do you need help with something?\" Courtney nodded and caused her strawberry blonde hair to fall into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was just putting my clothes away before I get grounded again.\" She replied with a sigh as she grabbed the rogue pieces of hair and brought them back behind her ear in an attempt to bring them back under her control. Courtney then placed the clothing on his bed and groaned as she watched them fall over, coming unfolded in the process.  \"I hope you don't mind if I lay them here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not at all.\" Josh chuckled as he lay down on his bed next to her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened to you today after you missed the bus?\" Courtney wondered as she started to refold her clothes, taking care to make them the way that their Mom loves so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew he couldn't keep it to himself forever so he told her the story. How the rain seemed to come down in sheets, how he met up with the older lady that had the creaky walker, and how she gave him the 'gift'. \"That's about it.\" Josh replied as he sighed in relief and attempted to regain his breathing after spilling out the entire story with a single breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't really believe in that mumbo jumbo, do you?\" Courtney laughed as she thought about magic. She had always been much more down to earth than her other siblings and didn't really believe in magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I haven't really had a chance to think about it, honestly.\" Josh said as he looked at the hamper that he tossed his clothes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney looked down at her clothes grimaced at the amount of clothing she had accumulated over the years. Just as she did, her hair began to fall into her face once more. \"I wish that this hair would just stay where it supposed to be.\" She grumbled as she brought it back behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would certainly take it off of your hands if I could.\" Josh said to her reassuringly as he gently patted her on her back to emphasize the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I would gladly give it to you.\" She chuckled as the both closed their eyes because of a blinding light filled the room. \"What happened?\" Courtney asked as she brought her hands up to her head to relieve a scratch. What happened next would make her believe in magic. Her once strawberry blonde hair had turned into short, cropped hairstyle a boy would wear. \"My hair!\" She responded as she looked over at her brother who seemed to be having the same problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you have my hair and I have yours?\" Josh wondered as he tried in vain to get his new mane of hair under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know?\" She replied as she continued to feel her hair. \"You just said that you would take it off my hands if you could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then the flash of light happened.\" Josh interrupted as he played the story out in his head. His new hair started to get in his eyes once more and he grew more aggravated with it. Taking it firmly in his hands, Josh balled it up and threw it behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do that.\" Courtney said angrily as she made her way over to him. \"You're going to get it all knotted up. Maybe if we redo what happened, we can get out hair back.\" She suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that could work.\" Josh agreed as he patted the bed right next to him so that she could sit down too. \"I would gladly take it off of your hands if I could.\" Josh announced and closed his eyes as he anticipated the blinding light. After now seeing the light, he reopened his eyes. \"What happened? Why didn't it work like it was supposed to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney sat there for a moment and thought about it. \"Oh...\" She squealed with delight. \"And I would give it to you.\" The blinding light came back once more and after the two of them were able to come back to their senses, they brought their hands up to their heads to feel their hair. \"I'm back to normal.\" Courtney said happily as she bounced up and down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Josh replied back to her and sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that lady did give you something.\" Courtney said to her brother. \"I guess we both have to agree for it to work.\" Josh sat there for a moment to think about what had just transpired. \"But I do have something to ask of you.\" She then turned to her brother and looked in his eyes. \"I have something that I have to do tomorrow morning, but I have to meet up with Christina to go clothes shopping.  So I was wondering if I could borrow your friends so that I won't have to choose which one to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can.\" Josh answered back to her. \"How long will I need to keep it for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just until until bedtime tomorrow?\" She suggested.  \"So will you swap friends with me until tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we can do that.\" Josh replied tentatively, but that seemed to be good enough for his new found power to work and the blinding light soon enveloped the two of them once again. \"I don't feel any different.\"  He said to his sister but soon found her looking at his computer and noticed all of his friends replaced hers on his Facebook account.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Courtney chuckled as she looked at her brother who had a grim look on his face. \"Oh it's alright. I mean, it's not like you're going to my beauty pageant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's eyes grew 2 sizes when he heard this. \"No, that is one thing I'm not going to do.\" He replied as he brought his hands up to protect himself from the thought of having to parade himself in front of the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad, but we can certainly trade some other stuff and I'm sure you've always wanted to see what its like to be a girl.\" She suggested to him. \"It might even get you a girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm perfectly happy being a guy and I'm just not ready to have a girlfriend yet.\" He announced as he folded his hands across his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" She said smiling as she began to bait him into something. \"I bet you're too scared to make another swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not scared.\" Josh announced proudly. \"I'm sure I could handle almost anything that you would suggest.\" He stuck out his chest to show his bravery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Courtney replied back to him. \"How about we swap _________ and you can prove it to me.\"</span></div></div>",

Besides, I think you would look cute wearing my clothes and that way you know what kind of clothing I like to wear.\"  Josh looked at her with a sense of disdain.  He really didn't want to wear skirts until tomorrow.  \"Well, do we have a deal or do you want to swap something else like height.\"  She couldn't help but grin as she saw Josh's reaction of horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as fast as the reaction came to him, it dissolved, but only when he realized that he needed the permission from him and the person that he was swapping with for it to take place.  \"I don't know if I want that or not.\"  He declared proudly.  \"Heck, I don't know if I want to swap anything else with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney looked at him and crossed her arms in disdain, she didn't realize that both people needed to agree to swap in order for it to happen.  As she thought about this, a little light bulb went off within her head.  \"That's fine.  I could use a break from my friends, but what will I do about Kira's sleep over next weekend?  I mean, you will be over at that girl you like's house..\"  She feigned a thinking pose as she brought her finger up to her mouth to emphasize the effect.  Something that she saw on one of her favorite shows.  Just as expected, her brother didn't seem to know what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't dare.\"  He glared as he took out his phone and noticed all of his contacts were indeed all of his sister friends.  Plus, with her being such the social butterfly, there were quite a few numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me.\"  Courtney replied back to him.  \"So do you agree to swap clothing with me or will you be going to the sleepover next weekend?\"  She cocked her hip slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"  Josh growled, but soon was blinded by the light once more.  As it subsided and he was able to see again, he felt a slight constriction on his chest and around his hips.  He opened his eyes and noticed that he also had her booty shorts and light pink tank top on his body.  But it all seemed to fit him.  He also noticed the clothes that she brought in and found that they also swapped to be his male clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\"  Courtney said seemingly unfazed by what had just happened.  \"I thought these clothes that I brought in with me would be yours, but I guess I was wrong.\"  She sighed as she picked up her new clothes and brought them with her to her room, effectively leaving Josh in his misery.</span></div></div>",

Instead of his friends Steven and Tyler, he found a couple of girls who seemed to be around Courtney's age.  \"Looks like they're my friends until tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down at his clothes and found it a little uncomfortable and demeaning to wear, so he made his way over to the closet to see if he now had something more comfortable and less revealing to wear.

He reached in and found a pair of jeans and quickly put them on over this shorts.  \"I am so ready to get this over with.\"  He sighed as he picked up his remote and started to play again.</span></div></div>",

He guessed that since Courney and her friend Jessica were going shopping tomorrow morning, he would have to go do it now. At least he would fit in now as he had the clothing style of a 12 year-old girl. Josh decided he would double check with Jessica since he had nothing better to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started to type: \"Hey Chris! Are we still on for shopping tomorrow morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, he got a response: \"Sure thing Joshie! Maybe we can go catch a movie after ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird.\" Josh thought. He looked at previous texts and saw different message exchanged he guessed were between Courtney and Christina. Nothing in the previous messages said anything about movie. You hoped she wasn't hinting at a possible date. \"Gross!\" Josh said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about 15 minutes of looking at his phone to see what had been changed, which was quite a lot actually, most of Josh's pictures and videos with him and his friends in it has been replaced with pictures and videos of him with younger girls around Courtney's age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Josh heard a knock at the door. \"Who is it?\" He questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Courtney.\" She said. Then with a loud whisper, she said \"I want to make another swap.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head. \"No thanks sis. I'm done for now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" She begged. \"I'll give you my next week's allowance if you swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it two and we'll talk.\" Josh said, wanting to get the most possible out of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney sighed and then agreed, \"Fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh opened the door and let her in, only to close the door again and lock it behind her. \"What is it now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the mile run.\" She said. \"There's no way I'm gonna pass the time my teacher set for me.\" Josh remembered the mile run from middle school. The teachers always set unrealistic times for students to achieve even though he normally beat the times due to the fact he was a decent runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this have to do with a swap then?\" Josh asked his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trade our lower halves. With your legs there's no way I WON'T pass.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Josh said. There's no way I'm trading my lower body with my sister's. Especially our genitals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take that part out of the swap. Please do it! Do you really want to see me fail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay final offer.\" Josh said. I'll trade you my lower half minus the genitals, if you give me your next two week's allowance and you let me trade our chores.\" Josh normally had to take out the trash, bring in logs for a fire at nighttime when it was cold out, and light the fire and make sure it didn't burn out. Courtney on the other hand, only had to wash dishes, and vacuum the house. Josh decided he wanted to trade this because it would take the heavy lifting duties away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Fine! Deal.\" Courtney said clearly frustrated. Then there was a flash, and when Josh looked down, his new panties and booty shorts were resized once again as they were now accompanied by shorter, slender, hairless legs and much smaller feet. His hips were now a bit wider as well and his butt grew a bit bigger, but not to huge proportions as Courtney's body was only starting to develop. His toenails on his new feet were painted pink. Josh wore size 9.5 shoes, while Courtney wore 5.5. That was going to be a big adjustment for him. At least he still he his penis. Courtney actually stood a couple of inches taller than Josh now, who now stood at 5 feet while she now stood at 5 feet 2 inches due to her new longer, hairier, muscular legs, and bigger feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Courtney said with a smile on her face. \"I'll trade your legs back after school on Monday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then realized it was only Friday afternoon. \"Wait your keeping my legs and feet for the whole weekend?!?!\" Josh asked in worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I need to get used to them before I run don't I?\" Courtney reasoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine.\" Josh said. \"But I'm not swapping our chores back until I get my lower half back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Courtney could say something, their moms voice called out, \"Courtney! Come take out the trash for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom!\" Courtney then looked to you. \"I'll be back on Monday.\" She said leaving and closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh was going at it on his playstation while his mom was preparing dinner, Courtney was doing his chores, and Bri was watching Disney Channel downstairs. After half an hour of preparing the meal, Kim prepared to gather her children for dinner. As the onslaught of zombies on Josh's PlayStation continued, he got a knock on his door from the other side. \"Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Bri.\" His youngest sister called from the other side of the door without opening it. \"Mom told me to tell you dinner is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be down in 5.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay kay!\" She said, obviously in a good mood. He could hear her skip away down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished his level, Josh turned the console off and ventured downstairs. He had to be careful to though because he now had the legs of his younger sister attached to a heavier body, he went slow so he didn't lose his balance. <i>\"At least I still have my dick though.\"</i> He thought. As he neared the bottom of the stairs, the front door opened. Behind it was revealed to be his sister Courtney, who was drenched in sweat. \"What happened to you? Did you just now take the trash out?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Apparently you had to water the plants today as well.\" She said angrily, looking down at him due to her now taller height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I forgot about that. Thanks for doing it for me!\" Josh snickered, obviously amused by Courtney's misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Tell mom I'm getting changed and will be down in 5.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe proceeded to enter the kitchen where his mom was dividing the mac and cheese into different bowls, she also added a side of beans along with each serving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh, Kim and Bri were all finally settled in at the dinner table, the middle Mitchell sibling arrived with a black tee shirt shirt and black sweatpants on. \"What took you so long darling?\" Kim asked her eldest daughter. Courtney explained how she was running late watering the plants and how she got all sweaty, which forced her to change clothes for dinner. \"Fair enough, but we still need those chores done around the house and you know yard work is your job.\" She said, even though those chores usually belonged to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought his sister looked ridiculous with his legs and thought his mom would say something, but she didn't seem to notice the difference. Dinner went by normally for Josh until about halfway through. With his seat at the table, he could see a framed picture of the current for family members and their late husband/father on the wall. What was significant about the picture was that Courtney's legs looked a lot bigger and more masculine in that picture too! Of course the picture was from a couple years ago, which was why Josh's feminine legs even thinner! He could easily tell this because he was wearing one of Courtney's red skirts in the picture that looked ridiculous on him. He couldn't tell why at first, but then he made an educated guess that reality was shifted so it seemed their legs were always like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of dinner, the children reluctant ply ate their beans due to their mother's orders. Beans normally gave Josh gas, but tonight Courtney was the one frequently passing gas! He had to guess that it was because with the lower half swap, she also gained his backside as well, which was causing her to fart. \"Courtney, use your manners!\" Kim scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" She said more and more surprised each time, not knowing why she was farting so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was also farting to a certain extent, but they were very quiet and hardly noticeable. This also helped him figure out why his butt felt a bit 'fatter' than normal. His sister's ass wasn't huge yet, but it was a bit bigger than his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally when dinner ended, their got up and asked her youngest daughter a question. \"Are you ready to go sweetie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Kim's other daughter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to pick up some supplies for Bri's game tomorrow. We'll be back in 15 minutes, so be good!\" She grabbed her keys and opened the door before calling out one last thing. \"Don't forget to clean the table and wash the dishes, Josh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney noticed the confused look on her brothers face and explained to him. \"Cleaning the table and washing the dishes is one of your new chores.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh have a nod before Courtney went on to complain about their mom. \"Why was mom so mad at me for farting? I don't even know how I was doing it, but they just kept coming.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know why.\" Josh said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was because when we switched lower halves, you gained my backside too, and I fart more than you do.\" Josh explained, which eventually caused him to laugh at a frowning Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...\" She said. \"Mom didn't seem to notice our legs either.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know why about that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mr. Know-it-all, tell me.\" Courtney said annoyed. He then showed his sister the difference in the family photo and explained to her his theory of how his swaps caused reality to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually really cool!\" She said. \"In that case, why don't we swap our hair color!\" She said. \"There's always this one idiot guy who calls me a ginger at school even though I'm a strawberry blonde, I want to see what he does if I have your brown hair color.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought against it at first, but then realized that the worst-case scenario on this swap was minor, and it could protect him from future swaps with his younger sister for the time being if he played his cards right. \"I'll only do it if there are no more swaps until I get my friends, lower half, hair color, and clothes back. I want my friends back tomorrow night, and I want the rest back on Monday after school or Monday night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this: I'll give your friends back tomorrow night like we planned. Then, we can make more swaps after I give you those first three things back you mentioned, and I can keep your clothes for a little longer, but we can only make one more swap after that until I give your clothes back. This way, I can't take too many things from you at once until we swap everything back eventually.\" She proposed. \"Besides, with our hair color we will have 4 different things swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that was the best deal he was going to get from Courtney given her manipulative nature, he agreed. \"Deal, I agree to swap hair color with you.\" The flash of light returned and disappeared again within a second. When Josh could see again, his sister now had hair that looked similar to Bri's but shorter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's check this in the bathroom mirror!\" His sister said. When they got there, they turned the light on and saw that they didn't looked that much different. They had the same hairstyles but Josh now had light-colored hair that was a reddish color, while Courtney first saw her new look as a brunette. \"This is awesome! Thanks LITTLE bro!\" She said referring to herself being taller than her older brother now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she went upstairs, Josh cleaned the table and went to work in the dishes after. <i>\"This is going to be a long weekend.\"</i> He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh closed the door after Courtney left, as he didn't want anyone else walking in because he wanted to be alone for a few minutes. He didn't want anyone else finding out about his power either for the time being. Josh felt like going on his laptop and what he saw when he opened it shocked him. Instead of his background picture being of him with his close friends at a professional basketball game, it was replaced with a picture of him and some girls who looked to be Courtney's age at the beach. Also, instead of the swim shorts, that he would normally wear, he was wearing a pink two-piece bikini! He couldn't help but think how weird he looked wearing it. After surfing the web for a few minutes, he heard his phone buzz, he reached over to his nightstand and turned it on to see he got a text:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Josh, are you still coming to the mall with me to shop for clothes tomorrow morning?\"- Christina Goching<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh recognized as the name of the girl Courtney said she was meeting up with the next day. He could just go and get it over with, as long as he kept Courtney happy she would swap back friends with him on schedule. The only problem was he didn't have a ride, so he decided to ask for one:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I plan to, but I don't have a ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh got his response very quickly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay no problem, my mom can pick you up on our way. Is 9:30 okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. Thanks!\" He texted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina sent him a bonus text:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem! Just think, next year you can drive us to the mall. :)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh realized that she was right, as he was 15 now and getting his driver's license in a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Josh heard his mom call up the stairs. \"Courtney! Jennifer is here to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh forgot that she was supposed to come over after his crazy past couple of hours. But he realized that it was his sister's problem now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as though he had nothing to do, he camped outside of Courtney's and Bri's room, where Jenn currently was at the moment. He was listening to their conversation \"So, are you ready for me to help you study for that math test?\" He heard Jenn ask. He guessed that she came to tutor his sister instead of studying with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Just let me get my books out!\" He heard Courtney say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll go to the bathroom while you do that.\" Jenn told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Josh a minute to realize, but the room that his younger sister's shared didn't have a connecting bathroom like his did, which meant Jenn would come out and see him! By the time that he thought of running, it was too late. Jenn walked out and saw him, Josh felt weird around her at the moment. He had to reasons, one being she wasn't his friend anymore, and two, his new clothes were more revealing than hers. \"Hey, your Courtney's brother right?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to say, he responded with \"Yeah... I'm Josh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer.\" She said, holding out her hand and shaking his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I was just looking for the bathroom.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing he was standing in front of the door to the one across the hall from his sisters' bedroom, he opened it. \"Right here.\" He cleared the way for her to walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said. \"See you around.\" She then closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat experience was very weird for Josh because Jenn didn't even remember him anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided to return to his room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking down, Josh noticed that Courtney's, wait scratch that, his bra strap seemed to have fallen off of his shoulder.  Fixing it and putting it back into place like he's seen many times before at school and his sister doing, he made his way out of his room and downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have to divide by y to get the answer?\"  Courtney's voice asked.  Josh turned around to see Jenn and his sister walking not far behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now you're getting it.\"  Jenn congratulated her with a small pat on the back.  As she looked up, Josh couldn't help but watch her long black hair fly behind her.  He was soon snapped out of his trance by Jenn asking him a question.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\"  Josh asked as he shook his head to get the daydream out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if you're in Mrs. Walthrop's 5th period Biology class.\"  Jenn repeated as she tried to place him somewhere, but she seemed to have trouble with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're Jenn right?\"  Josh feigned ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer, actually.\"  Jenn corrected him as they started to descend the staircase to the main floor.  Josh forgot that only her closest friends were allowed to call her Jenn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry.\"  Josh replied as he tried to pull his shorts down a little more so they didn't seem so short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was caught off guard, however, when Courtney talked softly in his ear so that only he could hear.  \"You can't do that, if you do they will fall right off.\"  She giggled at her brother's torture and sat down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Jennifer.\"  Josh and Courtney's mom, Kim, replied as she saw the 3 of them enter the room.  \"Will you be joining us tonight for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind me staying?\"  Jenn replied with a smile, that only recently, melted Josh's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, sweetheart.\"  Kim said as she gestured to the empty seat next to Josh.  \"We always have a seat for you.  I mean, with all the work you've been putting in with Courtney's Algebra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but I feel she's starting to get it.\"  Jenn chuckled as she sat down next to Josh and across from Courtney.</span></div></div>",

After about a half an hour of them double teaming him,  Josh finished his dinner and promptly went back to his room to cool off before he said something that he knew would get him into trouble.  \"I am ready to get this day over with.\"  Josh groaned as he tried his best to stretch his limbs.  Looking over at the clock, he knew he had enough time to take a shower before Courtney's friends, or rather for the rest of the day, his friends came and got him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked into his drawers to see what he had in there and found, as much as he suspected, his clothes were replaced with Courtney's.  Letting out at drawn out sigh, Josh closed his eyes and picked a couple things at random.  Opening them he noticed a plain white panty and training bra combo.  'I guess I will have to wear this, at least for today.'  He then went over to the closet and found a decent pair of pants and what looked like a black shirt.  Feeling proud of what he's been able to do and wondering why it takes Courtney so long to get ready, Josh made his way over to the shower and got it ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh got done with the shower and getting dressed, he heard his Mom calling his name down stairs.  \"Josh, Are you almost ready?

He was carrying bags of clothes that he reluctantly bought, and only did at the encouragement of his new friends, as they thought the outfits looked really 'cute' on him. Nothing really eventful happened other than that. Locking the door, Josh immediately removed his black shirt and training bra because of the latter's discomfort. After kicking off the very uncomfortable shoes he was wearing the belonged to his sister. He took a minute to lay on his bed shirtless. Before he got a knock on his door. \"I'm kinda busy. Can you come back later?\" He asked whoever was on the other side of the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me in! It's Courtney!\" His sister said, not watching the volume of her voice. Josh opened the door to the sight of his sister, who was wearing a red long-sleeved shirt and a pair of jeans, along with a pair of gray sneakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Josh asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just checking in.\" His sister replied. \"How did shopping with my friends go?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ehh... It was boring, but I survived. I got some clothes that your friends told me to get.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, where are they?\" Courtney asked, which was answered when Josh pointed by the door to the shopping bags from the clothing stores. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his sister looked through the clothes, Josh had nothing else to do so he started up a conversation. \"So, what was so important that made you miss your shopping date with your friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Courtney unfolded and held up a pair of skinny jeans in front of her, she proceeded to answer her brothers question. \"I had an interview for an upcoming beauty pageant, and mom had to take me so I could give them my info.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But after,\" she continued. \"Steven invited me to go see a movie with him and Tyler.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious what his sister went to go see with his friends, Josh asked with curiosity. \"What movie did you guys see?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was that new Star Wars movie.\" She said, choosing examine the clothes he bought rather than make eye contact with her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Josh remarked angrily. \"We were talking about seeing that for months.\" He said frustrated, realizing the effects the friend swap between him and his sister where having on his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the clothes her brother bought, Courtney was actually impressed that he managed to get decent looking clothes that she would have probably bought herself. \"Not bad Josh. I didn't know you had such a good taste in female clothing!\" She teased him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina helped me pick out a lot of the clothes.\" He said pouting, still angry he missed the Star Wars movie with his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christina has such a good taste in fashion! I wish she was more socially active though...\" Courtney started, about to go on a long rant about her now former friends. Not that her brother cared though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we swap back now?\" Josh interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swap back what? Friends or clothes?\" She asked. Although, she didn't really want to swap back either at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both.\" He replied. He was already tired after wearing his sister's clothes. Even if it wasn't even for a day. Not to mention, it was probably worse being friends with a bunch of 12 year old girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not going to swap back both.\" Courtney said. \"In fact, I'm not even sure I'm ready to swap back one yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cause Josh's face to be overrun with concern. \"Come on sis, you have to swap back at least one of them now.\" He pleaded. \"It's time to swap back friends anyway. I already went shopping with your friends like you asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we never agreed when we had to swap back.\" She corrected him. \"I like having older friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's swap back clothes then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I like male clothes. They're comfortable and looser than female clothes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last statement from his sister surprised Josh, because she was normally a girly girl and very stylish. He was starting to worry even more that he could be stuck. If she would swap back anything at request, he thought it would be clothes. Now he was starting to get desperate, so he used a threat. \"Well if you won't swap back, I won't include you in any more swaps.\" He sort of meant it, although would probably change his mind if she were to ever want to swap back, whether it was a minute or a year later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to have an effect on Courtney, as she enjoyed these potential life-changing switches that her brother could make. As much as she liked having older friends and more comfortable clothes, she didn't want to ruin her chances at making future swaps. \"Alright fine, you can have one thing back.\" His sister said, which followed by a loud sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh mouthed an \"oh yeah\" in celebration, but his sister didn't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" His sister continued. \"You know how much I love clothes and fashion anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh realized she was hinting that she wanted to swap back clothes instead of friends. At first, he almost gave in on instinct. Even the pants were uncomfortable, not to mention the shirt, panties, and training bra. However, there was something else Josh had in mind. He couldn't stand having 12 year old girls as friends anymore and would choose swapping back for his friends over his clothes any day. He wasn't about to let his sister get her way again like she always did. \"Actually sis, I want to swap back our FRIENDS.\" He said with an emphasis on the word friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have to?\" She whined. \"Can't we just swap our clothes back instead?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh now had assurance that his sister did indeed want to swap clothes back instead of friends, but his guess wasn't the victory. \"Sorry, but you can't always get what you want.\" He taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine. I agree to swap our friends back.\" Courtney said reluctantly. With that, there was the return a familiar flash. When Josh's vision cleared, he went on his phone to get confirmation that he had gotten his original friends back. This clinched one of the few victories he had gotten against his sister in arguments at this point in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis excitement was short-lived however, when his sister went on to gain a smirk on her face, which he didn't like one bit. \"I have an idea.\" She said. \"I'll swap back your clothes with you too, IF you make another swap in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh suddenly found himself internally debating with himself on whether he should take the deal or not. He could get out of his sister's uncomfortable clothes, but he could be risking swapping away something worse instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse for Josh, Courtney gave Josh a catch. \"My only policy is you agree before I tell you what it is I want to swap.\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh realized had to make a decision of whether the clothes he was wearing were THAT uncomfortable where he would risk making a worse swap.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Have fun with my clothes then.\" She said before making her way out and shutting the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided to remain shirtless, and fired up his PlayStation. Kira got online with him, and they chatted and played against each other at the same time. He finally had someone to talk to where he didn't have to worry about making a swap. After about 45 minutes, Kira had to get off and Josh continued on his own before 5 minutes before there was another knock on his door. \"Who is it?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your mother. May I come in?\" Kim said from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kim opened the door and immediately gave Josh a look of dissatisfaction. \"Josh sweetie, how many times do I have to tell you to wear a bra?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" He started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts!\" She said cutting him off. \"Put it on NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what did you need?\" Josh questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna let you kids pick what you wanted for dinner tonight. Bri wants tacos and Courtney wants Chinese. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tacos please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tacos it is then.\" Kim said, leaving but not quite shutting the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh put the bra back on and then the black shirt along with it. He had to say, it was very uncomfortable. Not to mention the tight pants, and the panties. He was starting to feel more and more discomfort, as he thought he would get used to the clothes. That was why he passed on the mystery swap in the first place. He was starting to reconsider his decision though. As he lay on his bed again, the bra made it ten times more discomforting than originally. They were starting to itch too. Eventually, Josh had decided to rethink his original decision. <i>\"Is the 'mystery' swap really that bad?\"</i> He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh came to the conclusion that he would do what he should've done an hour ago. He took off his sister's shirt and bra in an effort to find comfort again and headed to the door to go to Courtney and Bri's room. Before he got to the door however, the cracked open door was opened completely by none other than Courtney, in the same clothes as before. \"What now?\" Josh questioned his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. I just wanted to see how you were holding up.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah about that, I can't take these clothes anymore. I'll do your secret swap, but only if we can swap clothes back first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Courtney said. \"In that case, agree to swap clothes with you again.\" There was another flash of light, which was staring to become familiar. When it departed, Josh was completely back to normal as he was wearing his red long-sleeved shirt with jeans and gray sneakers like his sister was in the first place. Courtney, on the other hand, now looked out of the ordinary as she was wearing her pants and panties on her lower half, but there were no clothes on her upper body! Courtney immediately covered her breasts as Josh looked away. She found the training bra on her brother's bed and put it on, the bra was once again resized to fit her. She also put her black shirt back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's my turn!\" His sister said. \"And you can't say no since you already swapped clothes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Now what's this 'mystery' swap?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's swap bodies!\" She exclaimed smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like... our entire bodies?\" He said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Courtney confirmed laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh immediately face palmed himself when he heard this. <i>\"I should've stuck with the clothes.\"</i> He thought. <i>\"How could I have been so stupid?\"</i> He was going to be stuck with his sister's body all because of his impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are ya waiting for?\" Courtney said. \"We agreed you can't say no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh eyed up the body that was about to become his one last time before saying \"I agree to swap bodies with you.\" The flash came and went, and after, things were much different. He was now nine inches smaller. He looked down and saw that he was now the one with A cup breasts, a flatness in his crotch, wider hips, shoulder length strawberry blonde hair, and a lot less muscle. Courtney on the other hand, was now nine inches taller. She now had a flat chest, a dick and testicles, broader shoulders, short brown hair, and more muscle. Josh's long hair fell in the way of his face again. \"Ugh... not the hair again!\" Josh said, covering his mouth with both hands after. He was surprised by his new high voice that mirrored his sister's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister now felt the uncomfort that her brother felt when he was wearing her clothes. She immediately fixed her new dick inside her panties to make it more comfortable, but it didn't help much. \"I can see why you wanted to swap clothes back so badly.\" Courtney said. She now had a lower voice, she didn't react the way Josh did to his. In fact she kind of liked it. \"I don't know if I would've given up your body for it though.\" She added, rubbing it in her 'brother's' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you even want to make this swap?\" Josh asked, still irritated by his high voice. He now had to look up at his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to see what it was like to have an older male body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to avoid future conflict, Josh decided to next ask a more important question. \"I don't want to fight over when we swap back again, so can we set a time now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems fair. How about next Monday before school?\" Courtney proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEXT Monday?!?!\" Josh asked with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? That will give me a week of experience with an older male body, just like I wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's MORE than a week!\" He whined in a high voice. He sounded just like his 'sister'. Seeing as there was no way out since he needed Courtney's permission to swap again, Josh agreed. But, he wasn't going to let his sister off easy. \"Fine! But we're not making any more swaps until that swap back happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me!\" She said on her way out. She then saw the bags of clothes next to the door, the jeans Josh bought her still visible in the bag, and the clothes remained the same even though Josh was the one who bought them. They were even sized to fit Courtney! \"How come these clothes didn't swap?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess because I bought the clothes with the intention of buying them for you, you're considered the owner of the clothes.\" He guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's pretty cool.\" She said, picking up the bags to take them to her room. She could carry all of them easily with Josh's new strength. \"See ya, SIS!\" She said before closing the door behind her. It sounded weird to Josh considering it was his voice but not him speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took a moment as the aftermath of the swap sunk in. <i>\"Great. I'm stuck with my younger sister's body for more than a week!\"</i> He thought. First, the former boy noticed everything seemed smaller to him because of his nine inch height decrease and smaller body altogether. He then looked down at his clothes, remembering that he had regained his old wardrobe. The red shirt felt weird, as his breast had no covering against it, and they were brushing against the shirt. He found the breasts to be quite sensitive, especially when he touched, rubbed, or squeezed them. He stopped though, as it felt wrong touching his sister's body like that. His sneakers were also much smaller. He had to guess they went from his size 10 to a size 3 or 4. Courtney had very small feet. He looked over at the clock, and the time was still only 3:49 PM! He still had the rest of Saturday, Sunday, a full week of school, then another weekend with his 'sister's' body before they would swap back and Josh would regain his rightful body. <i>\"This is going to be a LONG week.\"</i> He thought.</span></div></div>",

Agreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Courtney said with a grin. Josh was a little worried at how quickly she had agreed and wondered what he was about to get himself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First lets swap clothes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know you'll still go through with my swap if I let you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll just have to trust me.

It was something that his Grandfather taught him to do when he was younger and it saved him a lot of regret when an argument came.  \"Listen,  I'm sure there is something else you would like to swap instead, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mischievous look flashed in Courtney's eyes as she thought about how she could get what she wanted.  \"Well, we could always swap our you know.\"  She did a slight whistle as she pointed to her brother's groin.  Deep down, she's always wanted to see what it would feel like to have a penis and get to stand up when she had to go to the bathroom.  Courtney blushed slightly as she thought about playing with herself.  She cleared her throat as she tried to gain some composure.  \"Or we can swap heights or even muscles.\"  She flexed her own arms to show the very minimal amount of muscle in them, the amount that often times won beauty pageants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on her brother's face seemed to say it all, as the frown and sound of disgust emanated from his mouth.  \"I don't want to do any of those things.\"  He replied as he thought of himself with each of those traits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you promised that you would get what I picked.\"  Courtney replied with a huff as she crossed her arms against her chest.  \"You're not pulling away from our agreement are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Josh quickly replied as he tried to save himself.  \"I just really didn't like the conditions is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the main condition was that I get to pick and I pick my chest.\"  She stood her ground and acted defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"  Josh agreed, breaking under the assault of his sister's bullheaded nature.  Once more the light blinded them both and Josh almost instantly felt an irritation on his chest.  Still not able to see straight due to the blinding light, Josh brought his hands up to his chest to relieve the itch and irritation, instantly feeling the slight bumps.  \"I can see why you wanted to swap these.\"  He tried his best to keep his shirt from rubbing against his sensitive chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you are saving me.\"  Courtney said as she ran up to her brother to give his a hug.  \"Listen, if you need anything just let me know.\"  She hinted to her brother about doing another swap with her, as she nudged his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"  Josh grumbled as he made his way over to his Playstation to start it back up and play a little bit before anything else happens.</span></div></div>",

It was just too awkward for him to sit there with one of his best friends, who was brainwashed and didn't even remember him. He took off his bra and decided to get a jumpstart on his studying. He had planned on doing it with Jenn, he had to do it by himself now considering his current situation. Josh started to read through his textbook, adding important notes as he went. After about a half an hour, he heard a knock at his door. \"Come in.\" He said to the unknown person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person entering the room was Courtney once again, wearing her older brother's looser clothes resized to fit her. \"Hey big bro.\" She said, before noticing the removed bra sitting on his bed. \"Are you not wearing a bra?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was uncomfortable so I took it off. Is that a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, especially because you don't have breasts. But mom does, so I'd be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took a mental note to not let his mom see him with a bra. \"What brings you here?\" He asked, pushing his notes aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney dove in to her problem with no hesitation. \"Well, Jenn is gonna spend the night, but it will be too cramped with us two and Bri in there. Can we swap rooms for the night so Jenn and I have more space?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't too keen on the idea of swapping bedrooms with her, largely because then he would have to sleep in a room with Bri. But he still cared about Jenn, even if they weren't officially friends at the moment. He wanted to make sure she felt as welcome and comfortable as possible. \"Sure, I'll swap rooms with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flash came, which left some drastic changes. The walls were painted light purple, and his bed now had Courtney's pillows and bedsheets on top. Josh noticed in an open closet that his former shirts were once again in there, but still in his sister's size. The dressers now had other clothes such as sweatpants, jeans, boxers, and more. Josh's school supplies on the homework desk were replaced with Courtney's and her posters took place of his. Last but not least, his TV was still in the room but not his PlayStation. He guessed it was moved somewhere downstairs since there was no TV in the room his sister's shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe was another knock on the door, Josh was about to say \"come in\" once again, but Courtney beat him to it, and rightfully so seeing as the room now belonged to her. Jenn was the one who opened the door. \"There you are Courtney! I was looking all over for you.\" She then noticed Josh though. \"Oh sorry, we're you two busy? I can wait outside.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's fine, Josh was just about to leave anyway.\" Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was?\" Asked Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you were, because this is MY ROOM!\" She said emphasizing the final two words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh exited in defeat, not knowing where to go next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While they were normally only buddies on the console, the way she talked to him made it seem as they were closer. Like they were more than just gaming buddies, but maybe close friends. It didn't take long for Josh to realize that he inherited this friendship from Courtney. After a couple hours of teaming up on their games, Kira told Josh she had to leave for dinner, which possibly could have meant Jenn left to go home and eat dinner with her family. Josh locked the door in case Courtney did end up coming back, wanting to make another swap. Josh played for about another half an hour before turning off his game. He looked over and saw the time was 7:30 PM. <i>\"It's only 7:30?! This day is taking forever, I can't wait to swap back!\"</i> He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he got on his bed to lay and ponder his next move, he heard a knock at his door. \"Who is it?\" He asked, hoping it was either his mom or youngest sister, Brianna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Bri! May I come in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" He said while advancing over to unlock his bedroom door.

Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, just checking in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last statement wasn't as enthusiastic as the others. \"You sure. Anything wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.

It was his duty as her big brother to look out for her. \"I can tell your lying, come on and just tell me.\" He sat down on his bed and motioned for his sister to do the same next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well today at school there were some boys that were picking on me. They stole the soccer ball that me and Jenna were playing with at recess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Josh was surprised, he didn't remember anyone being like that when he was that age. He decided just to give her some brotherly advice to help his sister out. \"Well they're just trying to get into your head. You shouldn't let them ruin your day just because of one little thing they did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought to myself. But then they pushed Jenna down and she hurt her arm, she said she hopes it won't be broken. Then she wouldn't be able to play on the team.\" Bri was referring to the all-girls soccer team that she and her friend Jenna played on. \"Mom says it's because the boys have crushes on me and Jenna, but I don't think she's right because they're mean to everyone in our grade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" He said angry that kids were even capable of being like that and getting away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that _______ could be _______ so _________.\" Bri told her brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've always worn female clothes and been friends with girls her age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My power is just messing with your brain.

He realized that he could actually help make Bri's wish come true. At first he thought it would get himself into another situation like the one he was currently in with Courtney, but eventually convinced himself this time a swap could actually help someone and it was the right thing to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh finally spoke up. \"What if I told you I could make that happen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You could come to my school for me and Jenna?\" Bri was suddenly beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike he did with his other sister, Josh explained everything that happened. From the meeting the old lady, to gaining the power, but he did leave out the swaps with Courtney. He didn't really want his siblings to know that the other sister was also swapping with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll come to my school with me?\" Bri asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't come with you, but I can swap our schools. On Monday, you'll go to high school for me, and I'll take care of your little problem. Then we'll swap back Monday night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's even better!\" Bri cheered. \"I'll take it.\" There was once again a flash of light that filled up the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" Bri wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew it did, but had to pretend he did not know since he made not mention of any swapping with Courtney. Playing the part, Josh reached into his book bag (now pink instead of green due to his swap with Courtney) and pulled out a card the size of a credit card. \"Here, look at my school ID.\" He showed her a card with his picture on it. All students in the school district were required to have one for a reason Josh did not know. Below his name was a subtitle saying that he was in the third grade at the elementary school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome!\" Bri said. \"I'm gonna go get mine.\" She was back in about a minute, and held up her ID to Josh's face when she did. \"See?\" His little sister said pointing to the subtitle below her name which said she was a freshman at the high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh realized there was one fixable error in the swap he had just made. \"One more thing, if you're gonna survive a day of high school, you need to have the smarts for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Bri asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means we should swap education. This way, you can be as smart as I am and do a good job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I agree.\" The two siblings swapped education with another flash of light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will we know it worked?\" The youngest Mitchell inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tried to think of ways to test his sister. He couldn't remember anything from his algebra class, but reached into his memories of Jenn tutoring him since she was already in geometry instead. He thought of something she told him. \"Bri, if <i>x</i>-4=1, then what is <i>x</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, 5.\" She said without thinking. \"How did I know that?!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you have my schooling now.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sick! Before I go, I have one request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" He asked, scared that she would start asking for random swaps like he was before he told her of the power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's swap friends! It'll make going to school easier for us, and Jenna will trust you more when your helping her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh realized she was right, and made one last agreement for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri didn't have to bother asking if the swap worked this time as a picture that the siblings were standing next to had gone from Josh with his friends Tyler and Steven to Josh with Bri's friends Emily and of course Jenna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, are we done here?\" Josh questioned toward his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, thanks Joshie!\" She said before leaving his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day had arrived.  Josh was going back to the third grade.  He was going to help his little sister's friend.  Helping his little sister is what a big brother was supposed to do.  Due to the swapped he had made with Bri he was ready to go.  The school thought he was a student just like Bri had been.  All of Bri's friends were now his friends.  He knew the appropriate school work so he wouldn't seem out of place that way.  But he was over a foot taller than all the students in his class and eight years older.  Not withstanding his clothes which were of the fashion of a middle school girl (skinny jeans, a grey t-shirt with a scooped neck that would show the top of his breasts if he had any, matching grey canvas sneakers and a purplish red zip up hoodie ) than third grade and everyone else he was just anothyer student at school and was treated that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bullies wouldn't mess with him, he was taller and stronger than they were.  He was going to use that to help Jenna.  But when he talked to Jenna she wasn't as enthusiastic as he had hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenna,\" he said getting serious after a greeting.  \"I am going to talk to those boys and make sure they will never bother you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you are going to threaten them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  I'll tell them if you mess around with you, then you are messing around with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you can't be around forever. What do I do if I'm alone and they threaten me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell them that I will beat them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if that'll work.  What if they don't back down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm still scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I wish I was as strong as you, then they will leave me alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't think like a teen anymore.  He swapped that away by accident so that Bri could cope in high school.  Josh wasn't as sure of himself as he had been.  Also he now had a true friendship with Jenna.  He didn't want to see her hurt, not because she was Bri's friend, but because she was his friend now.  \"I have an idea,\" he told Jenna.  Josh then went to explain about what happened with the old lady and that he has this new swapping power.  He said that he had tested it and it worked, but he didn't tell her who he tested it with nor that she was seeing the changes right in front of her.  As a third grader he liked to show off.  His maturity had dropped to fit his circumstances.  He wanted to prove himself to his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that is really really cool.  But how will that help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can swap strength and then when they come around to bother you you can beat them up.  It they know how strong you are then they won't bother you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey yeah.  That'll work.  OK let's swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast.  This will only be for today.  Once they know how strong you are they won't bother you any more.  We'll swap back tomorrow when all this is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna hugged her friend Josh and said gratefully, \"Yeah we'll swap back tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was happy to help out his friend.  </span></div></div>",

They hadn't believed her at first, they all thought she had always been very strong.  But these there third graders and some were relatively easy to convince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat at the lunch table with many of Bri's friends.  he knew them all and he considered them his friends now.  He expected them to talk about little girl stuff, but every one wanted to know about his swapping power.  Josh told them it was true, but they didn't believe him.  They wanted proof.  If Josh had his own intelligence he would have just let it go, but he felt he had to show them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, what do you want to swap?\" he asked the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristy said, \"Well my mom always makes me wear a dress to school, or at least a skirt with a blouse.  I wish I could come to school like you in jeans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?  OK, then.\" he said.  There was a big flash of light that no one except Josh and Kristy saw.  Kristy was now wearing jeans.  Not the jeans that Josh had been wearing, but jeans from her closet.  She was no longer required to always wear 'nice clothes' to school.  Josh now had on a cotton skirt that had been in his closet when he left for school and a matching blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you believe me now?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG yeah I believe you!\" Kristy said.  But no one else did.  They didn't see anything unusual, Kristy wore jeans all the time, it was no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prove it to all five of his friends he had to swap something with each of them.  To Paige he swapped her fear of monsters under her bed at night.  To Tricia he swapped half the difference in height.  Josh didn't know if he could just swap six inches but he could.  Now he was an inch shorter than Paige when he used to be about a foot taller.  Sondra for the other six inches and now he was the shortest one in his group of friends.  Alicia got his hair, his hair was now a mousy mess of curls with lots of split ends.  Finally Nicole's allergy to peanut butter was his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone wanted to keep their swap for a day.  Josh didn't mind, he was a hit at his table and everyone liked him.  This was suddenly very important to him now.  He needed to fit in.</span></div></div>",

Never! I'm not doing that.\" He says, trying to sound pretty convincing to Courtney that he wouldn't swap their genitals under any condition. \"Why would you even want to swap that anyway?\" Josh asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to see what it was like honestly. You know peeing standing up, don't have to wipe, no periods, that stuff.\" Now Josh really didn't want to swap because he overheard his mom recently acknowledge the fact that Courtney had started puberty and started having periods as early as three months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't care!\" Josh said. \"There is no way I'll ever swap that. Especially with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister twirled her strawberry blonde hair as she normally did when trying to think of a clever plan. Which was bad news for Josh. \"That's a shame\" Courtney teased. \"Because I was supposed to go to the movies next week with Jennifer so she could try to get together with her crush. The only problem is I would've had to spend time with his really annoying friend on a double date. I guess you have to do that now.\" She smirked with her arms folded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way you would make me do that\" Josh said. \"You're probably lying anyway.\" Josh then pulled out his phone and saw under text messages that there was indeed a guy texting him about a double date, and he was certainly coming off as a weird guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See\" Courtney cooed. \"I told you!\" Josh looked at his phone in disbelief for a few seconds before finally turning it off and putting it back in his pocket. \"So what's it gonna be?\" His sister said with a smirk on her face. \"Swap our genitals or go on a date with some 12 year-old weird dude?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening.\" Josh said visibly frustrated before finally coming to a decision. \"Ugh.. Fine I agree to swap genitals with you\". There was then another sudden blinding flash, and by the time it was gone, Josh reached down into his pants and found that there was definitely something missing down there. Courtney in the other hand, now had an obvious bulge coming from her tight yoga pants, Josh was surprised the pants could stretch out that far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we done now? Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite\" she said sounding like she was in pain. \"Can we please swap underwear because these panties are WAY too tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if we are done after this.\" Josh said in a demanding tone rather than a negotiating one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I will leave you alone after.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I agree to swap underwear with you\" Josh said as another blinding flash took place and he then looked underneath his pants to see pink lace panties overtop of his new vagina that were resized to fit him. Josh could see that Courtney was now wearing his blue and gray plaid boxers resized for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney then went to pick up the folded clothes off of Josh's bed when she noticed the panties she had folded there were now boxers in her size. \"Weird.\" she said. \"I thought these would be your panties now, but I guess not. She picked them up and walked outside before adding \"I'll be back to swap our friends back tomorrow night\". She then closed the door and walked toward her room.</span></div></div>",

Going back to his bed, he sat down and couldn't help but feel unnatural with the new void in between his legs.  The days events began to play out within his in mind and he couldn't help but wonder how it all began to spiral out of control.  Should he have kept his mouth shut or would his sister have found out some other way.  He really wouldn't know now.  Looking over at the clock, Josh noticed that it was starting to get late and it was still raining outside.  \"Looks like I won't be doing anything else tonight.\"  He said to himself as he went over to his dresser to get some pajama pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the drawer that normally held his pajama pants, Josh noticed that not only were they were all neatly folded, but also that he had a strange white and pink fabric next to it.  Cautiously, he picked it up to get a better look at the mysterious item and immediately regretting it.  What he had just picked up was more than likely the effect of the underwear swap that he did with his sister just before she left his room.  He picked up one of her bras, the white and pink fabric seemed foreign to him and had only seen it when his Mom did the laundry.  Looking down at his own chest, Josh quickly put down the fabric and looked down his shirt and noticed that he wasn't wearing one at the time being.  \"She must not have been wearing one when she wanted to do the swap.\"  Josh concluded as he sighed a great relief.  He went ahead and got a pair of pants out of the drawer and pulled down his jeans to reveal the pink, lacy panties that he was forced to wear.  What seemed to disturb him the most was the lack of bulge in the front where his 'package' normally would be at.  Josh pulled up his pants and sat over at the computer to see what other changes had happened with his swap with his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogging onto his social media accounts, Josh could automatically see the changes.  Gone were the pictures of him and his friends over at the local amusement park and gone were the pictures of them having fun at the beach.  In their stead, Josh found pictures of him and several other girls, he seemed to be standing a head taller than the rest of them.  But that didn't seem to cause him any grief, because he was smiling along with the rest them.  He looked at the names in his friend's list and knew most of the names from when Courtney had a sleepover.  There was Megan, Christina, Josie, and of course, Kira.  Kira, Josh always found to be cute in a geeky sort of way.  When she came over, she was always wanting to play on his PlayStation.  What he found amusing was the fact that she bested him several times when they played Call of Duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh continued to look at the pictures, he couldn't wait to swap back.</span></div></div>",

However, ignoring what had occurred was more difficult than before. He was able to put having new friends in the back of his mind, the unnatural void between his legs was impossible to ignore. He had a vagina for crying out loud, and it belonged to his sister! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes of playing without interruption, the door was opened by none other than Courtney. She spoke up before Josh could say anything. \"Josh, I need your help!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Jenn invited me to go swim at the country club tomorrow afternoon.\" She told Josh, which made him a bit upset as she was already making plans with his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got these breasts I'm gonna have to swim around with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that have to do with me?\" He asked, only half listening while focusing on his game still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate swimming with them.

The cup size hadn't changed, but the straps were a bit longer due to Josh's bigger size. He went over to his underwear drawer, which now had bras and panties instead of boxers inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\" Josh questioned, waiting for a no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing actually.

He was certain that she would come back to him trying desperately to get at least her friends back from him.  As he was beginning to sit down on his bed, a low vibration started to come from on top of his dress.  \"Oh my god.\"  Josh groaned under his breath.  Getting up to see who it was, he felt deep down that he already knew who.  Picking up the phone, a message from Josie flashed across the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">Josh, missed you after school.  Hope you are going to the game Wednesday.</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned as he looked at the phone.  Over the last three days, his phone certainly hasn't had a break.  Between Christina and Josie, the phone was nearly half full from messages.  Laying the phone back down, he made his way back over to the bed.  Sitting down he grabbed his Biology book and started to brush up on the chapter that was going to he was going to be tested on.  As Josh was reading he heard a light knock on the door.  \"Yeah?\"  He called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"  Courtney replied as she entered his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her enter his room, Josh felt a little excitement thinking that she came in to swap everything back.  \"Oh, hey Courtney, what's going on?\"  He put his book down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was wondering if you wanted to swap?\"  She wondered as she browsed the different books on his bookcase.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled broadly as he heard this.  \"Sure thing, are you ready to swap everything back?  Getting tired of that thing between your legs, huh?\"  He gestured down below her waist where his penis sat between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, I just wanted to swap our friends back.\"  She chuckled as she looked down.  \"This thing is so awesome and I love how I don't have to sit when I pee.  I just don't like having to sit alone at lunch and not having anyone to talk to between classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt his heart sink as he heard this.  \"Oh.\"  Was all that he could say as he heard this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You actually thought that I was going to swap everything back?\"  She chuckled at her brother's predicament.  \"I told you, since you didn't want to swap with me further, you're going to be stuck with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you want to swap our friends back?\"  Josh asked, trying to understand what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like I said it gets kind of lonely not having anyone to talk to.\"  She reaffirmed.  \"So do you want to swap them back or will I have to leave again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it for a minute and not wanting to let this little opportunity walk out the door, Josh turned back to her.  \"Fine, I will swap friends with you.\"  The bright light enveloped the room and Josh knew that the swap took place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, bro.\"  She waved as she started to walk out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, are you willing to make another swap if we swap back our groins?\"  Josh eagerly offered trying to get rid of the vagina between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\"  Courtney stood there at the door frame thinking about it.  \"You know what?\"</span></div></div>",

It was part of the deal, and you said ANY swap.\" She argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but you're a bit young for high school and don't have the knowledge yet. I can't have you ruin all of my grades and hard work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then swap our schooling too, I'll be prepared to take your place.\" She suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had a chance to back out right then and there and keep his groin as well, but that was not the type of person he wanted to be. He took pride in his honesty. \"Ugh... okay, deal!\" He gave in as another flash covered his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if I'm correct, you've got some tests to study for bro.\" She taunted. \"I'm gonna go do high school things.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean it is a little embarrassing in the locker room when changing before gym. I keep catching the other girls staring at it and sometimes that makes it get hard which is also embarrassing.

He thought about what Courtney had said about the other girls checking her out in the locker room. He hadn't really thought about it before she'd said something, but maybe some of the other guys had been checking him out. He'd noticed, but not really paid attention to, a lot more guys trying to cover their groins in the locker room which could have been them trying to cover up boners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought caused a strange reaction. He felt an unfamiliar sensation in his groin. It felt like his panties were wet, like maybe he had peed a little without realizing it. He reached down an patted the crotch of his pants, but they still felt dry. When he reached his hand into his pants to feel around though he felt a lot of moisture. It only took him a second to realize what had caused it: he was turned on. It was the first time he'd been turned on since he had swapped genitals with his sister which was why he hadn't recognized the signs at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that the swap was only going to be temporary, he had touched his vagina as little as possible over the last three days, only touching it to wipe after peeing and to wash it in the shower. Now that it looked like he might be stuck with it for a lot longer than he had hope, he thought that maybe it was time to explore it a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a teenage boy he was used to relieving his sexual tension often, sometime more than once a day. He hadn't realized how much sexual tension he had built up over the last few days of not relieving himself.</span></div></div>",

He knew that if he went over there, then she would want to study for next year's standardized tests.  Instead, Josh went downtown to see if he could find anything to do.  After ten minutes the store fronts were in view.  The city that they lived in didn't have a lot to do, but it had something that most cities don't.  \"Looks like the Jack's is dead.\"  Josh chuckled looking at the old Arcade.  The business had been a big thing back in the 80s, but instead of closing down, like most had, Jack's had persevered and survived.  It had even outlasted the Chuck E. Cheese that closed down a couple years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Josh.\"  A feminine voice called out to him.

'Jack's Game and Play' was one of the best places in the state to play not only miniature golf, but also laser tag, arcade style games, and retro games from the 80s and 90s.  \"How have you been?\"  Kira asked as they got near the pinball games.  Josh put his tokens inside the glass encased game and heard the series of 16-bit tones to let them know that the game.  The ball rolled into place and they both heard the signal that the game was ready.  \"You've been really distant lately.  You know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed as he pulled the launcher back and put the ball into play.

I forgot my History report, I get caught in the rain, I lose my manhood to my sister, and now this.\"  He gestured to the game and lightly slammed the top of the game to let out his frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, it will be okay.\"  Kira she put her hands on Josh's arms to help calm him down a little.  \"Wait, did you say that you lost your manhood to your sister?\"  She asked and looked at Josh's face to see the color draining from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh paused for a moment and knew that he just let slip about his new power.  \"Well you see.\"  He pulled the plunger back once again and started to play the game again.  While he played the game, Josh told Kira everything.  He told her about the old lady, about Courtney swapping her hair with him, swapping it back, then the friends, and finally how he swapped out his penis for her vagina.  \"Now she won't give it back.\"  Josh sighed as the game signaled that the last pinball was lost and that the game was now over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you're telling me that you had a penis?\"  Kira asked as she tried to wrap her head around it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and from what I can tell nobody will know that anything is different unless they are involved with the swap.\"  He pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think that you're pulling my leg.\"  Kira laughed as she elbowed him in the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew what he had to do.  \"I will make a swap with you so that you know that I'm telling the truth.\"  He turned back over to Kira and motioned over to the chairs next to the doors that led outside to the miniature gold courses.  \"Let's go sit over there and I will show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat down, Kira excitedly sat next to him wondering if this was true and how it worked.  \"So what do we have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to swap?\"  Josh groaned.  \"Just tell me and I will think about swapping it and show you that I'm telling the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira sat there for a moment and smiled broadly.  \"I want to swap our _______\"</span></div></div>",

Josh could feel a little uncomfortable under his shirt and looked down to see two slight bumps.  He brought his hands up to his chest, hoping that they were just the way his shirt wrinkled up, but knew what he would find.  He brought his hands up to his chest and squeezed them slightly and felt an odd sensation course through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"  Kira looked down at her now flat chest and opened up the top of her pullover and noticed that it was slightly hairy.  \"I didn't think it was really going to happen.\"</span></div></div>",

Why would you want to swap something away like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, how do you know how my life is?\" Kira cried out, almost as if they were playing co-op on one of their shooter games. \"You have a lot to learn if you want to get closer to my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you talking about?\" Josh held up his hands trying his best to prepare him from what was coming. \"Is Jen talking about me at home?\"  He replied as he felt his face starting to burn slightly and turned away to look at the pinball game once again in an effort to block Kira from seeing him blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look.\" She sighed and brought her fingers up to her eyes as if she was trying to relieve a headache. \"Are we going to do this or not, because I'm starting to think that you're just blowing smoke up my butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me just say one thing first and then I will agree to it. So I don't what to have any interruption until I'm done. Okay?\" He looked over to his friend and gaming partner with great sincerity. She nodded her head and waited for what he had to say. \"I just wanted to say that you're the youngest child and I know that you probably don't have as much responsibility.  I know that I, personally, do more chores that Bri and Courtney combined.\" He looked back at her and could see her straight look face was now brimming with an exuberant smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I was just trying to see what you would do.\" She laughed as she nudged him in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You conniving little...\" Josh mumbled something under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you want to swap our lives or not, because I'm really starting to think that you're lying to me.\"  Kira asked with a slight bored look on her face that she usually got when she was paired with a new player that didn't know her distinctive playing style and tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I agree.\" He sighed and both of them were blinded by the accompanying flash of light. Josh could feel a little uncomfortable under his shirt and looked down to see himself wearing the exact same clothes that Kira had been wearing just a few seconds before. He brought his hands up to his eyes and hoped that if her rubbed them, in hopes that it was just an illusion brought on from the brightness of the light to his unprotected eyes.  But looking down again, Josh knew that it wasn't an illusion at all, but in fact his and Kira's new reality.  He felt a slight tickle on the back of his neck and thinking that it was a tag from his new sweatshirt that he now wore, but instead felt his now longer hair.  Bringing it around his neck to get a better look at it, he noticed that it was a little darker than his own color.  Not knowing what happened, Josh brought his head around to see Kira, now sporting his lack of control for a hairstyle and more importantly his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Kira looked down at her now masculine attire and back over at Josh who seemed just as shocked as she was. \"I didn't think it was really going to happen.\"</span></div></div>",

He couldn't help but think about when his sister would return and give him an answer though. He thought a decision would take a few seconds, but then the seconds became minutes, and the minutes piled on up to the point where an hour had passed. He was starting to think that Courtney was not going to return and was just pulling a trick. When he was about to accept that, his sister finally returned about an hour and 15 minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bro, I thought about what you said. I think I'm willing to go through with it as long as I pick the swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was just relieved she was actually willing. \"That's fine, what did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I tell you, I'm just going to warn you that it's a pretty big swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think anything 's better than the situation I'm in now, go ahead.\" He challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, instead of just swapping our genitals back I say we swap our entire bodies the way they are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden Josh was not so sure if having a vagina was worse. \"Why would you want to swap that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've gotten to experience one part of a male body, I figured I should get to experience the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight: I get my penis back but I get the rest of your body with it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs bad as the idea sounded, Josh just really wanted to fill in the void between his legs. It wasn't like he was trading lives or clothes along with it. \"Deal!\" He surprisingly said without hesitation, as the light instantly enveloped the room. Josh found himself to be much shorter, and there was an orangish-brown hair color covering his face. He cleared it out of his sight and saw his own body staring back at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey 'LITTLE SIS'!\" Courtney taunted with her new deeper voice. She found the voice very fascinating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\" Josh replied in a high voice. <i>\"That'll take some getting used to.\"</i> He thought, as it wasn't his own voice making his words. He examined the rest of his body after that, first and most obviously, he now had two A cup orbs protruding from his chest. His entire body was smaller as well besides his height. His arms, legs, stomach, everything pretty much. He was happy to see though that he was successful in the real reason he had for swapping, as he looked underneath his now smaller pants which were resized to fit his smaller female body and saw his original member beneath the panties he was still sporting, which were now back to their original size. It was weird seeing his own groin between his sister's legs though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only complaint he had now was the same once Courtney had when they made their first genital swap. \"Hey sis, can we swap underwear so yours aren't so tight down there?\" He asked while pointing downward,  and also still adjusting to his voice.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He considered it totally gross.  He had to put a pad in his underwear.  It was disgusting.  Then there was Courtney's friends who were always communicating about this and that.  They might call on his cell and he would have to talk to them until they got off.  But they always sent what seemed like a hundred messages a day.  There was also posts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and if that wasn't enough they would send him long emails.  It was always about silly girlie things that he didn't care about.  It wasn't just one of her friends it was all of them.  He could see the same message or post from three of four of them within a few minutes.  he didn't know if this was more annoying than his period.  He wanted out and he wanted out soon.  In a week he would have his second period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney on the other hand was happy with what she got.  She liked having older friends.  Some of them had their driver's licenses and could drive her around.  She was invited to high school parties.  Some of the kids there would drink, but she didn't have to.  Finally, even though she was still a girl and everyone knew it, she didn't have any of the girlie problems like her period.  They had swapped their groins not their genders so she was still considered a girl even though she had a penis and testicles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had had enough and he hatched a plan to get everything back.  \"Mom,\" he said to Kim, \"doesn't it concern you that Courtney has so many older male friends?\"  Josh knew this line of thought would convince his mother.  In Kim's mind, since Courtney had a penis it didn't matter too much that her friends were boys.  But now that puberty was starting, that could lead to unfortunate things.  Kim should stop it now.  That is what Josh tried to convince her and it worked.  Kim said she would talk to Courtney about having friends her own age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it had been a month and Josh wanted more than just getting his genitals and friends back.  He wanted revenge for Courtney refusing to swap back earlier.  Josh decided to give all of Courtney's friends away (and maybe her groin too) to Bri, such that when they swap back, Courtney would end up not with her friends but with a bunch of eight year olds.  It would take planning to do it.  But Josh was determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh told Bri the story of how he got his power. And then suggested that they swap her interest in Soccer with with his interest in video games.  He convinced her that with his height and size playing with the little girls, he would always win.  If he won it would be like she won.  It was a silly argument, but it worked on an eight year old.  Then he told her he needed to have her friends because they would be his teammates and he could play better if all of his friends were on the team.  Bri swapped that again.  She knew that all of Josh's friends were eleven and twelve year old girls which wasn't too different than her friends.  No one besides bri and himself knew of the swap.  They all thought that these were his friends and he had always played soccer with eight year old girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew he would never swap back with Bri since he didn't want Courtney's friends back.  That was the point.  As far as soccer went, he would just have to finish the season and then he could just quit.  But after playing he would find that he did really like soccer..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Josh was prepared all he had to do was wait for Mom to make Courtney swap friends back with him.  Hopefully Courtney would give him his penis back too.  If not he could bargain with her.  If she didn't want all her friends to be little eight year olds forever, then she would give him back his groin.  Only then would he help her.</span></div></div>",

Josh replayed the important moments of yesterday in his head. Nothing eventful happened at school, so that left at home. First, he gained his new power on the way home, where Courtney then checked in. He told her the truth of his power, where he eventually lost his friends and manhood. Nothing happened after that, as Jenn called for a rain check due to her mom wanting her to spend some bonding time with her sister Kira. Josh pretty much played video games and avoided people as much as possible for the rest of the day. He didn't want anyone else discovering his power yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took a shower, got dressed and headed downstairs. He ate breakfast with Courtney, as Kim was scrambling to get Brianna ready for a soccer game. Courtney ran him through what he would need to do to pass off as a normal member of her friend group so Christina would not suspect anything. Josh noticed that Courtney was trying to hide her new member by wearing a baggier pair of pants, something she did not normally do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Bri's friend Jenna picked her up to take her to the game, Courtney and Kim headed out to travel to whatever was interfering with her clothes shopping this morning. <i>\"Maybe she's just going to a beauty pageant.\"</i> Josh thought, realizing Courtney never told him what that 'other thing' she had to do was. Deciding not to trouble himself on thinking too much about it, Josh decided to watch some TV until Christina arrived. He was home alone after all and didn't have much else to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, Josh heard the door bell ring and went to go answer. He opened the door and standing behind was Christina. \"Hi Joshie!? You ready to go?\" She asked cheerfully and giving him a big hug. Josh was about to correct her about saying Joshie, as he really only let Bri and Jenn call him that. He decided in the end that it was best not to considering Chirstina was now considered a friend. As for the hug, it surprised Josh, but he knew that Courtney's friends did it all of the time. He just lightly returned the hug, where he hopped into the back seats of Mrs. Gooching's mini van before they headed off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay.\" Courtney replied back to him. \"How about we swap something else and you can prove it to me.\"  She crossed her arms across her chest in a defiant manner and tried to look intimidating.  \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stood there for a moment trying to think about his options.  He could just say no and live with having Courtney's friends for a couple days and as soon as she went through a full day of classes without anybody to really talk to, she would come crawling back to him.  \"I'm thinking.\"  Josh announced as he continued with his thoughts.  '<i>But knowing Courtney, she might find newer friends and forget the ones that she had before hand.'</i>  He sighed as he looked over at his sister.  \"Since you're holding my friends hostage for the time being, I think I have no choice but to do another swap with you.\"  Courtney started to squeal with delight at hearing this, but stopped when she saw her brother holding up a finger telling her to hold on a minute.  \"But if I do his, then I want to have my friends back.  Deal?\"  He held out his hand to seal the deal with his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I get to pick what I want to swap with you?\"  She wondered as she hesitantly waited to seal the deal with her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Within reason.\"  Josh agreed as he looked down at his hand to help move the negotiation along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  She eagerly shook his hand.  \"I want to swap our sport skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\"  Josh sputtered as he nearly choked on the bottle of water that he was drinking.  He wasn't really a jock or anything, but he could certainly hold his own at most sports and enjoyed watching them every once in a while.  While he watched the games, he would get learn the rules and found them to be more enjoying as he learned more about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, next week we're having our Sporty week at school.\"  Courtney started to explain, but Josh didn't really need to hear it because he remembered it well.  During Sporty Week, all the classes were able to do a sport of their choosing for an hour or two so that the students could try out new things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's all week.\"  Josh complained as he fell back on his bed.  \"I guess I can do that, but in order to do it, I think you'll need my sport knowledge too.\"  Thinking mostly out loud to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly and impatiently, Courtney replied.  \"I Agree.\"  The blinding light once again enveloped the room and nearly blinded them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courtney!\"  Josh complained as he rubbed his eyes trying to get them readjusted back to the normal light after the bright, white light dissipated.  \"I was thinking out loud, not making a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's too late now.\"  Courtney suggested as she got up from her brother's bed.  \"And besides, you got your friends back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>But at what cost.</i>'  Josh thought to himself.  \"Just leave me alone.\"  He pointed to the door.  Shrugging her shoulders, Courtney left her brother's room, excited to try out her new sport skills and knowledge.  As the door closed, Josh just lay on his bed trying to figure out the damage that was done by his sister's eager attitude.  He thought back at baseball and all that he knew were the basics.  The play threw that ball and the other team had to hit the ball with a stick.  That's all he knew.  '<i>Did the games have a time limit or was there another way for them to keep track of the time.</i>'  Josh just shook his head trying to think of how the game went.</span></div></div>",

It sound like somebody playing basketball.  He got up from his bed and looked out the window to see Courtney having the time of her life.  The smile on her face showed how much she was enjoying herself.  Seeing this, Josh knew that he'd done something good for another person and decided to go down to see if he could play too.  \"Hey sweetie.\"  Kim replied with a smile on her face.  \"Glad to see that you've come out of your room.  Where are you heading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd go outside and help Courtney train.\"  He replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim chuckled at this comment.  \"Sweetie, you're not really a sporty kind of guy, but it's nice to see that you want to help your sister.\"  She rubbed his cheek with the back of her hand in a loving manner.  This seemed to aggravate Josh just a little bit and decided to see if he could put the record straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mom, she took it from me.\"  Josh complained.  \"I'm the one that's decent at basketball, I'm the one that loves baseball, and I\"m the one that played basketball in middle school.\"  He waited for a minute to see what his Mom would say about this revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's rich.\"  Kim chuckled.  \"Maybe you should go out and see if you can help Courtney.  You sure do have the ambition for it.\"  Josh groaned as he heard this and decided to leave it alone for right now and made his way out side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind him, Josh heard a loud bang as the ball hit the back board and through the hoop once more.  \"Oh, hey Josh.\"  Courtney replied when she saw her brother coming out of the house to meet her.  \"Thanks again for letting me have your sports skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your going to give it back to me after school on Monday.\"  Josh corrected his sister as he pick up the ball and tried to pass it to his sister, who had her arms out ready for the pass.  Letting the ball go, he found that it only traveled less than a few feet before bouncing over to her open arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice toss spaz.\"  Courtney commented, making sure to use the same term that her brother used when they were growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, it's only because you took my sport skills.\"  He replied as he watched her dribble the ball to the far end of the drive way and throw it into the net.  \"Wow, I bet that was a 4 point Home run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney couldn't help but laugh at the comment.  \"I think you mean a 3 pointer.  Man, I can't believe that I was that dumb with sports.\"  She shook her head in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"  Josh spat back as he sat down.  \"And it's because you took my knowledge too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can give you something that I like to do in exchange for the skills and knowledge.\"  Courtney offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat down for a minute to think it over.

She was the opposite gender, younger, smaller, and had no skills that appealed to him accept the ones she already took from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Josh thought of two things that seemed appealing that he might find useful. The first thing was swapping chores. The chores for him required hard work and were a lot more strenuous than the work his sisters had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option was a bit more complicated. It was obvious that Courtney knew how to socialize since she had many friends. One thing that Josh thought he could take was her ability to socialize with females in order to get closer to Jenn. He didn't relate to his crush much when it came to gender and he felt that he needed more confidence when talking to her, in order to build confidence in maybe asking her out in the future. If he got Courtney's ability, he would be able to conquer both of those problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh finally came to a decision after some hard thinking. \"Okay Courtney, I'd like to swap ________.\"</span></div></div>",

In the end, he decided that he was going to take something from his sister to get a little bit of revenge.  He took a moment to think it over and see what would be the best thing for him.  He took a moment to go back on the porch and watched Courtney continue to toss the basketball into the hoop.  As he watched, Josh couldn't help but be amazed at how well she was putting her ability to work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>What would be the best thing to take from her so that she would want to swap back?</i>'  Josh thought to himself.  <i>'I could request to take her clothes.</i>'  Being quite the social butterfly, Courtney always loved her clothes.  It was the thing that set her apart from all of the others in her year.  Even though they weren't the most expensive, her outfits were considered so well put together that everyone was jealous.  Josh shook his head to get the idea out of his head.  Even though it would make his sister more manly looking, it gave him a chance to get his skills and knowledge back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you thinking about?\"  Courtney asked, breaking Josh out of his thoughts.  Josh looked over and noticed that she seemed a bit exhausted from her little work out that she just had.  A thin layer of sweat started to bead around her brow and her skin seemed to a bit flushed, all from the bit of exercise that she'd been through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing really.\"  Josh lied as he turned away to avert her gaze, not wanting his sister to get an idea of what he was thinking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what you were thinking?\"  Courtney giggled as she set the basketball down so that she could sit down next to him.  Josh couldn't help but blush at the comment.  \"I thought so.\"  She nudged her brother as she continued to giggle a little more.  \"So what were you thinking about getting in exchange for your skills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought about it for a moment.  Did he want to tell his sister what he was thinking about?  \"Yeah, what of it?\"  He asked defensively, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what did you want to swap?\"  Courtney asked eagerly.  \"We can swap strength or height.\"  She named off a couple things, then had a stroke of genius.  \"Ooo...  We can swap heights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I was thinking about.\"  Josh replied with a somewhat angry tone.  \"If I were to swap any of those things, they would only help you.\"  He spoke with a matter of fact tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what were you wanting to swap with me for your skills?\"  She asked, waiting for her brother's decision with great anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided that now was the time to declare what he wanted in exchange for his skills.  Taking a deep breath, Josh told her what he was thinking just a moment earlier.  \"I was thinking about taking your clothes and maybe accessories, I don't really know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney couldn't help but laugh at her brother's request.  Just the thought of him wearing her clothes over the weekend or even going to school with him made her giddy.  \"I think that would be a great idea.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you do?\"  Josh asked with great confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Courtney replied back with a grin on her face.  \"That way you know what it's like for a girl to get ready in the mornings.\"</span></div></div>",

I mean, it was your idea after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Josh just looked away, trying to avoid eye contact with his younger sister.  \"Well, I was just trying to get something that I know that you loved and that came to mind.\"  He replied trying to explain his reasoning.  \"Well are we going to do this or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hold on a minute.\"  Courtney smiled at her brother's eager attitude.  \"I think we need to stop and talk about what we're going to swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is there to talk about, I want to swap our clothing and accessories.\"  Josh suggested as he was ready to get this over with and go back upstairs.  \"I mean, it's not that important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is.\"  Courtney suggested as she sat down next to her brother.  \"You see. If you want to have my accessories, then that will involve makeup and jewelry.  So if you want that then I think you'll need to take those skills to go with them.\"  She watched as the gears turned in her brother's head once again.  She was hoping that her brother would take the swap.  Since she'd seen what her brother could do, Courtney wanted to see if she could see how other people live.  Thinking back at her life, her Mom always seemed to push her to do the beauty pageants and she never really had time to do anything else.  Whenever the time came around for the sport tryouts, she'd always wanted to tryout for some of them, but her Mom always seemed to push her towards the pageants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I want that?\"  Josh groaned as he thought it more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I don't know if I want to swap back your sport skills.\"  Courtney pointed out to her brother.  \"I only want to see why Bri has a great time being a tomboy is all and you don't want to swap that with me.\"</span></div></div>",

He really wanted to get his sports skills back from his sister, but he really didn't want to take all those things from her.  \"Well, are we going to do this, or am I going to enjoy having these new skills?\"  She asked with a huge smile on her face and she picked up the ball.  \"I mean, I don't mind being able to do this.\"  She chuckled as she bounced the ball in a seemingly professional manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, what did you want to swap?\"  Josh asked in a seemingly perturbed manner.  He watched in disbelief as Courtney stopped dribbling the ball and started to spin it on her finger, seemingly out of spite to his ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean what?\"  Courtney asked with a chuckle.  \"I already told you.\"  She put the ball down and held up her hand, to help count everything.  \"Clothes, accessories, and our daily routine skills.\"  Holding up the three fingers to show that she meant business, Courtney felt like she had the upper hand in the negotiations.  Ever since they were kids, she had always known the way to get what she wanted, which is why Josh knew she would make a shrewd businesswoman later on in life.  \"Do we have a deal or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought about it for a moment and started to sigh.  \"Fine, I agree to swap those with you.\"  The bright light seemed like a flash of lightning from the clear sky.  As the spots disappeared from Josh's eyes, he felt like something was off about his body.  Looking down, he saw that he now wore his sister's clothes.  'Why did I do this?'  He thought to himself as he brought his hands up to his ears to feel that they were now pierced and he also had her earrings in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  Courtney chuckled as she bounced up and down with excitement. </span></div></div>",

What he wore was 'nice' on Courtney, but he had a different complexion than she did.  He had gained not only all of her skills but also her passion for fashion.  He decided to go into the bathroom and reapply his makeup.  He found all of his (formerly Courtney's) makeup supplies.  The first thing he did was wash off the makeup with cold cream to make sure it was all gone.  He knew that was the best way to reapply it.  Then he started with some foundation.  He really needed a lighter shade than she did, but this would have to do for now.  Then he worked on the various areas of his face.   All his makeup had to fit together, but each area had it's own concern.  Before putting on eye makeup, he decided he had to pluck his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took almost an hour before he got his makeup on right.  It wouldn't take this long every time, but since this was his first time he was taking extra care.  Plus he had to get the colors right.  Next he went back to his room to change into another outfit.  That also took a while to find the right apparel.  Courtney complained about how long it took to get ready, but in reality she had loved every minute of it.  This love carried over to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs times passed, all he remembered about sports was that he had liked it once, but it didn't seem as important to him now.  Not as important as getting properly made up.  He knew that with the swap, no one would find his new apparel and make up choices odd.  They might not like how he put together an outfit, but everyone had their individual tastes.  Maybe if he never got back his sport skills it might not be such a bad thing.  They were silly games anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis might help with Jenn he thought.  Jenn didn't know much about sports, but she knew a lot about fashion.  He could invite her to go shopping.  Maybe things will heat up with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Plus, the sooner he agreed to a swap the sooner Courtney would leave him alone. \"Okay, works for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light cleared, Josh opened his eyes to find that nothing in the unchanged bedroom had changed from what Josh could tell. \"Did it work?\" He heard his sister ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. I guess time will tell.\" He said while leaving the room. \"I'm getting a drink I'm parched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived downstairs, he started to pour a glass of water when his mom walked in. \"Josh sweetie, Brianna and I are heading over to her friend Katie's house for a few hours. It just you and your older brother. He's in charge.\" She said before kissing his forehead and walking out toward the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well that was weird.\"</i> Josh thought as he finished pour his glass and headed back upstairs. He found Courtney to still be in his room when he returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did mom leave?\" She asked. All Josh did was nod. \"Okay then, I want to show you something.\" She gestured for him to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me first.\" He said. \"Mom said she was going to be gone with Bri for a few hours, she said 'it's just you and your older brother. And he's in charge'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" She questioned curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" It seems that we swapped gender roles in the family as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That cool.\" She replied. \"But look.\" She motioned for Josh to come to his nightstand. Now he knew what she wanted to show him. Every picture of him was now of Courtney. \"It seems that I'm the older brother now and this is my room.\" She explained with a sense of joy in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... that can't be.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... it is.\" She answered while mocking him. \"Have fun sharing a room with Bri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" He mumbled sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also Josh, I need my privacy. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave my room.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts! I'm the older brother and mom said I'm in charge. Now get outta my room, SIS!\" Courtney teased him, obviously having fun with the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Josh could do was hang his head in defeat and exit, he certainly was not enthusiastic about the swap he had just made now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His mom was just finishing up on fixing his breakfast, while the girls were at the circular table. \"There's my biggest girlie!\" His mother said, using a a nickname normally reserved for Courtney. As she brought his plate over, he saw that Bri was mindlessly eating away at her breakfast. However, he noticed Courtney was sitting in his normal seat at the table across from their mom. And sure enough his mother placed his breakfast where his sister normally sat, in between her mother and younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wow, she's really embracing this 'big brother role'.\"</i> He thought. His mother took a seat at her normal seat, so Josh sat in between her and Bri with no other option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than the seating change, nothing was out of the ordinary for the remainder of breakfast. As they were finishing up, Josh heard the phone ring. \"I'll get it.\" He said, as Courtney's seat was closer to where the phone was located. \"Mitchell residence, Josh speaking. How may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Josh, it's Jenn.\" His friend said from the other end of the line. \"I was just wondering if you wanted to swing by my house for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, sounds like fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" She continued. \"if your older brother wants to come too Kira's just playing video games by herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell her, see ya soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that hun?\" His mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenn. She said that me and Courtney are invited to go to their house.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that fine Courtney? Do you want to go with your sister?\" Kim inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in.\" Courtney said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'll drive you two over then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri left after breakfast with her friend Jenna for their soccer game, so having her tag along was unnecessary. After the two siblings packed some stuff up in their new rooms, they both headed out to the car with Josh leading the way. We went to the passenger's seat door and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh eh eh!\" His mom said to stop him. \"Josh, you know that the oldest gets to ride in the front. Sit in the back and let your big brother sit up here.\" Knowing he had no chance at winning an argument, Josh headed toward the back he saw Courtney smirking at him as he walked by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new older brother was surprised with the extra perk she was getting to go with being older, and was starting to realize there opportunities that would open up since she was viewed as older. <i>\"I could get used to this.\"</i> She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He quickly found a blue, 'retro' looking 'School House Rock' T-shirt and slipped it over his head.  Just in time too, because just then he heard a light rapping on his door.  \"Yeah?\"  He called out to the mysterious visitor behind the doorway.  The door creaked open and in walked his youngest sister, Brianna, carrying her 3rd grade math book under her arm.  \"Hey there Bri, what's going on?\"  He asked as he picked up the drenched shirt and tossed it into the hamper across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you wet?\"  She asked him as he eyed both him and the shirt that he recently tossed into the hamper.  \"What happened to your umbrella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably wouldn't believe me if I told you.\"  Josh sighed as he motioned her to his used office chair next to his desk.  \"Do you need help with something?\"  Bri nodded and caused her long brown hair to fall into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need some help with these multiplication problems.\"  She responded as she grabbed the rogue pieces of hair and brought them back behind her ear in an attempt to bring them back under her control.  Bri then placed the book on the desk and opened it to the problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's not too bad.\"  Josh chuckled as he went on to explaining the rules for multiplication and smiled when he saw his younger sister nodding, almost as if she understood what he was saying.  \"So you got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I get it now.  Just the way that she was explaining it.\"  She then gestured her hand going over her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they tend to over simplify things.\"  Josh chuckled again and they sat in silence for several seconds before one of them began to talk once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened to you today after you missed the bus?\"  Bri wondered as she continued to work on her math problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew he couldn't keep it to himself forever so he told her the story.  How the rain seemed to come down in sheets, how he met up with the older lady that had the creaky walker, and how she gave him the 'gift'.  \"That's about it.\"  Josh replied as he sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't really believe that mumbo jumbo, do you?\"  Bri laughed as she thought about magic.  She had always been much more down to earth than her other siblings and didn't really believe in magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I haven't really had a chance to think about it.\"  Josh sat back down on his bed and looked at the hamper that he tossed his clothes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri brought her nose closer to the paper, almost as if she was really getting into the math problems.  Just as she did, her hair began to fall into her face once more.  \"I wish that this hair would just stay where it supposed to be.\"  She grumbled as she brought it back behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would certainly take it off of your hands if I could.\"  Josh said to her reassuringly as he gently patted her on her back to emphasize the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I would gladly give it to you.\"  She chuckled as the both closed their eyes because of a blinding light filled the room.  \"What happened?\"  Bri asked as she brought her hands up to her head to relieve a scratch.  What happened next would make her believe in magic.  He once long, straight brown hair had turned into short, cropped hairstyle a boy would wear.  \"My hair!\"  She responded as she looked over at her brother who seemed to be having the same problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you have my hair and I have yours?\"  Josh wondered as he tried to get his new mane of hair under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know?\"  She replied as she continued to feel her hair.  \"You just said that you would take it off my hands if you could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then the flash of light happened.\"  Josh interrupted as he played the story out in his head.  His new hair started to get in his eyes once more and he grew more aggravated with it.  Taking it firmly in his hands, Josh balled it up and threw it behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do that.\"  Bri said angrily as she made her way over to him.  \"You're going to get it all knotted up.  Maybe if we redo what happened, we can get out hair back.\"  She suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that could work.\"  Josh agreed as he patted the bed right next to him so that she could sit down too.  \"I would gladly take it off of your hands if I could.\"  Josh announced and closed his eyes as he anticipated the blinding light.  After now seeing the light, he reopened his eyes.  \"What happened?  Why didn't it work like it was supposed to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri sat there for a moment and thought about it.  \"Oh...\"  She squealed with delight.  \"And I would give it to you.\"  The blinding light came back once more and after the two of them were able to come back to their senses, they brought their hands up to their heads to feel their hair.  \"I'm back to normal.\"  Bri said happily as she bounced up and down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\"  Josh replied back to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that lady did give you something.\"  Bri said to her brother.  \"I guess we both have to agree for it to work.\"  Josh sat there for a moment to think about what had just transpired.  \"But I do have something to ask of you.\"  Bri turned to her brother and looked in his eyes.  \"I have a game tomorrow morning and I was wondering if I could borrow your hair so that it wouldn't get in my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can.\"  Josh answered back to her.  \"How long will I need to keep it for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the game is tomorrow afternoon, so I guess until bedtime tomorrow?\"  She suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we can do that.\"  Josh replied tentatively, but that seemed to be good enough for his new found power to work and the blinding light soon enveloped the two of them.  He felt his new hair cascade down his shoulders to the middle of his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I could enjoy this.\"  Bri chuckled as she looked at her brother with her hairstyle on his head and noticed his grim look on his face.  \"Oh it's alright.  I mean, it's not like I'm making you play in my place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's eyes grew 2 sizes when he heard this.  \"No, that is one thing I'm not going to do.\"  He replied as he brought his hands up to protect himself from something.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad, but we can certainly trade some other stuff and I'm sure you've always wanted to see what its like to be a girl.\"  She suggested to him.  \"It might even get you a girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm perfectly happy being a guy and I'm just not ready to have a girlfriend yet.\"  He announced as he folded his hands across his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\"  She said smiling as she began to bait him into something.  \"I bet you're too scared to make another swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not scared.\"  Josh announced proudly.  \"I'm sure I could handle almost anything.\"  He stuck out his chest to show his bravery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Bri replied back to him.  \"How about we swap _________ and you can prove it to me.\"</span></div></div>",

I mean, if it's a big deal, we can swap it back when we swap the hair back.  Or you can say no and we can keep our hair for a lot longer time period.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh stood back for a moment thinking about what he could do.  One... He could go along with what she wanted and swap his penis with her, so that she could see what it would be like.  Or two...  He could just tell her no and keep her hair for an unforeseen amount of time.  He looked at his sister and noticed that her face looked to be a little scruffier than her normal fair, smooth complexion.  \"Well, I know one thing.\"  He said with a smile on his face.  \"You got all of my hair with the swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri looked down at her pant covered legs and lifted up one of them to look at them.  To her amazement, they were now covered with a small amount of darkening hair.  Josh's legs were just starting to get their amount of hair on them with his advancement into puberty.  She let go and just shrugged.  \"I can live with it for now.\"  She said with a smile.  \"So what will it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew he couldn't stall her forever and made his decision.  \"Fine, I agree to swap genitals with you.\"  With this phrase uttered, the blinding light flashed once more.  After he regained his composure once more, he brought his hands down to his crotch and noticed that it was certainly flatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri, on the other hand, found her pants bulge out significantly.  \"Ouch.\"  She cried out as she brought her hands down.  \"I think my panties are a too small for your... I mean, my new stuff.  What do you say we do one last swap to make each other more comfy while we are like this?  How about we swap underwear too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, if it will make you happy.\"  Josh mumbled as he closed his eyes in preparation for the blinding light.  After the light subsided, he felt a new constriction around his waist.  He pulled the band of his pajama pants to see the pink, polka dotted panties that his sister wore just earlier, but now enlarged to fit his larger frame.  He could only sigh when he thought about how long he was going to be stuck with his new additions.  \"Are we done now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri could only smile as she felt the her brother's boxer shorts around her waist.  \"I think we are.  Having this shorter hair will help me win tomorrow's game.  But, I think I need to go use the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shuddered as he thought about his own sister going to the bathroom with his penis.  \"Fine, but lets just keep this between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\"  Bri agreed.  \"Oh and when you have to use the restroom.  Don't forget to wipe.\"</span></div></div>",

He had his sister's much longer hair and by the looks of Bri's face and arms, her body hair too.  Plus he lost his male equipment to her as well.  \"I guess I better check out what I will have to deal with.\"  He said to himself as he made his way over to the mirror on his door.  The first thing he noticed, of course, was the silky, brown hair.  He looked at his desk, which was located right next the door, and noticed a vast array of hair ties.  \"Hmm...\"  He picked up one of them and did a quick attempt at putting his hair into a ponytail.  Next, he proceeded to take his pants off and looked at his newly hairless body.  The thing that bothered him the most was the absence between his legs.  Bri's panties, that were now his, called out to him.  \"Should I see what I got myself into, or should I show a sense of dignity and leave it alone.\"  He wondered as he thought about Bri in the room across the hall, probably living it up with his penis.  \"I guess she's going to have fun with it and I'm going to see it when I have to use the restroom.\"  He reasoned as he brought his new panties down his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his disgust and amazement, his new equipment amazed him.  I mean, what average teenage boy doesn't think about this stuff.  He looked at it and tired to use his fingers to get a better look at it in the mirror and noticed that he really didn't feel anything.  \"She must be too young and it's not sexually mature yet.\"  Josh said to himself in a bit of disappointment.  \"But I guess that's a good thing and I won't be getting a period.\"  He pulled back up his panties and sat back on the bed to play the Xbox.</span></div></div>",

Very worried for his sister he go to her and tried to calm her down, \"Sh sh shhhh. Bri.  Take a deep breath.  Tell me what's wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri stopped her wailing and took a couple of long sniffs, \"I I I broke them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did what?!\"  Josh said sounding less calm than he'd like, what had his sister done to his manhood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wa-wa-was jumping on the bed and then a landed on my butt.  But-but I was on your...\"  Bri pointed to her groin before continuing, \"And it hurts so much!\"  Bri started to cry all over again.  Trying to be a good big brother Josh gave his little sister a hug, partially to make her feel better and partially to hide his enormous grin.  Josh knew this pain, he had sat on his manhood once as a teen.  Once.  After than he made sure that whenever he sat down he was properly 'arranged' down there before Josh sat to avoid the extreme pain that his sister was now experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter holding the hug for a while Bri's crying let up long enough for her to speak without stuttering or sniffing, \"I don't want it anymore.  I want you to take it back.  Now.\"  Bri didn't say this like a request, she was making a demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh were ready to take back his manhood despite the pain it would bring, but that was before his sister got a little nasty.  \"I don't know, you did this to yourself and should live you might have to live with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to.  I want to trade groins.  Now you say that you want to too.  And if you don't agree I'll never give it back.  Never ever ever.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's eyebrows raised, his little sister had gone from requests, to demands, to threats.  He wanted to take his manhood back but he didn't want to give into Bri like this.  Surely she wouldn't go through with this threat and try to keep it forever, that's just crazy talk.</span></div></div>",

I agree to swap our genitals back.\" The flash of light that took place when the siblings swapped hair and genitals for the first time arrived again. When Josh's vision returned, he felt pain coming down from his crotch. He didn't feel as much pain as he expected though, realizing that the only reason Bri was crying was because she had never felt pain down there before, but he had more of a tolerance for it. He decided to fake pain so Bri wouldn't suspect anything though, he was happy he got his own groin back and didn't want Bri trying to take it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh groaned and hunched over while grabbing his crotch and pretending to be in pain. \"Still with tears running down her face, Bri come over to help Josh. \"Is there anything I can do to help Joshie?\" She said before sniffling once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was about to say no and leave quickly, but then he remembered the constricting feeling on his groin and remembered he still had Bri's panties on! Similar to the short-lived groin swap, Josh had no intention of remaining with her underwear. In fact, the tightness on his groin was causing about half of the pain at the moment. \"Can we swap our underwear back too?\" Josh said still hunched over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Bri said disappointedly. The bright light once agin returned, and Josh's boxers were around his waist when he could see again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sis.\" Josh said, weakening his voice in an effort to trick his sister. He walked out slowly, and then went back to his room normally once his youngest sister could no longer see him. When Josh got back to his room he felt his long hair and remembered Bri still had his hair, but it was better off the hair being the only remaining thing to regain rather than his penis or underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh resumed playing his video games and after about another half an hour, someone knocked on his door. \"Come in!\" He said, silently praying it wasn't Bri. His other sister Courtney appeared from behind the door, visibly frustrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tired of mom telling me what's right and what's wrong. She's always trying to make me behave like a 'young lady'.\" She complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh figured it would be a good time to be a role model for one of his younger siblings. \"She's just trying to help you. Right?\" He said, trying to reason with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, but she's always saying 'well, a lady wouldn't do this' or 'a lady wouldn't do that'. I wish she would just treat me the way she treats you. She doesn't care about what you do as much because your a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took a deep breath, realizing he was probably about to tell Courtney something he would regret. \"You know, I could help you with that.\" He hinted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" She said not understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh went on to explain everything from the old lady at the bus stop to knowing his swapping powers worked for sure after testing it with Bri and her hair, leaving out the groin and underwear part though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, did you swap back your hair?\" Courtney asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was about to say no, but then he saw something that he didn't notice before. Right behind Courtney, there was a picture of a younger him with his father before he died. The picture had changed now however, as Josh had Bri's longer hair. He realized that his swaps affected reality! That meant that his new hair appeared as normal to everyone else. He didn't try to hide it from Courtney because he didn't think twice about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we swapped back after a few minutes, we were just testing the power.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, because I would have loved to see you with short hair!\" She laughed. \"I just can't picture you with it.\" Those two sentences confirmed Josh's theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you believe me?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, but it doesn't hurt to try.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Josh said nodding his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how can you help me?\" Courtney asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I could swap our perceived genders so mom would think your a boy.\" He told her, but she looked unsure. \"We wouldn't undergo any physical change to make it easier.\" He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last part did for Courtney as she said \"Okay, I'll swap my perceived gender with yours.\" She said. For the sixth time of the day, the blinding flash came, but this time, nothing was different physically after the light. \"Did it work?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" Josh said. \"There was no physical change, but we will find out soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Courtney said trailing off. \"How long should we stay like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about until tomorrow morning?\" He proposed. \"That will give us enough time to test it without having to stay like this for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got yourself a deal!\" Courtney said as she held her hand out to her brother, where they officially shook on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after their handshake, the siblings heard their mom call up the stairs. \"Hey _____, can you _________ for me?\"</span></div></div>",

Everything he had been wearing went into one of the bags.  That included his sneakers and socks.  The only thing he had on that was truly his was his underwear.  He only had that because he didn't have a pair of Jenn's panties to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Jenn arrived at Josh's house.  She was accompanied by her mother.  Jenn was wearing Josh's clothes.  They weren't anything special, jeans and a t-shirt.  Kim instructed Josh to help bring in Jenn's stuff.  They brought in Jenn's clothes also stuffed in garbage bags.  Jenn had many more bags of clothes than Josh did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn and Josh both looked miserable.  \"OK,\" Kim said, \"it's time to make it official.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courtney I want to you say, 'Jenn will you swap clothes with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courtney say it!\" Kim warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenn will you swap clothes with me?\" Josh asked reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Jenn's mother told Jenn to say something similar to what Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courtney, will you swap clothes with me?\" Jenn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SAY IT,\" Kim reminded Josh in a menacing tone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes,\" josh said in a meek voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I will swap clothes with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the magic words spoken.  Josh found himself wearing his own clothes again.  He was back into his own jeans and t-shirt.  Jenn was wearing her own skinny jeans, white blouse and matching jacket.  The problem was that she thought she was wearing Josh's clothing.  Inside all the packed bags, clothing were swapped.  The bags brought by Jenn, contained all of Josh's clothing and vice versa.  Josh would be wearing his own clothing, including underwear from now until his mother told him he could 'swap' back but everyone would think he was wearing girl's clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was such an odd turn of events.  Josh could be wearing his own jeans and t-shirt but everyone would treat him like he was wearing a dress and pantyhose.  At least if he was truly wearing Jenn's clothes he could choose the least feminine close possible.  But since they were his own clothes he didn't know which clothes was like wearing a dress and which clothes were like wearing jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh helped Jenn pack up her car and then they drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

Does that about cover it?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep that's all.\" Josh said shuddering at the reminder of his past swaps.<br>\r\n\"So, if we wanted to, we can fix this clothes swap?\" Jenn suggested.<br>\r\n\"Only partly, we can makes sure everyone sees the clothes as normal again, meaning I would actually be wearing yours instead of them just thinking so, but I doubt I can rewrite reality to get rid of this punishment.\" Josh said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of silence, Jenn spoke up again.<br>\r\n\"So we'll be stuck with everyone thinking we're cross-dressing anyway, so we might as well actually wear them.\" She suggested.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, wearing my own clothes again does feel good.\" Josh said not sold on the idea yet.<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Josh, then at least you will get to experience wearing my clothes and you can choose what clothes other people will see you wear, right now, I'm not sure what would count as a dress or skirt.\" Jenn said reminding Josh of the thoughts he was having earlier.<br>\r\n\"You bring up a good point, but I have worn my sister's clothes for a while already.\"<br>\r\n\"My clothes are different from her's, come on Josh, I want to try on yours as well.\" Jenn practically begged.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This had gotten way out of hand.  Josh had made several swaps and now he wasn't called by his own name and even though he was wearing his normal clothes people would be thinking he is dressed like some fairy.  Not to mention his tween sister is dressed like a little girl and vice versa.  Even the voice in his head sounded like a girl.  Josh wanted to return to normal and then once everyone was back to themselves he could swap things again.  Hopefully this time with some thought behind the swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first place to swap was to return to normal as far as his own clothes were concerned.  \"OK, let's swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I agree to swap clothes with you,\" Josh said formally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Josh knew it he was back to wearing Jenn's clothing.  He had on her jeans and t-shirt.  It was more girly than a boy should wear but in general, it wasn't too bad.  Underneath it all he was also wearing panties although he wasn't wearing a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Jenn said.  \"Maybe after this punishment is over we can swap something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I'm starting to feel all swapped out.  I mean look what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll think differently later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got off the phone and Josh tried to come up with a plan to get everyone back to normal.  Josh was deep in thought when his mom entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courtney,\" she announced, \"I've come to pick out what you will be wearing tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, I can pick my own clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not during the punishment.  I'll pick out what you will be wearing.  You'll just find some unisex thing and that wouldn't be a punishment would it.  So let's start this thing out with a bang.  Not a dress, we'll save that.  But not skinny jeans either.  I think a nice skirt and a blouse.  Something nice for school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I think you should wear some heels with that.  It's school so nothing too high, maybe something an inch and a half or two inches.  Let me look through YOUR things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was speechless.  He didn't expect his mom to go even crazier than she had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you wanted to wear Jenn's clothes, you should get the full gambit of her things,\" Kim continued.  Then she looked through the drawers.  She knew what was in there as she had helped Josh pack up all of Jenn's stuff.  He didn't like putting away his own stuff, putting away Jenn's stuff wouldn't have happened if Kim hadn't insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see for tomorrow, you can wear this skirt and tunic.  Let me find some heels to go with this.  Also, from now on, you are always wear a bra at all times from when you get dressed in the morning until you are in your nightgown or pajamas at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't have breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care.\"  \"Wait,\" Kim said, as if she just remembered something. \"What's the weather for tomorrow? Isn't it supposed to be chilly in the morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it's chilly, then you'll need to wear tights under your skirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Josh mumbled under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back.  I'll check the weather on cable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh should have never swapped back with Jenn.  He missed his old clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though they were now practically his, they were still Jenn's size, so they were kind of tight on him still.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Josh was now standing in some panties only.<br>\r\n\"Mom this is embarrassing.\" Josh said as she covered himself with a towel.<br>\r\n\"You are going to wear a skirt tomorrow, as well as a nice top, I can't have your hairy legs and arms show with them, you need to shave them.\" She ordered handing him a razor.<br>\r\n\"MOM!\" Josh said but was cut off by a glare.<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back, if you are not shaved by the time I am back, I'll shave them for you.\" She declared.<br>\r\nShe grabbed Josh's discarded clothes and put them in the laundry basket, as she took it with her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, there go my jeans.\" Josh said as he watched his mom leave.<br>\r\nHe looked at the razor and his legs and arms, not enjoying what he was about to do. He knew how to shave, so he grabbed everything he needed and started to slowly shave his arms and legs as smooth as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him some time, but Josh finally shaved his body fully smooth. He decided to shave his chest hair as well, as it looked ridiculous with his now bare arms and didn't want his mom to complain.<br>\r\nHe looked into the mirror and saw his body now devoid of hair, which he wasn't used to at all.<br>\r\nAs he was admiring his work, his mom entered the bathroom once again and had an approving expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to see you actually working with me here.\" She said as she laid down some stuff on a nearby shelf.<br>\r\n\"Of course, I mean I did swap clothes with Jenn and I should face the consequences of it, might as well just embrace it instead of fighting it.\" Josh said, causing his mother to smile.<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear you say that, but I expected you to do this, so I've come up with something.\" She declared.<br>\r\n\"Tell me.\" Josh said curiously.<br>\r\n\"If you behave tomorrow and wear the clothes I picked for you, I may allow you to choose your own clothes at home.\" This caused Josh to start smiling.<br>\r\n\"But, you will still wear a nice skirt to school, that will not change.\" She clarified.<br>\r\n\"Sure mom, thanks!\" Josh said smiling.<br>\r\n\"But only if you behave, if you don't I'll still choose for you.\" She said with a stern voice.<br>\r\n\"Yes mom, I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now here, put these on.\" She said as she handed him a pile of clothes. \"I still want you to try them on for now so I know how they look and fit on you.\"<br>\r\nJosh looked over the pile, there was a nice matching bra to his panties, there was a short denim skirt and a nice white blouse.<br>\r\n\"Could you teach me how to put this on?\" Josh asked as he grabbed the bra, being met with an approving nod from his mother.<br>\r\nHis mom helped Josh put on the bra, afterwards he put on the tight denim skirt and white blouse, which were also of course in Jenn's size, but they seemed to fit him pretty well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look quite cute Courtney.\" His mom nodded in approval.<br>\r\n\"Are we done for now?\" Josh asked hoping his mom was done.<br>\r\n\"For now, but you will keep that on the rest of the day.\"<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" Josh said as he went back to his room, feeling the tight denim skirt on his hips.<br>\r\nHis now smooth legs were showing underneath it and surprisingly looked fairly feminine, just not as skinny or shapely. The blouse wasn't very comfortable for Josh, but he could bare with it. He did admire the way the skirt felt on his smooth legs as he felt them up a little bit.<br>\r\n\"That's enough of that for now, but if I stay on mom's good side this may be bearable after all.\" Josh sighed.</span></div></div>",

His mom was bluffing, she wouldn't make him go to school dressed as he was.  She made him wear a skirt with a sleeveless blouse at home with heels and pantyhose to get him all scared.  But in the morning she wouldn't make him go to school like this.  All he had to do was get his voice and name back from Courtney and everything would be fine.  Courtney better not give him too much guff or he wouldn't tell her that she is wearing the apparel of an eight year old and she would be stuck that way (without realizing it for life.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri entered the room breaking his train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why shouldn't I be here?\" Bri asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had forgotten that he now shared a room with his little sister.  It was all forgotten with all that had happened.  All in all that seemed like the least important swap.  \"I'm sorry,\" Josh said. \"I guess I'm having a bad day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.  Why are you dressed like that?  If you want to dress like a girl you could just swap.  Can't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being punished.   Mom is making me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, Mom is just being...well she is being Mom.  Everything will be OK soon.\"  Bri found something to play with.  She asked if Josh wanted to play with her.  But Josh said he had to talk to 'Josh' first.  He wanted to return to normal as soon as he could.  He had a name, voice and room he needed to swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding Courtney in Josh's former room, Courtney broke out laughing when she saw how Josh was dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good laugh.  It's time to swap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says me.  Don't you want your name and voice back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good then we'll swap name, voice and rooms.\"  For laughing at him, Josh wouldn't tell her how ridiculous Courtney looked in the clothes of her sister.  Although it was true that Josh did look more ridiculous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well name and voice OK, but I haven't had a room to myself for a full day.  I'll keep that for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not that long.  Let's swap now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney had him over a barrel.  Maybe he could negotiate.  \"How about over night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two days is enough.  Besides what about Bri, she should be in her room with her sister not older brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, two days..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine let's swap names and voices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the flash, nothing seemed to change. Courtney said, \"Did it work?\" in her own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it did,\" Josh said.  \"Now remember in two days I get my room back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh returned to the room he shared with Bri.  He was truly Josh again, he would be back to normal in only a couple days then he would have to be more careful about his swaps.  Bri was playing.  He put in his ear phones and started to listen to music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed.  Then without warning, Bri started to strip right in front of him.  She had never done that before.  Not since she was a very little girl anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost bed time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri and Courtney bed time wasn't too dissimilar as they were close in age.  But Josh was almost double Bri's age and didn't need to be in bed until at least 11.   What was he going to do for three hours?  Should he just listen to music in the dark?  Should he go to sleep himself?  Should he go to the living room and watch TV, assuming no one else was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri was stripping out of her panties.  Josh looked away, but he was embarrassed for her.  She shouldn't be changing in front of her brother.  But since they shared a room this was obviously common now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Josh remembered, Mom said he could take off his bra when he was going to bed.  The bra was beginning to itch.  He found a pair of pajamas and took them to the bathroom to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Bri was in the bathroom brushing her teeth and getting ready for bed when the call arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Josh,\" Jenn said brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jenn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I know that your name is not Josh I'm having a hard time calling you that.  I mean I know you swapped names with your sister so you should be Courtney, but I remember that your name has always been Josh.  It's so confusing, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop over thinking this.  You don't have to worry about it anymore.  I swapped back with Courtney.  I'm back to Josh now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what I always thought your name was.  But you said you had swapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did swap but I swapped back.  It's back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are back to sleeping with Bri and this is your normal voice too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the voice is back to my own, but Courtney won't swap rooms yet.  She says she'll swap back in a couple of days.  I can wait until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if she won't swap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say a thing like that,\" Josh said.  He didn't want to think about what would happen if this was permanent.  Although, as far as changes went, he supposed sharing a room with Bri was better than having his sister''s voice or being called Courtney for a lifetime.  Not that Courtney didn't have a nice voice, she could sing beautifully.  He just didn't want to sound like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I called to ask how it's going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm wearing your nightgown.  That is how it's going,\" Josh said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm imagining you in my nightgown...wait which one is it, the cute red one with all that lace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this time that Bri returned from the bathroom.  Josh didn't want her to hear what he was talking to Jenn about.  \"One second,\" Josh said to Jenn on the phone and then held the phone to his chest so she couldn't hear what he was saying.  Then directing himself to Bri, Josh said, \"Hey Bri I could use a snack before bedtime.  Can you get us some Pizza Rolls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh needed for her to take a little while so he and Jenn could talk.  \"One more thing, can you make them in the oven?  They come out better that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't.  You know Mommy won't let me turn on the oven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true, Mom wouldn't let her touch the oven.  She thought that she was too young.  \"I'll tell you what, I'll swap with you our apparent maturity.  Then mom will let you use the oven.  I'm sure you can do it.  It's easy to use the oven, Josh knew that Bri would be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, let's swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree to swapping my maturity,\" Josh said and after the flash, Bri left the room.  Josh didn't realize that his clothing had changed.  Not at first, then when he looked down he found he wasn't in a nightgown.  He was wearing a pair of boys pajamas.  They weren't the ones he remembered having.  They were for a much younger boy, but they were at least male clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Jenn on the phone, \"Hey, I'm back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joshie, your back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm back to wearing guys clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you are.  You are such a silly billy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me check the stuff in my closet.\"  Josh carried the phone with him and he looked into his drawers.  Nothing of Jenn remained.  All his clothes were for a young boy.  He didn't know what had happened.  He didn't swap clothing with any little boys.  There weren't any little boys around to swap with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you wearing boys clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not.  Why would I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know of any punishment I'm having?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been a naughty boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not.  Look, I'll see you are school tomorrow, Bye\" Josh said and then hung up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn was confused.  Josh didn't go to her high school.  He was in grammar school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh needed to talk to his mother and see if he was still being punished.  Something had changed and he didn't know what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh left his room to find his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next.</span></div></div>",

Well we did swap but not the way you mean,\" Jenn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did swap, don't you remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that was before I knew about your swapping ability.

But Mom is calling me.  I'd better see what she wants.\"  Josh put down the phone and headed towards his mother's voice.  His mother was obviously in a foul mood and he didn't want to upset her anymore.  Tomorrow he was going to go to school in a skirt and blouse if she didn't change her mind.  He was going to follow her instructions to the letter and maybe she'll reconsider.  Maybe this was a big bluff and she would let him go to school wearing his own clothing yet.  Josh had forgotten that he didn't have any of his own clothing in his house even if she did change her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mom,\" Evan said pleasantly.

He wouldn't like that either way, but particularly as he was sharing a room with Bri.  He wasn't sure if Bri had ever seen his penis and he didn't want her to start now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to remind you that after school come straight home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to remind me.  I don't want to be seen like this one moment longer than I have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that won't be the case, because I have decided that Jenn's bras don't fit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of her clothes fit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we are going out to get you a training bra which will fit you.  You wanted to see what it's like to wear girls clothes, this will show you.  But if you want we can buy you an entire outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just a training bra will be fine.\"  Evan hoped that all his mother was doing was trying to scare him.  But he wasn't going to complain.  Maybe he would get out of this anyway.  Maybe she'll relent by tomorrow or by the time he returned home from school.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be home on time,\" Evan promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan returned to the room he shared with Bri, his phone was waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have decided what we should swap,\" Jenn said without preamble.  \"We should swap chests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened next?</span></div></div>",

When she looked over at Josh, her eyes seemed to say it all.  They were wide with wonder as she thought of all the possibilities, even if they were for only until tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mom.\"  Courtney called back downstairs.  \"Come on Sis, it's time for dinner.\"  She chuckled as she looked over at Josh, who seemed to have a little shock at what just happened.  Courtney then went and got Bri for dinner too, but as she did, she couldn't help but look at some of the photos that lined the walls.  She found the ones where Josh was in little league baseball and noticed that he wasn't in them anymore, but she was in his place smiling broadly.  Smiling as much as the picture, Courtney made her way a little further down where she found her pictures, or rather the pictures she should have been in.  The picture of her soccer team had Josh, dressed in her Lavender Lillies uniform and Bri's long brown hair tied up behind his head.  In the next picture, which was taken earlier that school year, Josh was seated with several other girls dressed in the purple and grey cheerleading uniforms of his High School.  She couldn't help but chuckle at the sight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Courtney.\"  Bri replied as she tried to pull her along.  \"You know how Mom gets when you keep her waiting for too long.\"  Courtney really didn't want to feel the wrath of her Mom, so she nodded her head in agreement and made her way downstairs to the table for dinner.  As she sat down at the table, Courtney looked over at Josh who seemed a little down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with you?\"  She asked wondering what was really the matter with her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much.\"  Josh grumbled as he sighed.  \"I just got griped out by Mom about not 'acting like a lady'.\"  He did some air quotes to help emphasize the point.  \"And I had to help her set the table.\"  Courtney couldn't help but giggle at his new hard ships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned closer to his ear and replied.  \"See that's what I meant, but now you know what I meant.\"  Josh silently nodded his head as they both watched their Mom bringing in the last of their dinner and they started to get ready for their meal.</span></div></div>",

Every few minutes his mom would make some sort of comment targeted at Josh about how he should 'act more lady like' and how 'her' behavior wasn't 'very becoming of a girl her age'.  Josh just groaned and tried to ignore everything she said before Josh reached his breaking point just before dessert.  Their mom had Josh bring in a lime gelatin mold and after Josh sat back down his mom remarked, \"Josh, you should really not sit down with your legs spread open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, I'm wearing jeans.\"  Josh said not even looking up from his empty plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Josh I'm just saying that it's not very...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady like, I get it.\"  Josh said annoyed, he'd only been dealing with this criticism from his mom for about an hour but he felt like he'd been listening to it forever.  Josh stood up, \"I'm going to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have your dessert?\"  Bri said cheerfully.  As Josh walked past Courtney he heard her whisper, \"Told you so,\"  and their mom just said, \"Josh?  Get back here young lady.\"  But Josh didn't go back, he just went to his room and started playing Playstation.  It only took a minute for him to get over it, Courtney did probably have it bad, but considering Josh acted like a guy all the because, well, he was one, his mom was bound to be much harder on him.  Josh already couldn't wait to swap perceived genders back with Courtney as he brushed Bri's hair out of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of playing there was a knock on the door, \"Josh, sweetie, can I come in?\"  Josh's mom said sweetly.  Josh paused and went ahead and said, \"Sure mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered and sat down on the bed and motioned Josh to join her.  \"I'm so sorry I've been so hard on you.  I know I annoy you so much, but I don't want you to be different than the other girls at school, you're already so different from them physically I just don't want you to isolate yourself from the other girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, really, it's no big deal, I'd just appreciate it if you got off my back just a little bit.\"  Josh said thinking in the back of his head that maybe this little talk might transfer over to Courtney helping mom back off of her a little bit too when he swapped back his gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut mom wasn't going to brush off her little girl, \"Josh, I just want the best for you.  And if I could give you my breasts and...womanhood I'd give it to you in a heartbeat to make your life just a little bit easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese words made Josh's ears pop up, if he actually agreed with his mom right here they would swap breasts and genitals.  It would probably freak his mom out and man could that be fun to make her think it's a 'be careful what you wish for' situation or something.  But then again Josh had just gotten his own manhood back and wasn't sure he wanted to give it to his mom.  But maybe he could trick her into swapping something else with him.  If she wanted school to be easier for him, maybe he could swap occupations and let her got to school for him.  That might be fun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh couldn't hide his smile anymore as he thought about what his mom's reaction was about to be.  \"Sure mom, I agree to swap breasts and...your womanhood with you.\"  Josh felt the now familiar feeling of your body changing in an instant.  Josh looked down and there were his mom's breasts stretching out his shirt and a quick pat of the groin confirmed that chests wasn't the only thing that got swapped with his mom.  Josh turned to look at his mom to see how she was taking this sudden change.  Turns out she wasn't taking it as well as him (then again she didn't have any experience with this unlike Josh).  Sure enough she wasn't taking it well, it looked like Kim was about to faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, mom!\"  Josh said loudly snapping his fingers in front of her face.  \"Stay with me mom, it'll all be ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you just, we just.  You have my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay mom,\"  Josh said deciding after this reaction continuing messing with her would be borderline cruel.  \"I was told I got this weird power earlier to swap when someone agrees to swap something and it looks like it's real.  Thanks for proving it to me mom.\"  Josh also decided to not share his previous swaps with Bri and Courtney in order to keep things from getting complicated for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, we can swap back right?\"  Kim said still confused by everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, let's try it.  I want to swap genitals with you, do you agree?\"  Josh said not wanting to lose his penis for a second time today.  \"I agree.\"  Kim said softly and sure enough Josh felt his manhood return just like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh saw that his mom seemed to be in deep thought, he couldn't quite read her so he just decided to finish the swap back to try and not break her mind with all this craziness, \"So now that you know we can swap easily by just agreeing, are you ready to take your breasts back?  I'll start, I want to swap breasts with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looked at Josh and softly said, \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you don't?\"  Josh asked quite confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, can you only swap physical things?  Or can you swap things that are more mental.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wasn't 100% sure but he guessed he probably could, after all he swapped perceived gender with Courtney so mental swaps couldn't be that far out an idea.  \"Probably I guess.  Why?  What are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's mom looked at Josh and with an odd look in her eyes.  Was it..desperation?  No, it was a weirdly caring look.  \"Josh, if you would humor me, I want to swap mannerisms with me.  You would finally act more lady like without even trying and you'll realize how easy it is and how much it could better your life.  It would make your life and school much easier and the boys won't be as intimidated by you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\"  Josh said weirded out by the idea of his mom wanting boys to hit on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you don't want to mess with your mind, and I understand if you don't we could use this power to help you in a different way.  You've always had a bit of a boyish body, but if you had a more feminine body it would help you be more comfortably with your femininity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want me to what, swap bodies with you?  No offense mom, it's weird enough I have your boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's all you would need, I know I've talked about your problems with the girls in my book club and I'm sure you told them about your power they'd be more than willing to let you borrow from them until you have your dream body.  It would just be temporary of coarse, but I really think you should try it to experience it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't deny that picking out and creating his dream girl via parts from mom's volunteering friends...though it kind of sucked he would be the dream girl in this scenario.  But it also meant a lot more people would know about his power so that might not be a great idea.  But his mom seemed determined the he act more 'lady like' and wasn't going to take no for an answer.  So the easiest way to get her off his back would be to swap mannerisms with his mom, but the downside of that was messing with his own mind and Josh didn't exactly love that idea.</span></div></div>",

He could go ahead and swap his mannerisms with his Mom, if only to humor her a little.  Or on the other hand, he could try and swap out his entire body with some of the ladies in his Mom's book club.  Remembering the last time he seen some of those ladies, he thought that they seemed pretty.  In all actuality, all the members of his Mom's book club were all stay at home moms who had nothing better to do but keep in shape and read books.  Shaking his head to clear his thoughts, Josh looked towards his Mom who looked a little odd with his flat, manly chest in place of her own.  \"So what will you choose?'  Kim asked as she tried not to look too excited over anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will choose the mannerisms.\"  Josh chose as he looked at his Mom who was about to agree, but stopped as Josh cut her off.  \"But, I want us to swap our breasts back.\"  Josh motioned down to his much more expansive chest that only a few moments ago, belonged to his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I accept.\"  Kim announced with a bit of annoyance.  She had hoped that she would be able to have some time away from her own chest, but decided that helping her 'daughter' would take precedence.  She shielded her eyes as the blinding flash came and went.  \"Did it work?\"  She asked as she spread her legs further apart and started to scratch an itch on her chest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it did.\"  Josh replied as he carefully crossed his legs to bring his knees together.  He watched with a slight disgust as he watched his Mom scratching herself with out a care in the world.  \"So how long do you think we should keep these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"  Kim responded as she waved her hand as if to dismiss the idea.  \"How about until you think you've learned a great deal about manners and how to be proper lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"  Josh agreed as he got up and walked over to the closet door to see his reflection and noticed that he seemed to have a slight sashay when he walked.  He stood there for a moment and looked at his reflection.  Josh found that as he stood there, he put more weight on his right foot and his hip seemed to flare out slightly.  A hearty chuckle came from behind him.  \"What?\"  He asked his mom who seemed to be enjoying what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing really.\"  Kim chuckled more as she watched her son exploring his new mannerisms.  \"I'm just happy that you're able to see what being a lady is really like.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm going to go make sure that Bri doesn't stay up too late since she has the big game tomorrow.\"  Josh's mom left the room leaving Josh to his own devices.  Deciding he didn't want to freak himself out by thinking of his new feminine mannerisms too much he decided to just go back to playing Playstation.  But before he even started up the game he noticed that Bri's hair was starting to get in his eyes.  So he got up and went to the mirror and brushed it back, but he felt like he should do something more to it.  Thinking about what he could do Josh got an idea and went to the internet to look up a hair styling tutorial.  Because even though thanks to his mom he was more inclined to want to have done up hair, he still had no idea how to do it.  So after about half an hour of watching tutorials and tangling up Bri's hair a few times he finally made up his hair into two buns on the side of his head.  Josh looks proudly at his space princess style hair and voice came from behind him, \"Looking good 'sis', it's nice that you've styled your hair to match your perceived gender.\"  Courtney said as she waltzed into Josh's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh felt his cheeks flush but then remembered that Courtney didn't know about the swap with Kim so Courtney probably thought it was normal form to want to style his hair.  Courtney made herself at home in Josh's room sitting down on the bed.  \"It was nice to not go through dinner without mom nagging me to act all lady like and junk.  And speaking of that...\"  Courtney said sounding a little hesitant to make a new proposal.  \"I know we said we'd swap gender's back after dinner but I got to thinking.  I'm really curious about how I'd be treated at school on Monday as a guy to see what all would be different you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh chuckled, \"You just want to go to gym with the guys to watch them shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney slyly smiled, \"Don't tell me the thought never occurred for you and the girl's locker room.\"  Both siblings laughed at their mutual curiosity/perversion.  \"So Josh, what do you say we delay the swap back until Monday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought about it, he was planning on swapping back but not only did Courtney make a good argument, but the fact that he now had swapped mannerisms with his mom made things a little bit trickier.  She seemed determined to have him to try it out for a few days, but if he was back to being considered a guy those mannerisms would come across as kind of weird.  Then again that could be an interesting experience in it's own right.  After considering the options Josh decided what do to.</span></div></div>",

The girls only had three or four minutes to change so they didn't dawdle.  Also he didn't want to stare too obviously.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Knowing time was of the essence, Josh quickly made his way back to Courtney's room.  As soon as Josh opened the door Courtney looked with surprise at her sibling and said, \"Oh, hey 'sis'.  What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom is what's going on, I don't want to get bogged down with details but just know that I've changed my mind and I'd really like to swap back perceived genders now.\"  Courtney looked surprised and a little disappointed but just shrugged.  \"Sure, whatever.  But I do want to swap back someday to see the guys locker room.  I agree to swap perceived genders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, and thanks.\"  Josh said not 100% sure if the swap took place, so he got out his wallet and looked at his drivers permit and was relieved to see an M next to his gender.  But now that he was mostly back to normal, well outside of still having his mom's breasts and Bri's hair.  But those could be fixed.  Feeling like he was on a roll Josh then went to Bri and asked if she would swap their hair back.  Bri didn't want to, but Josh tricked her by mentioning that her with his hair would look awfully silly in the championship pictures.  Bri immediately agreed without thinking it through and Josh was 2/3 the way to being back to normal and ready to start swapping a new whenever he felt like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast off Josh went to his mom who was just getting off the phone with somebody.  \"Hey mom, I'd really love it if you swapped chests with me, it's awfully silly for a short haired male like me to walk around with breasts isn't it.\"  Kim looked a bit confused but agreed, \"If you really don't want my chest that's fine.  I agree to swap.\"  The swap then automatically took place and Josh gave himself a mental self high five for his plan working.  But that celebration didn't last long as his mom then said, \"It's okay if you think it's weird to have your mother's breasts.  When the girls from my book club get here you can choose whatever chest you want.  Everyone's excited about the swapping and have all agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's heart sank a little, \"They have?\"  Josh was honestly hoping that since he'd gotten his gender back from Courtney, his mom would be off of the 'you should be more lady like' bandwagon.  \"And refresh my memory, why am I swapping parts with your friends again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looked confused, \"We just had this discussion a few minutes ago.  You told me about your powers and I threw out that my friends would love to experience parts of being a man and you generously volunteered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, didn't I?\"  Josh said figuring out that the universe must have made up a reasoning for his mom calling her friends to swap since her 'daughter' was not trying to be ladylike anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, before the girls get here, have you thought about what you're going to swap around?  You not just helping the girls experience parts of being a man, you will be experiencing womanhood.  And you should put some thought into what kind of woman you would like to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh right.\"  Josh sighed figuring that he was getting roped into this.  But Josh tried to look at it from a positive standpoint.  He had this super cool power and he was going to eventually use it to try being a woman at some point, and now thanks to his mom it looked like he was going to try out full on womanhood sooner rather than later.  With his mom's word echoing in his mind as he waited for his mom's friends to arrive he thought about what kind of woman he should try being.  He could just take some of the best feature from each woman and become like some sort of super bombshell.  He'd probably be the most popular guy, um, girl in school.  But then Josh realized that with this power he could make it so he didn't have to go to school.  He could become an adult woman and not even have to go to school.  He'd make his mom and her friends happy and he could just stay at home and play video games, just with parts of a woman's body.  As the doorbell started ringing and his mom's friends entered the house one by one, Josh decided how he was going to swap about with them.</span></div></div>",

After a long and drawn out debate with himself he decided to see what the women had to offer before he made a plan on the woman he wanted to be.  He remembered the last time that he saw the ladies of his Mom's book club when they came over for their weekly meeting.  Most of them were in their early to mid 30s with families of their own and Josh never really got to know them or even their names.  \"I guess I will have to know them a little better before I make any changes to my life.\"  Josh said to himself as he sat down on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat there for what seemed about another 10 to 15 minutes until he heard the door bell going off and knew that his world was about to be turned around.  He stood at the top of the stairs as he watched some of the ladies as they came in and tried to remember who they all were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst to come in was a 5' 3\" African American woman.  From what Josh remembered, her name was Leah and her husband was a Major League Baseball Player.  Being almost 10 years older than her, he only married her after his ex-wife ran off with their gardener and now treated Leah like a trophy.  Mostly to spite his ex wife.  Her curly black hair cascaded down from her head and bounced with every step, showing that she took great pride in this trait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight behind was a 5' 8\" single mom.  Her name was Ashley and she often enjoyed coming over to get away from her 4 and 6 year girls.  With her B cup chest and shoulder length brown hair, she was a determined woman to get through life and show her daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed as he knew that his end was near and went back to his room to wait for the rest of his Mom's friends to come.  </span></div></div>",

As he waited he thought of the series of events that caused this all to come into fruition.  Thinking back, Josh had a chance to think about what was going to happen and now he had to choose what he wanted to do.  Did he really want to lose all of his responsibilities and not go to school.  If he did this, then he would probably have to take care of somebody's family that he didn't know what to do.  Although, not having to go to school certainly piqued his interest.  He wasn't a bad student by any means, but a guys really deserves a break now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr he could get some of the ladies to swap some of their best parts to become his own dream woman.  Josh thought about the problems this would cause.  First, he would get these body parts onto his body and he would have to deal with them.  He was sure that some of the ladies would be glad to get some of their body parts out of the way so that they could feel what it was like to be a guy.  Second, he would also know that pains that those ladies had to deal with.  While this would certainly give him a new perspective on life and how others live theirs, but would it be worth it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since he was little, Josh had always had a problem with change.  He attributed it to when their dad left to be with his secretary, leaving his wife alone with 3 children.  After that day whenever a major change happened, he didn't know how to handle it.  How as he supposed to pick something from all those ladies and deal with the circumstances that came with them.  He would be better off letting them pick what they wanted and letting him deal...  \"Wait a minute.  That would certainly get rid of some of the stress.\"  Josh said to himself.  Finally making his decision, the stress seemed to leave him and he felt at ease for the first time in several hours.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a slight knock on the door, Josh's heart rate began to escalate once more.  He got up and found his sisters waiting for him.  Courtney looked at her brother and smiled her biggest grin.  \"Mom said that she's ready for you.\"  The tone that she usually used when she had to go get her brother after he did something wrong and her Mom was ready to deal out the punishment.  \"What did you do this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\"  Josh replied as he made his way downstairs.  As he neared the bottom of the stairs, Josh saw that his Mom's book club was already assembled and eerily enough, all had a grin on their faces.  He looked around and noticed 6 ladies, including his Mom, were gathered around the front room.  As he looked at them, he tried to remember their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was Leah Thomas (24)  5' 3\" with a B cup and her curly black hair goes down to her dark shoulders. Being the trophy wife of her Major League Baseball husband, Leah has all the time in the world to take care of herself and the house. Although she does get a little lonely at times, Leah always tries to find something to do with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Leah was Ashley Reynolds (30) - 5' 8\" with a C cup and light brown hair that goes down to her mid back. Being a single mom of 2 girls (4 and 6 years of age), Ashley is trying to show her children what a strong person is and works her hardest to do her best at her job as a secretary to University President.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Ashley was Elizabeth 'Beth' Fletching (35) - 5' 0\" with an A cup and curly brown hair that went down to below her ears.  Being alone for most of her life, Beth had always fallen into the wrong crowds.  But recently, she was able to get her life back together and now has her Master's Degree in Music, which allows her to teach at the local high school and has Josh in one of her classes.  Ashley and Beth have been friends for the past few years and enjoy going to lunch together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Catherine 'Cat' Marquez (35) - 5' 4\" with a small B cup and has her blonde hair in a pixie cut.  Having come out several years ago, Cat has been trying her best to find the right person.  Being the softball coach at the local University has helped Cat with her life and sexuality.  She has recently been seen with the basketball coach around town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly there was Mary McCulley (30) - 5' 1\" with a B cup and her curly red hair that goes past her shoulders.  Having Megan at a young age, Mary had never had time to do anything.  After coming here from Ireland with her husband, Jason, Mary had found it hard to fit in since she stays at home and only recently started to come to the Book Club meetings to get out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are.\"  Kim replied as she saw her son come around the corner.  \"Are you ready to find out what a real woman is like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed as he looked around and noticed that his sisters sat down with the other ladies, almost as if they were going to do something too.  \"Yeah, I guess, but wait, why are they here?\"  He nearly yelled as he pointed over to his sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't yell.\"  Kim scolded her son as she motioned him to sit on the ottoman in the center of a circle of ladies.  \"They wanted to join in, so I thought it would be a great chance for you to know your sisters better.  Now, have you decided how you wanted to do this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded his head.  \"I thought that I would give them a chance to pick something and if I like it I will agree to it.  But it will only be for a week, tops.\"  He looked around at the group of ladies who all seemed to agree to this and had smiles on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now who should be first?\"  Kim asked as she pulled out a bag filled with numbers.  \"We'll all draw numbers to see how the order will go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded their heads in agreement.  \"Yay.  I got the first one!\"  ______ cried out.</span></div></div>",

Courtney looked over at her sister a frowned slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only want to go first because you always get what you want.\"  Courtney cried out seemingly mad that Bri got under her skin.  \"I mean, you get to wear tomboy clothes all the time and you look down on most of us like think you're all high and mighty.\"  That's when her eyes got all big with realization.  \"I want to swap my height with you Josh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"  Josh nearly screamed in surprise.  \"Why that?\"  He looked over at his sister and didn't know if he wanted to lose almost a foot in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I want to know how it feels to be tall for a little bit.\"  Courtney explained.  \"Being able to reach up into the cabinet or even on top of the fridge without a step stool.\"  Josh looked around the group of ladies and noticed that the ones that were shorter than 5' 5\" were all nodding their heads, almost like they were being preached to in church.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Josh?\"  Kim exclaimed.  \"Are you going to accept or will we need to do some more drastic action?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at his Mom and didn't really know what the drastic action was and he certainly didn't want to know.  \"Fine, I accept.\"  The room filled with the bright light once more.

Thinking back on her life, nobody ever took her seriously when she went out.

However, she was tired of having to take care of it constantly, especially when she was playing on her soccer team. She wanted a break from all of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap my hair\" She announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Josh said. However thinking it back over, that was not too bad of a request. \"Fine, I accept\". In a flash of light, the change was done, and Josh felt his new hair running down the back of his neck. Bri ran off to check out her new hair, leaving Josh to his next swap. A number was drawn, and ___ stood up next. </span></div></div>",

With this I could I finally spend time with my friends and really enjoy the life I have, can we please do it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Well it seems harmless enough\u2026. It can\u2019t possibly be anything too hard</i>'  Josh thought to himself.  \u201cAlright I agree to swap responsibilities with you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said there was a bright flash that covered the room and slowly dimmed down.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel any different.\u201d Leah said as she looked at herself and then back at Josh. \u201cAre you sure it worked?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me it wor-\u201cJosh was cut off by the buzz of his cellphone. As he checked it he noticed it was a message from Leah\u2019s husband reminding him about the chores he was assigned for tomorrow.  \u201caw man this seems like a lot. How am I going to finish all of this in one day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah couldn\u2019t help herself from giggling as she checked her phone. \u201cIt seems like my husbanded wanted me to remind you as well while I\u2019m here. Apparently that message was sent earlier In the day and you never responded back. He was worried you might be taking a sick day tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSick day?\u201d Kim asked a bit confused by the new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! It seems like Josh is our new maid. I always wanted one since we had the money to afford it but my husband always preferred my touch when it came to these type of things. I\u2019m so happy that I can finally get away for a while, thank you so much Josh!\u201d Leah said as she gave josh a big hug. \u201cYou have a busy day tomorrow so we should get this done as soon as possible so you can rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Josh and Leah were hugging, Kim\u2019s friends stared in shock and amazement. They were each skeptical of what Kim had promised but now after seeing the power Josh possessed in action they could hardly contain their excitement. Each of them were already planning what they wanted from Josh in order to fulfill their own selfish desires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh pulled out of the hug and begrudgingly asked aloud who the next person was. He was already regretting what he had gotten himself into. He assumed the tasks Leah was complaining about were exaggerations and wouldn\u2019t be as bad as Leah described but now he was stuck doing them all for a week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems like I\u2019m the next one up\u201d said\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since she was the second of the ladies to go, there were many things to choose from. Especially since Leah had chosen responsibilities and she would had never really considered that, as she loved her job coaching softball. She thought about some of the possibilities, there was trading her decently-sized breasts, or maybe gender. Although, taking Josh's entire gender for herself seemed a bit unfair to the other ladies, as they wanted a piece of the pie as well. Then she suddenly got a wild idea that she thought would be fun for her and her girlfriend Janet. \"I think I will take your penis.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooooooooo!!!!!\" Echoed a chorus of women, knowing exactly her intent considering she was the only one of the group to have sexual relations with another female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis swap actually sounded intriguing to Josh. Contrary to the swap he made with Bri, he now had experience with the female genitalia and now a grown woman was offering to give him hers. Plus, Josh had heard his mom say before the Cat was 35, which he remembered Jenn saying was a woman's sexual peak when the two reviewed their biology notes. \"Sound good, I accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!\" The chanting of the women got even louder this time as the swap went through with a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Cat.\" Kim said resting a hand on her shoulder in the middle of the commotion. \"I want you to be careful with that thing. Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my word.\" Cat assured her friend, looking at the bulge that was poking out from her yoga pants, thinking about the next week that awaited her and Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought had crossed Josh's mind and connected the dots. His penis would have sex for the first time without him! <i>\"Oh well,\"</i> He thought. <i>\"Bet nobody else has ever been able to say that before me!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm next!\" _______ exclaimed.</span></div></div>",

I mean, we will pay you for what you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not it.\"  Josh sighed as he shook his head.  \"It's that maids are girls, aren't they?\"  The group of women laughed as they saw his distraught face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can call you something else.  But after tonight's over with, I think you might be more of a girl than a guy.\"  Leah replied as she gestured at the other waiting ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I pick now?\"  Beth asked as she waited for them to stop talking.  \"I know what I want to pick now.\"  Everyone looked over at her, wondering what she had chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Cat replied as she was ready to pick her trait.  \"What are you going to get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking about it and I want to swap our physiques.\"  Beth said with an affirmative tone.  \"I think that I will like to have that for a couple days.\"  Not really knowing what she meant, Josh accepted the request and the room was soon filled with the blinding light once more.  Before she knew it, Beth was looking around the room and noticing that it looked different.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Beth.\"  Mary replied with wonderement as she crossed her self for taking the Lord's name in vain.  \"You look like a man.\"  Beth looked down at her body and noticed that she was right.  Gone was her petite body with feminine musculature, instead in it's place was a taller body with the musculature of a teenage boy.  No longer were her hands slim, but not seemed more at home on one of her student's.  She smiled as she looked over at Josh's body who looked more feminine, much like hers had been, with her narrow shoulders going down to her size 6 feet.  Looking at him seemed completely out of place with his teenage boy clothing covering up his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think it was going to be like this.\"  Josh complained as he looked down at his changed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See.\"  Leah started to say as she looked over at him.  \"I told you that you would become more ladylike in appearance.\"  Josh just huffed as he sat there trying not to move too much.  \"So whose next?\"  She asked the group of waiting women who were waiting for their chance to get something new to try out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn!\"  _______ responded with a wave of her hand as she showed the group the number in her hand.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"My turn!\"  Catherine responded with a wave of her hand as she showed the group the number in her hand.  For most of her life she seemed to be fighting both her Hispanic family and heritage.  Growing up she had been forced to wear dresses and keep her hair longer to fit in with the average Hispanic girl her age.  Going to Catholic School and getting her High School education opened her eyes more than her or her family would ever know.  After joining the softball team, she then started to feel the feelings that she'd been fighting to hold down for most of her life.  The female body seemed to excite her more sexually than any boy ever would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"  Courtney asked with wonder, not really knowing what she was going to pick from her brother.  Cat looked around the table and felt more at ease with this group of ladies than she'd ever been in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking right now.\"  She calmly replied as she looked her friend's son over to see if he had something that seemed to interest her.  At first she thought about asking for his penis, but knew that her girlfriend, Janet, would probably not like it.  She felt her short, dyed hair and thought against that too, since Janet was the one that dyed and cut it for her.  She took in a long sigh, at having such trouble picking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard, huh?\"  Beth chuckled as she flexed her new found muscles.  \"I had to fight myself to pick something that I knew would help me be comfortable.\"  As long as Cat had known Beth, her small stature had always been something that she hated about herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Cat had a revelation.  Since she had been the softball coach for the local university, she had trouble with her chest getting in the way.  Sure they were not as big as most women, but it certainly was something that she didn't like about herself.  \"Thank Beth.\"  She replied as she looked around the group and finally rested her gaze on Josh.  \"I want to swap my chest with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to intrigue Josh somewhat, here was a grown woman wanting to give him her chest and he didn't have to refuse.  \"Well, I guess I will accept that.\"  Josh replied nonchalantly and tried not to sound too excited about it.  For the 3rd time that night, the blinding light engulfed the room and as he opened his eyes Josh felt a small tug pulling on his chest.  Looking down, he found that Cat's B-cups were now on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what a rush.\"  Cat replied as she brought her hands up to her chest to feel her flat, manly chest.  \"I think I will enjoy not having those on my chest for this week.\"  She hopped up and down a little to feel her new gravity.  \"I don't think I will need this anymore.\"  She pulled a black bra out of her shirt and laid it down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...  Cat.\"  Kim asked as she motioned over to her son, who seemed to be feeling himself up.  \"I think he will need that, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat nodded her head and didn't seem to upset over Josh feeling up her chest, since it was his for the week.  \"I guess I will swap bras with Josh.  Trust me you'll need them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh accepted and found the blinding light engulfing them once again.  \"Thanks, I guess.\"  He picked up the foreign article of clothing, which now was sitting beside him instead of Cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will show you how to put that on a little later.\"  Kim chuckled as she looked toward the girls.  \"Alright whose next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn.\"  ________ responded as she stood up stretching her tired extremities.</span></div></div>",

He already had a job to do after school, a new body shape, and now a chest.  She thought about giving him her hair, but decided against it since she didn't want to have boy hair for the next week.  '<i>If everyone expected me to wear my hair short then I could probably get away with it.'</i>  She thought to herself and almost had the proverbial light bulb go over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know what that look is.\"  Josh replied a little frightened at not really knowing what his sister was up to.  Her gaze seemed to be looking him over like a piece of meat.  Currently, that is what he mostly felt like in front of all the ladies.  Each one of them taking one thing about him and trying them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it won't be that bad.\"  Leah chuckled as she leaned back checking her phone to see what her husband was up to while at an away game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah hurry up Courtney.\"  Bri sighed as she was starting to lose patience and was ready for her turn to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Courtney replied as she looked around the group.  \"Let's see if I can word it right.\"  She cleared her throat and looked at her more effeminate brother.  \"I want to swap everything that the world deems appropriate for girls with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at his sister like she had just smoked something.  \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Courtney.\"  Kim asked, as she didn't really understand what she wanted to swap with her sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he will accept, then I can show you.\"  She stood there with her hands on her hips waiting for her brother to say those magic words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that he was going to have to say it, Josh accepted the trade.  With the blinding light subsiding, Josh instantly felt something a little off.  Looking down at his changed body, he noticed that he wasn't wearing the T-shirt and jeans he was before, instead he was wearing a pair of black leggings with a girls blouse.  \"What in the world?\"  He cried out as he looked over at his sister who was wearing male clothing.  \"What happened to your hair?\"  He asked as he instinctively brought his hand up to his head and felt that it was now longer too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see.\"  Courtney started as she cleared her throat.  \"What I swapped with you is what the world expects a girl to have.\"  She paused for a moment as the ladies in the group chuckled.  \"So the female clothes that you have one.\"  She gestured to the clothing then to his head.  \"Your longer hair and now your pierced ears.\"  Josh brought his hands up to his ears and found them to be pierced several times, which was the style for girls these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, now that was a good one.\"  Leah chuckled as she continued to play on her phone.  All the others nodded their heads and didn't really know what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whose next?\"  Courtney said trying to keep the night going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now it's my turn.\"  ________ replied as she stood up.</span></div></div>",

Someone has already picked responsibilities, boobs, and physique. She could pick hair, since that was available, but she was quite fond of her hair. She also could choose something like age or height, but she didn't feel like that would make a huge difference,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was the secretary for the university president. While she liked her job and it paid well, sometimes she got tired of being someone's assistant. On top of that, being an attractive young woman in a skirt or dress, sometimes she felt like she was just eye candy to some people. She decided she would love a break from all that and just be in high school again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap jobs with you\" She said. \"That means for the next week you would be the secretary, and I could go to high school\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's not too bad.\" Josh replied. \"I accept\". A white flash of light occurred, and while nothing looked like it changed, Josh now remembered that he had to go to work Monday morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what about Leah's responsibilities?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't wory, you can do those after work and it's not every day\" Leah assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're going to have my job, shouldn't you also have my wardrobe?\" Ashley suggested. \"I mean you can't show up in your jeans and a tshirt for work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh groaned at where this was going. \"Fine, I agree I guess\".

Even though her husband wanted to have something in common with them, she put her foot down.  She really didn't want to have any tomboys in her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you look weird.\"  Bri giggled as she looked over at her brother who is starting to look more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha.\"  Josh mocked as he crossed his arms across his chest.  \"Laugh it up, it's only going to be for a week and besides.\"  He took a moment to look over at her.  \"I won't have to go to school this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri started to pout over this latest revelation, but Mary was ready to get something.  \"Well,\"  She replied with her Irish brogue.  \"I think I already know what I want.\"  She then looked over at the group of ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\"  Josh grumbled to himself not really knowing what she had in store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not going to be that bad.\"  Mary assured him as she rested her hand on his shoulder.  \"I mean, you have the job to go to, right?\"  Josh, not knowing exactly where this was going nodded his head.  \"Well, you have to look good, so I am offering to swap my makeup with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't know how to put it on or anything.\"  Josh replied as he seemed a little relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't think he can apply it with only a couple days of practice.\"  Ashley commented.  \"Dr. Neuman would freak if I didn't come into work put together.\"  Ashley's employer was a bit old fashioned and thought that woman should always come in put together and have a smile on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I can add my knowledge of personal hygiene.\"  Mary suggested as she looked over at the two of them.  \"I mean, I just stay at home anyway, so I won't really need it for the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's felt his heard go into his throat as he heard this.

Not wanting to get Ashley fired from her job, Josh knew what he had to do.  \"Fine, I accept.\"  The blinding light engulfed the room once more and Josh didn't really feel any different.

'<i>Lipstick?</i>'  Josh thought to himself and looked down at himself and looked at his normal male legs coming out of Ashley's sundress.  <i>'I really need to take care of those tonight before I go anywhere.'</i>  He paused for a moment at this thought.  \"I guess it worked.\"  Josh sighed as he looked around once again in a semi defeated manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have told you that.\"  Kim chuckled as she looked over at Mary and saw her once well put together appearance looked drab.

Her voice sounded excited and somewhat cute to Josh with her Irish brogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what you want from my son?\"  Kim wondered as she sat down waiting for the trait to be picked and she can watch her son change once more in front of her eyes.  She was certainly proud of him, giving away some of his manly traits so that her friends would have a chance to see what it was like to live life on the other side of the fence for once in their lives.  She looked over at him and noticed that no longer was he the strapping young man that she was used to, but now he more resembled a petite female, with his smaller frame and clearly feminine chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, you know what, I think I do.\"  She chuckled as she looked around at the group of women who were ready to hear what she decided to pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\"  Beth wondered a little too loudly as she waited for Mary to say what she wanted.  She certainly looked a little odd with her taller and more manly frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.\"  Mary replied looking back over at Beth.  \"I think I want to swap out hair.\"  She lifted a small segment of her own reddish curly hair to help emphasize what she wanted to swap.  \"For all of my life I wanted to see what it would be like to have short hair without having to get it cut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just shrugged his shoulders.  \"I guess I can live with that for a week or so.  I agree to swap hair with you.\"  With the blinding light once more engulfing the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was the first to sway anything as she brought her hand up to her head and felt her much shorter hair on her head.  \"I appreciate this, Josh.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Not as if I really had a choice.</i>'  Josh thought to himself as he just smiled and nodded his head.  He brushed a rogue hair out of his face and placed it behind his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's my turn.\" _______ replied as she looked around.</span></div></div>",

With her husband being home for the baseball off season, he was always seemingly pestering her to go out with friends that she'd never had the luxury of meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth couldn't help but chuckle too at the comment.  \"Yeah, I'm getting tired of having to tell you what's going on in the book so that you can keep up.\"  She nudged Leah in a joking manner, but seemed to over estimate her new muscle strength, nearly knocking her over in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was only that one time.\"  Leah nearly yelled back, trying to defend herself.  \"Plus that was over 4 months ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Ashley nearly yelled trying to get the room back under control.  \"I think I know what I want to swap.\"  That seemed to quiet the room as she got ready to tell the group.  \"That's better.\"  She replied as she took in the silence for a little more.  \"I'm getting tired of being treated like a piece of meat at work by my boss.  So I want to swap how the world perceives our gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh, not really knowing what she was saying, agreed to the request.  Like the several times before, the blinding light enveloped the room.  \"Did it work?\"  Josh wondered out loud looking down at his altered body to see if anything had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it did.\"  Ashley suggested, also looking down at her own body.  \"I mean, it worked with everyone else and I saw a bright light, so I don't see why it didn't work with me.\"  All the other women who had something swapped with Josh nodded their head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell you it worked.\"  Kim answered as she looked over at her son and the way he was sitting.  \"I want to correct you so bad, but I know it's just the magic influencing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct me how?\"  Josh wondered as he looked down at the way he was sitting and found nothing wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just the way that you're sitting.\"  Kim said as she motioned over to her son.  \"I want you to cross your legs and see you with a little bit of color on your face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Josh.\"  Courtney chuckled at her brother's expense.  \"You need to come to my room and I can show you how to do your make up.\"  Taking a moment to laugh at her own joke, Courtney then turned to her Mom.  \"So it's our turn now right?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim took a moment to think about what was best for her son.  \"I guess, but it's all up to Josh.\"  She then looked over at her son.  \"What do you think sweetie?\"</span></div></div>",

Bri didn't have such good judgement however.  \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will go up to your room and wait until I come up there.\"  Kim reiterated as she pointed her hand back up the stairs.  Bri, not really wanting to test her boundaries even further nodded her head and followed her sister back up to their room.  \"Now.\"  She turned her attention back to the group of women and also to her son.  \"I think we agreed to do this for a week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of women nodded their heads, but Leah seemed to have a question.  \"Will we be able to swap other things after the week is over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is all up to Josh really.\"  Kim pointed out.  \"I mean, it's his power after all.\"  All the women looked over at Josh who seemed shocked at the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, if everything goes okay this week.\"  Josh suggested as he started to get up and instantly felt a different center of gravity.  Between having Beth's physique and Cat's B-cup breasts on his chest, Josh just stood there for a moment so that he could get a feel of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful.\"  Kim replied reassuringly as she reached out to help him out, but soon found that he could walk just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just going to go up to my room for a little big.\"  Josh replied as he looked over at Leah and remembered about what he got from her.  \"So what time should I come over tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah thought about it for a minute.  \"I think around 10 or 11.\"  She suggested as she looked over at Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim thought about it for a minute.  \"Bri has a game tomorrow.\"  Josh felt a slight elation when he heard this thinking that he would be able to get out of having to clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can come and get him if I have to.\"  Leah offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great.\"  Kim replied in an appreciative manner.  \"Now let's get to the task at hand.\"  She started to hand out the books for next weeks book club meeting and Josh took the chance to go back up to his room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the ladies talked downstairs, Josh quietly made his way back to his room to see the extent of the changes.  He closed the door behind him, and just in case one of his sisters decided to come barging in, he also locked it too for good measure.  Looking down at his changed form, Josh started to undress before he got too engrossed into what was happening.  Taking a deep sigh, he started with his blue T-shirt, which seemed to be slightly distended with the breasts that were now on his chest.  He pulled the shirt over his head and noticed that Mary's, or rather his hair started to get in his way again.  \"Great.\"  He grumbled to himself as he remembered back when he had Bri's hair.  Looking down at his body once more, he noticed the fine body hair on his arms and knew that he also had Mary McCulley's body hair too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back down to business, Josh looked down at his chest and noticed what seemed to be rather utilitarian.  \"At least it's not too girly.\"  He chuckled to himself as he tried his best to unhook it from the back.  After a few minutes of trying to reach behind to grab the hooks, he decided to just take the straps down off of his shoulders and swing the bra around to the front and easily unhooked it.  \"There.\"  He replied as he licked his lips, eager to see what lay beneath the gray fabric.  Slowly he took it off and felt a small tug as each breast fell out of the cups and gravity took it's hold.  On his chest, Josh noticed what he thought was the perfect size breasts.  Reaching up with his, now smaller hands, he started to caress them.  As he did he notice a small wave of pleasure coursing through his body.  He continued to knead them and felt the pleasure well up inside him.  But what happened next surprised him a little, as he kneaded his new additions, his penis seemed to want to join the fun too.  In a matter of no time, he was sporting a full erection.  \"I need to stop before somebody walks in.\"  He said dejectedly as he brought both of his hands down to his side and began to take off his pants so that he could get a full look at his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a manner of minutes, he was fully undressed and standing in front of the full length mirror that was in the room when they moved in almost 7 years prior.  The sight of his body caused a audible gasp to come out of him.  In the mirror, what should be a teenage boy, instead looked more like a teenage girl.  From the curly red hair at the top of his head down to the petite feminine feet, Josh looked like a normal girl his age, except of course for the male genitalia that sat nestled between his legs.  Instead of his normal body hair around his genitals, he noticed that it was clear of any hair.  \"Looks like Mrs. McCulley likes to be hair free.\"  He chuckled as he took a moment to take stock of what truly happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere his once slightly broad shoulders were, now appeared narrow and more feminine in appearance.  So too, where his arms, which looked dainty and not as muscular than he expected.  His wider hips and smaller waist line certainly didn't help his appearance at all.  Then he remembered what Ashley decided to give him.  \"Perceived Gender.\"  He said to himself, as if to remind what he could do at school.  \"If I think what I think it means.\"  A devilish grin crept across his face as he thought about going to the girl's locker room when it came time for Gym.</span></div></div>",

Since then he had redressed in an old T-shirt and a pair of sweatpants, his normal sleeping attire.  He decided to leave the bra off since he had a hard time putting it on the first place.  As he lay on his bed playing one of his games, Josh heard a slight knock on his door.  Remembering that it was locked, he got up and went over to see who it was.  Each step he took he felt the jiggle of his new additions.  \"Yeah.\"  He asked the unknown person through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me.\"  Kim's voice called out to him from the other side.  \"Will you let me in?\"  Sighing, Josh agreed and unlocked the door.  \"How are you holding up?\"  She asked as she gently put her hand on his shoulder in a consoling manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I guess.\"  Josh replied not looking at his Mom completely.  \"My clothes don't fit me right and I don't like having long hair.\"  He grabbed a fistful of his new hair to help emphasize his case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie.\"  Kim answered back to her son.  \"For you hair, just keep it brushed and all you will have to do is put it up in a pony tail.  As for your clothes, well they were made to fit a man and you now have the body shape of a petite woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the petite body of my Music teacher.\"  Josh replied cutting her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm trying to say is that, you may need to look at borrowing some clothes, or we can see if Beth has some clothes that she doesn't mind parting with.\"  Kim suggested as she sat down on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that could work.\"  Josh said mostly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"  Kim said in an over motherly tone.  \"We will go and get a couple things after you get done over at Leah's.\"  She looked over at he son who seemed to agree with her.  \"Good, and on Monday, you can talk to Beth to see if you can borrow some of her clothes or I can text her to see if she can bring some stuff for you to wear.\"  Josh really didn't want to do that, but it was certainly better than wearing the ill fitting clothes that he had on.  \"Alright, I will text Beth to see if she can bring some on Monday and you can pick them up when you have her class.  So what are you going to be doing tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to the text, I have to sweep and mop the floors, dust the living room, and some other things.\"  He replied as he thought back to the text he got from Leah's husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you have any questions, I would say call me, but I think I may be too busy with your sister's game.  So I think you can ask Leah.\"  Kim chuckled at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Josh replied with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be that way.\"  Kim said consolingly as she tried to cheer up her son.  \"Leah is willing to pay you and from what I hear, she pays pretty good.  Now, I'm off to talk to your sisters about something.\"</span></div></div>",

As he played, Josh heard the girls and his Mom go into it about something, but didn't want to go out and see what was going on.  It turned out to be almost midnight before he turned in, knowing that he wouldn't be expected to be ready until around 10 or so in the morning and wanted to be ready for when Leah came over to get him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm went off on his phone around 9:30, and Josh groaned as he got up out of his bed.  As he did, the long red hair that he had gotten from his Mom's friend, Mary, the night before.  \"So it wasn't a dream.\"  He said to himself as he looked down to see two orbs pushing out of his chest and the much smaller body that he now had.  \"I guess I better be getting ready.\"  He went over to his dresser and got his boxers out so that he would have something to wear when he got out of the shower.  As he turned, he remembered his new chest and looked through the drawers to find something to keep them in place.  As he looked, he found the drawer and sighed in relief.  \"I'm so glad she doesn't have anything too girly.\"  He grabbed another utilitarian bra and went about his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, Josh got out of the shower feeling a lot better than before.  The way the water hit his skin certainly felt better than when he took a shower a couple days ago.  He got dressed in a pair of sweat pants and a T-Shirt so that he would have better mobility while he helped clean Leah's place.  \"Josh, Leah's here.\"  Courtney called out from downstairs to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he opened the door and called down to her.  \"I will be down in minute.\"  He looked around and put on his sketchers shoes and made his way down.  Going outside, Josh found that Leah drove a red Lexus.  'I guess you can drive whatever you want when your husband plays professional baseball.'  He chuckled as he got in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look, ummm...\"  Leah replied looking over to him trying to figure out the best word to use.  \"Homely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah.\"  Josh chuckled as he buckled up the seat belt and noticed how it now sat on his chest.  \"It's comfortable and the other clothes don't fit me right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're about the same size and I could look to see if I have something that you could wear.\"  Leah suggested as she put the car into gear and they headed to her house.</span></div></div>",

It has more room for your breasts so it won't be so stretched out in the front and will fit better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked around for somewhere to change when Leah interrupted his search. \"You can just change your shirt in here. It's not like I've never seen breasts before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill somewhat embarrassed to be taking his shirt off in front of Leah, but not wanting to insult her by insisting that he change elsewhere, Josh turned his back before taking his shirt off and replacing it with the one Leah had handed him.

All the young women and girls your age are wearing them these days.

You look pretty good in those clothes. There is one thing that is out of place though.\" She said looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tried to follow her gaze but his breasts were blocking a lot of the view of his lower body. \"What is out of place?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the yoga pants are kind of highlighting one thing this really out of place. Honestly I had almost forgotten that you weren't entirely a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh finally caught on to way she was talking about. He still had his manhood and the tight fabric was probably looking ridiculous stretched over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Josh,\" Leah said stepping up quite close to him, \"I must confess that I really considered swapping that with you.\" Leah looked down passed his breasts and he was sure she was looking at and referring to his manhood now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh gulped.

Josh looked down at his new outfit that Leah had graciously let him borrow for the day.  The light purple T-shirt that she gave him to wear certainly fit him a lot better than the shirt he put on this morning and the pants fit him a little too good.  He could see every curve that his new body had and could see his manhood showing underneath.  Pulling his new T-shirt down as far as he could, but found that no matter how hard he pulled it down, the shirt didn't go past his slightly wider hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stretch it out.\"  Leah protested as she attempted to swipe Josh's hands.  \"That's one of my favorite shirts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"  Josh apologized as he looked around.  \"So where do I start at?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you are certainly ready to get done aren't you?\"  Leah chuckled.  \"Well, you can start by sweeping and mopping the kitchen and after that you can do the bathrooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\"  Josh replied as he noticed just then that he was several inches shorter than Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, if you have any questions on how to do anything just let me know, okay?\"  Josh nodded his head as he looked around for the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

Probably thanks to his swap with Leah, he knew right where the duster was kept. At first things were easy but when he tried to dust the stuff on higher shelves he found that he couldn't reach them very well due to his new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he resorted to climbing on the lowest level of the bookshelf to be able to reach the top with the duster. When he was satisfied that he had done the best he could, he climbed down. That was when he heard a snickering coming from the chair in the corner. He hadn't realized it, but Leah had been watching him the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he turned to look at her, Leah started clapping and said \"That was quite the performance there Josh. I was wondering how you were going to get the top shelf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down at his feet blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry honey. All short girls have to resort to climbing the furniture sometimes. It's something you will have to get used to for the next week at least.\" Leah said with a smile. \"Speaking of swapping... Have you given any thought to my offer from earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was momentarily confused until he remembered that Leah wanted to swap genitals with him. \"Um. Not really.\" He said. \"I've been too busy cleaning to really give it much thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I want you to think about it while you are cleaning the bathrooms, alright? I'd like your final answer when you are done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... okay.\" Josh stammered before heading off to clean the bathrooms.</span></div></div>",

Josh had to give Leah and her Husband credit.  For all the money that he made with the Major League, they lived rather cheap.  As he went around the house, Josh noticed that there wasn't any extravagant purchases, no diamond plated goblets or really expensive cars, but instead everything seemed normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the bathroom, Josh couldn't find anything wrong with it, but decided to do a quick cleaning.  Taking a few minutes out of his day, he was able to get it done in no time at all.  \"I guess I have one more left to do.\"  Going back down the hall way, Josh noticed that Leah was taking the time that was freed up and seemed to be enjoying it by reading the book she had been given the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun?\"  Leah asked jokingly as she watched her temporary maid run around the house doing her chores for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loads.\"  Josh chuckled as he made his way upstairs to the Master Bath.  As he grew closer, he found that Leah's clothes were all over the floor.  \"Great.\"  He moaned as he bent over and picked them up.  Since he didn't have to do the laundry, Josh just placed them into the hamper right next to the door.  Since he'd been wearing a bra for the last day, he really didn't find it odd picking one up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, have you decided what you wanted to do yet?\"  Leah asked from the doorway, nearly causing him to jump in fright.  Laughing at his predicament, Leah placed her hand on his shoulder to steady him.  \"I'm sorry, but that was too funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, laugh it up.\"  Josh replied as he put his hand on his chest to steady his racing heartbeat.  \"I'm done.  What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too shabby.\"  Leah complimented as she looked around the bathrrom.  \"Like I was saying, have you decided yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought about it for a minute.</span></div></div>",

There was the usual flash and then it was gone. Josh looked down past his breasts and saw that the front of his borrowed yoga pants were no longer stretched out but instead they lay smooth against his now relatively flat groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to Leah and saw that she the opposite was true for her. His former penis was creating quite the tent in her own yoga pants. He could tell that she was really turned on because she was fully erect already. Josh was surprised when Leah reached down and began stroking his former penis through her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked. It really worked.\" Leah said looking at him with a surprised look on her face. \"I mean I knew it probably would after everything that happened last night, but I was afraid that it might not. But it worked perfectly. I've always been curious what one of these felt like from this side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah played with her new penis a little bit more before she noticed that Josh was just standing there watching her. She looked up at his face and said \"Go ahead Josh. I know you must be curious about what having my pussy feels like. Why don't you touch it. It is going to be your pussy for a little while after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh hadn't really been waiting for permission to touch his new genitals, he had just been too shocked by Leah's behavior to explore his newest change. But now that she had told him he could touch it, it almost seemed like it would be rude not to. Slowly Josh lowered his hands to the front of his pants and began touching himself through the thin stretchy fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly felt nice. Different, but nice. He didn't want to get too into things with Leah standing right there though. She didn't seem to have the same restraint though and was going it pretty hard through her pants. Josh pulled his hand away from his crotch and cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Leah to stop and look up. \"Sorry.\" she said, \"I guess I was getting a little carried away.\" Suddenly she started laughing and Josh couldn't figure out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is so funny?\" he finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing really. Probably just something you never thought to have to deal with before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confused Josh even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah pointed down to his crotch and said \"Now that you have a pussy, you need to watch out for Cameltoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, Josh looked down at his crotch and saw that she was right. His little exploration earlier had left him with his tight pants showing the distinct outline of his genitals. He quickly adjusted his pants to a more modest position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" Leah said. \"Now that you are done cleaning my house, I should probably take you home.\"</span></div></div>",

From her taller frame and muscles, she has been walking on cloud nine.  Sitting on the couch, Beth had been going over the lesson plan for her classes the next week.  Picking up her clarinet, Beth noticed that with Josh's physique, she couldn't play her clarinet properly.  \"This sucks.\"  She grumbled under her breath as she put down the wood instrument next to her.  \"It wasn't that bad yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought back to yesterday.  Whenever the book club had finished up, Beth made her way back over to her classroom.  Since the start of the school year, she'd needed some of the furniture that had been in the way.  The previous band instructor decided to block off some of the exits with a huge cube storage system for the low brass instruments.  The blockage had been an eyesore and a fire hazard.  The principal had come by several times to see if she needed some help with it, but declined each time because of upcoming events.  With her teenage muscles, she found it a lot easier to move and within an hour, she had it moved out of the way.

Was she demented or hated her son, we may never know but this is what happened.  The lots selected where predetermined to make Bri the first girl to select a swap with Josh.  The whole plan would fall about without this key swap.  Kim had told her youngest daughter what to select and even though Bri was too young to understand the plan it was easy to convince her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everyone here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Irene?

I got the first one!\" Bri cried out.  She didn't know she would be first but she was just as happy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Bri,\" Josh asked \"what do you want?\"  Josh didn't know what a little girl like Bri would want.  It scared him a little she could ask for anything.  He didn't think she was supposed to be part of this in the first place.  A little girl like that would probably take his age.  Who wants to be so little?\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well big brother, every one bosses me around: Mom, you, Courtney, everyone.  No matter what I do, someone tells me I can't do this, or I can't do that.  I hate it.  If I try and say no they just say they are older than me and I have to do what they want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought he was right, \"she was going to ask to be older.\"  Josh didn't want to be a kid again.  He had agreed, but he was sure if she asked for something like that he could just say 'No'  He did have to agree for the swap to take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing Bri said, \"So what I want is your self-confidence.  If I was sure of myself then I can stand up to people and they couldn't boss me around.\"  'Self-confidence' is a term that an eight year old like Bri shouldn't understand.  She didn't really, it was her mom who told her what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was relieved.  He thought she was going to make him into a little girl or just very short.  But self-confidence what was that really.  So what, that was nothing and it would only last a week.  Josh knew Bri, she got everything she wanted he thought.  So without thinking of the implications he said, \"OK, if that's what you want, you can have my self-confidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the tell tail blinding flash of light.  Nothing look like it changed.  There wasn't any easy way to see if the swap did take place.  But it did, Josh now had the self-confidence of a little girl.  This meant that Kim (especially with everyone else looking on) could get Josh to agree to anything.  If she demanded that he do something he would have to do it.  He might resist for a little while, but mommy always gets her way eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't too bad,\" Kim remarked.  \"Who's next?\"</span></div></div>",

But Josh didn't have the self-confidence (nor related will-power) to resist his mom.  Not with everyone staring at him.  He wilted like a flower and said, \"OK, I'll do it.\"  It didn't even take a moment before there was the usual flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everyone's eyes returned to normal, Josh had shrunk nine inches to Courtney's four foot eight.

It was like Minnie Mouse was sucking a helium balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" Kim said reassuringly, \"have you decided what you want yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth spoke straight to Josh.  \"Sweetie,\" she said, \"I know this is hard on you, but I would like how you talk.\"  Beth was the type of person who liked to sprinkle in words like sweetie, honey, darling, into her speech.  It was like everything she said had quotes around the sentences and those quotes were made of hearts.  Continuing, \"Honey I have been talking with this high pitched voice all my life and I would just like to talk relatively normal from now on.  Can we swap our ways of speaking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm a man.  You don't want to talk like a man do you,\" Josh retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your voice isn't as deep as it could be.  It'll probably get  deeper in a couple of years.  I like it just fine now.  Be a sweetie let me have it, pretty please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth was instructed to ask for his 'way of speaking' not his voice.  This way Josh would not only get Beth's high pitched voice, but all her vocal mannerisms too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought that this was OK.  So he talked like Mickey mouse for a few days.  No one will think it's odd for him.  He would swap back soon anyway.  Josh thought he was getting off pretty cheaply.  He agreed to the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the flash, Beth came close to Josh and gave him a kiss on the cheek.  In the voice of a young man, she said, \"Thank you.\"  It took only a couple of minutes until she found the right tone of voice to make it sound more feminine that Josh's usual speaking voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, next?\" Kim asked.</span></div></div>",

Their part in this was done and ti would be best to get them out of the room.  \"Bri and Courtney it'll be your bed time soon.  Go up stairs and get ready for bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want to see what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now young lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls left.  Then Kim asked, \"OK, next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm next, Cat said.  Cat was the most masculine person in the room.  She wore a bra and panties of course, but her slacks and button down shirt was definitely bought from the men's department.  She had known she was gay from a very early age and her and her 'roommate' have been living together for over a year now.  For the sake of the children (and her job at the school) she says she is looking for the right person, but everyone knows she is a lesbian.  She doesn't make any pretense to her friends in this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my partner Rachelle and I have been together for a long time now.  I'm glad you ushered the kids out so I can say that she and I have done everything two women can do.  We have used dildos, strap on and otherwise but that isn't the same as a real cock.  Certainly not for the one who wearing the dildo.  So what I want is everything that makes Josh male.  I'll still be a woman at least on the inside.  But with a cock and a flat chest, and everything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, you want my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly.  You'll be you, you'll just have my genitals, my breasts, my curves, things like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll make me into a woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People will still think your a man.  It's only for a week, plus I hear you had already swapped genitals with a girl.  Now you can do it with a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim stood up again.  This time she towered over him.  \"You promised,\" she reminded Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts, its just a week anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have come this far.  I guess OK then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd had gotten used to the flash.  When it was done, both Cat and Josh had changed quite a lot.  The most obvious change was Cat's B-cup breasts poked Josh's t-shirt.  His hair also changed from his boyish cut to a pixie cut.  His skin got softer and his hair disappeared, under his clothes his hips expanded and his waist narrowed and of course his penis disappeared replaced with an adult vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat's shoulders broadened as her boobs disappeared.  Slight stubble appeared on her face.  Under her slacks and underarms hair also appeared.  Her muscles developed and under her pants a penis grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was now effectively a woman although no one thought of him as one.  Josh wanted to reach up and touch his new boobs, but he restrained himself.  His mom and five other women were with him.  He couldn't do such a thing publicly.  In the end having all these feminine parts forced upon him was exciting.  When this was over he could do what he wanted and say, hey I didn't ask for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Kim said, \"that was interesting.  Who's turn is it now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leah had the biggest boobs and smallest waist of any of Kim's friends.  She didn't have to work hardly at all as her husband was the wife of a professional baseball player.  Kim and Leah had been friends a long time, since way before Leah became rich.  They hadn't lost touch as is sometimes the case.  Everybody thought that her husband married Leah for her body, but her friends at the book club knew she had plenty in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at Leah and thought, \"What could this woman possibly want?  She has everything a great body and a rich husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of you know me here,\" Leah stated.  \"Most of you knew me before I got married and I don't think I have changed too much.  I'm a good person and a smart person.  My husband is very nice and they is why we got married.  But people see me and think look at her, he only married her as eye candy.  This isn't fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh started to get worried during Leah's speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing Leah said, \"I want to prove everyone wrong.  I want everyone to know that it's not my body that my husband fell in love with.  So I want to trade the curves the body I have now with the curve that Josh has.\"  Due to the last swap, Josh had the shape of a woman.  Cat had had a nice body before even though it had always been hidden under men's shirts and slacks.  But that didn't mean she didn't have any curves at all.  Leah wanted those more ordinary (or maybe slightly less than ordinary curves) to replace her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh saw the sexy body of Leah.  He was already a woman where it counted, the lust within him made this swap easy.  If you already have boobs and everything else, what difference did it make if your boobs were bigger and all the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'll swap with you,\" Josh said followed by the flash of bright light that no one even flinched at anymore.  When it was done, Josh's boobs, expanded two cup sizes and sagged a little big since they weren't being supported.  His hips, thighs, and butt ballooned as his waist slightly narrowed.  Josh hadn't grown in height (he was still the smallest in the room having Courtney's height of four foot eight) which made his curves look larger than they had been on Leah.  His face became prettier and a thousand other slight changes effected his body making him look gorgeous and very sexy in an organic way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah's appearance, on the other hand became more average.  She was still pretty, but her huge melons were gone, replaced with B-cups.  Her curves were less pronounced.  Her face was a little plainer.  If a stranger saw her, she would look like just another woman, not the bombshell she had been.  Not that anyone in the room had noticed, they were all staring at what had become of Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew what his new assets were and purposefully looked away.  Josh planned on exploring his new body when he was alone.  He thought that after this was all over, he should take a shower.  He didn't take a shower every night, but tonight he thought he did need one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, we are over half done,\" Kim said.  \"Whose turn is it now?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley raised her hand.  It was her turn.  Ashley was a very busy lady.  It was a wonder she could make it to the book club at all .  She had two girls aged four and six and a full time job at the University working for the president as his secretary.  She loved her kids and she loved her job, but she felt put upon.  She thought if she was a man, things would be easier.  She not only had to make the beds and get the kids ready in the morning, but she had to spend an hour putting on her clothes and getting made up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was a man, she could just take a quick shower and put on a suit with a white shirt and any old tie and she would be done.  But as a woman, she was expected to pick her skirt suit every morning.  She couldn't just pick the same old blue one, she had to decide from over a dozen suits that she had.  Each in different colors and different lengths.  She would have to coordinate it with a blouse and wear it with hose or tights.  But even the hose wasn't an easy decision.  Did she need nude hose or something with color?  Opaque or transparent? Control top or regular?  Then of course there was the shoes and accessories.  This all had to be decided before she showered, because that would determine her hair style too.  Then there was the makeup which had to match her outfit.  Not to mention her panties and bra which shouldn't be seen, but had to enhance her apparel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also thought that if she was a man, she would be admired for being a parent and having a full time job.  She wouldn't be treated condensendingly by her boss and would be making more money at least.  Or she should have had a promotion at best.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wanted to be a woman.  She would never give that up, she liked it, it was all of the things that society thrust upon her as a woman that she didn't like.  She tried to explain her case to the group.  Josh didn't understand but the rest of the women understood what she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing she said, \"So because of all of that, I want to swap the expectations that society has on being a woman with you Josh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, what do you mean the expectations,\" Josh squeaked.  He didn't know what she was getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well like I said, people's expectations.  I can't just run out and pick up milk.  I have to make sure my face is made up and my clothes match.  It's just the way it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't sound like any big deal.  Josh already had the big boobs and vagina of a woman.  What does it matter if people treated him as a woman too.  Besides, he was more interested in getting alone and exploring his new body.  So he simply agreed to the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the flash cleared, Josh was dressed totally differently.  He wasn't wearing jeans and a t-shirt anymore, he was wearing a pleated brown skirt and a white blouse.  Under his blouse he wore a bra because no one could imagine a woman to go around without some support for her breasts, not to mention his nipples would be exposed under his top.  Makeup for the first time appeared on his face, making him look very pretty.  His sneakers became high heels and his posture changed to something more refined as he crossed his legs.  All of his mannerisms (both obvious and subtle) became completely female.  Josh didn't even realize all of the changes.  He certainly didn't know he was wearing makeup now since he couldn't see his face.  If he did, he would probably freshen his lipstick a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK ladies just one more to go,\" he said.  His high pitched voice sounded cute now that it matched his appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be Mary's turn next.  Kim would follow after.  Kim hadn't picked a number but she was going to get her turn in the end.  It would be the last turn of the assembled ladies.  But there would be one more turn after that.  A turn that would change everything.</span></div></div>",

Also if you like the complete arc let me know through an email/message.  If you think I missed something at the end let me know that too.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary rose to speak. Everyone knew she was the last one left.  Mary had had a hard life.  She was born in Ireland and quickly became pregnant with Megan.  Her and her husband emigrated to this country soon there after.  She is a Catholic girl who tried to make her marriage work.  She tried a long time,  But she had married too early.  As a last ditch effort, three years ago, she had another child, Michael who is still in diapers.  But that didn't help and soon her husband left her.  She didn't believe in divorce as a Catholic, but when your husband leaves what else is there to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did find a good lawyer and between the alimony and child support and her thrifty ways she didn't have to work.  She was a full time mother.  She was still young at thirty, but without the help of the father and little excess money she spent most of her time with her children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing her throat and sighing a little she started to speak.  You could still hear the trace of an Irish brogue in her voice.  \"What I want is a week off,\" she began.  \"I have been taking care of my house, my former husband and my babies for eleven years now.  There didn't seem to be a day when I couldn't just relax and be myself.  It was always keep the house clean, support my husband, take care of the babies.  Now that my husband is gone and the house doesn't have to be spotless I have so little I just can't get away and have some fun.  Babysitters are expensive and can you really trust them.  You worry all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't like where this was heading.  Which was saying a lot considering how he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing, \"To give me a break, I want to swap my motherhood with you Josh.  We would also have to swap our ages too, since you can't be fifteen and be the mother of an eleven year old.  If we swap then I can take a break for a week and know that my children are taken care of.  You will be their mother after all with all the motherly concern I have.  I'll be just a silly teenager enjoying a break from all my responsibilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary sweetheart,\" Josh squeaked unable to believe what he was hearing.  He couldn't imagine anyone would give up their children.  No woman anyway. \"Are you sure you want to do this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know they will be in good hands.  You will treat them like your own children, because they will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom,\" Josh said plaintively to Kim.  \"This is different.  Do I have to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think it'll be good for you.  You'll get to see what it's like to be a parent.  It'll come in handy when you are older.  Plus you don't realize the good side, you will have your own house.  Until this is over, you won't be living here, you'll be your own person, an adult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sealed it,\" although Josh had little choice anyway.\"  There was a flash after Josh simply said, \"oh OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot changed because of this swap.  The clothes that Josh was now wearing changed from professional looking to much more casual.  They were also the clothes of a woman who didn't have too much money.  The makeup on his face which he still hadn't seen also took on a more casual appearance.  It was also of a lesser quality but still applied well.  In his panties his vagina changed (without him knowing) such that if he had another child, that child would be genetically a sibling of Megan and Michael.   His hair became red and curly and his skin lightened to reflect his now Irish heritage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the things that matter most weren't the physical things.  For Josh to be the mother of Megan and Michael he had to remember everything that had to do with them.  He could remember giving birth to them and loving them instantly.  But he remembered farther back than that.  He remembered how he met his husband, James (father of his children)  How James persisted with him until they dated, how he swept him off his feet and then married him.  The entire marriage and of course all of his wifely duties  two of which produced the birth of his children.  This had totally changed his life more than any of the other swaps before it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary youthened and became part of the Mitchell household to even the scales.  She forgot everything she knew about her marriage and lost the maternal feelings toward her own children.  They were just kids she knew and nothing more to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Dears if that is it, I have to get back to my children and I'll see you all in a week.\" Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that isn't quite it,\" Kim explained.  \"It's now my turn.\"</span></div></div>",

Josh agreed, it wasn't any big deal.  he didn't want to see his friends until this was all over anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" he said and then there was a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh now had Kim's social life.  But there was something that he hadn't known about it.  Kim never brought men into the lives of her children until it was very serious.  Such that Josh hadn't known about Paul Ward.  Kim had met Paul several months ago in a chance meeting.  He asked her out and she accepted.  Paul was handsome and self assured which made him irresistible to Kim.  Before she knew she was deeply in love with him.  It was only later that she found out Paul was already married.  But it was too late, she loved him nonetheless.  She tried to avoid him, but she couldn't he had gotten under her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh now knew of this relationship and couldn't help but love him just as Kim had.  he was desperate for him.  It was even worse for Josh since he had the self-confidence (or lake of one) of an eight year old and the vulnerability of a divorced mother of two.  When Josh got home and touched himself, he wouldn't be thinking as he once would have.  he would be imagining that he was with Paul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Josh's much more attractive body had changed Paul's opinion of him too.  Josh wasn't just a casual lay for Paul now, he was one of the sexiest women he knew.  Paul would never leave his wife for Kim, but Josh was different.  He certainly made more time for Josh than he would have for Kim.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I think it all works as a complete story with everything making sense.  The horror of the story is that in the end Josh isn't only stuck, he doesn't know he is supposed to 'return to normal.\"  I tried to leave the characters as they had been written as much as possible, but I did make a few changes to make the story make sense.  If you have any comments email/message me.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrene entered the room with Mary after the  last swap was concluded.  She saw all her friends there and Kim who was no longer her friend.  Josh had just swapped his social life which included all of Kim's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here? And what is the emergency?\" Irene asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's sort of hard to explain,\" Kim stated purposefully fumbling on the words.  \"You see Josh can do things that umm, well you just had to be here to understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh,\" Kim said, \"can you help me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Irene sweetie, I met this woman while it was raining and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh I have a better idea,\" Kim cut him off.  \"Why not just swap the memory everything that happened to day with Irene and she'll know it as well as anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could tell her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look we haven't all day and you have to get back to your kids,\" Kim raised her voice and used a tone implying that Josh should just do what she said.  He was running late.  If he got home just a few minutes passed the hour the babysitter would want the entire hour payment.  It probably would be easier to just do as Kim suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to know what happened right?\"  Kim told/asked Irene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what is going on here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that assent there was a flash of light and everything that happened to Josh today was forgotten by him and remembered by Irene.  She knew about the miserable day, the rain storm, the gypsy, the test swaps and everything that happened tonight.  Josh on the other hand remembered only the ordinary day that Irene had.  Groceries, chores, a phone call to come over and here he was.  he didn't know why he was here anymore nor what had happened.  All of his swaps were forgotten along with the memory to swap everything back next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh,\" Kim said quickly.  \"I'm sorry, but I know you have to go.  The babysitter is waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.  But what did you guys want to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing important, we'll call you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't care very much anyway.  He was horny and he didn't know why exactly.  But for some reason he was thinking about Paul and if he couldn't come over, he would touch himself instead.  Josh was Irish but he didn't receive Mary's puritanical values with her swap, just her genetic makeup, not including the other swaps he got which was why he was very short way under five feet tall and still have D cut breasts and very wide hips with a narrow waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh left, never knowing what had happened.  he didn't even realize he had his swapping power. All those memories had been swapped away.</span></div></div>",

Being different  physically doesn't really bother me though.\" Josh explained. He decided to try and swap occupations with her instead. \"It's just that school has been tough lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Are other girls bullying you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not that. Just having to worry about grades, tests, papers, and all of that other stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. We all have to do through it at one time or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could have a job like you where I wouldn't have to be as stressed out all the time. Even if it was for a couple of days.\" He said, setting out the bait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if I were ever able to make that possible, I would give you my job and go to school for you. But unfortunately, that's just not how the world works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would do that for me?\" Josh asked. He was not smiling because of how sweet his mom was, but because he was almost done tricking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything I could do within reason to help my daughter, definitely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough for Josh, he decided to pull the trigger. \"Well I agree to swap occupations with you!\" He exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light consumed Josh's bedroom once again, and Kim was caught of guard by it and covered her eyes as if she was shielding them from something. \"What do you mean swap occupations? What just happened? What was the light?\" She asked very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh raised his hands to calm his mom down. \"It's okay mom. I just swapped our occupations like you said you would do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?!?\" She asked even louder, and not any calmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I forgot to mention. You see, I...\" Josh explained everything that had happened from the end of school to when he arrived at home. He left out the part about the swaps with his sisters though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's crazy talk!\" His mom argued. \"Tell me what just happened and don't lie this time.\" She said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling the truth! Here I'll prove it.\" He said getting an idea. He looked around the room for his book bag, but could not find it. He then realized that if reality changed once again, his mom must own his school supplies. \"Wait here.\" He said before leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" His mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, Josh was back with a bag that did not appear to be his. However, it had the look of a bag that could be used for carrying school supplies. Here reached into a pocket and pulled out a card, which was a school ID. It replicated the one Josh had, but now had his mom's information on it. \"See mom, this ID is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at it, but still refused to believe it. \"This isn't real.\" She argued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is. It has your picture and reads: Name: Kim Mitchell, Grade: 9, Age: 36.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay that's enough!\" She said. \"I believe you. Now I demand you swap us back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why now mom? Don't you think it would be fun to go back to high school? And I want to see what it's like having a job. Why don't we stay like this through Monday, and we can swap back if you don't like it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As fun as that would be, you're not qualified to do my job.\" His mom said, finally lightening up a bit. She had to admit, she had always wondered what it would be like to go back to high school for a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can swap knowledge on how to do your job. And I can give you my knowledge on school.\" He suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still not a great idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please mom? You said you would do anything within reason to help your daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was about to argue that it wasn't within reason, but realized she had no arguement. Plus, her curiosity overcame her and made her want to try high school over again. \"Alright, but I choose when we swap back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Thanks mom!\" He said before giving her a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim ran her fingers through her son's long hair. \"These are the mother-daughter moments I've always wanted. Now let's get to swapping our knowledge on how to do our occupations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh and Kim swapped some more so Josh could do his mom's job well, and so Kim could survive a school day or two. Kim left the room after, leaving her 'daughter' to play video games.\"</span></div></div>",

Courtney took a seat on the couch next to Bri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Joshua.\" Kim said, finally breaking the silence. She only used his real name when it was something serious, like the moment she found out about his swaps with his sisters. \"Sit.\" Kim pointed to the other chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on mom?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after talking to your sisters, we decided that grounding you wasn't the best route to take.\" Josh face suddenly beamed with joy, but not for much longer. \"We decided you needed a more fitting punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We decided that we could still make you learn a lesson, but give us a new experience at the same time. You see, we want to make some swaps with you.\" His mother explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh became very fearful but tried to remain as calm as possible. \"Wait, but I thought you said this would be a 'swap free house'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a change of heart, after some convincing from your sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? What if I don't want to. I have to agree as well.\" He argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I could ground you until you agree then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you win.\" Josh admitted, seeing no other way out. \"How many swaps and for how long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We get three swaps each,which you MUST agree to no matter what. And, we get to keep them until Monday. Isn't that right girls?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually mom, I think you said a week.\" Courtney replied, while Bri nodded her head eagerly in agreement. Josh could only glare at his sister. He did not know why she was in on this, as she had no real reason to be angry with him. Courtney stuck her tounge out in response to Josh's glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's settled, we'll swap back right here at this very time next week. Now girls, each one of us picks one thing to take from Josh at a time until we go three times around. He got the two of you first, so I'll let one of you go first.\" She said, pointing to Bri and Courtney for them to make a decision. Josh did not like how his mom was acusing him of forcing the others into swaps. If anything, they made him do the swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we do rock, paper, scissors.\" Bri spoke up. \"It's the only fair way.\" This time, Courtney was the one to nod in agreement. The girls turned to each other, balled one of their hands into fists, and hit the fists The their other hand three times. Courtney came out the winner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I win!\" The older of his two younger siblings cheered. \"Alright Josh, I want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Two out of three.

For the longest time, Bri had been a little jealous of her sister.  She was jealous of how she had it easy making friends, being able to stay out later, and always seemingly getting what she wanted.  This, however, would be disputed by both of her siblings, who saw that since she was the youngest member of the family, Bri was the one that always seemed to get her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\"  Courtney thought for a moment as Josh seemed to sweat at the upcoming verdict.  \"I think I want to swap our clothes.  I want to see what the big deal it with guys clothes and why everyone is so crazy about them.\"  She looked at her brother who looked as if he didn't want to say anything.  \"Well?!\"  She complained to her brother and then looked at her Mom who seemed to be getting aggravated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to wear girl's clothes.\"  Josh complained as he started to sulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim started to get a little redder in the face.  \"You didn't seem to mind when you swapped your gender with your sister.\"  She looked over at Courtney who seemed to be sinking into the couch to avoid her Mom's gaze.  \"Or when you swapped your groin and underwear with your little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"  Josh started to protect himself, but was soon cut off by his Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts...\"  She answered as she gave her son 'the look', which always seemed to make him squirm.  Seeing the look, Josh shut up and tried to avoid her gaze.  \"Now, you will accept these changes, or I will make your life a living hell for the next month to make you wish you would've swapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room seemed to grow cold and silent and everyone waited for what happened next.  \"Fine.  I agree to swap with you Courtney.\"  The bright light invaded the room once more and as it started to die down, the silence was broken by Bri laughing at something.  He felt something off and looked down at his body and knew that the swap had happened.  He was now wearing Courtney's <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.belk.com/p/pj-couture-unicorn-shortie-pajama-set/210200581918.html?rrec=true\">pajamas</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://www.belk.com/p/pj-couture-unicorn-shortie-pajama-set/210200581918.html?rrec=true\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>.

Instead, she now had a single pony tail fixed at the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Josh.\"  Courtney replied with a grin.  \"Are you going to do it?  I know it will certainly help while you wear my clothes.\"  Josh felt that this was a shot at his masculinity and groaned at the thought of having to wear Courtney's less than boyish looking clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Josh.\"  Bri pleaded as she tried her best to give the puppy dog eyes that she'd been known to do from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to feel the wrath of his Mom, Josh sighed.  \"Well it wasn't too bad when I had it last time.

Even though she had an average cup size, she thought it would be a great idea for her son to see what it would be like to have a pair for himself.  By having his own pair, she thought that he would, in turn, have a better respect for the other gender.  \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tried his best to avoid her gaze.  He felt his penis starting to stiffen at the thought of having a pair of breasts himself and tried his best to cover it up, since Courtney's shorts were a little too short, Josh felt it was only a matter of time before it popped out.  Crossing his legs was a last resort that seemed to be the best thing.  He was brought out of this little daze with Bri yelling at him.  \"Hmm?\"  He replied looking over at his sister, with his shorter hairstyle on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom is talking to you.\"  Bri answered back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Kim responded back to her son.  \"Well, are you going to agree swapping chests with me or not?\"  She crossed her arms over her chest, trying her best to look intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to make her too mad and face her wrath, Josh ultimately agreed.  \"Fine, I agree to swap that with you.\"  For the third time that night, the bright light engulfed the room and caused the Mitchell family to protect their eyes.  As his vision was starting to come back, Josh felt a small tug coming from his chest and felt the irritation too.  Looking down, he was met with the sight of a pair of breasts.  Opening the top of his new tank top, Josh was met with the gaze that most teenage guys don't want to see.  His Mom's breasts now rested on his chest and certainly looked out of place on his body.  The enlarged nipples and areolas were seen by Josh in some of his friend's magazines.  Something that his Mom would certainly frown upon and ground him if she found out about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, honey.\"  Kim replied to her son as she found herself jumping up and down in her seat to see if her physics have changed any.  She found that without her chest being in the way, the way that she moved certainly was different.  \"I think I will like this when I have to go to work and clean the house.\"  Josh only groaned and crossed his arms under his new chest, only finding that it accentuated it even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn again.\"  Courtney chuckled as she looked to her Mom.  \"Right?\"  Kim just nodded her head over at her daughter.  \"Yay.\"  She cheered.  \"I think I want to swap out our _________.\"</span></div></div>",

She waited for her brother to say something with her voice, but he sat there with his mouth shut.  Bri then started to pout since she didn't get her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh, on the other hand sat there thinking about what all it would entail.  His Mom surely did alot around the house, but he thought that he could handle it.  He continued to sit there thinking it over and finally gave Bri what she wanted.

Sighing, he reluctantly agreed.  \"I will swap that with you.\"  The bright light enveloped the room once more and as it subsided, Josh felt lighter.  Looking down, he saw that his Mom's normally C-cup breasts had shrunk down to an A cup.  \"Wow.\"  He replied in shock, but stopped when he heard his voice, which didn't change.  He thought that with the increased puberty, he would have gotten a slightly less girly voice.  Thinking back, Josh remembered that his mom telling him that she was a late bloomer, not seeing any results until the summer between her 7th and 8th grade and thought that was the reason why his chest wasn't any bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look different.\"  Bri chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, laugh it up.\"  Josh replied as he looked over at Courtney.  He couldn't believe at what he saw.  In her place stood a knock out, that Josh knew that this is what she would look like in several years.  She now stood 5' 3\" tall with a moderate B-cup bust.  Her hair grew slightly longer and her curves had become more pronounced, especially the curve in her pants, which she got from Josh last round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Courtney asked with a grin.  \"Do I look weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn.\"  Bri yelled out with excitement.  \"I want to swap our __________\"</span></div></div>",

Steadying himself, he pulled down his short shorts as much as he could and made his way up stairs.  Soon, he found himself in front of the door.  Taking care in opening it, since he didn't really know what he was going to find, Josh was surprised to find that it looked pretty much the same.  As a matter of fact, it looked exactly the same, except for the fact that his bed was now where Bri's was and his clothes were now strewn all over Courtney's side of he room.  Stepping into the room, Josh found the mirror that Courtney would often frequent.  In the mirror, Josh was shocked at the sight reflecting back at him.  The longer hair, that was tied up into a pony tail behind his head, was out of the way and he'd forgotten that he had swapped it out earlier.  Bringing his hand up to his face, Josh noticed how much less defined his arms now were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious at what other things changed, Josh got up and made his way over to the closet.  Opening it, the first thing that he noticed was that it seemed a bit bigger than he was used to.  Looking down at his body, he knew why it seemed so much bigger.  His body had lost some height and from the reflection in the mirror just a short time earlier, Josh could tell that from how much higher the clothes were generally.  From the look of things, he guessed that he lost a good 6 to 7 inches.</span></div></div>",

Another flash came and went within the room. Josh reached for the coffee table where he earlier rested his cell phone, then picked and went to his contacts. Some notables where Leah Thomas, Ashley Reynolds, Beth Fletching, Cat Marquez, and Mary McCulley. He also noticed Dr. Wright's number as well, which was listed as 'Mike Wright'.Josh thought their relationship was purely professional, and pehaps it was. But he didn't know she considered him a friend. Maybe there was something more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney interrupted the exploration of his new contacts. \"You can play on your phone later, we've got some more swaps to make.\" Josh shut his phone down and rested back on the table, diverging his attention to his sister. \"Since it's my turn,\" she continued. \"I want to swap _____ with you.\"</span></div></div>",

She pulled out her wallet, which inside contained her driver's license. She took a close look at it and to her amazement, next to \"Sex:\" was a capital \"M\" showing that the swap had worked. \"Amazing!\" She remarked. \"Look girls, you have a new father now!\" The apparent father showed to her two youngest of her supposedly three girls. They started to pass it around amazed with the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As cool as that is,\" Bri started. \"I believe it's time for me to choose a swap.

Their Mom, rather that berate Josh for not acting ladylike, told them about an odd story she heard from one of her friends.  It seemed that an older woman with a walker seemed to appear and disappear throughout the town.  She just laughed it off as just a story and nothing more, but stopped when she saw the goosebumps on her children's arms.  \"I didn't think that it would scare you guys that much.\"  She replied as she kept on eating, but reminded her two older children about their duties.  \"Don't forget that you two will need to do your chores when you get done.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down to see that he was now down with his plate.  '<i>I wonder that when I got her gender, if we swapped chores.</i>'  He thought to himself as he got up from the table leaving the empty plate where it was.  If that was the case, he would love to do the dishes and clear the table.  Ever since several years ago, Josh was in charge of taking the trash out and making sure that they were properly secured so that no animals could get into it.  He remember last year when a group of raccoons or possums seemed to have a feast with all the trash cans in the neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\"  Kim said as she cleared out her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"  Josh asked as he turned to his Mom, who was gesturing to the empty plate that he had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to clear your plate?\"  She asked while trying to motion toward the plate that he left and give her daughters a dirty look for their chuckling.  Courtney seemed to be finding this especially funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I uhh...\"  Josh stammered as he thought of a good excuse to make up for this blunder.  \"I was waiting for everyone to get done before I cleared all the plates.\"  He mentally gave himself a pat on the back for the great excuse that he was able to come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's eyes started to narrow, something that she often did when something somebody did didn't make any sense.  \"Well,  if you wait until everyone is done, then you will have a lot more to do.  So, I suggest that you start the water and wash them as they come to you.\"  Josh just nodded his head before his Mom got too mad and made him do something that he didn't want to do.  She then turned to Courtney.  \"Oh and I need you to make sure that the trash cans are brought up front so that the trash men can take them tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Courtney grumbled to her Mom as Josh chuckled.</span></div></div>",

He was feeling on top of the world after not caving in to Bri's pathetic attempt at blackmail.

Josh was enjoying studying with Jen from the aspect of that for once he didn't have to have a book or something nearby to cover his crotch in case he got...excited around her.  Josh thought about ending the study session and just telling Jen about his new powers, but he decided that swapping with Bri was enough for now.  He'd probably let Jen in on it eventually but for now he decided to keep it simple.  So after a little over an hour of studying Jen closed her book and went on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh actually had let himself not think about his powers and swaps he had made with his sister as he went back to playing video games.  When he started to yawn Josh decided it was time for bed, and when he stripped down to his new panties he was strongly reminded about what had happened.  Looking into the mirror he couldn't help but laugh.  He had longer hair than he had ever had, he was wearing pink polka dotted panties, and his crotch was smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird and so cool.\"  Josh said to himself as he began to climb into bed, \"But as neat as this is, I'll swap back with Bri.

He pulled off his pants and underwear and saw that they were indeed covered in blood but he couldn't see any wounds that would account for it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh heard a scream from behind him and turned to see Jen standing in the doorway. In his haste to get his pants off, Josh had forgotten to close the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GOD!\" screamed Jen. \"I'll call an ambulance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to turn and run out of the room when Josh grabbed her arm. \"Wait.\" he said. \"I don't need an ambulance. I'm alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not! You are bleeding and your penis and balls are gone. Where are they? Maybe they can sew them back on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. Come back into the bathroom and I'll explain everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill looking really doubtful Jen reentered the bathroom and closed the door. While Josh set about cleaning the blood off of his crotch with a wet washcloth he explained about meeting the old woman, giving her his umbrella, and getting the swapping power. He then told her about how he and Bri had swapped genitals and that she had refused to swap back with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a girl now?\" Jen asked even though the proof was right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose technically I am but only in this one place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't you sister only like 8? That's way to young for her to be getting a period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been thinking about that ever since I realized that was what is happening to me. I think it is because my body is older; her genitals are trying to catch up so they are getting older really fast to catch up with the rest of my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes some sense. Wait does that mean that you penis, which Bri has, is getting younger to match her body?\" Jen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Heck I don't even know if my theory is right.\" Josh said. \"What I do know though, is that I need something to control this bleeding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't look at me.\" Jen said. \"I'm not having my period right now, so I'm not carrying anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Courtney has something I can borrow.\" Josh said looking through the bathroom cabinets. \"Hmm. Nothing. Maybe she doesn't need them yet. Can you go look in my Mom's bathroom and see if you can find me something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you go?\" Jen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn answer Josh gestured down to his naked crotch where droplets of blood were still forming and occasionally dripping onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right. Wow, you are having a heavy flow today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen left the bathroom and returned a little later holding a tampon. \"I know it's not ideal, but this is all I could find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's better than nothing.\" Josh said taking the tampon from her. He unwrapped it and examined it for a while. \"Um, how does this thing work anyway?\"</span></div></div>",

How do you not make it spray everywhere when you use the bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't help but chuckle at his question.  \"I thought you said it was going to be easier.  All you have to do is aim it and what's the other question?\"  He noticed that she blushed.  \"What is it?\"  He pressed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I noticed some of Courtney's posters and it started to get hard.\"  Bri replied back to him with her face almost a brilliant shade of crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh let out a huge guffaw over the last question.  \"I honestly thought it was going to be something like that.\"  He put his remote down and motioned for her to come and sit next to him.  She obliged and had a seat on his bed, where he was motioning for her to sit.  He explained to her the whole birds and the bees, how when he saw a beautiful lady, it would do the same thing for him.  \"The only thing that I can think of is that your 'future' sexual preferences are taking hold.  That would explain why seeing a guy you think is handsome your, I mean my, member comes to attention.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\"  Bri responded back to him.  \"I'm just glad that it wasn't just me going crazy.  Thanks for clearing that up at least.  Can I help you out with anything?  Fix your hair or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just looked at her for a minute.  \"I guess you can help me with the hair.  I don't want to have to deal with the tangles that you did when you were younger.\"  Bri just shook her head to get rid of the bad memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I can help you out with that.\"  She answered back.  \"I learned some new braids last month when I went to that sleepover at Jenna's house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\"  Josh said sarcastically, but turned to face the opposite wall so that his sister could fix her hair that as now on his head.  Within about 5 minutes, Josh had twin braids going down both shoulders.  He picked up one of the braids and looked at the brown hair.  '<i>It's only for another day.</i>'  He thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

After playing for what seemed like several minutes, Josh looked over to the clock to realize it had been several hours. <i>\"It's 9 o'clock already?\"</i> Josh thought. He then heard a 'ding' come from his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Josh! Sorry I couldn't make it over to your house today, I had to babysit and then my phone died. Maybe tomorrow?\" -Jenn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That would explain why she didn't show up or text me.\"</i> He thought. \"Sounds good. You can come whenever you want, just text me when your coming.\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then heard a knock on his door. For whatever reason he thought it was his mom, checking in or taking care of some laundry. His guess was wrong when the person was once again Bri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi again Joshie!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bri, what brings you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing really, I'm just heading for bed because I have to get up early for my game tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, goodnight and good luck in your game tomorrow. Don't forget to come back so he can swap our hair back tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do. Goodnight big bro!\" She closed the door behind her, only to open it again and walk back in without closing the door behind her. \"Before I leave, I was thinking about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh should've known better than to think she didn't want something. \"What is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to make another swap, one that will help me in the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing this was probably Bri's plan the entire time, Josh quietly cursed himself out for letting it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap feet.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, your feet are way bigger than mine. It will be easier to kick the ball, and I will kick it better when I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was the kind of person who was always willing to help out the ones close to him. \"Nothing bad will happen. She'll probably be back from the game before I know it.\" Josh thought. He looked down at his large feet one more time, then took a look at Bri's petite feet. \"I agree to swap feet with you.\" Josh said before the bright flash occupied his room for the fifth time of the day. The next thing he knew, he looked down to see he had much smaller feet. He stood up, and felt a bit off standing. There was a bit off soreness, which he wasn't surprised about it considering these tiny feet had to bear the weight of his  bigger body. His balance wasn't at its best either, considering his center of gravity had probably changed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri on the other hand, now had humongous feet compared to her smaller body. Her feet looked incredibly out of proportion with the rest of her. \"Wow my feet are so big!\" Bri cheered. She had no shoes or socks on, and even though she had her brother's feet now, her toenails were still painted light blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're size 11.\" Josh replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool. Thank you so much!\" She said, giving Josh a big hug. \"Later big bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Bri, Josh had no shoes on during the swap. His socks were resized to comfortably fit his sister's smaller feet. She never told Josh what shoe size she was, so he decided to look for himself. He found a pair of his sneakers on the other side of his room. He walked over to them, which certainly felt different. He looked for one of those small tags sewn on the inside. He found that his shoes were now size 3.5! <i>\"Geez, Bri, no wait... I have really small feet!\"</i> He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he brought his legs over the side of the bed and gave his body a giant stretch.  That's when he felt his bladder was filled to it's max and screamed to be released.  He quietly made his way over to the bathroom.  \"Hey there sweetie, did you sleep well last night?\"  His Mom's voice called out from behind him.  Josh froze where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"  Josh replied back to her, holding his breath waiting for his Mom to say something about his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fine?\"  She replied as she turned him around to get a better look at him.  \"I swear, you were dead to the world.\"  She began to chuckle.  \"I went in there to ask you a question and you didn't even move an inch.\"  She picked up one of his braids and looked at it, when she did this, Josh froze in place.  \"You really need to think about getting a haircut or at least go to the salon with me to get the dead ends cut off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a massive sigh of relief.  \"Yeah, perhaps we can do it next weekend.\"  He responded back to her.

The first one he noticed was one of the three Mitchell children together, Josh was in the middle of his sisters and now had Bri's longer hair pulled back into a ponytail. Meanwhile, Bri was on Josh's right side and had Josh's shorter hair and the hair on her arms were visible because she was wearing a dress, meaning there were no sleeves. The second one that Josh saw was a picture of his two sisters on the beach. Bri, standing on the right side, once again had Josh's short hair, and there was an obvious bulge coming from the bottom of her one piece bikini. \"That must be why mom was treating me like I've always had Bri's hair.\" Josh said to himself. Sitting on the couch, Josh watched some cartoons for a few hours. Nothing was different about the experience, except he found that sitting with his legs crossed was now much more comfortable considering he didn't have a penis to get in the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Jish decided to go and play some video games. He saw that Jenn's little sister Kira was on. She was one of Josh's gaming buddies, even though she and Courtney were friends. They played Call of Duty for a while with Kira winning most of the games. \"Man, I should use my new power to trade gaming skills with her someday.\" He told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh looked over at the clock, it was 7:15. \"Huh, Bri should be home by now. We still need to swap back.\" He said hoping to get his hair and genitals back in a short time.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't really focus on studying though, as he was waiting for Bri to return, but he was starting to worry that she might have decided to sleep over somewhere, and he would be stuck with his youngest sister's hair and vagina for another night. At 7:30, Bri finally returned home, and came upstairs, making a stop at her room before Jish heard a knock on his door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" Josh said, hoping it was Bri so they could swap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Josh!\" His littlest sister said walking in, she was out of her soccer uniform and in normal clothes now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis, how'd your game go?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was great!\" She said excitedly. \"We won 5-3 and I scored 3 goals! Your hair was a big help, so thanks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem! By the way, are you ready to swap that back now?\" He asked, and held his breath hoping she would say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\" Bri said dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh guessed he had to officially agree, seeing as they had not swapped back yet, so he threw in a \"Me too.\" There was then a quick flash of light that he was now seeing for the third time, and when it was gone, he felt the top of his head to see his shorter hair had returned, along with the rest of his body hair. Bri's hair was now longer with two twin braids, and she had almost no body hair again. Josh figured it was a good time to get his genitals back as well. \"Let's swap our private parts back too.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, we never agreed when to swap back.\" She said. \"I want to keep it a bit longer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worried Josh because he really wanted to get his penis back. Then, he suddenly got an idea. \"I'll make you a deal sis, if you give me my penis back I'll make one swap in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I don't?\" Bri questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there will be no more swaps for the rest of the night.\" He answered.</span></div></div>",

She turned two controllers on and handed one to Josh. Call of Duty was already in so Bri just had to start up a game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Josh could already see something was off. First, Bri was setting up the game without any effort. Second, he failed to recall what the controls were! His theory proved to be right, as Bri jumped to any early lead while eliminating his player multiple times in a row.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is fun!\" Bri said. \"I'm pretty good at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you mean I'm good at this.\" Josh corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri won the first game without dying once. Her brother never stood a chance now that the former had the latter's skills. In the middle of the second game, their mother dropped by to check in on her kids. \"Bri, your teaching your brother how to play video games? How cute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Josh's frustration continued to grow as he continued to get destroyed by his youngest sister. She once again won the second game without her avatar suffering a single death. By the time the third game had rolled around, Josh had grown tired of constantly losing. He did eventually get Bri once due to him improving Bri's have skills a bit. There was no increase of enjoyment because of this though. When the third game ended, Josh tossed his controller to the ground in anger. \"That's it, I'm done.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! I win!\" His sister cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we swap back now?\" He requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\" Bri said. \"That was too much fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about tomorrow night before bedtime then?\" He proposed. \"You can have my skills for the rest of the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next weekend too and you have a deal.\" Bri said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that was the best he would get, so he held out his hand and the two siblings shook on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I keep playing?\" Bri asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.

This was right before they were the World Series Champions.  The weather was gloomy with high humidity, so pretty much really miserable.  But to Josh, it was the best day in all of history.  The hot dogs, catching a foul ball, and even the Sox beating the Yankees.  Everything was perfect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to swap our memories of Dad?\"  Bri asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I accept, but I want them back.\"  Josh exclaimed as he closed his eyes when he saw the bright lights once more.  He took the moment of silence to think back at the game once again but came back with nothing.  Just a blank slate, almost like it never happened.  Well technically now, it never really happened.  Josh looked over at his sister who was crying.  Given that he has almost never seen her emotions get the best of her, this surprised him.  He made his way over to her and embraced her lovingly, which seemed to surprise her and caused her to jump in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri wiped the tears from her eyes and looked at her brother.  \"His laugh.\"  She took a moment to recompose her herself.  \"We have the same laugh.

It certainly felt interesting, but not in any sexual way. He tried stroking what he assumed was his new clitoris, but again nothing.

He thought about contacting Jenn to meet up since they never ended up doing so over the weekend. He remembered that she mentioned that Sunday was a busy one for her since she was going to spend a day with some family upstate. Courtney went out with her friends and Kim ran some errands, so Josh was left at home alone. As for the swaps he had to deal with, the hair was easy because the braids weren't in his way that often. He realized that if he took a shower the night before he would have had to undo them. Thankfully he chose not too, so he avoided a second clash with what was his sister's rouge hair. As for the vagina, Josh still was freaked out by the lack of a groin. He had already went to the bathroom once since the swap and wanted to keep it that way. He refused to drink any water until he was completely parched which was not until early to mid afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for why his youngest sister hadn't returned home yet, he guessed she was having a fun time with Jenna wherever the two where. Either next door or out somewhere in town. Kim had returned around four o'clock, and Courtney about half an hour after. During one of his few trips down the stairs for the day, he overheard his mom talking with Jenna's about when Brianna was returning. She wanted her home soon since it was a school night, and he heard his mom say no later than five thirty. Since Josh was all done with his homework, he just went away on his PlayStation ending virtual life after life in his game. Bri finally returned 10 minutes earlier than required. Josh however, wanted to wait for her to come to him. Especially since he wanted to sweat back in private.

It's fun not having to sit and pee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew what she meant and was surprised, but had planned accordingly and was prepared though. \"I figured you might say that, so what'aya say we make another swap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I give back your penis you'll do another swap?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And underwear.\" He added, remembering the panties he was still wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri took a minute to think it over, but Josh could already tell what she was planning to say. By reading her facial expressions, it seemed as she had thought of a fun swap as a substitute for his penis. He just hoped the swap she chose was better for him than having a vagina. \"I'll do it!\" She agreed, even though she hadn't said what her swap was. Josh's power activated early though and swapped the siblings genitals plus underwear back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's good to have you back.\"</i> Josh thought as he stretched the waistline if his shorts out to see his boxers and a familiar bulge hiding under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, the swap I want to do is what grade we are in.\" Bri announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swap schools?

But if he traded booksmarts with Bri, what would be the harm? The idea of swapping friends was appealing to him too, as they could then feel more in place in their new learning environments. \"Sure, why not?\" He replied. With that, there was a third flash. \"Did it work?\" He wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think it worked even though nothing changed physically.\" Bri filled in, although Josh wasn't sure what she meant. \"Considering I just said a phrase that sophisticated shows that I'm more intelligent and the swap worked.\" She continued, to his amazement. \"Okay, it totally worked.\" She said excitedly while jumping up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh went over to his backpack and Bri followed. He opened it to see that it was now filled with work that was fit for a third grader, rather than a freshman. He also pulled out his school ID, which now read that he was in elementary school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is very intriguing.\" Bri said, still fascinated by her expanded vocabulary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took out a math worksheet formally of Bri's, and to his surprise it was completed even though he was certain Bri hadn't started her homework yet. \"Did you do your homework yet sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\" She replied, only to have Josh dangle the completed worksheet in her face. Unlike her older brother, she was able to put two and two together. \"The shift in reality must've caused whether our homework was completed or not to be flipped since you finished and I'm not.\" Josh just stared at her confused. \"Swap make that homework done and big kid homework not.\" She said slowly, as if she was talking to a child even smaller than herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that stupid.\" Josh replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, now I've got some big kid homework to do.\" She walked away clearly enjoying the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When they opened them, they noticed that the clothing that they were wearing had swapped.  Bri was wearing Josh's sweatpants and T-shirt, while Josh had on Bri's soccer uniform.  Complete with her purple knee high socks, pink shorts, and purple \"Ponies\" jersey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did we swap exactly?\"  Josh wondered as he looked at his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"  She replied back to him as she cried out in pain once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened in here?\"  Josh and Bri's Mom asked as she looked at her daughter on the bed.  \"Oh my god!\"</span></div></div>",

Let mommy handle this.\" She cut him off looking straight at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...\" He tried to speak again, this time in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it!\" She yelled, not in anger toward him but more so in distress with the situation at hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided to obey his mother's order and not make the situation worse. Once he got downstairs, he couldn't help but wonder what had just occurred. Everything seemed completely normal (other than the fact he had his 8 year old sister's vagina) until some unknown swap was made. After that, his mom had come I and started addressing him as Bri and vice-versa. She even told him to come down and wait for his ride. He had to guess that he had swapped lives with his sister since his mom was perceiving him to be Bri, plus he was wearing her clothes. As far as he knew, nothing else physically or mentally was different though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh suddenly turned his attention to the stairs to see his mom carrying his sister bridal style down the stairs. Her small stature made her easy to carry, but Josh couldn't help think about what would happen if the real Josh was up there. She rested Bri on the couch before saying \"Wait here.\" She then walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is mom calling me Josh and why am I wearing your clothes?\" Bri asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we swapped lives, meaning the world sees me as you and you as me.\" He explained but keeping it short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess that's kinda cool.\" She said with a slight smile, making Josh happy that she still had some joy despite her injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think since I'm the one playing in the game now, we should swap hair again, you said it was easier to play with short hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said no more swapping.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't count if we're swapping something back.\" He countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's fair, I accept.\" Bri said quickly so their mother wouldn't notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flash came and Josh had his short hair again, while Bri regained her longer hair which was still in twin braids from when she tied them up for Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally walking back in, Kim applied an ice pack to Bri's ankle. \"Keep it there, we're going to take you to the ER once your sister leaves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, he heard a car horn from outside. \"That's my ride.\" Josh said standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, good like sweetie!\" His mother said, coming over and giving him a kiss on his cheek. Josh walked out the door to see Bri's friend Emma waving from inside her mom's SUV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Let's hope I don't make a fool of myself.\"</i> He thought walking in the car's direction.</span></div></div>",

He found the game extremely fun. Which was weird since he normally didn't enjoy sports at all. Megan's mom had set up a sleepover with some of his now teammates. As he dressed in his pajamas (which were now girly, but he seemed to like them anyways) he rejoined the girls downstairs who were playing with dolls and watching ICarly in the background. At first, Josh tried to ignore some of the activities and the show, but as the night progressed he started to like ICarly, and enjoy playing dolls with Megan. However, the more he did this, the more wrong he felt, Josh began to realize that these feelings were Bri's feelings had she been here, it was seriously starting to mess with his mind. Then as the night turned to nine o'clock Megan came up and stated \"For tonight's awesome game, I think we should all do my BFF friend, Josh, a makeover with some makeup and nail polish\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all sounded fun to Josh, but to him it felt extremely wrong that he was experiencing his sister's life for her. \"Hey Megan, I'm just going to call my sister to make sure she is okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Joshie, but after the call be ready for the makeover\" Megan said as all the girls started to giggle in the background as Josh went to talk in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh went over to the phone and started to call his home \"Hi, Bri speaking\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bri, how's your leg, also i have a question for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Josh.  How's the sleepover, just a sprain, should be healed up in 2 weeks, are you having fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing Bri, honestly I'm having a great time, but it just feels weird to experience things you like without being, you know, you. I mean I'm starting to like dolls and stuff, things you like\". Josh took a breath back \"Can we just return to normal, I'll even take the sprain leg\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri thought about this, she was having fun playing video games and texting Josh's friends, but her mom and Josh's friends still treated her an eight year old. (her mom just sent her to bed even though Josh's normal bed time was midnight and Bri couldn't go out with Josh's friends to see a PG 13 movie, so Bri came up with a plan.)  \"Josh were you having fun tonight\" Bri asked as she tried to weave her web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean yeah but it's really weird,\" Josh sighed \"Can we just go back to normal now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this deal, you get my original body, my original name, and my original age, while I keep the sprained ankle, I mean think about it, we have a once in a lifetime opportunity that no one else get to experience. I mean how awesome is it to live someone's life? Also I want your powers for 24 hours tomorrow and trust me nothing scary will happen\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just stood by the phone in silence, thinking back on how today was extremely fun for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh, you can have fun without being worried, please say yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then answered back .<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josh now was physically tugged along (something that couldn't be done in his previous body) and brought to the makeup chair, where Megan gave Josh a messy makeup. Next Josh gave Megan a messy makeover, and they looked each other in the mirror and both laughed. They then spent the night watching the <i>Princess Diaries/i} and talking about how they wanted to be the next Alex Morgan. For Josh it was like discovering that you had a secret best friend all along that you're just rediscovering.

She was a nerdy girl with glasses, though she was in shape and had nice B cups for her age, as well as nice black hair.  Mark began to pull up a chair, but Bri just scotched to an open position and Jennifer just sat on Bri's lap, and gave her a beck on the check, much to the amazement of Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mark, what brings you to the mall?\" Jennifer asked earnestly <br>\r\n\"Oh, he was just here to grab lunch then head off to watch the big game, isn't that right Mark?\" Bri asked in a suggestive manner,<br>\r\n\"Oh yea, just dropped by to say hi, anyways I'm going to go watch the game, you guys have fun\" Mark said, giddy to get out of the mall and finally be able to watch his game.<br>\r\n\"You know it's important that you guys are friends, we go way back\" Jennifer stated<br>\r\n\"Oh trust me I know, anyways before we shop can we have a quick make out session\" Bri asked, ready to experiment. <br>\r\n\"Since you came all the way here with that foot of your's sure!\" and with that Bri began to make out with Jennifer, Jennifer had soft lips, with a hint a mango lipgloss, Bri found herself a bit more passionate in kissing than she thought she would, but Jennifer was just inviting for Bri to do that.

Running her hands over her shorter hair, she then took another look down at the disproportionate bulge in her pants - a bulge that an eight-year old girl should just not have. \"So - cool!\" She exclaimed, biting her bottom lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made preparations to have her pee, but when she managed to wrestle her new teenage cock out of her boxers... she was transfixed by it and her peeing got postponed. She started stroking her borrowed member, inspecting the dark veins that ran its length, then she gasped when it started growing in her little hand, hardening into her first erection. The feeling nearly caused her to blow her load right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowsers!\" Bri continued gushing over hr new equipment as she reached underneath her stiff penis and grabbed her balls... only to wince and recoil in a little pain. \"Ow!\" She whined. They were certainly sensitive, and now she knew why she'd always been told to kick a boy in the groin if the situation called for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful Bri.\" She told herself, as she carefully felt her testicles, which certainly felt weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Bri couldn't put off peeing anymore, but then she saw the problem facing her. She couldn't see how she could urinate while her penis was sticking up so much. When she tried to push it down... she met resistance from it because of it's rigidity. \"How do boys do this?\" She sighed in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri decided to try and think of something else, to take her mind off her package (some hope). She slipped it back in her pants and waited, while the pressure in her bladder built up. But her cock remained hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing again, Bri pondered her next move.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was essentially the only homework she was assigned for the weekend, and she figured now was a good time to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 5 minutes deep into math problems, Bri checked in on her package. To her relief, when she looked underneath her new boxers she saw that her penis was no longer bulging out. She gently grabbed on to it and found it much more flexible. <i>\"Finally, I can pee!\"</i> She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the pressure in her bladder building up, Bri sprinted to the bathroom and pulled her pants and boxers down. She started to pee without hesitation. The only problem was she had never go to the bathroom standing before, and she didn't take her time to aim! She finally held on to her penis once again and tried to maintain control. Despite now being able to direct her urine, she still wasn't very accurate though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally was eventually able to contain it mostly near the end, but the damage was already done. She had urinated all over the toilet seat, the floor, and even some on the wall! While somewhat upset, Bri realized she needed to hide the mess as best she could. After a few minutes Bri had somewhat fixed the problem, the toilet was now dry, as well as the floor. There was still some visible on the wall, but luckily for her she went to the bathroom connected to her room. The only other person who went in that room was her older sister Courtney, who Bri remembered saying she wouldn't get home until before dinner before bed last night. So hopefully it wouldn't be noticeable by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... that was harder than I thought it would be.\" She thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

But it wasn't really working, as the void in between his legs was still a very unfamiliar feeling and he had to fix his long hair every few minutes. Suddenly, Bri appeared in the open doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Joshie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Great, here she is again.\"</i>. Josh thought. \"What is it now Bri?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Bri dove right in to the reason why she came back. \"Can we please make one more swap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can we swap our knowledge of how our private parts work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess... you tried to pee for the first time with my penis and you made a mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" Bri said, and then she started to laugh. \"I just want to know how to use it better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that will help me too, so I agree.\" Amd the flash entered Josh's room once again. The next thing Bri knew, she had the knowledge to pee with her new package without making a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Bri said happily. \"Before I leave, do you want me to fix your hair for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please.\" Josh said with relief in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri looked around her brother's room and found a few hair ties lying on his hair dresser. They looked like the ones she had, and she guessed they were passed on to her brother now that he was the one with long hair. She took one and stood behind her brother, who took a seat at his homework desk to make things easier. After about 20 seconds, Bri had successfully put her former hair into a ponytail for Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Things will be a lot easier now.\" Josh told his youngest sister before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri walked back to her room, and when she got there she made a shocking realization. When she gained Josh's knowledge of private parts, she gained his knowledge of how babies were made, sex, and masturbation. \"Oh my gosh!!!\" She said as the knowledge filled her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bri certainly didn't give a tell about any agenda, that Josh could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly...\"  She started to say as she looked Josh in the eyes.  \"I just wanted some older friends and see how they are.\"  Bri always seemed grown up and never really fit in with her friends.  Whenever Josh saw them together, she always seemed to be a little bored and a little stand offish.  Remembering back, he remembered her being this way since their father passed away last year from a car accident.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what...\"  Josh replied back to her.  \"I think it will be fine, but I don't want to be in the 3rd grade.\"  He watched as Bri's eyes grew 3 sizes with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, deal.\"  She accepted as they were soon blinded by the light once more.  As the light diminished, both Josh and Bri wiped their eyes to help alleviate some of the spots that came with the bright flash.  She looked over at Josh with her longer hair on his head and wondered.  \"Did it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh logged onto his Facebook account to see if it worked.  Looking at the pictures, Josh heard Bri laughing when the pictures of when she was invited to go to the Beach earlier that month with some of her friends.  Instead of Bri standing with her friends.  Josh now stood in her place and was over a foot taller than the other girls.  \"I guess it worked after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked over at Bri and saw her smile, knowing that he was finally able to help her out, he felt happy.  \"You're so much taller than Emily and Jenna.\"  She chuckled as she saw the picture once more.  \"Oooo...  Do you want to swap heights too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... I don't think I'm ready for that.\"  Josh replied as he backed away slightly, trying to distance himself from the suggestion.  \"Maybe later on.\"  He didn't really know if Bri's smile couldn't get any bigger, but it certainly did when he told her that.  They looked at more pictures when they heard a knock on the front door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes, their Mom came into the room.  \"There you are.\"  She said with a slight frown on her face.  \"_______ is here looking for you, ______.\"</span></div></div>",

She's waiting downstairs.\" Kim said before starting return downstairs to do the laundry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Bri said excitedly. She started to head out of Josh's room but saw a worried look on her brother's face. She turned to him and tried to comfort him with some words. \"Don't worry Josh, I'll try not to ruin your friendship with her. I know you have a crush on her!\" She said before laughing and ran out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not!\" Josh yelled back, which he found to be pointless as Bri didn't hear him. Josh decided he was thirsty, so he wanted to go downstairs and get a drink. He out into the hall and started to walk down the stairs and saw Bri bringing Jenn up to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenn passed Josh, she stopped. \"Wait Bri, that's your brother?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Yeah.\" Bri said stating what she thought was obvious. She didn't really understand what was going on. Josh seemed to catch on though. He realized that since Jenn and Bri were now friends, she never became friends with Josh, and therefore never knew him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in my biology class!\" She said. \"Hey, Josh! It's Jenn from biology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to face her. \"Oh hey.\" His voice sounding nonchalant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you started studying for the test next week?\" She asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. It's not till Wednesday, correct?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. But you never know, it could be difficult.\" Jenn said. She always used that phrase on Josh when trying to coordinate a study session between the two a week prior to the actual exam. Josh was a big procrastinator, so it never worked on him though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay well, see ya around!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye!\" Jenn replied before continuing to follow Bri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh entered the kitchen and grabbed a cup and pressed the button on his fridge to fill it up with water. He then added crushed ice, just the way he liked it. As he was heading, back to the stairs, his mom came out of the lanundry room with a basket of clothes. \"Here Josh! These are your clothes.\" She said, handing him the basket. He picked it up and placed underneath his right arm, with his water in his left hand. \"Is your sister upstairs with her friend?\" She asked him. He responded with a nod. \"I wish your friends were more like Bri's.\" She suddenly said, which got a surprised look from Josh. \"You need to start finding friends your own age.\" Kim added, before heading into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh got upstairs, he placed to clothes on his bed for organization at a later time. He placed his water cup up next to his gaming chair and fired up his PlayStation. He could overhear a conversation between Jenn and his sister coming from the room that Bri and Courtney shared. \"So I hear you have a big game tomorrow.\" Jenn told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Bri said excitedly, similar to the way she was before swapping friends with her brother. \"It's the championship game.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you'll do fine.\" Her new friend told her. \"I've seen you play, your really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" His sister said happily. Josh noticed his sister seemed to be enjoying a mature conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for me to help with your math homework?\" Jenn asked. \"Lemme see... Multiplication?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, now it's dividing. My brother helped me with the multiplying.\" Bri told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's really sweet of him!\" She said, which made Josh blush back in his own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided that was enough listening for that moment, so he got his mane of hair under control, tucking some behind his ears, and grabbed a controller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After he cleared his hair out of his face, he decided to go find his sister. He wanted to fix his hair, as he was tired of it always being out of control. He went to her room, which had the door open. He saw his youngest sister inside, while Courtney was nowhere to be found even though she shared the room with Bri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Joshie!\" She said. \"You want to make another swap before I leave for the game?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks.\" He replied. \"I wanted to know if you could get my hair to stop moving and get it under control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" Said Bri, patting the chair in front of the mirror where she put her makeup on. \"I can try something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat down and his sister went to work, after about ten seconds, she had pulled his hair back into a ponytail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that better?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh got up and found that his hair no longer got in his way when he moved. \"Perfect!\" He exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Glad I could help.\" Bri assured him. \"It's the least I could do for you when you let me borrow your hair for the big game.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh went downstairs and hopped on the couch to watch some TV, where he switched to the Comedy Central channel. He saw Courtney was eating breakfast in the kitchen, where Kim was getting drinks together for Bri during her game. After a few minutes, Bri came down and entered the kitchen. \"Ready to go sweetie?\" Josh heard his mom ask the youngest Mitchell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" She said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh and Courtney, I'm taking Bri to her game. We won't be back for awhile, especially if she wins because then there will then be a team party.\" She said. \"That means it's just you two, so be good!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye mom!\" Josh said, while Courtney waved as Kim and Bri left the kitchen, and eventually they were outside and in the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes, Courtney entered the room, where Josh was still sitting on the couch watching Comedy Central. \"Hey big bro!\" She said. \"Do you mind if I watch with you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all.\" He told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they continued to watch Courtney tried to start some kind of a conversation. \"Well I see you finally got your hair in a ponytail.\" She said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Bri helped me with it.\" Josh replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of her, I wonder how her game will go.\" Courtney said, realizing there would be a team party if she won, meaning she could have so more peace and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she'll win.\" Josh said, hoping that it would happen for the good of his sister. \"She's definitely gonna play better now that she has my shorter hair which will stay out of her way.\" Josh immediately cussed himself out quietly for spilling his secret swap with his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has what!?!?\" Courtney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh panicked and tried to come up with something to trick her sister. \"Umm... I said she would take better care of the ball.\" Emphasizing the care so his sister would think he meant that instead of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what you said.\" Courtney told him, not buying his desperate escape. Now tell me what you meant by Bri having your hair and don't lie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh explained everything to his sister, including the hair and friend swaps. He told her about the old woman that first gave him the power, and how Bri found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come I didn't notice that you have Bri's hair then?\" Courtney asked intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my power makes the people around us think we've always been like this.\" He told her, even though he wasn't exactly sure how or why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we make a swap?\" Courtney said, which surprised Josh because he didn't think she would believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really want to right now.\" Josh told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! You'll swap with Bri and not me?\" She questioned, annoyed at the fact he was excluding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it just that I've already swapped two things and I don't want to swap any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was just going to ask if you would swap Bri's hair with mine.\" Said Courtney. \"You would still only have swapped two things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want to do that?\" He asked. He didn't see any reason he would do that anyway because he was gonna swap back with Bri later anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two reasons. One, I'm tired of people calling me a ginger. I'm a strawberry blonde. Two, Bri's hair is still long like girls normally have it.\" She explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I should.\" Josh told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, I can tell your long hair bothers you. At least mine is a bit shorter.\" His sister said, trying to convince him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought she had a point. He would like shorter hair, and even if it was still longer than his, it wouldn't be as bad as having Bri's. He also realized that since everyone else didn't notice the swaps between him and Bri, it was possible that a third swap would make her  think Courtney's hair was hers, and she would swap back with him anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine. I agree to swap hair with you.\" He said, after the flash of light returned for a quick moment, Josh saw that Courtney now had Bri's longer brown hair cascading down to her back, while Josh's hair was stop still pulled back into a ponytail. Howeverthere wasn't as much hair pulled back now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Courtney squealed and hugged Josh. \"Thank you!\" She never asked about whether Bri would want her hair back or not, and Josh figured that she didn't really care. That was fine with him, as it would allow him to carry out his plan later that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Josh trailed off. \"I think I'm going to play some PlayStation.\" He started to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Courtney said. \"Can we please make another swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew it would come to this, which was why he tried to leave. \"I told you sis, I don't want to make more than two swaps at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you my allowance for next week.\" She blurted out. This seemed to interest Josh, as he was trying to save up for a new video game that was coming out in the next few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what do you want to swap?\" Asked Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I tell you, you have to agree to swap until I give you the money from my allowance that night.\" She said, wanting to try and get a decent amount of time with the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought about it. The day was currently Saturday, and the Mitchell kids got their allowance every Thursday, which meant that counting the rest of the day, they would be swapped for six days. \"Deal.\" He finally agreed, he really wanted that new game. \"Now do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to swap our _____.\" Said Courtney, which immediately made Josh regret agreeing to the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'll be fed up and you might not get your hair and friends back for a LONG time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis threat now worried Josh.

He reached down inside his boxers to find no dick or balls, but a vagina instead. <i>\"Gross! I have my little sister's vagina!\"</i> Josh thought. He surprised himself when he unintentionally ran a finger over, and making contact. This caused him to feel an unusual (but satisfying) wave of pleasure. Josh made an 'O' shape with his lips. He didn't let any sound escape though, as his sister was standing next to him, although probably doing something similar.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney found it fascinating that she had a dick and testicles between her legs, she found the feeling of her genitals protruding from her body different but also pretty neat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you cut me off, can we swap underwear too? These panties are very tight and uncomfortable now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I agree.\" Another flash came and gave Josh his sister's pink lace panties which were bigger to fit his body , and Courtney now had Josh's boxers, which were now smaller. No more after that.\" He reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine, I'm gonna go pee!\" Courtney said excitedly heading off for the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This left Josh a few hours of quiet time for him to play video games in peace. Josh noticed his friends list on the console was empty, which was because of the fact that Bri's 8 year old friends didn't play any video games. As he played, one thing he noticed was that he could cross his legs comfortably without his private parts getting in the way. He was fascinated with this comfort and would remain in that position for longer periods of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a few hours of playing Josh heard the front door open. He looked over at the clock and saw it was 5:38 PM. Josh didn't really bother to pause his game to go greet them, so he just turned his focus back to the game. After a little over 5 more minutes of playing, someone opened his door and the person who walked in was none other than Bri. \"Hey big bro!\" She said, sitting down on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bri, did you win your game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! And I played well because you helped me with my hair. I scored two goals and we won by two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri seemed happy but she didn't mention anything about Josh's change in hair length and/or color. Josh knew at this point in the conversation that there was no way Bri couldn't have noticed. He had to guess that the change in reality with him now having Courtney's hair caused Bri to think that Courtney's strawberry blonde hair has actually hers! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, are you ready to swap our hair back?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought about telling Bri the truth about his second hair swap, but he saw no point, as he was starting to long for having his signature short hair style again. Bri did think Courtney's old hair was haters anyway. <i>\"What's the worst that could happen? Swapping the hair of my sisters around isn't going to kill them!\"</i> He thought. Plus, like Courtney told him earlier, it was best to keep himself on Bri's good side as long as they were swapped. \"Yeah, I'm ready.\" He told her, but nothing happened. \"I agree.\" Headded before the flash came in, proving his second phrase a success. He has glad to have his short hairstyle, as well as his body and facial hair back. Bri on the other hand, looked odd to Josh with Courtney's hair, which was still in a ponytail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also Josh, I'll give your friends back too since you helped me. I can imagine you were bored with no friends to hang with today. But only as long as we can make another swap after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissing his friends, Josh agreed to the terms. The two siblings went on to swap back friends as well, before Bri broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now I want to swap our ______.\" Bri said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have a math quiz on Monday, and mom says I'll be in trouble if I don't do well because the last one was bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you figure if your as smart I am you'll do well?\" He asked, and Bri nodded in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh guessed that was fair and made sense, and he didn't see any reason why not to do it. He didn't have any tests or quizzes on Monday so he could make it through the school day without ruining his grades. Plus, he wanted to be there for his sister and be able to help her. \"Okay sure. But your gonna have to do my homework for me, I won't be smart enough.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" Bri said, and a flash of light followed. Neither of them felt any different after the swap. \"Did it work?\" Bri asked, while adjusting her strawberry blonde ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" He replied, but he got an idea shortly after. He went over to his desk and pulled something out of a binder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Bri interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, try doing some of my algebra homework. If you can do it then the swap worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" She agreed, excited to test her new knowledge out. She sat there for a couple of minutes, and actually managed to write some stuff. \"Here.\" She said holding out the paper to Josh, which had the first three problems done. \"You can check, but I'm pretty sure they're right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sounded confident, but he took a glance anyway. The only problem was that he couldn't tell if they were right or not! In fact, he had no idea how to solve them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Bri wondered aloud, growing impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the swap worked. I don't know if you got the answers right or not, but I have no idea how to do them, so I know we swapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Thank you!\" Bri said giving Josh a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri's excitement was reminding Josh of when they had swapped friends. \"This is giving me some... ahh never mind.\" Josh said, not being able to think of the word he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\" Bri said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I know that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, now you have my smartness...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh was sitting in his room gaming in his PlayStation, doing the same thing he was twenty four hours before. A difference he noticed playing was he no longer had any friends on his console, which he figured out was because Bri took them all. She did do something good for him as well though. Bri put Josh's hair up into a ponytail before she left for her game. That meant that Josh's day wasn't affected as much. His hair wasn't a problem and none of his new friends were around, as they were all playing alongside Bri in the championship game. That allowed Josh to just relax for the day, after a pretty eventful Friday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Bri returned home near 7 PM as Kim drove her home after watching her game. When the door opened, Josh could hear his mom call down to him. \"Josh! Come down here I need your help!\" He paused his game and found his mom downstairs with the door still open, her hands were full as she was carrying a few bags that Josh guessed were unrelated to the game. \"Go out and carry Bri's trophy up to her room. It's heavy so be careful.\" Josh went around to the back of the car and saw one of the biggest trophies he had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh reached to grab the trophy but he saw his sister peak out from the side. \"Hey Josh!\" She said happily. \"How was your day with my hair?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing out of the ordinary.\" He replied. \"The ponytail helped a ton, so thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Bri said. \"It was the least I could do for you considering you let me borrow your hair.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm guessing you won the championship game?\" Josh asked picking up the trophy out of the trunk. He noticed it was certainly heavy. It had to be at least 60 pounds, which his youngest sister could certainly not carry. He now knew why his mom called him outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they gave every girl on your team on your team a trophy this big and heavy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. This was the trophy they gave to every player.\" She revealed a smaller trophy in her hand that was probably twice the size of Bri's hand but easy to carry. \"That's the Most Valuable Player trophy. I scored three goals including the game winner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\" Josh said giving her a high five. He had to put a knee underneath the trophy when he freed one hand so he didn't drop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started to walk back toward the house, and Josh curiosily asked about the game \"So tell me how you scored the last goal.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Jenna was dribbling the ball down the field, and she passed it to me, and I was free so I kicked the ball in straight past the goalie!\" She explained in a very excited manner. \"Thanks to your hair, because my hair would've gotten in the way and I would've missed the kick.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds awesome!\" Josh told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, it finally made the girls excited for me again!\" She added, as they approached the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what do you mean?\" Josh said, as he stopped walking and put the trophy down on the first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I forgot to mention that. Didn't I?\" She asked as Josh responded with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since we swapped friends last night, none of the girls on my team really knew me anymore.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Josh trailed off. \"Well I'm sorry to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" She said. \"Because after I scored the winning goal, all of the girls treated me like normal and they were nice to me at the team party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was happy to hear that at first, but then he realized something else. \"Wait... That means that even when we swap back friends I'm still gona be friends with your friends?\" He asked while picking up the trophy again and wondering how that was going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Bri laughed and giggled as Josh frowned. As they made it to the top of the stairs, Bri told Josh to follow her. \"Here, let's go to your room first. I'll give you your hair back like we talked about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" Josh said in agreement. Bri opened the door for him, as he put the trophy down just inside of his room next to his door. His sister sat on his bed. \"Okay Bri, do you agree to swap our hair back?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I agree.\" She said. And with that, there was the familiar flash of light once again, as Josh now had his short hair again, while Bri's long, brown hair was returned to her. Bri stood up, but then came up with an idea. She turned to Josh. \"Before I leave Joshie, can we make another swap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't really want to, but he figured that since she still had her friends it was best to keep her happy so she would swap back eventually. \"Sure, but only one swap.\" He told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Bri said thinking, before coming up with an answer about fifteen seconds later. \"Let's swap our ______.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm not doing that.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Josh? Don't do that.\" Bri told him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you would make another swap with me after I gave you your hair, but know you won't swap.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah put that wasn't part of the hair deal.\" Said Josh. \"I'll still swap something else though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want another thing. I want to try being a boy for awhile.\" She pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you need to be a girl to be able to play on your soccer team?\" He asked, thinking he got out of the swap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The season's over. So now I don't have to be a girl.\" Bri said, meaning Josh's plan had come to no avail. \"I promise it won't be that bad. We can swap back soon if you really don't like it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought about it for a second before final giving in. \"Fine! But only if you give me back my friends tomorrow night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay deal!\" His sister said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I agree to swap genders with you then.\" Josh said before the flash of light quickly came in. (Author's note: Josh is now a 'she'; Bri is now a 'he'). When it was gone, Josh looked down and saw that there were now two mounds coming from her chest area. They were definitely bigger than Courtney's, and maybe just a bit bigger than Jenn's. They were likely B-cups that would soon be C's. Josh hoped she could swap back by then though. Along with that, Josh felt an emptiness in her crotch, hips were wider, shoulders narrower, thinner eyebrows, stomach flatter, legs thinner, and her feet were smaller as well. She now was a few inches smaller, and her body now had some curves with it. To top it off, Bri now once again had short hair, while Josh's was longer again. Still, Josh's hair wasn't as long as Bri's used to be, but it was definitely longer than Courtney's. Meanwhile, Bri had a bit more hair on his head than Josh used to, but it was still relatively short. Bri was now a few inches taller still looked almost the same considering he hadn't gone through puberty yet, but there were a few minuscule changes other than height, hair, and genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool, SIS!\" Bri said in a slightly lower voice. \"I have one more question.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Josh said in a high-pitched voice. He covered his mouth as it surprised him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri let out a masculine laugh before returning to his topic. \"Can we swap the gender of our clothes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Josh said, still not used to her lighter voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means we won't really swap clothes, but you'll get girl clothes and I'll get boy clothes.\" He explained to his new sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh figured there were worse swaps, and she also now had the body to make the swap to. \"I don't see why not. I agree.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another flash of light, and when it disappeared, Josh was now wearing a red tank top and white booty shorts. She looked under her tank top and saw that she had a black lace bra on, and looked under her tight shorts to see she had a mac thing pair of black lace panties. Meanwhile, Bri still had a soccer uniform on, but they were different colors. \"What happened to your uniform?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I guess this is from the boys league.\" Bri went over to her smaller trophy and showed Josh, which was now labeled as a 'boys league champion' trophy. \"It'll change again if we swap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If!?\" Josh's high voice got even higher in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know, we may both love it and not want to swap back!\" He said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed in relief knowing his sister wouldn't force him to remain female if she didn't want to, or at least she hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kim opened the door. \"Oh there you are Brian! You should go to bed soon.\" She said gesturing for Bri to go to her room.\" At first Bri and Josh didn't know who she was talking to, but they both realized it was Bri when she made the gesture. \"You take that big trophy too, it's heavy but I think you can carry it. I'll take that smaller trophy for you.\" Their mom picked it up and went to take it to Courtney and Bri's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" Bri asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean mom calling me Brian.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. That's probably your male name now since your a boy.\" Josh explained to her new brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" Bri said with a sense of happiness. \"I wonder what your girl name is...\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" She told Bri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well tell me what it is when you find out. Good night, BIG SIS!\" The youngest Mitchell said before picking up the trophy, which he had a bit of trouble with at first. But then got it off the ground after an adjustment and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided to play some video games before he went to bed. He played for a solid hour and a half and then looked over to see the clock, which read 10:49 PM, which caused for Josh to think about how much time flied sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as was preparing to turn the game off, Kim once again entered Josh's room and said something, but Josh didn't hear because she had headphones on. She shut down the console and removed the head phones to hear her mother. \"What mom?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm going to bed. Good night Jossie, I love you!\" Her mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Josh was caught off guard because she didn't call her by her normal name, but she then realized that Jossie was her female name. \"Goodnight mom, love you too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided that she was tired and could check out some of her new female clothes tomorrow. She brushed her teeth, and went to her droor in her dresser where she kept her pajamas, and found that there were now nightgowns. Josh took off her new bra, and left the same black lace panties on. She slipped on a white nightgown, and got into bed, which felt a bit bigger due to her now smaller size. The last thing Josh heard was her sister Courtney open the door and say \"Good night Jossie!\" Josh said goodnight before back her sister closed the door. It didn't take long for her to get comfortable, and within minutes, the new oldest Mitchell sister fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's note: Starting next chapter, Josh should be referred to as 'Jossie', while Bri should be referred to as 'Brian', until they swap back [if they do]).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jossie awoke to the sight of hair, which was not startling to her, as it was the same when Brian's hair did the same to him the morning before, what did startle her was when she cleared the hair from her face, there were two mounds coming out from her chest. She then remembered the events that occurred the night before, which caused her to become female and her former sister to become her brother. The first thing she did, was go to brush her teeth. Even looking in the mirror was a new experience as many of her facial features had changed along with the swap. It was like she was looking at a whole new person. When Jossie was done with that, she went to examine her new wardrobe. Thankfully for her, the new wardrobe didn't consist entirely of skirts and dresses, as there were many tank tops, shirts, jeans, and yoga pants thrown in as well. She decided to throw on a violet tank top with gray yoga pants, which were kind of tight around her butt. Jossie noticed that she had gained a new round and shapely ass with her new gender. She didn't feel the change during the swap the night before though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jossie got downstairs, she was first greeted by her mom. \"Morning sweetie! How did you sleep?\" Kim asked her new oldest daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" She replied. Even though she underwent a major biological change only hours ago, she still slept like a baby. She didn't have to worry about her old private parts getting in the way she had to turn over in bed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom put breakfast on the table for her. But instead of the two pancakes she normally ate as a boy, her mom only gave her one. Jossie figured that since her swaps could change reality, that it was best to ignore unless otherwise needed. Her idea proved to be smart when she wasn't as hungry as normal, a d was almost full when she finished her pancakes. When she was putting her plate in the dishwasher, she finally noticed that it was only her and Kim in the kitchen. \"Where's everyone else?\" She asked her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister was picked up by Josie to go to Megan's birthday party about fifteen minutes ago, your brothers on the couch watching TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJossie decided to go find her brother. She was kind of interested to see how the swap was going for him. When she walked in, her brother was watching Cartoon Network. He immediately turned his attention to his oldest sister when she walked in. \"Hey SIS! Do you know your new name yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jossie.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool... Wait, isn't that one of Courtney's friends names?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJossie almost said yes out of instinct, as she had mistaken that to be her name many times. She then however, remembered his mom saying Josie minutes ago. \"No that's Josie.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the difference?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well her name starts with 'Joe' and mind starts with 'Joss'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Brian said, finally understanding her sister's point. \"So what do you want to do now, Jossie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could respond, Kim walked in. \"Kids, I'm going to a friends house to catch up, it's just you two. Your in charge Jossie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their mom closed the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quickly digging through her thoughts, Jossie found there was new information in her brain about how to do makeup and hair stuff. Knowing that worked, she pulled out her phone and saw that her old friends were back in her contacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems to have worked,\" Jossie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Thanks sis!\" Brian said before running off. Jossie assumed she was going to pee or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that taken care of, Jossie decided to call up her friend Jenn to see if their friendship was different at all now that they were both girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jossie!\" Jenn greeted her enthusiastically upon picking up. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much,\" Jossie replied, finally getting a bit used to her new voice. \"Just wanted to see what you were up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much here either. I got all my homework done for the weekend so I'm just bored. Wanna come over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't,\" Jossie replied. \"I gotta watch ... Brian.\" She paused for a second just to make sure she said the right name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's no problem. I'll just come over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Jossie agreed before hanging up. She wasn't quite sure, but it seemed that Jenn was a bit more excited to talk to her now that she was a girl. Not thinking much of it, she waited for her friend to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too much later, the doorbell rang, and Jossie opened the door to see Jenn, who immediately gave her a hug. Jossie happily reciprocated the hug. Even though she was a girl now, she still had a crush on her longtime friend and was glad that she was more touchy with her now that they were both girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you wanna do?\" Jenn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that popped into Jossie's mind was her power. She wondered if she should tell her friend about it. She figured it would be more fun to swap with her than Brian ... but on the other hand, she was overwhelmed enough with the gender swap and wasn't sure if she wanted to swap anything else.</span></div></div>",

I know I'm prepared for our upcoming Biology test, but I have a feeling you haven't studied at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJossie just smiled sheepishly. \"I knew it,\" Jenn said smugly. \"Studying first it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two headed up to Jossie's room and got set up to study. As Jossie was finishing out her Biology textbook from her bag, she looked back to see Jenn staring at her shapely new butt encased in her yoga pants, but thought nothing of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were studying, however, Jossie began to notice differences in Jenn's behavior. She noticed that when Jenn leaned over her shoulder to help her, she would lean much closer and make much more physical contact. She also caught her staring at her breasts a couple times. And, whenever they made eye contact, Jenn always seemed to get flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when something occurred to Jossie. Was Jenn gay? Suddenly, everything seemed to make sense. Why Jenn made it clear she had only seen Josh as a friend, why she always seemed evasive when asked about boys and who she was attracted too, why she was suddenly acting so different now that Josh was Jossie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after they finished studying and put the movie on, these thoughts were filling Jossie's head. Even though she was a girl now, she was definitely still attracted to girls and she definitely still had a crush on Jenn. This was her chance to finally be with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the two happened to lock eyes as they both reached for the popcorn, and Jenn had that same flushed look on her face. Jossie decided to go for it and leaned in for a kiss. As their lips made contact, Jenn's eyes went wide with surprise, but then she relaxed and let it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a moment that Jossie had often dreamed of, she just never thought she'd be a girl when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking off the kiss, the two stared into each other's eyes for several moments, neither sure what to do next.</span></div></div>",

I'd be glad  to be your girlfriend\" <br>\r\n-\"You would?! Really?! I have always feared to tell you, how I'm feeling. Some people might not accept, that I like girls. I...just... don't know. Actually, I don't know what I am. I can be into boys, but thinking about them don't make me feel as good, as girls.

You have to answer, what sexuallity you are. But, is it important? We've got each other, baby, so you don't have to worry about this\" - Jossie hugged her new girlfriend. This beautiful moment for Jossie was interupted, by an alien feeling. She felt, that their breasts  met in some point, and were pressing against each other, to Jossie's discomfort. She didn't predict, that hugging, would cause this to happen. Jenn hugged her, in the entrance, but, it was so quick, that Jossie didn't noticed. She still haven't got used to her new, female body, and  all its assets. - \"Damn! I hate those things! \" - Jossie thought - \"If I were still a boy, this wouldn't happened.\" - she looked at her girly body. At her boobs, slender and hairless legs and arms, and round ass - \"But I am not anymore. I'm a fully fertile girl, 'till Brian decide to swap back with me , and I have to come to terms with all the pros and cons that come with being a woman.\" <br>\r\n-\"Thank you Jossie\" - Jenn said - \" I feel much better now. So my girlfriend, what do you want to do?\" <br>\r\n-\"Let's finish watching a movie.\"<br>\r\nThey went back to the movie, but Jossie couldn't focus on it. She was thinking about Jenn, all the time. She remembered, that when she was a boy, Jenn used to be  very reserved, with them. She wanted them to stay friends, even if Jossie ( then Josh) knew, she loved her. So that's the reason. Jenn was into girls. That's why she has never wanted them, to be a couple. <br>\r\n- \"How lucky, that I swapped  genders with Brianna (who is now Brian, and a he). And because of the reality change, Jenn now thinks, that I have always been a girl.\" - When she was thinking about Jenn, she felt an unfamilliar sensation between her legs. It was like her panties were getting wet<br>\r\n-\" So that's how girls feel, when they are turned on.\" - Jossie thought to herself. It was weird, but felt quite pleasurable, actually. - \"It is not bad. I can get used to it.\" - Jossie thought, and she came back to watching movie with Jenn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll try.\" Bri walked over to her Most Valuable Player trophy, and what happened next amazed Josh, his eight year old sister was lifting something that almost weighed as much as her with no problem! \"Wow! This is so cool!\" Bri said, starting to walk out, still holding her trophy pretty easily. \"Hey Josh, can you grab that smaller trophy for me?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh picked up the trophy and noticed something. Even though he picked up the smaller trophy with no problem, he was using a lot more effort that he felt he wouldn't need under normal circumstances. Then, it hit him. He now had the strength of an eight year old girl. \"Well, I better be careful while carrying and holding things tomorrow.\" He told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to Bri's room, Josh saw her put the trophy down gently on her dresser. \"That was awesome!\" She told her brother, as he put the smaller trophy down next to the big one.  Despite having no trouble carrying the generally decent-sized trophy, it still tired his muscles a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was prepared to leave and go back to playing PlayStation, but he had one more question for his sister. \"Hey Bri, can we also swap back friends sometime before school on Monday too? I don't want to have to go to school with no friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess so.\" She said, even though it was obvious she didn't want to do that.

However, Josh immediately knew the swap worked because his attitude about Jenna's arrival had went from a feeling of negativity to excitement. Also, he was about to start playing video games before his new friend came, now he had to urge to go outside and kick the ball around with her.

The actual dinner went by normally, with Josh and Bri hardly talking to each other, and not saying a word about their swaps. Most of the talking came from Kim gathering information from each one of her kids on how their school day went. Courtney seemed to have been in a rush, as she was the first one to finish her dinner, which was a rarity. She then quickly excused herself and retreated to the room she and Bri shared. Josh had to guess she was texting with her friends or something of that matter. Kim, also in a rush, finished her dinner second and excused herself to take care of some louds of laundry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left just Josh and Bri, the latter of the two made sure they were in the clear before igniting conversation. \"So, how was hanging out with Jenna?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a ton of fun!\" Josh said eagerly, and then went through every last detail about his time with his new friend. \"What did you do while I was with Jenna?\" He asked after finishing, placing some of his rouge hairs behind his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to play your video games, but I wasn't any good.\" She said sadly. \"They looked like a ton of fun though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I could give you my skills.

Josh couldn't remember how to play any of his games, not that he cares anyway. Now though, Josh had a better understanding of how to play soccer, which although unintended, would actually help him after he made the next swap.

Since you're not playing in the soccer game tomorrow, you have no use for borrowing my hair. Can we swap that back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really want to, but sure. It could help you in the game tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light filled the kitchen, which would mark the last time the flash visited for the night. Josh had his shorter hair back, and Bri's longer hair descended down her back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm going to go play video games.\" Bri said before bolting up the stairs.

I need you to help me set it up in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom said she didn't want me to play in your room.  She wants me back in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great,\" Josh whined to himself.  It'll take about twenty minutes to remove the connection in his room and then move it to her room.  He would miss half his show.  Then he would have to undo it later when they swapped back.  This seemed like too much of a hassle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well would you do it for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a better idea, let's just swap rooms.  Then you can play with it in your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wouldn't work.  You know how this thing is.  IF we swap, then all your stuff will be swapped into my room and vice versa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you are right.\"  Josh thought he would have to do it manually.  Then he came up with another idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we swap rooms and you can have anything you want from my room.  Then we'll swap back later.  That'll work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it will.  Let's swap.\"  The usually flash of light appeared and Bri left immediately.  Josh was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh spend hours watching TV.  All the shows were new to him and he liked them.  But as it got later, the Disney shows were for a mature audience.  Not for an adult, but they were shows designed for middle school and younger high school children.  He changed the channel from the Disney Channel to Disney Jr Channel.  he liked these shows much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was ready, he returned upstairs to swap back.  But he found that Bri had gone to sleep.  She was still eight and had a bedtime at 8:30.  He couldn't swap back with her when she was asleep.  She couldn't agree to anything.  So he went to what was now his room which he shared with Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside he found that it was not indeed his room.  There were toys and dolls that hadn't been in his room before, but now they were part of his interests so they should be in his room now.  But his half of the room did have a male color scheme as well as the comforter on what was his bed.  In the closets and drawers were his clothing.  He felt right at home here, except that Courtney was in the room too.  He had always had a bedroom alone.  He was the only boy and the oldest.  But that didn't matter anymore, he now shared his room with his kid sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got into bed.  Clutched his teddy bear and went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

For starters, the room walls were now painted light purple (Bri's favorite color) as supposed to the original sky blue that Josh preferred. Josh's bed remained in the room, but his pillows, blankets, and bed sheets were replaced with his sister's. His homework desk now had Bri's school supplies on top and the closets and dressers held her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome!\" Bri cheered as she hopped on to her new bed. \"This bed is huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, are you happy now?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Now get outta my room!\" She said, pointing to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she was right, Josh walked out and started to head to what was now his and Courtney's smaller shared room. As he exited his former room though, he noticed a slight change to the door. There used to be a yellow octagon shaped sign that read \"YOU ARE NOW ENTERING JOSH'S ROOM!\" Now, the sign was still there, but it now read \"YOU ARE NOW ENTERING BRIANNA'S ROOM!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh got to his new room, he opened the door to see that almost everything that changed in his old room was reversed. His clothes were now in Bri's dressers and closets, his bedsheets, blankets, and pillows were now on Bri's twin bed, and his homework supplies were in Bri's homework desk. The room was painted a red color now, which Josh guessed could have been a compromise color between pink (the room's old color) and sky blue (Josh's old room's color). He only got a quick glance though, as he found his sister and her friend Megan inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you leave Josh? I have a friend here!\" She complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but isn't this my room too?\" He responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Fine!

He guessed that his old one remained with Bri in her new room. <i>\"Where am I supposed to play video games?\"</i> He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, his mom marched into the room with a look of anger on her face. He didn't know what was going on, but he hoped he wasn't the cause of it. \"Courtney!\" She yelled. \"You lied to me and said the dishes were done but you didn't finish! What do you have to say for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom! Megan came and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts! I guess Megan will have to wait for you to finish.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney proceeded out of the room and down the stairs to finish her chores, but Megan didn't leave the room. There was an awkward silence within the room before Josh decided to break the quiet. \"So, how are you Megan?\" He asked, just to be polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I guess.\" She said in a slight Irish accent she picked up from her Ireland native parents, but her accent had become more American over the years as she met new friends like Courtney, she started to sound a bit more American. Her response didn't really convince Josh though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay, it's just that my family is going back to Ireland for a trip, and our dog can't come along. Nobody can watch him, so he's gonna have to go to a kennel and I feel so bad for him because I can tell he hates it there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see.\" Josh said to her, he didn't really see the problem in the situation, but he wasn't a dog owner, even though he always wanted one. Josh then got hit with a great idea. \"Megan, I think I know how to solve that problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh went on to explain the story of how he gained his power and what the power could do to his sister's friend. He covered everything from the old lady to his swaps with Bri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer talkin' crazy!\" She said. \"Nothin' is different about ya!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured you might say that, but I figured out that my power effects reality so people think it is normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I still don't believe ya! How would this 'power' help my dog anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see, we could swap ownership of your dog. This way we could be welcome here for the week, and Courtney and I can take care of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if yer serious, then I would really appreciate it if you could. As long as I can have him back when I get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that a yes then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, I agree.\" A flash blocked both the sight of him and Courtney's friend. When it disappeared, a dog with long brown fur was now present in the room. The dog immediately toppled Josh, who was still sitting on his bed, and started to lick his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh finally managed to go the dog to stop licking, he sat up on his bed. \"What's the name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Murphy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of dog is he?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An Irish setter.\" Josh tried not to laugh because he thought it was funny that Courtney's friend with an Irish background had an Irish dog breed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurphy, just noticing the presence of Megan in the room, started to growl at her. Her eyes widened in fear. \"What is wrong with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh figured out why. \"I think it's because you're not his owner anymore, he doesn't recognize you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, it's the new reality. My family owns him now so he is more comfortable around us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense, he doesn't really like visitors too much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay just don't tell anybody about this swap, Brianna is the only other person who knows about it.\" He said gesturing to his little sister's new room. Megan nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan took a piece of paper off Josh's new desk and wrote down instructions for taking care of Murphy and handed them to Josh. The top read \"HOW TO CARE FOR MURPHY IN THE NEXT 2 WEEKS\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going away for 2 weeks?!\" Josh asked, as his new dog hopped up beside him on his new bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, that won't be a problem. Will it?\" She asked, sitting back down on Courtney's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shook his head before Courtney finally walked back into the room. She immediately went over and acknowledged Murphy as if he was family. \"Hey Murph!\" She said while patting his head. She then sat down next to Megan on her bed. \"Sorry I took so long Meg, you were probably bored spending time with this loser!\" She pointed to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Josh was very good campany.\" She said while smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwww... you don't like him do you?\" Courtney asked in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo!!!\" Said Megan, and both girls laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He took him out to the back yard to let him run around for a bit. The yard was not huge by any means, but it had a pretty good size considering the were three kids and only parent in the family. He found a tennis ball resting against the house on the back porch. He knew his family didn't normally keep tennis balls lying around like that normally, but he guessed that a reality change had set in once again. The balls were always there as a result considering everybody except him and Megan thought the dog had always belonged to the Mitchell family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurphy picked the ball up in his mouth and brought it over to Josh. \"You wanna play fetch boy?\" He asked. Murphy drppoed the ball at his feet and Josh threw it. His new dog then chased after and brought it back, dropping it at his owner's feet. This created an endless sucker for about five minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh heard the door to the porch shut behind him and after he threw the ball once again, he turned around to see Brianna once again. \"Hey Josh!\" She greeted. When Murphy returned, he dropped the ball at Josh's feet again but before Josh could pick it up, he trotted over to Bri. \"Hi Murph!\" She said patting his head. Murphy then jumped on Bri, his paws landing on her shoulders. Standing in his hind legs he was about as tall as Bri. \"Woah! Down boy!\" She shouted, but it was too late. He had knocked Bri off balance and she fell down on her behind. \"Ouch! Not again!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay sis?\" Josh asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'll be fine.\" She assured Josh he helped her up. \"I hate it when he does that to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh brushed some long hair out of his face again, and then picked the ball up and threw it for Murphy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wish I was taller so Murphy didn't knock me down all the time.\"</i> Bri thought. Her frown then turned to a smile when she thought of something. \"Hey big bro, I've got an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's swap our height!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, I hate being knocked over my Murph all of the time. If I was taller, he wouldn't be able to do it to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure we should do that.\" Josh said, trying to make her lose the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? It'll be fun, I can see what it's like to be big. And you, can be small and see why I hate being knocked over by the dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been small before, I didn't like it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please? If you don't swap, maybe I'll keep your hair for the rest of the weekend.\" She threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew his sister had found a weak spot. His hair had been driving him crazy since the minute he got it. He didn't want to have the keep it for any longer than necessary. \"Fine, but only for the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about until Tuesday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monday night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it.\" Bri said. The flash filled what seemed as the entire town if not more. When it was clear again, Bri was the one now towering over her brother. Not the other way around. Bri body was pretty much just stretched out where her arms, legs, hands, feet, and torso were bigger. Josh's body now seemed more compressed, as those five things were now smaller for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurphy, who had returned from retrieving the ball a few minutes ago. Immediately jumped on Josh, the same way he previously did on Bri. Josh suddenly found himself laying on the ground. \"See what I mean?\" Bri said as she held out a hand to help him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's not any fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is for me! This is awesome, thanks 'little bro!'\" She said laughing before heading back inside.</span></div></div>",

Not wanting Josh to find out she was home, she went up to her new big bedroom and packed a bag as fast as she possibly could for the sleep over. Then she ran down the stairs and called to her mom that she was ready to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, give me a minute!\" She heard her mom respond.

They ate a bit late though due to lack of communication with Courtney, who failed to answer any messages from her family. Kim refused to make dinner until she knew the exact amount that were eating. He was told her could do whatever he wanted, meaning he was free to play video games. He was not feeling up for it though and we would have felt awkward playing when his mom was right around the corner. He checked the clock, which read a bit after half past 9. <i>\"What should I do? I don't want to go to bed just yet. But something relaxing... like a shower!\"</i> He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem was Josh lacked the knowledge to wash his sister's hair. He decided with all of the physical activity he had done that a shower was necessary, so he took one anyway. Since Bri was gone for the night, Josh went in his old shower and bathed there. He used Bri's shampoo and conditioner and ran it though his hair. Then he washed the rest of his body, which was also a new experience since it was smooth without his body hair. Washing his body also was quicker because of his new much smaller height, he had less skin to wash. The shower took about as long as he did on average, which was quick considering he was a teenage boy. When he finished up, he dried his body off with a towel. The problem was his hair was still soaking wet and he did not know how to wrap the towel around his head. He tracked down his mom and asked her to do it for him. \"I swear, you either need to learn to take care of your hair or we're going to get it cut.\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh got back upstairs he wanted to let his hair dry before getting in bed, so he decided to study for awhile. He left his door cracked, and Murphy found his way in by butting his head to get in. He wondered over to Josh and sat down next to his chair, panting quite loudly. \"Hey boy!\" Josh said petting him. He may have only had him around for a day, but Josh could tell he was a good dog and felt a good connection with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh decided his hair was dry enough, he hung his towel in the bathroom his sisters shared and hopped into Bri's twin bed. He was laying there for a few seconds before he turned the lights off, and to his surprise Murphy snuck up on him and jumped onto the bed. He laid on top of Josh and proceeded to lick his face continuously. Josh could not get him off either due to his smaller size. He thought it was funny though and was laughing as the dog licked him. \"Alright, down boy.\" He eventually said and got him down. But he then realized that with his smaller height of 4'2\", there was a gap between his feet and the edge of the bed. \"Come on Murph!\" Josh said patting the end of the bed. The dog hopped onto the end just how Josh wanted and curled up into a ball. \"That's better.\" Josh said to himself before turning the light off and drifting off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Testing...\" Bri said in a deeper male voice. Both she and Josh were surprised to hear such a deep sound from an 8 year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh finally built up the courage to speak. \"I guess it worked.\" He remarked in his sisters young female voice, which sounded totally unnatural for his body. \"Are we done here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so!\" Bri said and then laughed in a deep voice.

Bri grinned, trying to get her brother to agree to trade clothes with her. \"Will you swap clothes with me Josh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh let out a sigh, then rubbed his forehead before once more flicking his sister's long hair from his face.

It felt a little peculiar, since his cock was now restricted more than it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome!\" Bri squealed in delight, looking down at herself, tugging at the 'School House Rock' t-shirt she now had on, along with the rest of her brother's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly... it's different.\" Josh frowned, feeling embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Joshie, this is so cool!\" An excited Bri exlaimed, clapping her hands. \"How about we swap something else now?\" She suggested, wanting to keep going.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ever since their Dad left them 6 years ago to be closer to his secretary, Josh had grown apart from his sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed a great sigh as he looked over at Bri, whose smile was like she was opening gifts on Christmas.  \"Yeah, I guess we can do one or two more.\"  He watched as Bri's eyes grew several sizes with jubilation and anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I pick what we swap again?\"  Bri asked as she jumped up and down with the energy of an 8 year old so often have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought about it for a moment and shook his head.  As he shook it, he couldn't help but feel the braids hitting the back of his head and he had an idea.  \"Actually, I was thinking about making a suggestion.\"  Josh didn't know what to think when he saw his sister jumping up and down and squealing with joy  .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to pick?\"  Bri wondered as she sat down and tried to be quiet for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking about swapping our skills...\"  He replied but was cut short by Bri calling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept.\"  The blinding light son enveloped them both and Josh felt a little odd.  He now knew how to fix and wash his new hair, how to score the perfect goal in soccer, and how to perfectly catch the ball while protecting the goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\"  Josh exclaimed as he instantly brought his hands up to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo...\"  Bri teased as she pointed to her brother.  \"You said a bad word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I have all your skills for Soccer too.\"  Josh replied back to her.  Bri took a minute to think about her new skills and realized that he was right.  She now knew how to just wash her hair, but now also how to play a lot of the video game that her brother loved to play.  \"We have to swap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri, not wanting to swap back just yet, shook her head in defiance.  \"No, I want to try and play your games for a bit.\"  Knowing that he wasn't going to win the argument, Josh reluctantly agreed to keep them for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but we will swap all this back before school starts back.\"  Josh pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\"  Bri agreed as she thought about what she wanted to swap.

You will be treated like the little child and I'll be treated like a grown person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew that as the 'baby' Bri got away with murder.  She didn't have any real chores.  If she picked up her plate from the dinner table and brought it to the kitchen that was enough.  Josh sometimes had to wash the dishes.  he had to take out the trash, he had to wash the car and mow the lawn.  he didn't have to do them every time, but when his mother asked, he knew he had better do it.  Bri didn't even have to make her own bed, Courtney did it for her.  Josh even knew of times when Bri picked a fight with Courtney and it was Courtney who got into trouble.  He decided by taking this swap he could slack off and not have a problem.  \"It's a deal,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the familiar flash had receded, Josh notice his room had changed.  His room became much more girlie than it had been.  It had all the furniture it had before, bed, night stand, dresser, bookcase, etc. but they were all had girlie accents.  His room was painted in white and pink.  There were stuffed animals all over the place and all of his things were gone, including his video game system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to my room?\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to his closets and found his normal boy clothes.  It was his stuff then he realized that the size was wrong and he was still wearing Bri's tank.  Then it dawned on him, this wasn't his room anymore.  It was Bri's.  She is the older sibling now and so she was the one who had her own room.  Josh realized that he must be sleeping with Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see now,\" he said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Bri inquired she was just as confused as Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't my room anymore, it's yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's mine???  Wow Cool!!!\"  Bri didn't expect to get her own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come let's go see your room, I mean my new room.\"  Josh and Bri left his room and went towards her old bedroom.  Inside Courtney was on her bed (which hadn't changed) listening to music from her iPod,  The room had changed somewhat.  Josh's things were around the room.  It was still dominated as a girl's room (Courtney was treated like the older sibling), but there were some things that were definitely for a boy.  The bed spread on his bed was somewhat boyish.  He found his Play Station hooked up to the TV.  There was his school books and laying on the desk was a picture of him with his school friends and Jenn.  Inside the closets (he seemed to know instinctively which were his and which were Courtney's) were little girl's clothing but in his size.  This made perfect sense to him because of his other swap.  He liked this picture since it had Jenn in it.  (He was the only one in the picture dressed like a little girl)  This was definitely his room now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney saw Josh looking around the room.  \"What are you looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, nothing.\" Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are you doing,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, sorry to disturb you.\"  Then without saying another word, Josh left the room and headed back for what was now Bri's bedroom.  Bri followed along.</span></div></div>",

The situation was as ridiculous as it sounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you gonna do the swap or not?\" His sister asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I'm thinking about it.\" Josh answered. After all, he had a big decision to make. He really wanted to avoid playing in his sister's soccer game tomorrow, and he had found his ticket out. The only problem was that the ticket was swapping his penis for a vagina. The more thought he put into it, swapping for a little while seemed not not be such a bad idea. It would save him from the embarrassment of playing a sport he had no idea how to play with girls half his age. Also, maybe experiencing genitals form the perspective of females would be fun. And he would be swapping with an 8 year old girl, so worries about periods or related issues could be put to rest. \"Alright, I've come to a decision.\" He announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it.\" He said, as the flash of light filled his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Sweet!\" Bri exclaimed as the flash faded away. Once she realized that the flash had already come and gone, she looked beaneath her boxers and saw a 7-inch erect bulge inside. Bri was delighted with the view but was speechless and made no vocal reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Josh, he could immediately tell something was missing in his crotch. He didn't even bother looking beneath his jean shorts and panties to see what lied under. All he knew was that the empty feeling was his 8 year old sister's vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sis, let's figure out when to trade back. How about tomorrow like with your hair?\" He suggested while grabbing his long brown hair to emphasize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, that's not enough time. How about a few days at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet me in the middle and we'll say a couple and take it from there.\" He offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay deal!\" She said. Josh held out her hand and she shook it to solidify their agreement. \"Thanks for your penis big bro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, before you leave...\" Josh started but then went over to his closet to check for the uniform, but found it missing. \"never mind, you're free to go.\" He said as his sister closed the door and ran off excitedly with her new penis.</span></div></div>",

The situation was as ridiculous as it sounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you gonna do the swap or not?\" His sister asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I'm thinking about it.\" Josh answered. After all, he had a big decision to make. He really wanted to avoid playing in his sister's soccer game tomorrow, and he had found his ticket out. The only problem was that the ticket was swapping his penis for a vagina. Josh could say with almost certainty that he was not prepared for a swap of the magnitude yet. Besides, a swap like that would possibly include some side affects he was pretty sure he himself or his sister were not ready to handle. \"Alright, I've come to a decision.\" He announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Bri, but I can't do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself then. Have fun playing soccer tomorrow.\" Bri said with some sadness and anger in her voice as she walked out and slammed Josh's door behind her.</span></div></div>",

Along with his short stature, his arms and legs had grown shorter as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Bri, the exact opposite happened. Everything appeared to have become smaller to her, and with her new height came longer arms and legs as well. \"This is so cool!\" She exclaimed in awe of her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even focused on his new height, Josh reached for the closet door and opened it to see the absence of a wedding dress, as well as his sister's former clothes (now his) had been resized once again to become smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Josh said to his satisfied sister. \"All good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for your cooperation.\" She said happily, copying something that she recalled her mother saying to her the other day before walking out on her long legs.</span></div></div>",

One, she pronounced it like 'mus-coles'. Two, there was no way he would want to swap that with her. \"You mean muscles?\" He asked pronouncing it the right way and smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah those.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but no thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why not? They would help me win my game tomorrow, I can give them back after then if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought she did have a point. It wasn't the worst thing to swap either, at least she didn't want his dick and testicles. He could just ask her for them back tomorrow anyway. \"Fine. I agree to swap muscles with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flash returned and went away again in an instant. When Bri looked at her body and saw the differences their swap had made. Her arms and legs didn't gain any length, but they gained plenty of width and thickness. She saw her right arm and flexed her new bicep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't have huge muscles by any means, but his friend Tyler, who played three different sports this past year, worked out often and started bringing Josh to his gym a couple of times a week. He was just learning the ropes and everything, but there was definitely a difference from the year before. Josh had to get stronger if he wanted to start dating girls. He started to think that maybe Jenn would like it if he were stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Even my legs have muscles!\" She said amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh on the other hand, saw a opposite difference from Bri's. The length of his arms and legs remained the same, but they had definitely lost their fair share of size in width and thickness. His body looked extremely out of proportion considering he now had the arm size of an 8 year old girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngest Mitchell wandered over to a big brown box with likely something heavy inside, but she proceeded to lift it with ease! \"Awesome!\" She said. \"I couldn't lift that 10 minutes ago!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's inside?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the new TV mom got for us. It looks just like Courtney's.\" She said pointing to a picture on the box. \"Isn't it cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made sense to Josh, he had one in his old room before he made the swap with his other sister. He noticed his TV remained in Courtney's new room while he now didn't have one, despite still having his video games on a shelf now in his new room. His sisters had been begging for a new TV for months, and Kim said that they could get one as a shared birthday present, even though their birthdays were actually 5 months apart. Josh guessed she got them one early, which was good now that he had a new TV to play his games on. On another note, Bri was acting like it was normal that Courtney had her own room and not him, even though she knew of Josh's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me try to pick it up.\" He said, not answering Bri's question from before. He knew that before his latest swap he would pick it it with no problem. Now, he wasn't so sure. Sure enough, when Josh tried to pick the new TV up, he couldn't get it an inch off of the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" His sister said laughing. \"I'm stronger than you now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her comment, Josh suddenly thought of something when he noticed how much lighter he felt. \"Hey Bri, do we have a scale in the bathroom?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we do, shouldn't you know that? This has been your room for the longest time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh headed over to the bathroom that he now shared with his youngest sister and stepped on the scale. Sure enough, he had dropped in weight. He went from weighting 135 pounds to 90! It was likely because of what Josh learned from biology class where muscle played a big role in one's weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri followed her brother into the bathroom noticed that he had dropped weight. \"How did you do that?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I'll show you. Step on the scale!\" He said hopping off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister hopped on and her weight read 109 pounds. \"Whoa! How did that happen?\" Bri questioned with curiosity. Josh went on to explain to his sister that the muscle swap between the two had caused them to gain or drop in weight. She suddenly looked concerned. \"Does that mean I'm fat now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it just means you weigh more because your stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay!\" She said, the smile returning to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to set up the TV?\" He asked his youngest sister, twirling his ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" She agreed, following her brother out where they started to unbox the new product.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josh touched his head and found he had his original hair before looking over and seeing the same for his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't need your muscles anymore since I used them for the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Another flash swapped their muscles back, giving the two their original builds again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I like wearing your clothes, they're more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we could wait until tomorrow night for that.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave you two things back already, can we at least make one more swap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh saw some fairness in the idea since he already got two swap backs he wanted. \"I guess that's fine, what did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"______.\" She announced</span></div></div>",

It wasn't like he was swapping anything on his body physically and he had no plans with friends for at least the next day. What worried him though was the outcome of the swap. \"What about me? Don't you think I'll get bored of having 8 year old girls as my friends? No offense.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken. But, you can at least give it a try. Just because their young doesn't mean they're no fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still, they're all the opposite gender, not to mention half my age.\" He pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we try it just for one day?

He could live with both, but which one would be the best to get rid of.  As he sat there he looked down at his arms and noticed how it looked much lighter and not as dense.  Over the years, Josh watched in awe as the hair on his arms and legs started to grow in and certainly made him feel more manly.  Looking down at his legs, he noticed that they looked much the same that his arms did.  '<i>Do I want to have to wear girl clothes or do I want to at least look manly with some hair on my body.</i>'  He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\"  Bri asked impatiently as she watched him mull over what to pick.  \"What are you going to pick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get your panties in a twist.\"  Josh replied back to her, but winced when he realized that it was a poor choice of words, since he was now wearing them instead of her.  \"Fine...\"  He took a deep breath.  \"I want to swap back our hair.\"  Bri squealed with delight as she waited for the light to come over them once more, but as she waited for over a minute she seemed a little disappointed to see that nothing happened.  Josh sighed.  \"You're supposed to accept it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I accept.\"  She replied back and immediately they were both bathed with the bright light.  When they opened their eyes once more, Bri noticed that Josh had his shorter hair style back on his head.  She brought her hands back and felt the braided hair that she did earlier and marveled at how it was still braided, but this time on her own head.  She looked back over at her brother.  \"I would have thought that you would have chosen the clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled as he looked down at his girlish clothing.  \"I was about to, but then I remembered that you have some pants and it's not like I will have to wear any dresses if I don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really thought about this.\"  Bri replied back to him, seemingly impressed.  \"Are you ready for the next swap?\"  She smiled as she watched her brother begrudgingly nod his head in agreement.  \"Good, I think we should swap _______.\"</span></div></div>",

It's only fair, I gave you back your hair.\" She pleaded, making those puppy dog eyes once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you need my height anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two reasons. One, I want to see what it's like being tall, two, it could give me an advantage over the other players in tomorrow's game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Josh saw a point in reason number two, he still didn't want to swap though. \"Nah, I think I'm good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could always swap something else, like our private parts...\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would really expect me to do that?\" He questioned laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but swapping our height is not as bad for you. You can choose from one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I say no to both?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you won't get your clothes back.\" Bri threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took this threat seriously, as he didn't want to end up with his youngest sister's clothes longer than he had to. Even though he chose to get his hair back rather than clothes, he was still not completely comfortable wearing them. He figured there was worse things than being smaller, and he was definitely not willing to swap away his manhood. \"Fine, I agree to swap our heights.\" Josh said, ending the negotiations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flash of light returned, and when Josh's visibility returned, everything seemed WAY larger! He probably hadn't been this small since he was six years old. Bri was small for a girl her age after all, as he heard his mom say the other night that she was four feet, two inches. His old height was five feet, five inches, which meant that he had shrunk fifteen inches! He definitely felt a foot smaller, at least. He also felt lighter, as it wouldn't have been normal (or healthy) for him to remain the same weight but stand over a foot smaller. His arms, legs, hands, and feet were also generally smaller. Bri's clothes were once again resized, they were almost exactly the same size as when she had them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri on the other hand, felt heavier, had bigger hands, feet, arms, and legs, and everything looked REALLY tiny to her! The ground now seemed so far away. She wasn't sure how much she grew, but she had to guess she was over a foot taller. Now  She looked down and saw her now tiny brother, and couldn't help but think how cute he looked. \"Hey LITTLE bro! Didn't see you down there!\" She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow having to look up at his sister, Josh actually felt quite intimidated. \"I'm still older you know.\" He retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but your way smaller!\" Bri ran into the bathroom that she and Courtney shared. There were two sinks, Bri's had a step stool in front of hers so she could reach at her old height. \"Guess I won't be needing this anymore!\" She said tossing the stool aside before opening a closet and putting it in there. \"Whoa, I look SUPER different taller!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh followed her sister into the bathroom, but he couldn't see over the sinks to the mirror. \"I can't see!\" He complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, I'll help you!\" Bri said laughing as she helped her now smaller brother on to the top of the table. Josh felt that it was really demeaning. He sat on top of the counter, and looked into the mirror with his sister. She was right when she said they looked really really different, but not in the way he thought she meant. They looked ridiculous! Not just because Josh was a boy wearing the clothes of his little sister, and vice versa, but Bri still looked like an eight year old, but the size of a teenager. Meanwhile Josh looked like a teenager the size of a six year old. He thought he kind of looked like a midget, not that he had anything against midgets. He still wasn't liking the swap though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... when can we swap back?\" Josh cautiously asked his younger but now bigger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this, I already gave you your hair back, even though you said we could do it tomorrow night. You can choose whether you want your clothes back or your height back. I get the keep the other one for a bit longer after that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat actually sounded like a fair deal to Josh. Eight year olds were sometimes over their heads and unreasonable, but Bri sometimes had her moments of intelligence. \"Sounds like a fair deal to me.\" He said, hopping down from the table and reaching up to shake his younger sister's hand, while Bri reached down. \"I'm going to go play some video games.\" He left his sister's bathroom and eventually her room, only much shorter than when he entered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although now that he was a 4'2\" teenage boy with the wardrobe of his 8 year old sister he wasn't exactly sure how he could possibly make himself look cool for Jenn.  Pretty soon Kim opened the door and let Jenn into his and Bri's now shared room.  \"Remember the rules, keep the door open unless Bri is also in the room with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know Ms. Mitchell, but you'd know that we don't do that kind of stuff, we're just friends.\"  Jenn said as Josh felt the tiniest twitch in his left eye for some reason that he didn't even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim left the two of them (and Bri) in the bedroom.  \"So, what movie did you have in mind this evening?  Rom com?  Fantasy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking Sci Fi.\"  Josh said pulling out a time travel movie.  Josh was expecting to have the usual fun time of popcorn and a movie that he'd been having with Jenn for years, but apparently the swaps that had been made put a few minor twists into it.  For one, every few minutes or so, since Bri basically had to watch too since she shared a room with Josh now, Bri started asking questions and Josh and Jenn had to keep pausing the movie to explain the more complicated plot points to her.  And then as they were watching, Josh started to feel uncomfortable with Jenn practically towering over him now.  He started to uncomfortably adjust his positioning to try to minimize this effect, but seeing this Jenn kindly offered, \"Would you like to sit in my lap?\"  Josh blushed a deep shade of red and quickly muttered, \"I'm good, I'm good,\" as Bri at the same time started laughing and laughing.  Bri started laughing so much she actually choked on some juice she was drinking and ran with her long legs to their shared bathroom to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this Jenn said in a low voice so Bri wouldn't here, \"Your sister is nice and all, but have you talked to your mom about getting your own room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought back to a few hours ago when he swapped rooms with Courtney, \"I'm in negotiations for a new room right now.  I might have one of my own any day now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Josh, that's great!  Oh, and speaking of good news, just before I came over here I thought of something that I think you'll love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  What have you got in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was going through some of my old clothes to clear out my closet when I had a thought.  A lot of my old elementery school clothes would look so cute on you!  You're the perfect size and if you wear my old stuff it'll have a totally cool retro feel at school.  Oh I know, while your mom is at Bri's soccer game tomorrow, you should totally come to my house and you can try it all on.  It'll be like our own private fashion show!  And then after we're done we can study since it doesn't look like we're getting to it today.  Doesn't that sound like a plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds...great.\"  Josh said not wanting to let down Jenn who seemed very proud and excited about this idea of hers.  Josh was not as excited, he was dealing with the swaps with Bri because it was different and kind of interesting but something about wearing some other little girl's clothes, even if they were Jenn's seemed a little odd.  After Jenn and Josh tentatively agreed to these plans, Bri finally finished recovering from her laughing fit and the three of them finished the movie with a lot of stuff being explained to Bri along the way.  Afterwards Jenn went back to her place just as the sun set.  It was getting late when Josh went back to his new room and Bri was already her bed getting her rest before her big game tomorrow.  Josh knew that there would be no use in waking her up to try and switch everything back so he wouldn't have to be a fashion model for Jenn tomorrow.  So he decided to suck it up and went to bed himself as he decided what he was going to do tomorrow thanks to his switching power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day he woke up and was disappointed to see that everyone had already left to go to Bri's game.  \"Well, I know what I'm doing today.\"  Josh said as he jumped down further from his bed than he was used to, and went to his closet where he dug around and finally settled on a cute pair of overalls, with a yellow flowery shirt, and Bri's princess themed tennis shoes and made his way over to Jenn's house where she was waiting with a box full of clothing that was literally taller than Josh's current height.  <i>'How am I going to get out of this.</i>\"  Josh thought as Jenn happily pulled out a little girl's dress.</span></div></div>",

Being the oldest in the family had it's perks, but he also had the most chores to do too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you want to do it or not?\"  Bri asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I accept.\"  The blinding light soon enveloped the room once more and they looked over at each other, not seeing anything different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\"  Bri asked as she looked down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it did.\"  Josh answered, looking around the unchanged room.  \"How about we go down stairs and ask Mom.\"  Bri nodded and they both made their way down stairs to find their Mom talking on her cell phone talking to somebody lovingly.  But seeing two of her children walk into the room, she abruptly told them that she had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two.\"  Kim chuckled as she put her phone away into her purse.  \"What are you two up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thinking about the best way to phrase the question, he looked to his Mom.  \"Mom do you love me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback by the question, Kim looked over at Josh and started to stroke his hair in a loving manner.  \"Sure sweetie, you will always be my little girl.\"  Josh looked over at Bri who had the biggest grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was on the phone?\"  Bri asked bring her usual nosey self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"  Kim replied with a bit of blush.  \"That was Mike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just shook his head trying to help with the sudden drop of information.  \"You mean Dr. Wright, your boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, sweetie.\"  Kim made her way over to the kitchen table and had a seat.  \"Well, we've been talking and decided to start taking it to the next level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean dating?\"  Josh asked, still not used to the change that was coming to his family.  'Sure, Dad left them years ago and hasn't been seen since, but this was his family.'  He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm.\"  Kim nodded her head.  \"And he wants to meet you guys tomorrow and get to know you all a little bit better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA million different thoughts were starting to go through Josh's head, but was soon stopped by Bri speaking up for the first time since coming down.  \"Wow, really?\"  Josh looked over at his sister who seemed to be beaming as much as their Mom. To her it only came natural, since she never really got to know their real dad.  \"So what are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he will be taking you to a baseball game.\"  Kim replied as she turned to Bri, but was cut short by Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to go to the baseball game.\"  Josh announced looking over at the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know, but you see...\"  Kim commented, trying to find the best words that would fit.  \"Well it's going to be a boy's thing.\"  Josh didn't really understand what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri's smile turned even more devilish as she looked over at Josh.  \"What is he going to do with the girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think he's going to do something special.

Kim gave him an odd look because the old Bri didn't drink any soda, but she didn't know any better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took out a cylinder can and popped it open, which was harder than usual because Bri's fingers weren't used to opening soda cans. He climbed up to a high chair and sat at the island in the middle of the kitchen. He took a sip and a immediately spit it out all over the place. \"Ugh... Why does this taste so bad?\" He asked, not aware that he now had Bri's tastebuds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her 'daughter's' question, Kim proceeded to scold her child. \"Brianna! You just made a huge mess! Clean it up NOW.\" She said sternly. She went and handed Josh some paper towels to wipe up the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not used to his new name, Josh went to clean his mess, but he couldn't reach the top. \"Mom, I can't reach it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, stand on a chair.\" His mom suggested, patting a high chair to get on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be a LONG weekend.\" Josh thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He figured that was his mom, and the only other sound was the TV. He walked into the sitting room where it was and found Bri sitting there. Her long brown hair cascaded down to a smaller version of one of his tee shirts, and she was wearing a pair of plaid flannel pajama pants to accompany it. \"Hey Bri, what you up to?\" She asked, playing the part of her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time for games, we've got a problem.\" He announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot that you had a soccer game today and I have no idea how to play and I don't think it's a good idea for me to try taking your place.\" Josh explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we swap our places on your team so you'll be on it once again as me and I can stay home as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could work, but why don't I just give you me soccer skills so you'll be able to fit in?\" She offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe logic behind his sister plan worked out, the only problem for Josh was he really didn't want to go and play with other girls half his age in Bri's game.

That meant no video games, so Josh just spent most of the day doing Bri's homework for her. When he finished with that, he did his own. He had to look out for Courtney though because technically he was a third grade girl doing high school level homework. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only swap he made otherwise was that evening when Bri came back, where they swapped places on Bri's soccer team once again to avoid further confusion.

Taylor replied as he opened the door.  When the door opened, Josh could smell the faint scent of the ocean and hear the gentle crashing of the waves.  The last time he'd been to the ocean was when he was little and it was with his Dad.  With the sound of the seagulls, a tear began to form in his eye.

Thanks.\"  Josh said as he reached into the trunk and pulled out the girly looking backpack from the storage space and followed Bri's friend up the stairs to the home.  With each step that he took, Josh was in awe at the size and beauty of the home.  With two stories and being on stilts to help protect it from any nasty storms, the house seemed massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, huh?\"  Katie asked as she motioned for Josh to follow her.  \"Come on, let's go up to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too much stuff out.\"  Keiko said to the both of them.  \"We will be leaving for the beach in a bit, so go and switch into your swim suits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, mom.\"  Katie replied back as she grabbed Josh's arm to help drag him up to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"  Josh started to stammer, but was cut off by Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, BRI.\"  Taking extra effort to emphasize his new name.  \"We don't have a lot of time.\"</span></div></div>",

Katie had explained that she'd always wanted to wear something other than a one piece swimsuit.  \"My Mom always thought that it was unbecoming for a young girl to wear such a thing.\"  She looked back down at the swim suit that Bri usually wore and smiled.  \"This looks a lot cuter that that, I think anyway.\"  Katie then turned her head to see the orange buoys gently swaying in the water.  \"Bri, I mean, Josh do you think you can swim all the way out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the buoys?\"  Josh asked.  \"Sure, its easy, watch.\"  He began to swim out to the buoys with ease.  With all the years of swimming classes that he'd had, it made it easy to glide through the water with ease.  He'd even thought about joining the school swim team if he didn't have to wear such a revealing suit.  The irony in it all, not wanting to wear a speedo and now he was wearing a girl's one piece suit and nobody thought anything different.

He then let out a great sigh.  \"Because I said so.\"  He mentally patted himself on the back for doing such a good job.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about we wait until later on to swap back, please.\"  Katie pleaded and tried her best to make the pouty face that would make Courtney envious.  \"I just want to try this out for a little, please.  Besides, it probably didn't do too much to us.\"  Josh looked back at the shore line and noticed that Katie's Mom and Dad were too busy in their electronic devices to pay them any attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, we will wait until tonight and see how it goes.\"  Josh replied, conceding to Katie's efforts to get her way.  Since getting to know here a little more since earlier that day, he'd found himself liking her as a little sister even more.  \"I think I will see what I can do.\"  He started to walk slowly towards the deeper end of the swimming area and seem found himself barely able to keep himself afloat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just lay back and trust the water.\"  Katie suggested as she floated on her back not moving too much.  \"If you trust the water, it will support you, but if you move too much it can't support you.\"  Josh decided to see if she was right, well, he knew that she was right since she was using his ability to swim to reteach him.  He did as she suggested and soon found himself starting to feel anxious.  His arms started to flail and soon found his mouth full of sea water.  \"You're such a spaz.\"  Katie laughed as she stopped floating on her back and started to tread water.  \"Just stand up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"  Josh said as he stood up and found that the water only came up to his shoulders.</span></div></div>",

Katie was an expert swimmer as Josh had taken ( before the swap ) lifeguarding lessons. He was planning to take a job as a lifeguard for the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie knew many types of swim strokes, she started by teaching Josh the breaststroke. Josh had a great deal of fun learning to swim again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he learned the breaststroke, Katie suggested that Josh pretend to drown so that Katie could save him. Josh agreed immediately. He love the way that Katie could swim him to shore even though he was much bigger then she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half later, it was time return to shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It's time to swap back,\" Josh informed Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I guess you're right.\"  Then Katie said, \" I agree to swap all my swimming ability with Bri, I mean Josh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I almost forgot who you were for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It's okay,\" Josh said with a laugh breaking the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh and Katie walked back to the lounges where they left there clothes.   Josh had forgotten the original swap which included of all of his abilities. He didn't need them now, everyone thought he was an eight year old girl, it was expected he should act like one.  Besides, in general, Katie could do everything that Josh could just not as well and vice versa. Such as Josh could still read but now only at a third grade level. Not that he noticed since he wasn't reading any books at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be until he swapped lives back with his sister that he might notice his new abilities.</span></div></div>",

Remembering what he saw his sisters do, he just simply slid it down.  \"That's much better.\"  He said to himself as he stepped onto the beach.  Stepping foot onto the hot, dry, grainy sand, Josh cursed under his breath.  Quickly he made his way over to where Katie's parents were sitting/laying down.  Katie's Mom, Ichika, seemed to be at home in the shade.  Josh thought for a moment and found that he knew that '<i>Ichika</i>' meant 1,000 flowers.  He shook his head, wondering where that piece of knowledge had come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay over there?\"  Katie's dad asked chuckling as he could feel the heat emanating from the sand.  Josh just nodded as he did he best to clean the sand off of his feet before stepping onto the blanket.  He just nodded his head and wrapped the towel around him.  \"Ah, to be young again, right honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchika nodded her head as she looked up from her kindle, where she was too engrossed in a book to pay any attention.  \"Oh, Bri.\"  She said with her heavily accented English.  \"I was wondering if you would help me cooking some dinner tonight?  Bill loves it when you come over, he seems to enjoy it when he can spar with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was taken aback at what she asked him.  Since he saw her, he thought her as beautiful as women come and thought it would be great to spend some time with her.  \"Oh, Bri, perhaps you can help me teach Katie some more of those moves that we've been trying.  Hmm?\"  Katie's dad wondered as he put down his phone and looked at him.  Josh found it funny how he was dressed and not a soul seemed to think anything was odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...  I guess I can help you guys out later on.\"  Josh smiled as he looked at both of them.  '<i>What kind of moves is he talking about and what am I going to do in the kitchen?</i>'</span></div></div>",

The bell on the buoy ran dully as a small wave from a boat that passed by.  \"I can't believe all this.\"  She said to herself as she looked down at the tankini that she wore with her swap with Josh.  \"I wonder if she will let me try some other stuff too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie, Princess.\"  Katie's Dad called out from the shore line.  \"Its time for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Katie yelled back to them as she jumped off of the buoy and started to expertly swim back to the shore.  The water felt nice on her skin as she effortlessly glided through the water.  Within a minute, Katie danced across the hot sand to the picnic site where Josh was already helping Katie's Mom set everything up for the picnic.  All the plates were set and rice balls with bottles of ice cold water.  \"Wow, this looks good Mom.\"  She exclaimed as she drew the towel around her wet form and sat down next to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were looking good out there Katie-bird.\"  Her Dad replied putting down the book that he was reading.  \"Those lessons that we got you sure did pay off, right honey.\"  Ichika nodded her head lovingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Katie and Josh tried their best to keep from busting out laughing at what they thought that they were the reason for her new found abilities, but were able to keep it under control.

Taylor was carrying most of the items, even though Josh offered his assistance, but was told.  \"Don't worry about it sweetie.  Just head on inside with Katie.  She hasn't stopped talking about having you over for almost 2 weeks.\"  He chuckled.  Josh nodded his head and followed Katie inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he crossed the threshold, Josh instinctively took off his shoes and put on a pair of slippers that was next to the door.  It was something that Katie's Mom insisted that the household adopt, since it reminded her of her homeland.  \"Come on Jo... I mean, Bri.\"  Katie called out to him from the stairs, quickly catching herself.  Josh glared at her and followed her up the stairs to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get out of this stupid suit.\"  Josh stated as he made a bee line to his bad.  Opening it up, he noticed that something just wasn't right.  Instead of the pants and shorts that he helped Bri pack up, instead there were a couple cloth skirts and a pair of pink shorts.  Thinking he'd gotten into the wrong bag, Josh closed it back up and looked around again.  But that was the only bag that matched the one that he brought with him and had the letters <b>B.A.M</b> embroidered on it.  <i>'Brianna Annabeth Mitchell'</i>  Josh thought to himself, knowing that was Bri's bag.  \"What... Where are my clothes?\"  Josh stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie, not knowing what was going on, leaned in over her bed to see inside the bag.  \"Those are my clothes that I packed.\"  She stated as she went over to her light purple bag to find Bri's clothing in her own size.  \"This is awesome.\"  She said as she held up the shirt that Josh had been wearing several hours before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie, this isn't funny.\"  Josh declared as he saw the shirt that she'd picked up.  \"Give me back those clothes.  I don't want to wear yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe.  Come on please?\"  Katie pouted as she tried her best to make him feel bad.  \"I want to keep them for a little longer.\"  Knowing that he wouldn't be able to win.  Josh nodded his head.  Seeing that she'd won, Katie squealed with delight and quickly picked up the clothes that Josh had worn and made her way to the bathroom to change.  Knowing that he might as well change too, Josh grabbed the cloth skirt and shirt.  Soon he was dressed in her clothes and found them to fit him.  He looked back in the bag and noticed a pair of 'Hello Kitty' themed panties and knew that he couldn't run around commando.  Sighing he quickly grabbed them and put them on.  \"Wow you look cute.\"  Katie replied with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie, I want those clothes back.\"  Josh demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want them, how about we trade.\"  She suggested to him as she balled up the tankini that she got done wearing and did her best basketball throw into the awaiting hamper.  \"Wow, I didn't know I could do that.\"  She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you still have my skills.\"  Josh said to her in disbelief and knew that there would be only one way to get his stuff back.  \"What kind of trades?\"  Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, each of us will pick pick something from each other.\"  She suggested as she held out her hand showing three fingers.  \"Three things for each of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the clothes and skills are mine and I want them back.\"  He demanded once more, but this time stomped his foot, which caused his new skirt to sway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trade me for them and you can have them back.\"  She told him with a devilish grin.</span></div></div>",

I swapped potty training with my 2 year old brother. Nobody noticed. I even had to be changed by a grown up.  But I sort of swapped back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You're making that up.  You can go to that baby over there and swap and then will his mommy would change your diaper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No, I'm not lying.  But I don't know if that baby can talk.  How can I swap if the baby doesn't talk yet.  But who knows what the baby is thinking.  It might happen.  Also, I have to be careful. I could swap with someone without even knowing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Whatcha mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" If someone said something like 'I wish' and I agree then a swap could take place.  If they didn't know they were swapping, they wouldn't realize anything had happened.  Or if I wasn't paying attention, then I might not know.  As I said, I have to be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What swaps have you made so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I swapped lives with my sister Bri and I swapped clothes with Katie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" If you swap lives with your sister, who are you really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm Josh.

People do it all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No it's not like that. It was magic. All of a sudden, he was wearing my clothes and I was wearing his.  My Mommy wouldn't allow me to wear a tankini.

Katie didn't know exactly what would happen, but she wished it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Katie, her privates were replaced with the penis of an 8 year old. This amounted to only a small bulge in her swimsuit bottoms. Little else changed as little boys and little girls before puberty are pretty much the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for Josh, the changes were much more dramatic. Not only did he get the vagina of a girl, but because he had gone through puberty he also received wider hips, firm breasts and a rounder face. He also became a few inches shorter and his features became more delicate. His swimsuit adjusted to his new proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho noticed the change?</span></div></div>",

Now, it's time for you to sit,\" Katie's mother told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality had changed when the swap was made.  Katie and her friends had forgotten about Josh's swapping power.  in the new reality, Katie's best friend Bri was an 8 years old girl, who looked like a 15 year old boy and knew as much as a two year old toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Katie, you can't take your eyes off Josh. It's very dangerous for her around the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm sorry Mommy,\" Katie apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" it's okay. Just keep an eye on her at all times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Me wanna know stuff,\" Josh said in a frustrated tone.  Josh's only hope was that someone would say or think something causing a swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no one knew what Josh meant or what he wanted.  No one would willing return to the intellect of a two year old if they could help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I always have fun there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how about we swap back lives then and you can go to the beach?\" Josh offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the offer, but I rather keep your life for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, I guess I'm gonna pack then.\" He said before heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Bri called to her brother, causing him to turn around. \"I have an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it quick, I have to pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just swap our friends!\" She exclaimed. \"This way, I can keep your life and still go to the beach. You can get your friends back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh liked the sound of that. The only problem was that if he agreed, he wouldn't be able to get away from his younger sister's life. Therefore, he decided to take the negotiation a bit further. \"I will do the swap if I can have my clothes back as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to swaps clothes again. I already said I like your clothes more than mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The swap will be fair then though. You will get two things: A trip to the beach and my life, and I'll get two things: My friends back and my clothes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the logic in her brother's explanation, Bri decided to settle on Josh's offer. \"Your right, but we're swapping friends first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shake on it.\" Josh said, holding out his hand, he was close to winning the negotiation with his sister and he wasn't taking any risks on being cheated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot planning on lying to Josh anyway, Bri grabbed hold of her brother's bigger hand and shook it. Following was two swaps and two flashes within the room in under 30 seconds. The first didn't make Josh feel any different, but it give him his original friends back, making them friends with his youngest sister from a technical standpoint. The second gave Josh some physical comfort, however. His looser male clothes were returned to him, which included his 'Schoolhouse Rock' shirt. After that, Josh agreed to help Bri pack and they both went to what was now their bedroom to gather her belongings. Bri was gone less than half an hour later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If Bri was going to live his life, she should at least get to wear his clothes. \"Sounds good, it's a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two had swapped their hair and clothes yet again, Bri noticed something else. \"Hey big bro, why am I starting to have memories of this woman at a bus stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't quite figure out what she was talking about at first. He had no clue what woman she was talking about, but since he remembered telling Bri the story of the woman giving him the power. He couldn't picture the woman in his mind anymore though. Then he realized why she now had those memories. \"I think you got my powers.\" He said shocked. Josh explained to her how having his life gave her the power. Then, he told her to be careful with the it, as great power came with great responsibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri was finally able to put it all together. \"So you're saying that I know have your swapping power?\" Josh nodded. \"That is so cool!

You can have them again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sis!\" Even though it was true that his hairless body was uncomfortable to him, Josh found even more discomfort in wearing his sister's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two siblings went through the swapping ritual. After the flash had come and gone, Josh's old clothes were on his body again, resized to fit him. The same happened with Bri, as she was wearing her originally clothes in her original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's do more!\" Bri said. \"You said a couple swaps, so that means two.\" She said, holding up two fingers to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I pick one?\" He requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I choose one and you can choose one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's swap the way mom treats us.\" Josh figured this would be a good swap to make as their mom was not as strict with Bri as she was with him and Courtney due to her young age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! I get to be treated like a big kid!\" She exclaimed. \"I'll do that swap.\" There was a flash, but nothing was different physically following that. \"Did it work?\" The youngest Mitchell asked her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" He went on to explain that no physical thing was involved with the the swap so it would be difficult to tell immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's my turn!\" Bri said. \"I want to swap our _______.\"</span></div></div>",

Quit your whining!\" She scolded. \"You're too old to behave like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two siblings just stood there saying nothing until she left and closed the door behind her. Josh was shocked, he had never heard his mom talk to Bri like that before. The previous swap must have worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously intimidated by her mother, Bri still continued her relentless begging. \"Why won't you do this with me Josh? I did the swap that you asked for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, swapping private parts is much bigger than swapping something like the way mom treats us.\" He told her while moving some hairs back behind his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri looked as if she got an idea. \"If you swap with me I'll fix your hair for you and I'll convince Courtney to give you your room back.\" The latter incentive she mentioned was referring to the conversation she overheard between her two older siblings. She believed from the conversation that the room belonged to her brother, even if the room belonged to Courtney had the room for as long as she could remember. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri started to remind Josh of what had recently happened. \"Come on Josh, I gave you back your clothes, I gave you a swap, I'll get your room back for you, and I'll fix your hair.\" As she went, she put up an extra finger until she got to four, which she then held up to her brother. \"That's 4 things!\" She announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Josh had squeezed out an appealing offer from his sister. It reminded him of when he and his dad talked about baseball, and his dad would tell him of big trades between teams where teams would trade one really good player for a bunch of other not as good players to even out a deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my final offer, yes or no?\" Bri asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine! I agree to swap genitals with you.\" A flash filled up Courtney and Bri's smaller room again, and when it was gone, Josh could feel something odd in his crotch area. It surprised him, even though he was expecting it. He reached down into his pants to confirm his dick was no longer there and was replaced with his 8 year old sister's vagina. He felt no sexual pleasure though as he ran his finger over it. He figured that Bri's sexual organs weren't mature enough yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri was doing the same with her new equipment and finally let out a squeal of excitement when he was finished. \"Thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!\" She embraced Josh in a tight hug. When she held him tight, Josh felt something pressing up against his body. He realized that it was his penis, and it must have became hard while Bri was looking at it. Bri awkwardly broke the hug. \"Oops... sorry, she said embarrassed but still smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's long hair had become a problem again and he was having trouble keeping it under control. \"Umm... Bri? Can you fix my hair now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, sure thing. Sit here!\" She said patting the end of her bed. She then sat behind him and took the hair within her hands. <i>'It's so funny seeing my hair at this angle, but this might be a good time to try something new.'</i> She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to walk on some braids that Courtney had taught her, and within a few minutes she had created twin braids with her former hair. She pulled a handheld mirror out of her dresser and showed to Josh, holding out the mirror in front of him. \"Take a look.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't think the look was half bad. Even though the braids would frequently brush against his shoulders and and back, it was better that it was under control now. \"It looks good, thank you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go ______!\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, for the meantime it was his and Bri's room. Trying to find what to do to pass the time, Josh felt something build up in his bladder all of the sudden. He had to pee with his sister's vagina! He figured the time would come eventually, but he didn't expect it to happen so fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reluctantly headed over to the bathroom that was connected to his current bedroom. He noticed that at one of the two sinks, inside was his toothbrush, toothpaste, and has razor for shaving. He pulled down his pants and boxers to his ankles. He just tried to relax as much as possible, and the next thing he knew he was peeing with a vagina for the first time. He luckily remembered to wipe, which he never had to do with a penis. <i>\"Well, that was easy.\"</i> Josh thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he returned to the previous room, he decided to just down on the the twin bed that belonged to him. He had gone through so much today that he hadn't had the chance to just take a couple deep breaths and rest. 15 minutes passed by, and Bri still hadn't returned. <i>\"What's taking her so long?\"</i> Josh thought, starting to think that Courtney wasn't budging on negotiations. After about 5 more minutes of waiting, Bri returned to the sight of her braided-hair brother sitting upright on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay big bro.

You ready to give my room back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\" She said, sitting at her homework desk but not sounding very enthusiastic. \"I'm only doing because Bri threatened to tattle on me for kissing a boy at a party last week.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was too loud when I got back home, and I woke her up.

Everything was back where it was, including his game console resting under his TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, thanks again.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever.\" She said before leaving, still a bit mad about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided to sit and play some video games. He turned on his PlayStation, waiting for his game to start. <i>\"Ahh... home sweet home.\"</i> Josh thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were cut off with someone standing at the door, who turned out to be Bri. \"So I'm guessing you got your room back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks to you! I can't believe you threatened to rat out Courtney though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't underestimate me.\" Bri said before the siblings shared a laugh. Josh saw Bri run the opposite way of her and now once again Courtney's room, before he heard her run downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce console had turned on, he immediately got a party request from Kira Marshall, Jenn's sister. Jenn didn't really like the fact that they played video games together, but was starting to accept it. Josh accepted the request and put his headset on. \"Hey Kira! You looking for a partner in crime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish, but Jenn left for your house and should be there any minute. I'd just get of now if I were you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the door bell rang. \"I'll get it!\" Josh heard his youngest sister yell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she just got here, thanks for telling me.\" He said before shutting the console down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh made sure he looked presentable before Jenn got to his room, and sat on his bed once satisfied. \"Hey there Josh!\" Jenn said as she appeared through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jenn!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing at the current moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you want to do? Study, watch that movie you talked about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I have a different idea.\" Josh wasn't keen on the idea of swapping after the negotiations with his sisters, but Jenn's arrival changed all of that. He actually was pretty eager to reveal his power., as maybe it would make her view him in a new light. Especially because he knew it worked now. Josh went on to explain everything about his power to her, from the old lady at the bus stop, to swapping hair with Bri, to the room affair with Courtney. He also told Jenn that he currently had Bri's hair and vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Jenn said. \"There's no way someone could have a power like that. And you've always had long hair and a vagina, and you're trying to tell me it's your sister's? I'm calling bullshit!\" Jenn wasn't one to curse a ton, but she was angry because she thought that Josh was trying to waste her time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can say that, but it doesn't hurt to try, you never know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine, I'll try one swap.

Opening up the top of his shirt, Josh noticed a light pink bra across his chest.  '<i>Great, now I have long hair, breasts and a vagina.  How can this get any worse?</i>'  He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure doing business with you.\"  Courtney chuckled as she waved him good bye and closed the door behind her.  Josh lay back on his bed and noticed several bras laying around the floor, much like his underwear he forgot to put in the hamper every once in a while.</span></div></div>",

He'd lost his room for only a couple of hours and he just wanted to hide from the world and blow stuff up.  \"Yeah?\"  He called to the individual on the other side.  The door slowly opened up to reveal his Mom coming in.  \"Oh, hey Mom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"  She looked around the room and fought the urge to pick up the female under garments that littered the floor.  Kim looked over at what her son was doing.  \"I thought we had plans tonight?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"  He asked with an odd look on his face.  Josh tried to think back to see if he missed any conversations, but when he came up short, he started up the game that he had selected.  \"What are you talking about?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're supposed to go bra shopping today, remember?\"  Kim chuckled at her son's forgetfulness.  \"I swear, you would forget your head if it wasn't on your neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate to get out of this seemingly humiliating experience, Josh tried to grasp out for any excuse that would fit the situation.  \"That's okay, I think the ones that I have now will be fine.\"  He mentally patted himself on the back with what he came up, thinking that would save him from the boredom that was about to come his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim sighed as she made her way over to where her son was sitting and sat down next to him.  \"Look, I know you're embarrassed that you've started to grow breasts and I\"m sure that the other boys are making fun of you.\"  She put a hand on his back, as if to console him.  \"But the ones that you have now are too small and we need to get you fitted for a bigger size.  Besides, you were the one that said that they were too small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did?\"  Josh asked, wondering if Courtney complained to their Mom about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you told me earlier this week.\"  Kim pointed out.  \"And I told you that we would go Friday night when I got off of work.  So let's go and get this done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning and groaning, Josh got up off of his bed.  '<i>I wonder if this is one of the reasons why Courtney wanted to trade that</i>.'

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh was about to make an agreement of swapping hair with Bri. The lack of hair on his body was discomforting to him and he felt as if he had lost part of his masculinity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll swa...\" He started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Bri said, cutting him off. \"I have a new idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you back both the clothes and the hair, but you have to agree to another swap that I want, and you can't say no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought about this possible suggestion. Not only, could he get his hair back like his sister offered, but he could also regain his clothes. The clothes were a huge plus as part of the deal. He did have to consider the consequences though. He decided to ask some questions to see if he could get some more information. \"Could you tell me what your new swap would be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! It's gonna be a surprise.\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a big blow for Josh. The risk he would be taking is getting his original two swaps reversed, but be stuck with getting something unknown in return. He wasn't sure if the swap would be worth it. As uncomfortable as his new clothes were, and as much as he didn't like the feeling having no hair on his body, he didn't want to be stuck with something he wasn't interested in gaining from his 8 year old sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what's it gonna be?\" She asked, rushing his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh finally decided to give in. His New Year's resolution was to take more risks for what is was worth. As long as those risks didn't but him in any danger. He didn't really see any danger in what his sister proposed. \"Alright, I'll do it under two conditions. One, I want my hair and clothes back before the next swap, and I promise I won't trick you. Two, we're only making ONE swap. No more swaps after your new one until we swap that back.\" Josh explained, emphasizing the 'one swap' rule, so Bri wouldn't get any ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a minute, Bri said \"Deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded before saying \"Let's swap one thing at a time. I don't know the limitations of this power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri decided to swap back the hair first, and after a flash, Josh's short and cropped hair style returned, while Bri now had the longer hair style she had about an hour ago, only it was now braided. The siblings then swapped back their clothes, as Josh finally was able to get rid of the uncomfortable restriction in his nether region. All of his clothes were resized to fit him as they were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she and Josh were back to normal, Bri was eager to commence the next swap. \"Are you ready for the next swap Joshie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'll ever be, but I'll do it now anyway. What's this 'mystery swap' you had in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's swap our bodies!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUR ENTIRE BODIES?!?!\" Josh said perhaps a bit louder then he should had in a wide-eyed panic. His sister only confirmed with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately regretted agreeing to the deal. He would receive and be everything his youngest sister was physically. He would get her height, small arms, skinny legs, and even her vagina. To make matters worse, he got somewhat tricked as he would get his Bri's longer hair flipped right back to him. He would basically be his 8 year old sister from a physical standpoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask why you want to do that?\" He asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No questions, you HAVE to do the swap. I said that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have to?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we do. Now do the swap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine, I agree to swap bodies with you.\" With that, there was a flash and when Josh could see again, he had to look up to see himself! That did enough for him as he was able to tell the swap worked. He looked around and everything now seemed gigantic to him. He now has small arms, legs, hands, feet and a flatness his crotch area. Also, his clothes were resized again to fit his smaller body. He felt the braided hair he possessed a few minutes ago hit his back again. \"Ugh... I'm in my little sister's body!\" He thought aloud. He covered his mouth with both hands in surprise to his new high voice that used to belong to Bri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri didn't see what her brother was going through as she was looking at her new situation, which was the opposite of Josh's. Feeling a new discomfort with her clothes, which were resized to fit her bigger body, her first words with her new voice were. \"I can see why you want to give my clothes back so badly.\" She was trying to adjust her panties to give her new junk some room, with no avail. She was also surprised by her new voice at first, but she kind of liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... when can we swap back?\" Josh asked, still getting used to his girly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be able to keep it for longer than your clothes and hair. Can I give it back by Sunday before school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Monday doesn't sound so bad.\"</i> Josh thought. \"The weekend is fine by me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not that, I meant the Sunday after the next one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Was all he could say because of shock, his voice higher than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see what being a boy and being bigger than the other kids is like at school.\" She explained with her new deeper voice, intrigued by the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But for a whole week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please?\" She said giving puppy dog eyes. They weren't as effective as her former body's, but Josh gave in anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" He said, heading for the door. Even though it was now his and Bri's room, he wanted to escape the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joshie?\" Josh heard his sister ask behind him. \"Can we swap underwear too?\" She said while adjusting her panties which her tight on her unfamiliar male junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said no more swaps until we swap back our bodies Bri. I meant it too.\" He told her before leaving. Bri's voice sounded much more sophisticated now that a 15 year old was controlling the words it said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided to leave the upper floor altogether. As he defended down the stairs, a thought crossed his mind. <i>\"What did I get myself into? A whole week with my youngest sister's body. It's actually even longer than a week.\"</i> When he got to the bottom of the steps, he saw his PlayStation hooked up to the living room TV. It made sense now that his old room's TV now belonged to Courtney, and since his new room didn't have one, his console was moved downstairs. He decided to play a bit, firing up the PlayStation. As he turned it on, he noticed two pictures. One was with a frame labeled 'The Girls.' What was normally Courtney sitting, holding Bri in her lap, was replaced with his body, holding Courtney bridal style. His body looked ridiculous in his youngest sister's clothes. The second picture was of the four current family members together. Courtney and Bri were sitting with their legs crossed upfront, while Josh and his mom were in the back. Josh and Bri were in the same positions but their bodies were swapped. He could see that his hair was down in the picture, and could tell Bri's (now his) body had a polo shirt on, which looked ridiculous on her. He decided not to think about the current situation and get to playing his games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But don't expect your hair and clothes back tomorrow night if you still won't swap anything else!\" She threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis comment sort of caught his attention, but after thinking about it he realized that was more than 24 hours away. By then, she would want her hair or clothes back, and/or Josh would come around to another swap by then anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh went down the stairs and couldn't really find anything to do. After a few minutes of hiding out from his younger sisters downstairs, he felt his phone buzz in his pocket. He saw that he received a text message from somebody:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Josh, I'm about to leave my house and I'll be on my way.\"- Jenn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last few hours had made Josh forget that Jenn was coming over! He needed to avoid his sisters to avoid swapping anything else though, so he thought of a plan, and sent a text message to his friend:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On second thought, may I come over to your place by a chance? Things are a bit hectic around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin half a minute, Josh got his response and saving grace for the day:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem! See you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Josh called to his mom that he was heading over to Jenn's house, but then he realized something. He couldn't let Jenn see him with his new hair and clothes! He was about to cancel the visit, but then he realized that when Courtney found out Josh made a swap with Bri, she asked him what it was, not knowing until he told her. He thought maybe she wouldn't notice like his sister, and he decided to risk it, considering he wanted to avoid his sister and had no other options. He went to grab his book bag just in case Jenn wanted to study, but when he picked it up, his bag was much lighter. But then it hit Josh, as he put down his black bag and picked up Bri's Minnie Mouse bag, which was the correct weight, and headed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to Jenn's place after a 10 minute walk, he rang the doorbell and was answered by her mom, \"Hey there Mrs. Marshall!\" Josh greeted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Josh, Jenn is upstairs.\" Josh realized she treated him the same as always and didn't acknowledge his new hair or clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh headed up the stairs with his new book bag, and saw Jenn's sister Kira making her way down the stairs. \"Oh hey Josh! I didn't know you were coming over, I didn't know why you weren't on PlayStation.\" She told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah your sister invited me over\" He told her, noticing that she also treated him like normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to his friend's room, he knocked which was answered with a quick \"come in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh opened the door and then walked in, placing his Minnie Mouse bag next to her bed and shut the door behind him. \"Hey Jenn.\" He greeted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you don't sound very enthusiastic.\" She told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my sisters, they've been bugging me ever since I got home.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it!\" She said. \"Kira's been complaining all afternoon because you weren't on PlayStation with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to get out of the house.\" Josh explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so, what do you want to do?\" She asked.</span></div></div>",

After all that's happened, he just wanted to have some normalcy for once.  \"I think we should just study.\"  He suggested as he made his way over to his new backpack, courtesy of Bri, and got out his notes out.  Looking at the notebook, Josh noticed that it had a colorful unicorn on it instead of the normal plain color that he would normally have.  'It must be from the swap I got with Bri.'  He thought to himself as he put it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you must be ready to get out of the house if you're willing to study.\"  Jenn chuckled as she sat near by.  \"By the way, I like what you did with you hair today.\"  She motioned over to his pony tail that Bri fixed before he left the house earlier.  \"Did you do that or did your sister help you out again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh brought his hand up to his head and felt the pony tail and sighed at his misfortune.  \"Oh, Bri helped me with it.\"  He replied as he shamefully looked back down at his notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, it nothing to be ashamed of having your little sister help you with your hair.\"  Jenn chuckled as she nudged him jokingly and reached up to play with his now longer hair, pulling out the tie that was holding it all into place.  \"I think I can show you a couple things but you need to learn how to do it yourself.\"  Josh thought about telling his friend about his new ability, but thought against it since he wanted to get away, at least for a little bit, from his problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right.\"  Josh sighed as he tried to get away from his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Joshie.\"  Jenn giggled as she got even closer, causing Josh to blush slightly at all the attention he was getting from his longtime crush.  \"We have plenty of time to study, so let me play with your hair a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was taken aback, having never seen his friend like this before, he begrudgingly agreed and groaned when Jenn let out a small squeal of excitement as she ran over to her makeup table to grab her brush and some other items.  \"So, I guess you like guys with longer hair?\"  Josh asked poking a little fun at his friend who was seemingly fawning over his longer hair and wondered if she was always like this around him in this reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn blushed slightly at the question.  \"Oh, umm...\"  She fought to stay on track after the abrupt question.  \"I guess you can say that.  Now sit still.\"  She sat behind him and started to do her thing.</span></div></div>",

Wait, did I really just think that?!\"</i> Josh was shocked that he was even thinking of keeping something from his 8 year old sister. However, it meant getting Jenn to be his girlfriend after all of this time, it might be worth it. <i>\"I could at least ask her, maybe she could at least keep my hair until she grows it out for me.\"</i> The only potential problem he saw was that Josh would probably want his facial and body hair back and Bri probably wouldn't want to keep that. Although he figured those could be swapped back separately. He felt too weird with a hairless body with the exception of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jenn went to work on his hair, explaining every step of the way. Josh could hear her but didn't listen to a word she said, as he was lost in his own thoughts. Plus, if he actually did keep Bri's hair for a longer time, it was possible he could trade knowledge of how to care for it was well, seeing that his sister wouldn't need that knowledge anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I can always just make another swap to make it up to her. She loves doing them.\"</i> Josh continued to think of ways that he could convince his sister to keep the hair, if he decided to. He didn't want to hold it against Bri's wished though, as he wasn't the type of person who would put himself before his family. <i>\"Maybe tomorrow when she plays her game she'll realize it's easier to play with shorter hair and want to keep it, then a long-term switch could be mutual.\"</i> He also realized in the event where he upset her, he should make sure he could swap the clothes back without angering his sister and being stuck with those for a while as well. <i>\"I should probably wait until tomorrow to talk to her about it though.\"</i> Josh figured it would be easier to convince Bri if she had gone through a full day or so with his hair instead of going home that night and begging her right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn finally finished her braiding tutorial with Josh's new hair, even though Josh didn't actually hear a word she said. \"How does it look?\" She asked, holding a mirror in front of him, revealing two long twin braids defending down his back, he actually kind of liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks great! Can I leave it like this for a while?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? It looks super cute!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh blushed once again, this time a deep shade of red. \"What should we do now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I not sure.\" She said smiling, sitting next to Josh. She sat so close that their shoulders were touching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we get started on studying?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could do that... or we could do something else.\" She said, whispering the second part and leaning inward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" It was the Josh noticed she was leaning in for a kiss! Considering how close they were sitting before, she didn't have much farther to go. When he realized this, he chose to go for it. This was his crush trying to kiss him after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh could've sworn their lips were about to touch, but Jenn's phone rang on her desk! She backed away to check the number, Josh see she was blushing a deep shade of red. He could tell he was too as he could feel his cheeks burning up. To add on to the misery for Josh that they didn't kiss, the number that called her was a 1-800 number. \"I uhhh... have to go to the bathroom.\" Jenn said, quickly making her way to the bathroom that was down the hall from her room. He could tell she was lying though, as she had a connecting bathroom to her room and didn't even bother to look toward it. She obviously just wanted to get out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the past minute or so wasn't enough evidence for Josh that his friend was asking differently, he opened his phone and looked through some of the pictures to pass the time. He noticed that in the pictures Jenn was standing a lot closer to him, with her smile a bit wider. In some pictures she even had her arms around him in a hug! <i>\"I'm definitely gonna talk to Bri about keeping the hair.\"</i> He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Josh ate dinner with Jenn, so he didn't eat his his family. He just went and hid in his room. He locked the door and avoided any entrance from another family member, specifically Bri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of keeping the longer hair, Josh decided that he wanted to do it. But when he thought about he decided letting Bri play her game with his hair was a better strategy. This way, she could see the advantages before a negotiation. However, Josh didn't like the fact that he know had a lack of body or facial hair, so he thought that maybe they could swap their body and facial hair back. This way Josh could have long hair and keep his body hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much happened the next morning either, as Kim took Bri to her game and Josh was left with Courtney. But Josh's sister didn't really seem to care about what he was doing, so they left each other alone. Kim and Bri finally returned around noon. Josh gave her some time to settle in, and called her to his room after 15 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh finally got the knock on his door that he had been waiting for. \"Come in.\" He said, 99 percent sure it was Bri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want to see me?\" Bri asked appearing from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sit down.\" Josh said, while patting a spot next to him on the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri closed the door behind her and then sat on the bed. \"Do you want to swap again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not right now.

We agreed we could after my game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was wondering if you wanted to keep my hair for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Like how long?\" She asked, suddenly interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not quite sure. Maybe a couple of days, maybe forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just... started to like long hair.\" Josh lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lying! It's because of that girl you like isn't it?\" Bri was referencing to Jenn, she knew her brother liked her, even though he always denied it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like her!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri put he hands on her hips, doing her best impression of Courtney. She gave Josh a stare saying 'don't deny it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh finally just admitted it. \"Okay... maybe I like her a LITTLE.\" He said blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it! Joshie LIKES A GIRL!\" Bri smiled and started doing her happy dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're happy with that?\" Josh questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Me and Courtney knew you liked Jenn and we think of her like family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So would you being willing to help me then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to, I would miss having long hair. But your hair is more comfortable. Tell me how this would work first.\" Bri told him. Josh had to admit, Bri was a smart girl. She could not be tricked very easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh proposed his swap terms to his youngest sister. He wanted to keep the long hair, although he would be willing to swap back if Bri grew his out longer. However Josh wanted to swap body hair and facial hair back. He explained to Bri how his hairless body was a bit uncomfortable and it was abnormal for a girl to have facial and body hair like she did at the current moment. Finally, the duration of the swap would be for as long as Jenn was a possible romantic interest. That could span from a day to the rest of their lives. After explaining it all, Josh took a deep breath, waiting for a potential life-changing response from his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He also felt the small amount of facial hair that he had been familiar with before he gave it up to Bri.

He opened his laptop to see that his menu screen had changed. Instead of him posing with Jenn, who was holding a stuffed bear he won for her at the carnival, the picture was replaced with one of him at a boy band concert. He was alongside with Courtney's friends Megan, Christina, Kira, and Josie. The only one of the friends he knew from the picture personally was Kira, as they were gaming buddies, but her and the other three were now his best of friends due to the swap. He didn't hesitate to make the swap for a couple of reasons. One, he was sure that Courtney would want her friends back eventually. Two, he wasn't even sure if the swap would work because it wasn't a physical swap. Option two was now obviously not going to happen, so Josh hoped Courtney would swap back soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He immediately got started with his biology homework since he wanted to know what Jenn was talking about if she did in fact come over later to study. Josh figured he was in the clear after 5 minutes, but was still a bit embarrassed and wanted to refrain from telling his odd story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was making progress on his work when he heard a knock on his door. \"Come in!\" He called, hoping the person about to enter had a different topic to touch on other than his untimely and unconventional arrival. He stayed focused on his work but immediately knew who had walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are Joshua.\" His mother said using his real name, which she did every once in awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh immediately started to get nervous. \"Hey mom, home from work early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am. I just came to ask though,\" she took a seat on his bed. \"Are you doing okay? You didn't even greet me or either of your sisters when I heard you walk in, and Brianna said you were dripping wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing he was caught, he just decided to tell the truth. \"Yeah, I missed the bus and got caught in the rain.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, make sure to be faster so you can get to the bus next time. I don't want you walking out alone like that, especially in this type of water.\" She said with the overprotective mother in her kicking in. \"What about your umbrella? I thought I told you to take it to school before you left this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh couldn't think of an excuse, so he just told his mom most of the truth. He took a seat next to her explained how he had met the old woman at the bus stop and took sympathy for her and her situation, he stopped at giving her the umbrella though and made no mention of the power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, I'm proud of you for that.\" Kim praised her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Your not mad?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I be mad?\" She questioned. \"Those are the type of kind deeds and respect that I try to instill in you kids.\" She continued, giving her son a light pat on the back. \"Sadly, you do a better job than the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, what's wrong?\" Josh asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sisters have been talking back more lately. Courtney had an attitude because I refused to drive her and her friends to the mall. Then Bri got angry because I wanted her to start some of her homework since she has a game each of the two days this weekend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That stinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's part of being a mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I wouldn't trade it for the world. Although I could use a day or two off.\" She said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me mom, I would gladly take your place if it meant you had some time off.\" He said. What happened next after that surprised Josh. A bright flash occupied his room for a very brief moment, which also left his mother with a very surprised look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" Josh said, as he was very confused himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as nothing appeared to be different, the mother and son duo decided to ignore it. That was, until another visitor entered the room. \"Mom, are you in here?\" Bri opened the door. \"There you are. Do you know where my soccer jersey is?\" She asked, but weirdly looking straight at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hanging up in the laundry room downstairs.\" Their mother answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Bri replied with a look of confusion. \"Thanks Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother didn't seem to like the fact that her daughter by her first name. \"Excuse me young lady, I am your mother. You should show me some respect and not call me that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? You're my big brother.\" She replied not understanding. \"Why are you acting so weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit it with the nonsense Brianna! I am your mother and you WILL show me some respect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the youngest in the family did next was surprising. She approached Josh and grabbed him tightly, almost as if he was being used as protection. \"What's Kim talking about mom? She questioned with a look of fear in her eye. \"I'm scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Was all Josh could let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Bri spoke up before her 'brother' could yell at her again. \"Are you okay mom?\" She inquired with her eyes on Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... could you give us a second?\" He asked Bri, finally making a realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" She replied before dashing out of the room and closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to explain Joshua?\" His mother asked with her arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There MIGHT have been a part I left out about my story earlier.\" He went on to explain this supposed power, that he was still having a hard time believing he actually had. \"I think when I said I would gladly take your place for a couple of days, we swapped places in the family tree. That means I'm the mother and you're the oldest son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impossible.\" Was all she could respond with. Kim had never been a big believer in magic, even during her younger years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a more logical explanation?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I guess that flash was enough proof anyway.\" She gave in, still with a chunk of denial hiding within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, should we swap back then? Josh proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually not yet.\" His mom said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" He asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I said I wanted a couple of days off. I meant it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't know how to be a mother!\" Her son argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider it a learning experience. You can see what it's like to go through what I do and we can learn more about your, well I guess my siblings and see them in a different light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's do it then.\" He agreed. \"But we'll swap back Sunday night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, see you around MOM!\" Kim said laughing before she left. Josh was actually kind of glad, he hadn't seen her so happy in a long time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was where the real mother in the family typically slept. \"Geez, what's wrong with you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he was now considered Bri's mother, he found it a bit disrespectful for Bri to talk to him like that. However it was his fault that her 'mom' was acting this way, so he held back from lashing out at her. \"I'm just not really into it today. I don't think Kim is either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so either, but she did apologize to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good.

Are you hungry?\" Bri nodded. \"Well, the best I can tell you is to grab a snack to hold you over. Whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever I want? Awesome!\" Bri said dashing out of the room, down the stairs, and into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what to do next, Josh decided to leave the room. He wasn't quite sure what to do next, maybe visit his new room or go downstairs. He was interrupted again before he could make a decision. \"Hey mom, can I talk to you for a minute?\" Courtney asked approaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... sure, what's the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I just wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier.

He thought maybe he go easy on her since he was a new mom after all. \"I'll think about it. But you're gonna have to back your word about your behavior.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thanks!\" She exclaimed. \"You won't have to pay, I have money from my allowance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh realized there was a clear problem with taking his 'daughter' and her friends to the mall. He decided his next move was to address it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked around the house and found Kim in her office on her computer . He knocked and opened the door where his mom was working. \"Hey there Josh! I discovered that even though I'm now considered a kid in the family, I still have my job. I guess you go to school too.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nice, but we've got a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Courtney came and apologized for her behavior and I told her I'd reconsider taking her and friends to the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But let me guess, you don't know how to drive.\" She finished his thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Do you think you can drive them for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she thought before getting a smirk on her face mid thought. \"I told you I was taking off the weekend, but I have a different solution.\" Josh waited without giving a verbal response. \"We should swap our skills.\" She suggested. \"You'll be able to drive, which could be fun for you. Plus, you'll gain important stuff you need to know for being a mother. Like cooking, since you're going to be the one making the food around here for the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I agree.\" He said, as there was a flash that consumed Kim's office. Josh found that he now knew how cook a family meal for four, make a perfect left turn with a car, and how to clean every inch of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think it worked. Because I suddenly know how to play those video games of yours.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, I'm gonna take Courtney now.\" He said walking out of the office. \"Wait.\" He said turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a drivers license. It's not legal for me to drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have mine.\" Kim offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't do any good. You're a completely different person.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean I'll swap mine to you so it becomes yours.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good idea. I'll take it.\" Once again, a flash consumed the office. Josh then after reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet. He opened it and found a card inside, which had his name and picture. It was his own driver's license! Even more surprising, as legit as it looked, it still read he was 15 years of age. <i>\"Good enough for me.\"</i> He thought, and tucked the wallet back into his pocket. \"Alright Courtney, lets go!\" He called as he opened up the door to the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But to his surprise, he did everything with ease as if he was a pro. He did have the driving skills of his mom, who had been driving for about 20 years for what it was worth. All he had to do that was different was drive along the roads to the Marshall's, as opposed to the normal walk along the sidewalk to visit Jenn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh pulled up to the house, Kira emerged from inside and made a break for the car. The rain had let up a bit since when Josh had his encounter with the elderly lady, but it still was coming down at a moderate rate. Courtney reached back and opened the door so her friend could sneak in as quick as possible. Once the door was completely shut, she dried herself off as best as possible before speaking up. \"Hi Mrs. Mitchell, how are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was thrown off guard because he was addressed by his last name and called 'Mrs.' instead of 'Mr.', but shook it off.

Hey Courts.\" She greeted her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Kira, did you bring some money?\" She asked before Kira nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh realized he had another problem: He had no idea where Courtney's other friends lived. He wanted to avoid embarrassment so he refrained from asking anybody in the car. He unexpectedly found that he actually knew how to get to each of the girls houses remaining on his list of who to pick up. The only explanation he could come up with was with his mom's driving skills came her knowledge of the roads around town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh picked up the rest Courtney's friends driving toward the mall. First he got Megan, then Christina, and finally Josie. Weirdly enough, they all greeted him as 'Mrs. Mitchell'. <i>\"I'm never gonna get used to that.\"</i> He thought. Everything seemed to be going to plan. He dropped all of the girls off, after they all thanked him and he headed back home. However, he hit a bump in the road on the way back. He heard a siren, which sounded like a police car. Like any experienced driver would, he looked in the rear mirror to see that he was being trailed and he realized he was supposed to pull over. He found a safe spot on the side of the road and brought the car to a complete stop. <i>\"Crap! This can't be good.\"</i> Josh thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of his thoughts of what could possibly happen, he wasn't prepared for the policeman to knock on the window. Josh didn't jump or anything though and rolled his window down as a reaction. \"Evening officer. Is there a problem?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"License and registration please.\" The stern officer said with out giving an answer. He was bald and looked about his mother's age and was holding a flashlight pointed toward Josh's eyes. Josh pulled out the license and handed to the officer thinking it was no use. After about 10 seconds he handed it back. \"Alright, you're free you go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's wrong?\" A shocked Josh replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am, I knew you looked a bit young to be driving but you have a verified license. You're doing nothing against the law.\" He replied, seeming not as tense as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, have a good night!\" Josh told him as he rolled his window back up. He was once again not expecting to be called 'ma'am', but knew there was nothing he could really do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing Josh wondered about was why he acted so calm when he was talking to the policeman. He realized it was possible that he had switched social skills with his mom as well. He was a bit more quiet and reserved than the rest of his family, who were generally outgoing. He remembered his father being like that. Kim told him that he took after him and his sisters took after her. Without his father he was sort of the oddball in the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this point, the rain had almost let up completely as Josh pulled out into the road and headed home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can drive like a pro!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him a wide smile. \"That's great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked away, Josh felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He opened it up to see it was from Jenn:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Hey, I was about to come over but I saw you dive by my house and pick up Kira. Guess you weren't able to hang out?</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just told her the truth:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Yeah I had to take Courtney, Kira and their friends to the mall. Sorry.</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got a reply almost instantly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>It's OK, I get it. Being a single teenage mother is TOUGH.</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, it's go to know I still have my friends.\"</i> Josh thought. As he walked into the kitchen, he found the two kids of the house that were still at home in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, we're kinda hungry.\" Bri said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we'll have dinner soon?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering he know had his mother's cooking skills, he gave them the answer they wanted. \"Sure, I'll get on it right now.\" It was Friday, so it was the day where the kids got to choose what would be made. \"So, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about lasagna?\" Kim suggested, knowing it was a favorite among the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mom, your lasagna is the best!\" Bri agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lasagna it is then.\" He said to the pleasure of the the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kim wasn't the best cook ever, she got the job done and could make almost anything. The real cook in the family was her husband, but she had to take on the role of 'everyday cook' after his death. The good thing was the fact that she got better the more and more she made food for the family. Now, Josh was the one taking over that role. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh got the appropriate tools needed, and opened his mother's cook book to the page on lasagna. The thing was, it was one of Kim's best dishes and never often had trouble remembering in her head. Josh found that he was making it with ease and closed the book halfway through. He found it fun to try out the new experience, and was growing to appreciate the new power the lady at the bus stop had given him. Within 45 minutes, he had successfully created three plates of lasagna, and some leftovers for Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids, dinner's ready!\" He called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one to enter was Kim, who took a seat where Josh normally did. \"Umm... that's where I sit mom.\" He lowered his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore, the mom sits there.\" She pointed to the head of the table. Josh was happy to oblige, thinking it would be fun to sit in the seat where all of the power was held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with four current members in the family, their table sat six. Both parents normally took the ends, while Courtney and Bri sat on one side, and Josh taking the other next to an empty chair for one extra guest. With the kids it could vary due to who had a friend. Since their dad died however, Kim proposed they removed the chair and let nobody else sit there to honor him. Since then, there was considered to be only one head of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Bri entered, everyone was seated and started eating. Not much happened during dinner. Playing his role of the mother, Josh asked Bri how her day of school went and how his 'son' did at work. Everyone had finished within 20 minutes. \"Wow mom, that was great!\" Bri exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As usual.\" Kim added, not wanting to lose credit. She then gave Josh a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, do you think Jenna can spend the night? She said she wants to ride with us to the soccer game tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine. But it's getting dark, so you and Kim should walk next door and bring her over.\" He said, and Bri ran off toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I have to go?\" Kim complained like a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're two 8 year olds walking alone in the dark.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's just nex..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts, I'm your mother an you'll do as I say!\" Josh said loudly, but not really in an intimidating way. He almost burst out laughing. He had always wanted to say something like that to a kid, or in this case his mother who was a kid for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... fine.\" She agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Kim, we don't want it to get too late!\" Bri called from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there in a minute.\" She then turned to Josh. \"That lasagna was really good hun. And you're getting really good at this mothering thing. We should do this swap more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. But technically it's your lasagna.\" He corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, we should do this more often. Maybe we can let this last a bit longer, perhaps into the coming week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure about that, school's ending soon and it's getting a bit hectic. Maybe once summer vacation starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll be back soon.\" She said before going to find Bri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they left, Josh was alone again. But he heard another buzz come from his phone. This time is was a text from Courtney:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>You don't have to pick us up mom, Mrs. Goching is getting us. Do you think I can spend the night at Chris's???</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't see any reason to say no, plus it would make it easier once morning came around for Bri's game. He tried to think of how his mom would type it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Sure thing hun, love you!</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney shot him one last quick text back:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Luv u 2!</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess motherhood isn't so hard after all.\" Josh thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They wanted to celebrate back at Jenna's house, so he drove them back while Courtney remained at Christina's. That left just him and his mom for the afternoon. The house looked quite messy to Josh, so he decided he would clean it up. Kim meanwhile tried to do some work in her office, but found it difficult to type on her computer since she had lost her typing speed to Josh in the skill swap. Finding it increasingly difficult to continue with her job, she got an idea and went looking for her 'mother'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was vacuuming in the TV room when Kim approached him. \"Hey mom! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're alone, you don't have to call me that.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it's fun! Whatcha doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cleaning the house.\" He replied. \"It looked messy and I know you do it a lot so I figured it was my job now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice. Anyway, do you remember last night when I said we should let this mother-son swap go on a bit longer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, and I said it wasn't a great idea.\" He commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. I think I might have a way around it though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well you said that school was a bit of a hassle right now. That was why you didn't want to go on past Sunday. But what if we swapped occupations? You could do my job and I could worry about school for you instead.\" She suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like fun, but the only problem is I have no clue how to do your job.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could swap schooling as well then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" He asked not fully understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Schooling is your education or training that you receive. If we swap it you would be qualified to do my job and I can match your averages in school.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long would we do this for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking maybe a week. We could swap back next Sunday as opposed to this coming Sunday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a good plan, I'll do it.\" Josh announced which triggered a flash within the house. \"I think it worked considering I know that Miss Marquez is Dr. Wright's first patient on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some here...\" Kim said. \"Wait a minute, how could you not turn in your World War I paper on time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I just left it on my desk.\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll get it in by Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of schoolwork, I believe you have some homework to take care of MISTER!\" Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I'll do it now.\" She said without putting up a fight. Josh was left alone and continued to mind his own business and clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He turned off the vacuum cleaner and looked over to the intruder. \u201cHave you finished your homework?\u201d, he asked her, enjoying the feeling to be the one who asks this question instead of the one this question was asked to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d, began his mother. \u201cAlmost. I have been thinking. We\u2019re alone right now, so why don\u2019t we swap some more stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh raised his eyebrow but allowed her to continue talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just thought that we might take this mother-son swap a bit further. When we have this opportunity, why shouldn\u2019t we take it? Also, I really appreciate that you give me something that I\u2019d basically consider a vacation\u201d, she continued and put up her hands to calm him down when she saw his face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can imagine that you may be uncomfortable swapping physical stuff with your mother. We can just stick to non-physical stuff, or however you want to call it, or only have that physical stuff swapped until we aren\u2019t alone anymore, and someone could see you. Not that they\u2019d notice anything, but you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh\u2019s face changed from disapproving to mildly interested while his mother talked. So far, they had only swapped motherhood, driver\u2019s license, skills and just recently jobs and schooling. The two have not had any swaps that change anything about their bodies. He had to admit, he was curious about those swaps, but his mom was also right: He was uncomfortable with those swaps. Even when no one would notice anything, he did not want to be seen like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but only if we swap back immediately when someone gets here\u201d, Josh said. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you already are the mom, I thought that you maybe want to swap clothes, so you dress like the part. Maybe you want to swap my breasts or my vagina\u201d, she explained calmly. If she was uncomfortable suggesting this to her son, now mother, then she did her best hiding it. \u201cOr maybe you want to swap friends. It would make it easier for me in school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh pondered what to do. He certainly was interested in swapping clothes with his mother, simply to find out how it feels. The same went for the body part swaps but he was not sure if he was ready for that. Lastly, the friend swap would really help his mother out the coming week, but Josh did not want to be friends with his mothers\u2019 friends, they were old, and he had no common interests with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last he decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

He also felt something around his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I guess with the wording we also swapped underwear\u201d, confirmed his mother his suspicion. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be for long, so let\u2019s keep it this way for now\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded dumb founded. He was not really expecting to also gain his mothers underwear and he did not like the feeling around his chest, but his mother seemed pleased and it was only temporarily. \u201cGood, now that this is finished, go back to your room and do your homework\u201d, commanded Josh and immediately turned the vacuum cleaner back on to end the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had to admit that cleaning while wearing a skirt was less of an ordeal than he had imagined. It helped him to stay cooler. The tights on the other hands made him feel to slippery on the floor. Josh guessed that his mother sat on his bed the whole time and therefore put off her shoes. He quickly walked over to what was now his room and grabbed a pair of black flats, then finished his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was surprised when he finished cleaning the house, how quickly he did it. He still had time before he even had to consider making dinner. He was still alone with his mother at home. \u201cNo reversing the swap while we\u2019re alone, eh?\u201d, he mumbled and sat down exhaustedly on the couch. He looked down at his v-neck which would show off his cleavage. If he had one.

Josh was horrified when he saw the trio at the door.  Josh knew he had to swap fast before answering.  But when he inspected his mother's room, she was no where to be found.  He called out, but she wasn't anywhere to be found.  He had no choice but to answer the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh opened the door.  He knew that no one would see anything out of place but there was still the lingering doubt that they would see him and know something was wrong.  That didn't happen.  Josh opened the door, Bri scampered past him into the house.  Jenna's mother explained about the appointment and left quickly.  It was all very much routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were gone, Josh looked for Kim again, but she couldn't be found.  She had obviously left the house without telling him.  Josh decided to phone her cell, she always carried it with her, just like everyone else did these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you,\" Josh said urgently.  \"Bri came home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought she was at Jenna's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was but Jenna had to see the dentist.  So she's here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she notice anything wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not.  But where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went to the Dunkin Donuts to get a coffee and a cruller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need your permission to leave the house, do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would have been nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I didn't expect anyone to be back so soon and I wanted to see it anyone noticed anything wrong with the way I was dressed.  I'm sorry, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had better get back here right now.  So we can switch back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, MOM.\" she said with a little sarcasm.  Then they cut the connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was mad at his mother for leaving him the way he was.  He was clearly wearing women's clothing.  She on the other hand was wearing just a t-shirt and jeans.  She could wear such things even if they hadn't swapped.  It made him angry.  He wanted to get back at his mother and he had a way.  If he swapped with Bri then when he swapped 'back' with his mother, she would think that she wore Bri's clothing.  She wouldn't notice a difference.  He would be back to normal and she would be wearing the clothing of an eight year old.  He would tell her after a while, so no harm done.  But it would be funny to put something over on mom.  Besides she deserved it.  She shouldn't have left.  But even if she did she should have told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh found Bri.  She was wearing a long tunic that came down to her mid-thigh.  It had a mouse carrying a bunch of balloon's design and flared skirt at the bottom.  Under the tunic she wore matching striped leggings.  What panties that she wore underneath Josh didn't know.  But it didn't matter anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bri,\" he said, \"wanna play dress-up with Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" the eight year old said delighted that her mother would play with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's swap clothing.  I'll wear what you are wearing and you can wear my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't fit into my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make them fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Everyone will be playing too.  They won't say you are wearing my clothes.  So don't tell anyone or it won't be any fun anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. so what do I do take off my clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just say, 'I wish I was wearing Mommy's clothes'\"  Bri did as she was told and when the flash cleared, Josh was in the little girl tunic and Bri was wearing her mother's top, skirt and pantyhose.  Everything was resized to fit.  Josh was in the cutsie apparel of his little sister now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" she said.  \"How did you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh left the room waiting for Kim to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After about 10 minutes of wearing his sisters tunic and constantly looking at the door waiting for his mother to return Josh heard the door open. His mother returned with a paper bag and a coffee cup, putting on your best worried face you approached your mum \"Kim can we swap back now i almost had a panic attack when they knocked on the door!\" your mum still quite nonchalant put her hand on your shoulder still being taller than you saying \"it's alright MOM, nobody noticed\" you were about to respond but she cut you off by saying \"i agree to swap clothes with you\" and with a flash of light the change was made. Your mother walked off in the tunic and leggings with the pattern on it like nothing ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding back laughter you simply call out \"now if you could finish your homework!\" your mum simply waved and walked back to your old room. As you were finishing up your housework Bri walked up to you looking giddy \"Kim didn't notice we swapped!\" you knelt down so that you were at eye level \"she didn't notice me wearing your skirt and you wearing my pants!\" Bri continued you poked her nose like your mother used to always do when Bri was excited and said \"I told you she wouldn't it's magic!\". Bri hugged you \"that's so cool my mummy's a witch!\". You looked around playing along before putting one of your fingers on your lips and said \"but you can't tell anyone it's a secret!\" Bri nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri begun following you around and after a while she whispered \"so what kind of magic can you do?\" Realizing that revealing yourself to a 8 year old may have been an unwise choice you decide you need to try and curb her curiosity \"i can't do much magic, the only magic i can do is swapping things between people like i did with our clothes\" Bri was very focused on listening \"so if i wanted to become the mommy for a while or if i could go to work instead of school i could?\" you simply replied with \"Yes\" Bri began jumping on the spot, \"can we try swapping something mummy?\"</span></div></div>",

Josh just nodded his head and there was a flash of light \"Did it work?\"  She asked, not entirely convinced that it did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Kim came in to the room and looked at Bri.  \"Hey mum I've finished my homework\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBri proudly answered back to her 'daughter'.  \"Good girl Kim\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim snickered a bit \"Jeez mum, you don't have to treat me like a kid\" this made you crack up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" Bri cheered, she quickly looked at you again.  \"Can we swap more?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh seemed to be enjoying this much more than he should and he simply replied.  \"Whatever you want.\"  Bri was silent for the first time in a while as she was thinking, then she went and got a piece of paper and a pen. Sitting down at the dinner table and begun writing a note. Josh sat down opposite her at the table and waited for her to finish. Once she was done she handed you the note and it read as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>THINGS I WANT TO SWAP WITH MUMMY!!!</b></i><br>\r\n-Schools (I noticed my homework and schoolbag are still in my room)<br>\r\n-Bodies (I want to look pretty like mummy)<br>\r\n-Cooking skill and work skill (so I can be the mummy better)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed a little realizing how excited she was 'to be the mommy' to which you simply said \"Okay sweetie.\"  Then a flash of white light appeared once again blinding the both of them for a moment and then it was gone.  Josh was still sitting where he was beforehand but he saw his own body looking back at him wearing their mother's clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay, It worked!\" Bri exclaimed with much excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it did.\"  Josh replied, but sat there in shock for a moment when he heard his sister's voice come out of his own mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go be the mummy now!\" Bri said excitedly as she walked off to the kitchen to get dinner started.</span></div></div>",

He was just trying to be kind and help somebody out, much like something his late Grandmother would do.  He never would have thought to be rewarded for it, even though it was imaginary.  He let out a drawn out sigh as he locked the door so that he could change out of his wet clothes in somewhat privacy.  Josh quickly changed his clothes as he heard his sisters walking down the hall way.  \"I'm glad I can at least lock my door.\"  He chuckled to himself as he threw the damp clothing into the hamper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, Josh sat down at his desk and opened up his biology textbook and started to look over his notes from the past week.  As he was starting to get more into the notes, he heard his door knob giggle.  \"Josh, are you in there?\"  Jenn's voice called out to him from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"  Josh replied back to him as he got up from his desk and made his way over to the door to unlock it to let his friend into his room.  Although they were boy and a girl, his Mom usually didn't mind if they were left alone together.  Since they were in 1st grade, Josh and Jenn had been living on the same street and inseparable as friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeze man, you weren't masturbating were you?\"  Jenn teased as she walked into his room and nudged his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\"  He said flabbergasted as he shook his head in disbelief.  \"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn couldn't help but laugh as she watched her friend stand there in disbelief.  \"Relax, I was just messing with you.  Wait...\"  She stood there for a moment as she looked at his clothes.  \"Did you change your clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got trapped in the rain and had to change out of my wet clothes.\"  He replied back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I thought you had an umbrella?\"  She asked as she put her back on his bed and started to get out her notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah I did but.\"  Josh answered back, but soon had his thoughts trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\"  Jen wondered as she looked at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed and told her what exactly happened.  The rainstorm, the old lady, and the gift that she bestowed to him.  \"And that's it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn stood there with a huge smile on her face.  \"So you're telling me that a mysterious old lady just gave you this gift?\"  Josh nodded his head as she asked her question.  \"I find that hard to believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh gave out a nervous laugh as he listened to his friend.  \"Yeah, I guess it is hard to digest.  Let's get to work.\"  He said as he motioned to his bed where the materials were laid out.  Even though he laughed it off, he couldn't help but wonder if it was true and he could swap out his traits with others.  \"But what if it was real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious.\"  Jenn chuckled as she took her seat opposite of Josh, who was nodding his head.  \"Well, I guess I would swap ________ with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback, Josh instinctively replied.  \"I accept.\"  Out of nowhere, a blinding light enveloped the room.</span></div></div>",

The second one was different though, as it was a picture of him with two of Jenn's friends at a school football game. He recognized the brunette on the left to be Tracy Moore, and the blonde girl on the right to be Maya Wright. Even though they weren't in the picture, Josh also knew two other close friends Jenn had were Morgan Stevens, and Veronica Huff.

This seemed to annoy her to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what is that?\"  Josh wondered as he tried to think about what exactly she meant by sex appeal.  He had heard it plenty on many of the television and reality shows, but never really took time to look at what it really meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing major.\"  Jenn fibbed as she played with her hair.  \"All it really means is that you would be more likely to have a girl sit by you on the subway.\"  She felt her heart starting to beat slightly faster at the thought of being seen as a strong man instead of a petite girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat there and thought about it for a moment and answered back.  \"Well, I guess it would be alright.\"  He decided as he was soon blinded by a sudden flash and knew that the swap had taken place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Josh!!\"  She exclaimed in great excitement as she knelt down and gave him a quick peck on the cheek.  Josh, no really expecting it, could only blush slightly as he stroked the cheek in admiration and disbelief.

That meant Jenn would have to ride the subway to get there. She hated those trips. There were always some kind of creep that would feel the need to bother her, trying to capture her interest. <i>\"Finally, maybe this trip will actually be worthwhile.\"</i> Jenn thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a five minute walk, Jenn was at the station. There were plenty of guys trying to get around at this point in the day, whether they were trying to get to a restaurant or home to their families. The crazy part for Jenn was she did not get one stare from any of them. When she boarded, Jenn normally took a seat in the back to avoid people. This time, she decided to test her new sex appeal and sit near a group of men. They didn't even acknowledge her! Also, she wasn't intimidated as much due to the fact that she was now much closer in height. After riding for a couple of minutes, she picked up the bread and took a ride back. Once again, Jenn wasn't bothered by one person. <i>\"I think I'm going to like this.\"</i> She thought excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she returned home, Jenn dropped the bread off on the table and headed upstairs. Kira was the only other one home at the moment. Jenn walked by her sister's room with the door open, where Kira was changing. Normally, Jenn and Kira were pretty comfortable leaving the door open because of the house being girls only between the sisters and their mother for a majority of the day. Jenn peeked in and knocked in the doorway. \"Hey little sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira's reaction was much different this time. Now with no clothes on, she immediately covered up. \"Jenn! What the heck?!?\" Jenn gave her a questionable look. Kira only continued to yell at her older sister. \"Don't look, you pervert!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Jenn figured out that her new sex appeal was what had caused this. She just apologized and left, heading back to her room to either study or read a book before her entire family was home for dinner.</span></div></div>",

When Josh first accepted the swap from Jenn, he didn't really have a chance to get a good look at everything and now was his chance to do so.  On the closet door, Josh had a mirror that was there when his family first moved into the house.  It was a full length mirror that one would find in a teenage girl's room.  He took a small stroll over to the mirror and noticed that he looked the same, but just 5 inches shorter than his original height.  He was certainly relieved to discover that he wasn't fat looking, only because he thought that he would keep his original weight and lose several inches to go down to Jenn's height.  His discovery was short lived however when he heard a faint knock on his door.  \"Mom told me to come and get you for dinner.\"  Courtney's voice called out to him.  \"What are you doing in there?\"  She asked as she started to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh quickly turned around afraid to see if his sister will find anything different about him.  \"Umm... Okay.\"  He replied as he started to make his way towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing in there?\"  Courtney wondered as they started to make their way to the dining room.  \"It's not like you to ogle yourself in the mirror.\"  She chuckled as she looked at her brother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was just checking something.\"  He replied back to her as they made their way down the stairs.

But this time it was all different, no matter how sexy she walked they seemed to ignore her.

Jenn smiled slightly as she hurriedly made her way over.  \"Hey can I ask you something?\"  She asked the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl sighed slightly as she turned over to Jenn.

But you and Bri lock all of the doors before we leave because mom isn't home yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Josh and his sister stepped outside to make their way over to the park, which would take at least 15 minutes to get there by walking. He thought Courtney was capable of going herself and keeping an eye on Bri, even if she was a bit irresponsible. If his mom's overprotective nature was added into the equation, and it equaled a trip to the park for him. Josh stashed his earphones in his pocket to listen to some music while his sisters were off doing other stuff. More importantly though, it was Josh's first time in the outside world since his swap with Jenn. Everything looked just a bit bigger to him, even his sisters. Even though were still shorter than him, he was closer to eye level with Courtney, and Bri didn't have to look as far up to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up guys!\" Bri yelled to her older siblings, as she had a tendency to run ahead sometimes due to excitement. This was one of those times. As a result, Josh and Courtney had to keep up with the youngest Mitchell. However, Josh noticed he had to work a little harder to stay along due to his shorter legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 10 minutes into the walk, the Mitchell siblings got closer to town, where it was much more busy. One of the places they passed was a construction site where they were building a new apartment complex. It seemed as the workers were wrapping up, when some catcalling started. Since there were a few others in the area, Josh thought nothing of it. They were probably hollering at some twenty something year old girl Josh saw walking on the sidewalk at the other side of the road. But, he could've sworn they were looking right at him and his sisters as they did it. Courtney was a bit short for her age and hadn't quite filled out yet to the point where the workers would be catcalling to her. There was no way they would do it to Bri either. His sisters didn't pay much attention, so he decided to follow suit. He couldn't help but think about what had just happened, he did recall those workers often saying the same things toward Jenn when they walked together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the park, Josh checked in with his sisters to make sure where they were going and he told them to stay within visible range. Just as Josh was about to sit down on a bench and put his earphones in, he felt something slap his butt. He turned around to see a dude that was probably at least 18 years old, and Josh figured out the guy slapped him with his hand! Josh was waiting for an apology, but was given a completely different result. \"Heya toots! What's your name?\" He questioned. At first, Josh froze and didn't know what to say. The guy stood about 6'2\" if Josh had to guess, his new 5 foot stature made feel incredibly small and vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy still stood there, smirking and waiting for a response. Josh finally built up the courage to say something. \"Screw off ya creep!\" He yelled a bit louder than he intended, but it proved a successful move, as the  Lots of people looked, but one peculiar thing Josh noticed was many women around him were giving simpathetic looks. Josh took a deep breath and ended up taking a seat. After a few minutes, a girl suddenly approached the bench and said something to Josh. \"I'm sorry?\" He said, removing his earphones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if I can sit with you.\" The girl said. Josh studied the girl, who was actually very pretty. She had dirty blonde hair, with a pair of cute blue eyes, and an impressive duo of breasts. Which were definitely bigger than Jenn's. \"It sucks when boys hit on us like that.\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" He asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean how boys think they can just walk all over us like that and get our approval.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was really confused now. He had no idea why that guy approached him earlier, or what this pretty girl was talking to him about earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like what you did though.\" She said. \"Hopefully that punk will never bother another girl again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not a girl, why was he hitting in me then?\" He finally responded, but still not understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your not a girl, but guys obviously see something in you. It's like you have the sex appeal of a girl.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Josh finally figured it out. The explanation to the recent events was simple: when he swapped his sex appeal for Jenn's, she was freeing herself of the constant harassment from men!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, I'm a girl and your a guy. But I feel like I'm hanging with another one of my girl friends, no offense.\" She continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Dylan, by the way.\" She said holding out her hand for Josh to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh.\" He responded, shaking her hand. \"Are you from around here? How come I've never seen you before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am, but I'm homeschooled.\" She said. \"I'm a sophomore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I go to the public high school here, and I'm a freshman.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were interrupted though by yet another guy, this one looked to be 15 or 16 years old. He sat on the other side of Josh on the bench and put his arm around him. \"Hey baby, are you from Tennessee? 'Cause your the only ten I see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away you jerk!\" Dylan suddenly said. \"How dare you bother my friend here with such a lame pickup line!\" The boy quickly scurried away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Thanks.\" Josh said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, none of us ever deserve to be put in a position like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh and Dylan continued to talk on the bench, he discovered that she had two younger brothers, and brought them to the park similar to how Josh did for his sisters. Along with being a grade above him, she was also older. She had turned 16 three months ago while Josh wouldn't be 16 for another five. Dylan gave Josh her phone number, and said they should keep in touch before Courtney and Bri returend and said they wanted to return home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that your girlfriend?\" Bri asked after Dylan left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't even think she attracted to me.\" He responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because only guys are attracted to you.\" Courtney said which caused both her and Bri to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as everyone knew about his new sexual appeal, similar to how nobody noticed his smaller height. He guessed his swaps could alter the way people thought to make them think swaps were normal. As a they started to walk home, Josh came up with a plan: get Jenn to give him his sexual appeal back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenn ponders her next move in silence, looking down at her hands folded neatly in her lap on your bed. The pattering of raindrops against your window being the only noise, and in that moment your heart thumps. She's really cute, even if you have to look up at her face when she's standing up... thanks to the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dazzling blue eyes flash with clarity. Raising a finger into the air, she declares, \"How about we swap our knowledge of Biology??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there on the bed next to her dumbfounded. \"Wha... What? Why would you want to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three reasons!\" She explains. \"First, that Biology test is next week and I know you haven't studied much. You might be good at math and English, but science really isn't your thing... no offense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dispute there...\" You chuckle nervously, rubbing the back of your head. Feeling tremendously grateful in having such a smart (albeit a bit too bookish) friend to tutor you in that subject. \"You're the top student in the class, while I'm struggling to get by with a 'C' average. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts!\" Jenn persists, tapping her next finger. \"Second, I wanna see if you can perform mental swaps. You said the gypsy gave you the ability to swap <i>anything </i>between people, right? If this type of swap is also possible, just think of the possibilities! And third, you're a really wonderful person for wanting to help others out without concern for yourself. Who else would give away their umbrella to an old lady in the middle of a rain storm? Please, let me help you by making this switch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn melts your heart with that face she does, causing you to blush and look away. She knows you can't resist. You clear your throat and reply, \"Well... okay then.... let's swap our knowledge of Biology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like before, a blinding brilliant flash engulfs the room. In the blink of an eye it is gone again. You gaze over to Jenn, who is staring at you equally confused. She straightens her silky black hair and stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work this time?\" She asks. \"I don't feel any different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out...\" You mutter, sifting through your desk for your Biology notes. Recovering your spiral-bound notebook, you flip through the pages mouth agape. \"Jenn, come here! This is incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiagrams. Tables. Bulleted facts. Boxes of definitions copied carefully and organized neatly on a thoroughly sticky-note applied, annotated Biology notebook. The notes being way better than you are used to making, yet they bear your own handwriting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, these are really good notes.\" Jenn remarks, leaning over and placing a hand on your shoulder to get a look. \"I feel like I should know some of this stuff... but... hmm. I guess the swap worked again! Pretty cool, huh!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool? This is unbelievable!\" You exclaim, Jennifer's knowledge trickling into your mind like a rapidly flowing river. Feeling silly that you didn't understand all these previously straightforward concepts before. Which can only mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this means you'll have to tutor me now!\" She smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do that another time... didn't you want to watch that movie?\" You recall your conversation earlier today. Setting aside the notes, you place the disc into your DVD player and turn on the TV. Two of your most valued possessions, having mowed more than a few lawns a couple years ago in order to afford them. It serving as a nice way to pass the time between you and Jennifer on rainy days like these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! What a surprise ending! Ha ha ah!\" Jenn laughs as the final credits roll. She adjusts the pillows stuffed against the bed boards, beside which you two were resting while watching the movie. She stretches her hands over her head and yawns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna stay for dinner?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks out the window, the light pole outside shimmering in a milky yellow beam against the rain, which is still smattering down in sheets. \"Sure, just let me text my Mom and let her know. Although, I wouldn't mind having a piece of that hunky beefcake lead actor! Did you see his muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, \"Yeah, so what?\" Feeling rather inadequate compared to that guy, seeing how infatuated she seems. \"Besides, that actress is much more to my liking anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn pushes against you playfully. \"Duh! All boys your age love <i>those </i>kind of women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" You retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know what I mean!\" She smirks, cupping her boobs in front of you. Seeing your face redden, she adds, \"Hah! Don't pretend like it's not true! Boys are perverts always thinking about sex. You can't help yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, take that back!\" You say, trying to avoid gazing too obviously at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what, pipsqueak?\" She giggles, holding you back with her longer arms. \"God, I love being taller for once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what they say, Jenn? The bigger they are, the harder they fall!\" You shout, pulling her by the arm and throwing her onto the bed. Causing her to erupt into a fit of giggles. Recovering quickly, she folds one leg over her thigh in a ladylike fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can have a lot of fun with these mental swaps.\" She concludes. \"But we don't even know the limitations... if there are any. Are these swaps permanent, or can we swap back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try trading back our height first.\" You suggest, which she agrees reluctantly. Another flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm back to being the pipsqueak.\" Jenn breaks the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay for girls to be short... I think it makes them a lot cuter anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins, \"Oh, so you think I'm a cutie, Joshie?\" Seeing your reaction, she guffaws, \"It is way too easy pressing your buttons! It's been that way since fifth grade after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do think you're cute...\" You admit. \"And who can deny how smart you are? And kind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer stops giggling and gets a more serious expression on her face. Looking at you intently for a moment, before flicking her hair and changing the subject and huffing. \"I would be a lot smarter if you didn't <i>steal </i>my knowledge of Biology from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that was a fair trade! Besides, you proposed it...\" Your voice trails off, following Jenn out of your bedroom into the kitchen. She says hello to Courtney, Bri, and Kim, your mom. Based on how often she comes over to your house, the others treat Jenn like family. Brianna adoring her like a second older sister, and Courtney admiring her more like a friend. The two of them being much more simpatico on teenage girl stuff that doesn't interest you very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place settings for everyone at the table. Before long, Mom takes a meat loaf out of the oven and sets it down next to some other fixings. Brianna talking about her soccer practice and Courtney about something one of her friends said to another friend at school today involving some other girl. Losing track of her story after the third-or-so friend... thinking instead about your mysterious and intriguing swap powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked at it for a brief second before shutting it again. \"Actually Josh, my mom is expecting me home soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want to spend the night?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't, my family is going to my grandparents house for the day. I need to pack some stuff because they live more than two hours away and I'm not getting back until Sunday morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. When will we next see each other, school on Monday?\" He questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess so.\" Josh heard his friend say as he prepared to walk her out, but she didn't move yet.\"Wait! Can we make one more swap before I go?\" Jenn suggested, much to Josh's surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... I'm not sure, don't you think what we swapped is enough already?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already gave your height back, the only other thing you have is my knowledge of Biology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, I think I'm good with that for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Josh, don't be a wimp.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, one swap. But not for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! How about he swap our genders?\" She requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's eyes widened with horror at the sound of this. \"No!\" He said a lot louder than he meant. \"I'm not swapping that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then can we at least swap genitals? I want to see what being a boy is like for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wasn't planning on giving in, but he didn't see any other way out. \"You're just trying to get out of having your period.\" He blurted out, trying to stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you accuse me of that!\" She caught off guard at first, but then she couldn't hold a smile back which turned to laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you actually were?\" Josh said in both surprise and anger. \"I just said that to stall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you guessed right, although I did want to see what being a guy was like for a day or two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh could tell that she was being serious. Suddenly, as if a light bulb had flashed on above his head, he thought of the perfect solution. \"I have an idea! How about we swap what gender others perceive us to be?\" He suggested. \"It's a win-win! You can see what being a guy is like, but I don't have to go under any physical changes to make that happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually kinda like that. I'll do it!\" Jenn replied, giving the smile that Josh found so cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't get to see that smile for much longer though, as the flash returned. Nothing was noticeably different at its departure, but Josh could tell the swap worked. He walked Jenn out, and to his surprise, she gave him long, tight hug before walking off! She didn't see her friend's cheeks turn a deep shade of red as she left however. When he walked back inside, he was greeted with the presence of his youngest sister Brianna, who gave him confirmation at his new gender (at least in the eyes of others).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis! Did your boyfriend leave?\" She cooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not my girlfriend.\" He said, not watching his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean she's not your girlfriend? He's a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinal realizing what he said wrong, Josh corrected himself. \"Right, he's not my boyfriend. Whoops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean you obviously like him, when will you admit to him you just like him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like Jenn.\" He said, continuing his denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh huh...\" She teased. \"Do you want to do something with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis actually made Josh excited. His sisters never wanted to do anything with him. He wondered why the sudden change. \"Sure Bri! What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't he give each other makeovers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew what that meant. His sister would be decorating him based off of her preferences, the last thing any male ever wants to do. \"Ehh... I'm not feelin' it. Any other ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not Joshie? It'll be fun! You need to embrace your girl side sometimes, even if you're a bigger tomboy than me.\" She pleaded while reminding him of the swap he made with Jenn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, ONE makeover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He returned a moment later saying that his Mom had said it was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn called her own mother and received the okay to stay at Josh's house and an admonition to \"Not do anything I wouldn't do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably study at least a little bit.\" Jenn said. \"After all I have to make up for the knowledge of biology I let you have.\" They studied for almost an hour with Josh easily answering any questions that Jenn had just as if he had always known the answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jenn gave up saying, \"I just don't get it. This is really frustrating. Maybe we should swap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was getting tired and not exactly thinking straight when he said, \"Do you want to swap knowledge of our own biology?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I agree.\" Jenn said not really paying attention to the exact wording Josh had used. Jenn looked back at the page of notes she had been studying, but it didn't seem any clearer than it had before. \"Why didn't that work?\" She asked turning to look at Josh. Suddenly she was distracted by a pulling sensation from her chest. She looked down and was shock to discover that she had breasts. She almost screamed at the shock, but managed to contain herself. She looked down at her crotch and realized that she also had a pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the matter?\" Josh asked seeing the scared expression on his best friends face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got Breasts! And a Pussy!\" Jenn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a girl, of course you do.\" Josh said wondering what was wrong with his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I'm a girl, but I've never had these before.\" Jenn said grabbing her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you have, you've always had both breasts and a pussy all your life just like I have.\" Josh said reaching up to grab breasts that he was sure he had. When his hands grabbed empty air, it was Josh's turn to be shocked. Where had his breasts gone? And what was that bulge in his sweat pants? \"Where are my breasts?\" Josh practically screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What breasts? You've never had breasts, you're a boy.\" Jenn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I'm a boy but...\" Josh trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what happened.\" Jenn said finally calming down. \"You are such an idiot sometime.\" The last she said in a teasing way without malice. \"Your stupid phrasing didn't swap our knowledge of biology, it swapped what we knew about our own body's biology. I currently have what was your knowledge of what it's like to have a male body and you got what was my knowledge of what it's like to have a female body. Our bodies haven't changed, we just don't remember what it's like to have them be the way they've always been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really confused but you sound like you know what you are talking about.

Can you come in here please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what the problem could be Josh crossed the hall and entered the bathroom. Jenn had her pants and underwear pulled down below her knees and was sitting on the toilet with her legs spread wide. She looked up as Josh walked in not even bothering to cover herself. \"Close the door.\" She said. He did as she asked. \"How do you make this thing work? I've been sitting her for a minute and nothing is happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you make it work? I don't know, you just kind of do it I guess. I never really thought about it before. Try relaxing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn squirmed a bit on the toilet, a look of concentration on her face. Then suddenly there was the sound of splashing and a relieved look crossed Jenn's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done she stood up saying \"Man, that was harder than I thought it would be.\" She started to flush when Josh cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't wipe.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you pee, you have to wipe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right! I forgot that part.\" Jenn said grabbing some toilet paper and putting it to its intended purpose. When Jenn looked up she saw that Josh was staring at her groin. She knew she should be embarrassed, but for some reason she wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know.\" Josh's eyes quickly darted back to Jenn's face as she continued, \"There are actually two ways that we can fix our current problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What are those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could just swap back our body knowledge.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the flash of light was gone, Josh brought his hands up to rub his eyes, intending to aid them from the bright light. He had to clear a few stray hairs before he could do that though. Stray hairs? Josh never had hair long enough where it would come down to his face. He also a bunch of hairs brushing his neck and even some touching his shirt farther down his back. Along with that, there was some sitting behind his ears too. When his eyes finally readjusted, he opened his eyes. Josh saw even more stray hairs blocking his vision, and they were black just like Jenn's hair! To top it all off, when he finally cleared his vision he looked over at Jenn and saw that she had short, brown hair that was cut shorter, just like how Josh's was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Jenn said. \"It actually worked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kinda surprised too.\" Josh said, still in shock that he now had hair at a length he would never even think of keeping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda surprised?\" Jenn questioned. \"We have each other's hair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go see this in the mirror.\" Josh said, signaling for her to follow him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josh walked, he could feel his hair swaying back and forth, which threw him off at first since his hair was short enough before where it wouldn't move at all. They went over to the door where his bathroom was connected to his room. Sure enough, when Josh looked and saw a reflection of himself but with much longer, darker hair. Meanwhile, Jenn now had shorter, darker hair that hardly moved at all. She didn't look as unusual as Josh though because some girls choose to keep their hair shorter. Josh thought of Courtney's friend Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look ridiculous!\" Jenn said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Replied Josh in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that Josh noticed was he was very cold. He had to fold his arms up to his chest just to keep warm. At first he couldn't figure out why, but then he realized it was because he now had almost no body hair! Jenn now had his body hair, as he could see by looking at her arms. He couldn't be for sure because he just shaved before school in the morning, but if she kept his hair for a couple for days (which he hoped she didn't), then she would probably be growing facial hair too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of silence, Jenn noticed her friend was still uncomfortable with her hair, so she decided to pipe up. \"Looks like someone's uncomfortable with their new hair.\" She said teasingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" Josh said as he struggled to keep his hair out of his face and behind his head. \"Can't we just swap back now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. I want to see what people think.\" She told him, as they walked out of the bathroom. Then she thought of something to help her friend. \"I have an idea. Why don't you put your hair back in a ponytail?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could. But I don't have anything to use!\" He complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't Bri usually have her hair back like that? Maybe she has some hair ties.\" Jenn reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Maybe I can go take one out of her room.\" Josh told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them walked over to the room that Bri and Courtney shared and looked throughout for something to help Josh with his feminine problem. After a couple minutes of searching, the light flipped on. Josh and Jenn froze as they turned to see the youngest Mitchell sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two things...\" Bri said. \"One. Hey Jenn! And two, what're you guys doing in my room?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh and his friend looked at each other, surprised that Bri had said nothing about their hair. Josh decided to test it further. \"Oh, I was hoping I could borrow one of your hair ties for MY HAIR.\" He said, emphasizing on the last two words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just use some of your own.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My own?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah stupid! You have some of your own, you don't need to use mine.\" Bri said laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Jenn looked at each other with shocked expressions. \"Okay then...\" Jenn said. \"It was Josh's idea anyway.\" she said joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it was.\" Said Josh's sister. \"Why would you need hair ties Jenn?\" She said giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn followed Josh out of the room, after saying her goodbyes with Bri. She then caught up with Josh with an excited look on her face. \"Do you know this means Josh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He asked, not knowing where she was going with her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You swaps can alter reality! Bri was oblivious to the fact our hair was swapped and apparently you have your own hair ties. I still can't believe you have this power. It's so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's pretty cool.\" Josh said in agreement, still trying to keep his out of control hair behind his head. \"Can we swap back now? Now you know what others think of your hair.\" He hoped that reasoning with her words earlier would get him his hair back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should we? Nobody notices that we look different. I'd like to stay like this for a couple of days and see what having shorter hair is like.\" She told him. \"How about for the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's eyes widened, realizing he could get his hair back without her permission. \"Please Jenn? No offense, but I don't want to be stuck with girl hair for much longer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Josh! You were the one who wanted to test this in the first place...\" She said giving him puppy dog eyes that Josh found to be really cute, even though Bri's were second to none. Realizing that she was right about him wanting to try the power out, he remained silent as there was no way out of keeping her hair. \"I promise we'll swap back soon.\" She added trying to convince him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh finally gave in. \"Okay fine! But only for the weekend. I want it back on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Thanks!\" Jenn said wrapping Josh into a tight hug, Josh was kinda thrown off by her hug but he embraced her anyway. \"Now let's go find those hair ties!\" She said after breaking the hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of searching they couldn't find anything. Finally Josh got a clue. \"Maybe they're in the bathroom.\" He walked back to where he originally saw his new look for the first time. He looked around and as Jenn walked in, he realized something. \"Maybe they're in the cabinet where I keep my hair gel.\" He didn't use gel often, which is what caused him to take so long to remember that. He opened the cabinet and saw that his hair gel was no longer there, but there were a few hair ties. \"Finally! I found them.\" He told his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't use any hair gel?\" Jen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not normally, but I usually keep some up here. It's not in here though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must have it now!\" She guessed, the explaining her idea to Josh. \"Think about it, he must have switched not only our hair but the products we use in our hair too.\" Her suspicions were confirmed when she looked in Josh's shower to see her shampoo and conditioners in his shower. \"Yep!\" She confirmed to Josh, holding a bottle up. \"This is my shampoo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, can you do this for me?\" Josh said, handing her a red hair tie, which was his favorite color. After a few seconds, Jenn had successfully put Josh's hair back in a ponytail. \"Finally! No more crazy hair.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing.\" Josh's friend told him. \"Do you think you can swap our knowledge of how to take care of our hair so we can do stuff like that without any help?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so, it will make both of our lives easier. I accept.\" Josh said as the same flash of light as the first time followed, his filled with information on how to take care of girls hair. Specifically Jenn's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they both returned to his room, they continued to study. After about an hour, they were finished.<br>\r\nJenn looked over to Josh's digital clock, which read 5:45 PM. \"I don't have to be home for dinner until 6:30.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. You can stay and have dinner with us if you'd like to. I'm sure my mom won't mind.\" Josh said, being polite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might call my mom in a bit. I'll decide then.\" She told Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do now?\" Josh asked her since she was the guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we swap some more things around?\" She asked Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks.\" He said. \"I'm done for the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Josh?\" Having this power is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Let's take advantage!\" Jenn said reasoning to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine! What do you want to swap now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this?\" She said, preparing her pitch. \"Let's swap our _______\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't want to have to try to figure out things like which locker room I have to use at school if we are swapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably the boys locker room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. You can have my penis.\" Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it.\" Jenn said before he could change his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a similar flash of light as the one that had happened when they swapped their hair. When it was gone Josh looked over at Jenn and saw the outline of a semi-erect penis pressing out against the stretchy fabric of her leggings. When Jenn looked down and saw it, it became even harder. She squirmed a bit, obviously uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't our clothes change to?\" Jenn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Josh said standing up and opening his underwear drawer. It was full of panties as he'd expected it might be. \"Maybe it doesn't affect the cloths that we are wearing when we swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well these pants are too tight. Can I borrow a pair of sweatpants from you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Josh said handing her a pair that he pulled from his dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Jenn said and started to head to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn turned back to look questioningly at Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can change in here. After all you don't have anything I haven't seen before.\" Josh said nodding toward her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn thought about that. She supposed that was true now that they had swapped, though honestly he'd seen what she had before in 3rd grade when they had played 'Doctor' once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking up her mind Jenn set the sweatpants down on the end of the bed, turned her back to Josh, hooked her thumbs in the waist of the pants she was wearing, wiggled her butt at him and pulled her pants and underwear off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was definitely shocked, and honestly fairly aroused at the display. He felt a slight tension in his pants where before he knew that he'd have been  pitching a major tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with her back still to Josh he could see that she was reaching down and playing with her new penis a bit. He was totally shocked though when she started laughing uncontrollably. Finally she turned around and Josh could see her erection pointed straight at him. But something didn't look quite right but he couldn't figure out what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at him Jenn reached down and lifted her penis up. Suddenly Josh realised what was wrong. She didn't have his balls! Instead she still hd her labia and, he assumed, her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly afraid of what that probably meant for him Josh dropped his pants and underwear in near record time. Beneath his pubic hair, which was now darker and finer than he was used to thanks to the first swap he'd made with Jenn that day, he saw his balls hanging there. For a second he thought that he didn't have anything at all above them but running his hand through his new pubic hair he quickly discovered a very sensitive little bump which he guessed used to be Jenn's clit and was now his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to fix this.\" Josh said.</span></div></div>",

With that, another flash came in. Josh was relieved to now have Jenn's labia and vagina, which was something he didn't want about five minutes ago. On the other hand, Jenn, now missing her female reproductive system, had a pair of testicles to complement her penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Josh showed his appreciation for Jenn helping him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!

Plus, I'm tired of carrying these breasts around, and you already have my bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I agree to swap chests with you.\" Yet another flash came, which gave Josh two B-cup mounds on his chest, which sat under his new black bra, which matched his new black panties, where his new genitalia rested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it?\" He asked, praying that the end was at least near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep that's it... for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Josh said while laying down on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to watch that movie you were talking about?\" She requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good!\" Josh said while twirling his ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wanted to lay down one rule before the swap however. \"Alright, fine! But only if we swap back before Monday. I repeat, BEFORE Monday. I have gym and I'm not going into the boys locker room like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me.\" She agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree to swap sexualities with you then.\" Josh said. There was another flash, but unlike the one with hair, nothing was physically noticeable immediately after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn assumed it worked though, and squealed with delight. \"Thanks Joshie!\" She said, giving him a hug. If the swap did actually occur though, the hug would probably have meant nothing, Jenn only saw him as a friend. Given the slight crush Josh had on her, the hug probably would have given him a hard-on, but his dick never grew like he expected. It was safe to say the swap had worked. This was a time where the swap could benefit Josh, as he didn't have a hard dick pressing on Jenn when they were against one another. \"Shall we get back to studying?\" She asked, snapping him out of his thoughts. He nodded, knocking his ponytail back over his shoulder, as he looked town at his textbook, to resume their study session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two hair and sexuality swapped friends were finished with their studying a good forty-five minutes later, they tried to figure out what to do next. \"What do you want to do now?\" Josh asked his friend, twirling his ponytail back behind his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, it's up to you.\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to watch that movie I told you about at school?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" She agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both walked out the door, but before they reached the stairs Josh remembered something. He left his dirty clothes in his room, but his mom told him to bring it down when he came home from school in the morning. He told Jenn to head down without him and wait in the TV room. After she went Josh went back to his room and gathered his clothes, which were already in a laundry hamper. As he was carrying it back toward the stairs, he glanced at the room his two sisters shared. Nobody was inside, but the door was wide open. He could see a poster next to Courtney's bed on her side of the room with a picture of a shirtless Zac Efron. He stared at his six pack and then looked down and saw a tent coming from his pants in the genital area. <i>\"Gross! I'm actually attracted to that?\"</i> Josh thought disgusted. <i>\"I can't wait to swap back.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think any longer, he heard Jenn from downstairs. \"Josh! Are you coming or what?\" Snapping out of his trance, he picked up the hamper and proceeded down the stairs to watch the movie with his new lesbian friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His penis became very hard to the point were it was forming an obvious tent in his pants. Knowing that it was the male he was attracted to, he became embarrassed and attempted to cover it with a pillow next to him. Unfortunately, this gave it away as Jenn was easily able to spot it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well, looks like someone has the hots for a guy over here.\" Jenn teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just gave his friend a look. <i>\"This is so embarrassing.\"</i> He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you do you.

Josh found it adorable. \"Okay, deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do it then, but we're trading everything back first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two teens swapped everything back to normal, Josh was the first to speak up. \"Feels good to have short hair again, now what's your swap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" She asked as if they were preparing to race somewhere. \"I want to swap our bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no no. No way!\" Josh argued. \"I just got this power a few hours ago. I'm not ready to be a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you'd do my swap if we switched back to normal, this is my swap.\" Jenn stated, making her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she was right, Josh just decided to give in. At least he would be in his crush's body and not in the body of his mom or one of his sisters. \"Alright, I agree to swap bodies with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the third time in about as many minutes, a flash filled the room. When it left, Josh felt very different. He had long hair again, but it was still in a ponytail and didn't bother him that much. Now though, everything looked bigger to him, as he shrunk 5 inches, he looked down to see that he had a pair of B-cup breasts, and he reached down to his pants and felt an emptiness in his crotch. His shoulders were not as broad, but his hips wer pe much wider. To top it off, he now had small, petite feet to go with small hands. His toenails were painted pink to match his fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn was basically the opposite, with short hair (once again), everything looked smaller due to growing five inches, her feet were much bigger, her shoulders now had some broadness to them, but her hips did not. She immediately got an erection that formed a tent similar to when Josh saw the male actor during the movie, Jenn looked down and noticed it due to her flat chest. \"Whoops!\" Jenn exclaimed, trying to cover the erection. When she spoke though, her voice was now deep enough to match Josh's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, your voice sounds like mine!\" Josh said, only to cover his mouth because his voice matched Jenn's. Jenn let out feminine giggle in wake of this, which sounded awfully weird with a male voice. He realized that Jenn had outsmarted him, as he got her long hair returned to him in a matter of minutes. \"You got me here didn't you?\" He asked while lifting up his ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" She said, lowing her voice even deeper to normal to test it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, the two had kept their own clothes, but they were resized to fit their new bodies. Josh tugged on his shirt, which was now a bit snug with Jenn's breasts. When he did this, he felt an unusual wave of pleasure. \"So, how long are we going to stay like this?\" He asked, still not used to his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a couple of days to start, and we'll take it from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To start?\" Josh let out a whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, to start. This could be a good learning experience. I mean, who else could have an opportunity like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right.\" Josh looked over to the full-length mirror that was in his room before they moved in, he was not surprised to see the cute body of the girl he liked. However, he was surprised to see that he was the one controlling it. <i>\"This is gonna take some getting used to.\"</i> He thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh ended up not making a swap for the rest of that Friday afternoon. His night was pretty uneventful after Friday night, as he played video games until dinner time. He then continued to play video games up until bedtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around 11 o'clock during the Saturday morning that followed when Josh got a buzz on his cell phone. Turning it on, he saw that he had received a text from his friend Steven. \"Hey bro, me and Tyler are gonna be at the pool around 1. You in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as his past 10 hours or so were just playing video games or sleeping, Josh was quick to oblige. \"I'd, like to, but at the country club?\" He responded, knowing he and his family lacked a required membership to get in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know you're not a member but I can have you as a guest.\" Was his friend's answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK thanks.\" Josh sent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it.\" Was the last text from Steven. Josh wished he could belong to the country club, but with the death of his father years back, his family now had on,y once source of income. So being able to afford it was near impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he had a couple of hours until he needed to be there, Josh continued to play his games. However, as he thought about the upcoming get together he had scheduled with his friends, his thoughts drifted off to them being shirtless. The next thing he knew, he looked down to see he had a hard on pitching a tent in his shorts. \"Gross!!! Not again!\" He yelled a bit louder than he intended to. Luckily for him nobody else was home as his mom took Bri to her soccer game, and Courtney went shopping with one of her friends. Josh remembered her saying it was Christina she went with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim returned around noon after Bri decided to go over to Jenna's house for awhile. And Josh took a shower to get ready, and then packed a drawstring bag to take to the pool with him. He asked his mom if she could drop him off at the club. Kim agreed without hesitation, as she was aware that her son lacked a good amount of close friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh got to the club, he met Steven outside. His friend checked him in as a guest, and Josh was already in his suit so they got right into swimming. Nothing eventful happened while swimming, except for the fact that Josh got frequent hard-ons when he was next to his friends when out of water. He made sure to wide as best he could and was successful for the most part. Nothing happened until he got changed in the changing room after. Josh made sure that his friends left before he appeared from a stall. However, when Tyler walked back in. \"Where could my phone be?\" He asked. He then found it a couple of feet in front of Josh on the bench. Without thinking Josh picked it up and handed it to him, revealing his boner. \"Thank... whoa,\" Tyler said, noticing his friends erection. \"Dude are you...\" He started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" He (sort of) lied, trying to sound as confident as possible. For what it was worth, he was only homosexual at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see, thinking of that girl you like.\" Tyler said smiling. \"Jenny, was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenn.\" He corrected. \"And no, I don't like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say bro.\" He said before leaving the room, and leaving Josh alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm almost at the end of this chapter.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh waited for a few minutes before he got the call from Jenn a bit earlier than expected. \"Hey, we need to talk.\" He said immediately after picking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't, something is wrong I'm guessing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to swap back.\" He announced. \"It's nothing about being a homophobe, it's just too weird and I'm freaked out a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" She asked, wanting to know if he was telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh explained the moment in the bathroom, and how he was trying to hide his erections around the guys the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, we've got to swap back.\" He begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if I can get another swap in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name your price.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure yet.

There was no flash like before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait hold on, I agree too.\" She remarked, but still nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought maybe I didn't formally agree like you did, but it seems that wasn't the case. I guess we're stuck.\" She said, not sounding disappointed when she added the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, no no no. We cannot be stuck like this.\" Josh panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what else to tell you.\" She said. \"Maybe the power wore off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be. There's got to be a another way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's your power, not mine. You figure it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Josh got an idea, as if the imaginary lightbulb appeared above his head. \"Hold on, there's one thing we had in common when we mad the first few swaps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were in the same room!\" He explained. \"We've gotta met up somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you have to come to my place, Kira's gonna be home soon and my parents don't like it when she's home alone. Plus, I don't feel like walking all the way to your house just to swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll be over in 10.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time a ride from his mom was unnecessary, as he made the walk to Jenn's house. When he got there, he knocked on the door. His friend answered, as nobody else was home yet. She then led him up to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you ready to try it?\" Jenn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I'm ready to be straight again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Jenn said, although only for the purpose of initiating the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's theory was confirmed to be correct, as the light filled up Jenn's room. Josh was relieved to see the swap back had finally worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Thanks a bunch Jenn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome, as much as I liked that swap I felt bad seeing you so uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now I'm gonna make it up to you like we agreed.

Come on, it'll be fun!\" Jenn encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it gonna be fun?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it not gonna be fun. We can experience what it's like to have a body of the other gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right...\" Josh commented, starting to see the positive effects her proposed swap could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, it's not like we're swapping our entire bodies. You'll still get to keep your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll do it for a few days.\" He gave in. The flash filled Jenn's room once again, and it left as quickly as it started. Josh know possessed the body of a teenage girl to go with his own head, and vice versa in terms of Jenn. Josh had certainly dropped in height, he was definitely close to Jenn's former height. Likely a bit taller than his friend's signature height of 5 feet, due to the fact that his head was a little bigger. He looked down and saw that a pair of B cup breasts sticking out of his chest. He raised a small, manicured hand and started to poke at the breasts. He then lowered his hand to his crotch area, where there was a lack of one. He felt a finger skim over his vagina, and we felt a sensation he had never felt before. It actually felt quite nice. Not used to the feeling, he couldn't help but let out a quiet moan. He looked up to see Jenn giving him a curious look, because she witnessed his entire 'tour' of his new body. \"Oops, sorry.\" He apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, it's your body now. You get to use it the way you want. All I ask is you give me the same freedom with yours.\" Jenn said, now looking down at her friend due to her now having his height, maybe a bit shorter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than the feeling of his new body, something felt off for Josh, he looked down at his arms, legs, and even is tiny feet and noticed that they were covered in his original body hair. He liked having body hair, but for some reason it felt weird on a female body. \"Jenn, I got my body hair back in the swap. Do you want to swap our hair so you can have it for your male body?\" He asked, holding up his long black ponytail in one of his new smaller hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not, sure.\" She said, and the light consumed her room once again. This time Jenn had her dark locks returned to her, which now descended down her back as opposed to being in a ponytail like Josh had it. She also now had her friend's body hair, which accompanied her male body nicely. Josh meanwhile, now felt colder, as he lost his body hair again, but it felt better with his female body than it did with his male one. His short, cropped hairstyle was back, and he had his small amount of facial hair under his chin and above his upper lip again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well I guess we're done with swapping for now. But you don't have to leave Josh, feel free to stay through dinner time.\" Jenn told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? That sounds nice, I think I might.\" He replied.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenn decided it would be fun if she and her friend went down to the basement where she had a flat screen TV and watched some shows together. Josh let her pick the show, he was too distracted by his female body to watch anyway. She picked some girly drama show that he lacked interest in, which was for the better as her focus would be on the screen instead of him. Jenn was sitting on a beanbag as opposed to the couch behind it, which left Josh to have some fun to himself without being in her sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenn focused on the show, he quietly put a hand up his shirt from the bottom up and started to fondle with one of his breasts. They were a bit sensitive, but felt nice nonetheless. He had to be careful not to make too much noise though. Eventually, Josh got tired of just sitting there and excused himself to the bathroom. He had been to his friend's house enough times to find it on his own. When he got to the bathroom, he immediately stripped his sweatpants and boxers (which he was still wearing on Jenn's body) off, and he took a seat on the toilet and ran a finger against his clit. Eventually he thrusted it inside his new vagina. He felt numerous waves of pleasure take inventory throughout his body as he went. He noticed it was taking much longer to ejaculate with a female body, so he slipped another finger in and felt even more pleasure. Finally, Josh was able to reach his first female orgasm. It definitely felt different and longer, he personally liked the new experience. He put his clothes back on and headed back out to Jenn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're you masturbating in there?\" Jenn teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pshhh... what? No!\" He answered, but the lie was so obvious it gave her the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not interested in the show, Josh now took a look at his feet. He knew his shoe size probably changed similarly to the rest of her clothes, but it was unconfirmed because he took his shoes off at the front door. He figured at most in his male shoes they were at most a size 5 or 6. They were tiny compared to his old shoe size of 11.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Earth to Josh...\" was all that he heard, snapping back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I have a suggestion.\" Jenn announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we swap clothes. I mean, we both have the bodies for it. And I have to admit that these female clothes are a bit uncomfortable with a male body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took a minute to think about it. <i>I actually don't hate the idea.</i> He thought. Since he had Jenn's body, comfort would be no concern when it came to wearing her clothes. \"Sure.\" Was all Josh got out before the flash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I thought you'd put up more than a fight than that.\" She commented, while looking down at the male clothes she was currently sporting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh left his friend without a response, as he looked down at the clothes he was now wearing. This includes a black, long-sleeved shirt with a green skirt beneath and pink polka-dot socks at his feet. He stretched the color of his shirt to look under and see a white bra, and then did the same with his skirt to see a pair of white panties to match. His theory about comfort was right as while the clothes felt different, it was not necessarily discomforting. Right as Josh finished checking out his new clothes, Jenn's TV episode had wrapped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what should we do now?\" She asked.</span></div></div>",

I'm not sure I'm ready for something like that quite yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even know what I'm taking about when I say personality?\" She questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, but I'd rather not know.\" He said honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how can you say no to a swap if you don't know what the swap is?\" She pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine, tell me what it means and then I'll say no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means we will swap things such as interests, things we like to do, the way we act...\" Jenn tried to make her list longer but Josh cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I would have rather not known. I'm not making that swap.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be interested in things that a girl would be interested in.\" He explained, which angered his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what this is about? Don't be such a sexist Josh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that he offended her, Josh tried to find a way of calming her down. \"No that's not what I meant, I just meant that I am comfortable with my own interests, pleasures, and behaviors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not how you worded it.\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. You know I don't normally mean it when I say things like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you want me to help you study, you're going to have to make it up to me in return for what you said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do I have to do?\" Josh asked, although he had a feeling that she would say a certain something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do the swap, it won't have to be for long, just try it.\" She said with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wasn't sure if she actually wanted him to make it up to her as an apology, if if she manipulated him into doing the swap, but he couldn't stand to have Jenn act like this toward him. \"Fair enough, I agree to swap personalities with you.\" Which was followed by a familiar flash of light, but this time, after he regained his vision, Josh didn't know anything physically different about him or his friend. It didn't occur to him that the swap he agreed to was exclusively mental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" Jenn asked while scratching an itch on her inner thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure. I guess not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come the hair swap worked but not the second swap?\" She asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then realized that there was nothing that could be physically swapped and tried to explain his thoughts to his friend. \"I guess my power is limited to physical attributes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we continue studying then?\" Josh proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean if you want to, but there's other options too, like that movie you wanted to watch. The test isn't until Wednesday, correct?\" Jenn pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wondered what was up with his friend all of the sudden, first she comes over to study on a Friday afternoon and then one time where he wants to study she changes her mind? \"Come on let's just do it now Jenn. The sooner we get it done the better. We'll be more prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Jenn finally agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of studying, Josh took a glance over at his friend, and couldn't help but admire her outfit. Her black top was very contrasting to her white mini skirt, and her white sneakers looked nice too. He then started to question what even made him think that. Then it hit him: Him and Jenn's personalities actually were swapped! It was possible that the swap was more subtle due to the fact that it changed his thinking without any obvious clues. \"Hey girl, I think our personalities are actually swapped.\" He didn't know what made him say 'girl' like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? I thought you said you couldn't swap mental attributes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I noticed your outfit, and couldn't help but think how cute it was!\" He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Jenn said, completely ignoring the compliment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When would I normally think that? He explained. \"Here I have an idea.\" Josh thought of a question that he would know the answer his normal personality would give. \"Here's a question, if you were alone in my house right now, what would you do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably play some video games.\" She instinctively replied. Josh then gave her a 'see, I told you so' look. \"Ohhhhhhh...\" Jenn said, finally realizing Josh's point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, now I don't feel like playing video games now, but you do.\" He said, gesturing to his PlayStation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... There's nothing there.\" Jenn pointed out. Josh turned to look and see that his console was gone, he wasn't really bothered by it though for some reason. \"Wait, maybe it's at my house now!\" Jenn realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Josh questioned having no idea where his friend was going with her idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it, when I got your hair you got my hair ties and I got your hair gel. So, because we swapped personalities, I'm now interested in video games and your not. Now I have your PlayStation instead of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made sense to Josh. \"Okay, that's kind of cool. Should we go back to studying now?\" He asked, trying to stay on topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Jenn said, even though it was obvious she didn't want to. \"Can we watch that movie after though?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Josh said before he adjusted his long black ponytail and the two got back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although, he was kind of fascinated by the swap and wanted to see how it played out. He convinced himself that it was Jenn's personality doing the talking however, as she had been saying the same thing before the original swap. Once the movie wrapped up, he made swapping back his priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That movie was better than I thought it would be.\" Jenn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's just my personality saying that.\" Josh told her. He had seen the movie once already and liked it, but this time around he did not find it as enjoyable. \"I think you now have my taste in movies and other things like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's pretty cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of our personalities, can we swap them back now?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I want to yet, I like having someone else's personality. It's like having a different perspective on life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was afraid his friend would say something like that. Luckily for him, he had planned on it and was willing to up the offer. \"I'll tell you what, you give me my personality back and I'll let you make another swap of your choice.\" Josh did not feel like he was losing anything in this deal (at least at the moment) since Jenn's personality was interested in his power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the opposite side for Jenn, her new personality was making the idea of another swap seem not so pleasant. Josh could see it in her face once he made the proposal. He was just hoping she knew the effects that his personality had on her the same way her personality had on him. If he was lucky, she would want to swap in realization of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it.\" Jenn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take all of the time you need.\" Josh replied, with his friend's patience kicking in.</span></div></div>",

Since when do you want to have a dick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't.\" Jenn replied, \"at least not forever. I'm just curious, aren't you?

Until Jenn decided she wanted to her vagina back, he was stuck with all the pros and cons that came with having female genitals-- pros and cons that he never once thought in his life he would be experiencing first hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the reaction on Josh's face Jenn let out a laugh as she said while walking out the door, \"Well I've better get heading home now, I've got so many things I want to experience and I imagine that you can't <i>wait</i> to have some alone time with your new parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sat in shock as he watched her exit his bedroom, taking his manhood with her and sealing his fate for the foreseeable future. </span></div></div>",

Once home she headed straight to her room since she didn't want anyone to distract her before she had a chance to fully study the most recent, and weirdest, change to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her door and wish, not for the first time, that she had a lock on it. She'd asked her parents if she could get one but they wouldn't let her saying that there was no reason that she would ever need one since nobody in their family kept secrets from one another. But now she had a secret she didn't want to share with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe settled for wedging one of her shoes under the door and hoping it would at least slow down somebody trying to enter her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her door as secure as it was going to get she quickly stripped naked and examined her body in the full length mirror on her closet door. Everything about her body looked normal except for the penis she had recently acquired. Looking at it she saw that it was getting hard. She reached down, wrapped her hand around it and began to slowly stroke it back and forth. It felt really good. She tried stroking it faster and holding it a little tighter and was amazed that it felt even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely been stroking it for a minute when she felt it begin twitching and suddenly the mirror right in front of her and her hand were both covered in white goo. Jenn might have been a virgin still, but she knew exactly what had happened: she had just sprayed her cum all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to grab some tissue from the box on her vanity to clean up when a naughty thought crossed her mind. She brought her cum covered hand up to her mouth and tasted some of the goo covering it. It didn't taste like much. A little salty and strangely textured. It wasn't horrible like she'd heard some of the girls at school describe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer naughty curiosity assuaged, Jenn went about cleaning up the mess she had just made.</span></div></div>",

She thought about what to do with her time and quickly decided that one male orgasm wasn't enough. She wanted another one. Of course she did have one problem: having just had an orgasm, her penis was rather soft and limp and it didn't seem to want to cooperate with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought that maybe a little visual stimulation would help. She grabbed her laptop and sat on her bed. She'd never really looked at porn before but then again she'd never had a penis before. She had also briefly thought about grabbing the small vibrator that she had hidden in her underwear drawer but decided against that since she didn't know how she would use it with her new anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning safesearch off she typed in a search phrase that she thought would help her get off: \"Well hung hunks\". She clicked the search button and suddenly her screen was filled with pictures of naked men, most of them with penises much larger than the one she had. She started stroking her penis again and it slowly began to respond. She thought about what it would feel like to have sex with one of the guys in the pictures. It was working really well until a thought crossed her mind that suddenly made her penis go soft again: she didn't have her vagina right now so the only way she could have sex with any of these guys was analy and she found just the idea of that a major turn off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that maybe the solution to her problem was to look at naked women she typed something appropriate into the search bar. The pictures of naked men were quickly replaced with pictures of naked women. She found one that was a close up picture of a woman's pussy. Her penis seemed to really like that judging by its reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she thought about having sex with a woman, that didn't really turn her on either. Breasts weren't really attractive to her and she really liked the way that men's bodies looked, all tight and muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her only a moment to realize that there was one person who could satisfy her current desires. She thought of Josh, her friend for almost as long as she could remember. Her had a fairly nice body for a guy and right now he had a vagina so he satisfied that current desire of hers. She imagined what Josh must look like naked right now and her penis became harder than ever. She stroked it faster and harder than ever imagining what she wanted to do to Josh right now. Imagining that he was there, straddling her, riding her cock as she thrust it in and out of his pussy. Him begging for her to give it to him harder, faster. Begging her to cum in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought was the one that pushed her over the edge. She came again this time most of her cum ended up coating her stomach and her hand. Exhausted from cumming twice in less than half an hour, Jenn drifted off into a light sleep.</span></div></div>",

Because she was smaller than him it made his penis look bigger in comparison. \"I guess not.\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn kicked off her shoes and stepped out of her pants. She looked down at her new penis for a long moment before she reach out and touched it. She seemed a little disappointed at first and kept feeling around the rest of her new anatomy. Slowly her penis became erect which made her smile. She then sat down on the edge of Josh's bed and began to slowly stroke her now fully penis. \"This feels pretty good.\" She said. \"You should try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've jacked off a penis before, thank you.\" Josh said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean.\" Jenn said. \"Take your pants off. Explore the goods. I know you've never touched a pussy before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh hesitated at first. He felt a little awkward getting naked in front of a girl even if she was his best friend. Then again, he though as he unbuttoned his pants, it's not like I've got anything she hasn't seen before. Josh stood with his back to Jenn as he slid his pants down and stepped out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down at his crotch and was a little disappointed that he couldn't see anything but his pubic hair. He tried squatting a little and bending forward but still couldn't see much. Giving up, Josh decided that manual exploration was his only hope. He began to slowly trace the shape of his new genitals with a finger. Much to his delight he found his clitoris right away and stroked it gently with a finger tip for a little while before moving on. He traced his finger along the slit between his labia before gently slipping his finger between them and exploring the moistness of his inner labia and finally finding his vagina. Just as Josh was slipping a finger into his vagina he heard a loud moan escape from Jenn reminding him that he wasn't alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned just in time to see cum come pumping out of Jenn's penis before she lay back on his bed panting. He and Jenn weren't anything more than friends, but the sight of her laying on his bed with cum covering her lower stomach was really turning him on. He could feel the moisture in his groin and knew that if he still had his penis it would be rock hard right now.</span></div></div>",

Besides, he thought, if I am going to swap groins with anyone, it would be Jenn anyway\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the clothing preference swap is a good alternative without physical changes, which could end up making the situation more comfortable than the groin swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, while he would love to swap back, the swap Jenn will force them to make could be much worse, she could force us swap something like their entire bodies or personalities he thought. Plus the jeans do feel kind of nice on his legs, just not in all places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some consideration Josh said...<br>\r\n\"Okay, I want to swap ...\"</span></div></div>",

Normally, he wouldn't be so willing to losing his dick, but in the situation, he has found himself into, he wasn't thinking rationally.

As it faded, Josh clutched his stomach. It was now completely flat. He tried to think about Jenn, to make it rise up, but nothing happened. \"So, I'm a female now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"OUCH!\" - Josh heard Jenn screaming in pain. - \"What's wrong, Jenn?\"<br>\r\n- \"My penis... I mean your penis, is pressing against my panties. It hurts a lot.\"<br>\r\n-\" Now you see, what I had to deal with, when I had my dick to your skinny jeans.\"<br>\r\n- \"Yeah, it's nothing pleasant. Can we swap underwear, please?\" - Josh wasn't sure. It didn't make a difference for him, but for Jenn it was crucial. On the other hand, he didn't want to just agree. Jenn tricked him into swapping jeans and groins, and he wasn't happy about it.<br>\r\n-\" Please Josh. I'm begging you.\"<br>\r\n-\" Umm... fine.\" - Josh said and in a flash of an eye, the swap occurred. Josh looked underneath (Jenn's (now his) jeans, and saw, that he was wearing white, cotton, girly panties. He wasn't willing to do this, but Jenn gave him her flat groin, when he had his balls crushed.<br>\r\n-\"Thank you Josh\" - she hugged him.<br>\r\nWhat's next? </span></div></div>",

I am 100% satisfied with my vagina. I am just curious, how it look's like from a boy's perspective.

Having nothing between his legs was so alien to him, that, he couldn't focus on anything else. He had his best friend's, fully functional vagina, with all its pros and cons. <br>\r\n-\" Yeah, of course. Don't be such intolerant, Josh.\"<br>\r\n-\" Jesus Christ, Jenn! I have your pussy between my legs, and you have my dick between yours! You call this \"an intolerance\"? \"<br>\r\n-\" Please, don't shout.

Please, don't start with that  \"intolerance\" bullshit once again.\"<br>\r\n-\" No, I just say... \" - Jenn's words were paused, by her phone. She began to search for it, in the pockets of her new, baggy pants (Josh' baggy pants). - \"Crap! Where has it gone?\" - she dug through her pockets, once again. - \"I had it in my trousers\" <br>\r\n-\" We swapped trousers, remember? You have my pants now.\" - Josh said. <br>\r\n-\" So, you have it\" - Jenn shouted. Josh looked at his hips. <br>\r\n- \"Where? These jeans don't have pockets.\" <br>\r\n-\" On your butt, moron!\" - Josh reached to his back pocket, and indeed, Jenn's phone was there. Josh handed it to Jenn. <br>\r\n-\" Why do women's trousers don't have real pockets?\" - Josh asked, while giving. <br>\r\n-\"That's no time, for this\" - Jenn unlocked her phone  - That's my mum\" - she picked up the phone - \"Hello mum, what's going on? Yeah?....uhhmmm.... I understand... do I have to?... I see, I'll be in a min'.\" - she put off the phone - \"I have to go. My mum want me, to help her with something, at home.\" - she began to collect her stuff. <br>\r\n-\"Is this thing really so important, that you can't stay?\" - Josh asked. <br>\r\n - \"She said so. Sorry for leaving you so early, today, but I' ve got an idea. Why don't you come at my place tomorrow? We may study a bit more for this biology test, later watch some movie, maybe something else.\" <br>\r\n-\" Can't you come to me, once again, tomorrow? \"- Josh asked. <br>\r\n-\" Why should I? If I come at  your place today, and you come at my place tomorrow, that will be fair, won't it? Unless you can't come at my place. <br>\r\n-\" I can, but...\" <br>\r\n-\" So, I will be waiting for you. See ya!\" - she <br>\r\nran out your room. Josh realized something. <br>\r\n-\" Wait!!\" - He shouted after her, running to the corridor. <br>\r\nShe stopped mid-stairs. <br>\r\n-\"What?\" - she was surprised.  <br>\r\n-\" How about this?\" - Josh pointed at your flat groin, still in Jenn's tight jeans. <br>\r\n- \"I don't see\" <br>\r\n-\" I have your pussy, forgot?\" <br>\r\n-\"No, and so what?\" <br>\r\n-\" I want to have my dick back.\" - Josh demanded<br>\r\n- \"I thought we are going to stay like this, for a while.\" - Jenn said. <br>\r\n-\"WHAT?! HELL NO!\" - they were lucky, no one was listening to their conversation. <br>\r\n-\" And what were you thinking? Surely we have just swapped, and we're already supposed to swap back?\" <br>\r\n-\" Jenn, I don't want to have your pussy for I don't even know how long. \"<br>\r\n-\" This won't be very long, and I am not having my period soon, so you won't have to worry about it. \"- Josh' face got pale. He realized, that if he won't get his dick back, he would  have to deal with menstruation. -\" Anyway, I'm really in a rush now, bye. \"<br>\r\n-\" You can't leave me like this! \"<br>\r\n-\" What's so wrong in it? \"<br>\r\n-\" It's yours! \"<br>\r\n-\" You won't get hurt!\" <br>\r\n-\" I'm a fucking boy, Jenn! I can't have a pussy! \" <br>\r\n- \" I won't give you your penis back now, no way.\" - Jenn said definitely. <br>\r\n-\" And what with these? \" - you grabbed your jeans<br>\r\n-\" Listen Josh, I'm  really in a hurry... \"<br>\r\n-\" PLEASE!\" - you begged her. <br>\r\n-\" Ok, fine. \" - she gave up. -\" Because I like you, I will let you choose, Josh. You can either keep these jeans, 'till tomorrow, or I can take them from you, but you will have to swap one more trait with me. But you have 10 seconds, before I'm leaving.\" - she declared - \" Jeez, Mum will kill me, for being so late\" -  she said to herself. <br>\r\nJosh decided to</span></div></div>",

I used to like them like that.  Just because you like them tight, doesn't mean they don't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean it always hurts like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe, it is a bit uncomfortable.  It might hurt more for you since you have a penis.\"   Jenn didn't mention that she was wearing new jeans, it usually takes a couple of washing for the material softens and it feels a little better.  But in general wearing tight clothes does hurt a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tricked me.  I thought you said it wouldn't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that.  But now that we are swapping stuff.  How would you like to wear the rest of my outfit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Josh said.  But then he caught sight of what Jenn was wearing.  He hadn't noticed before that her top was so cute.  It went much better with skinny jeans than what he was wearing.  he had on a plain t-shirt with some silly saying.  he didn't like it at all.  When not on himself.  To to mention he was wearing ratty old sneakers.  Jenn's flats looked much better.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn on the other hand, felt that what she wore was well too girly on her.  Her top had puffy sleeves and her flats had a bow on the tail.  She felt odd wearing time.  (Not to mention her bra felt tight and her panties had a touch of pretty but uncomfortable lace.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it'll feel better if you have my groin.

Even though Josh knew every stitch of clothes there were so many choices that he couldn't make up his mind.  It was like a child in a candy store being told to put just one type of treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked through the apparel and finally hit upon a cute romper.  It had short sleeves and was made of stretchy material.  It was form fitting but it wouldn't feel tight on him.  But the romper wasn't the entirety of his outfit, he needed underwear to go with it.  With Jenn's preferences he knew that he had to wear it with a thong.  He didn't want pantie lines to show under his clothes.  He really didn't need a bra anymore, but if he had one he could stuff it and it would make the romper look much better.  He would of course wear it with some strappy sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never spent so much time thinking about what to wear.  But now he just had to.  He wasn't wearing just some clothes, he was wearing a complete outfit and every piece must fit together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to select the proper thong to go with his romper (the one he was wearing now, wasn't the proper color for a light colored romper), when he realized that it would still be uncomfortable.  The romper would feel great (and look terrific too) but the thong would squeeze his balls and ride up his crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Jenn asked when she saw him hesitating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This won't do,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to wear this with a thong and a thong will hurt just as much as before.  I'll have to find something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been looking for 25 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my first outfit.  I want it to be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The romper was nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  Well it might not look as good on me as on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I don't have your curves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know if I gave you my crotch, with my hips and narrow waist then that outfit would be killer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I would need your boobs too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DEAL!!!,\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Josh could react, the swap took place.  His penis was gone, replaced with a nice flat stomach.  His hips flared out and his waist narrowed.  But he didn't notice that.  At least not at first, what he noticed was the two mounds on his chest.  They weren't the biggest of breasts but they were certainly breasts.  The bra he had been wearing, hadn't had any cups.  It was resized to fit him when he swapped apparel with Jenn.  But as his boobs grew, the cups developed to support them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW LOOK AT WHAT YOU DID!!!\" Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look on the bright side.

Besides I want to show up at school in something cute just one time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want to wear a dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it doesn't have to be a dress.  Just something cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's getting late.  If you change your mind let me know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\"  Josh said.  Jenn was relieved.  She had a penis now and she wanted to use it.  She had dreams of going home and taking some of her lotion and rubbing it up and down her shaft.  Josh was right, this was a once in a lifetime opportunity.  She only offered so that Josh wouldn't suspect what she wanted to do or how much she wanted to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh on the other hand didn't have such perverted thoughts.  His thoughts were devious though.  Josh had heard his friend Nick say that Jenn looked so sexy in a particular outfit (leggings with a bodysuit with a U-neck and low back).  Josh noticed the outfit while he was looking for something to wear earlier. he wanted to wear it to school in front of Nick and see what he said.  \"It would be epic,\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was for tomorrow.  In the meantime he had to get ready for bed.  That meant not only putting on sleepwear, but also taking a shower.   Now that he had Jenn's wardrobe he found that not only with his day clothes, but also with his night clothes he had too many choices.  He used to sleep in just his underwear and a t-shirt.  But now he didn't want to do that.  he could wear Jenn's satiny pajamas or her nylon nightgown.  But if he wanted to feel really naughty he could wear her chemise.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/in-bloom-by-jonquil-chemise/4607030?origin=category-personalizedsort&amp;breadcrumb=Home%2FWomen%2FClothing%2FLingerie%2C%20Hosiery%20%26%20Shapewear%2FChemises&amp;color=off%20white\" target=\"_blank\">https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/in-bloom-by...</a>  It was sheer lace and very sexy.  Josh didn't know that Jenn had owned anything like this (before the swap) but know he knew everything about her clothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell,\" he thought.  \"The chemise it is.\"  He picked it out and a pair of matching panties and headed towards the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off all his clothes but before entering he saw himself in the mirror.  What he noticed wasn't how great his boobs and butt looked.  he saw them as Jenn would see them and noticed the imperfections.  He wished his boobs were more shapely.  Not necessarily bigger (although that would be nice too) but had a better shape.  When it came to his butt on the other hand, he thought it was too large.  This were his body now and he saw it like Jenn did.  It was part of the preferences he received from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he noticed how out of place his legs looked.  They were too muscular and a bit hairy.  They wouldn't look good in leggings, but at least no one would see the hair on them.  That reminded him, the bodysuit he wanted to wear was sleeveless.  Maybe he should shave his arm pits instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

Jenn was his friend and he thought that doing anything like that would be a betrayal to her.  Even if she would never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jenn squirted two dollups of expensive lotion on her hand and went to work on her new shaft.  She was so excited that it took no time before she exploded.  Jenn's sister never knew what was going on.  She was just happy that Jenn didn't take as long as she usually did in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh luxuriated in the chemise he was wearing to bed.  It felt so good against his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Josh found the outfit he wanted.  It was a white U-neck sleeveless bodysuit with a low back and a pair of camouflage leggings.  He matched them with bikini panties and a white push-up bra.  he was happy that the straps were hidden under his tank top.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.forever21.com/us/shop/catalog/product/f21/top_bodysuits-bustiers/2000325473\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.forever21.com/us/shop/catalo...</a>  Opening the first two buttons of the bodysuit and using a push-up bra made his boobs look bigger.  It was very sexy.  It would be so much fun to show up in school wearing such a sexy outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew that everyone would think that how he looked and everything he wore would seem normal.  They wouldn't even think of him as a girl, despite having a vagina and boobs.  He did wonder how his friends would react to his new outfit, especially Nick.  If they treated him as if what he had on was no big deal might be more (he didn't know the proper word) interesting/fun/exciting that if they said something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he looked at himself he saw something wrong.  He still had hairy arms.  The hair on his legs were hidden under his leggings, but he didn't like the hair on his arms anymore (or worse yet his hairy armpits.  He knew it wouldn't make a difference to anyone else, but it bothered him.  (Another effect from swapping preferences with Jenn.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't time to take a shower to shave his arms and the rest of himself.  Jenn couldn't be here in time.  He didn't know what to do when he remembered he wasn't alone in the house.  He could swap with someone else.  His twelve year old sister Courtney would be his best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rushed through his explanation that he could swap with anyone.  He told her he didn't have time to take a shower and would she swap with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to swap my smooth hairless skin with yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah please.  It'll only be for a day.  Then we will swap back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know?  Why should I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you twenty dollars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to walk around and have hair 'everywhere' and all you'll give me is ten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about twenty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want something more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you you can swap stuff, then you see I have this math test today.  I want to swap our math knowledge so I can pass the test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought about this for a few moments.  He had math class today as he did everyday.  But he didn't have a test.  He could just write down what was put on the board it didn't matter if he understood it.  When he got his math knowledge back he would just study his notes. He just would make sure not to raise his hand in class.  It should be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but we'll have to swap back later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, what do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just say you agree to the swap and it'll happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh could see what was happening to Courtney.  Josh was only fifteen so he wasn't particularly hairy, but he did have some hair all over.  He could see the hair growing on Courtney's arms.  But it wasn't only that, her face looked slightly different.  She didn't have any stubble on it, but it did look slightly rougher.  She didn't need a shave now, but she would in a couple days.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's skin got smoother, softer and more sensitive, like Courtney's skin used to be.  There wasn't a hint of hair anywhere on his body.  It hadn't started growing.  His armpits were bare of any hair.  Even his eyebrows became less bushy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his head, he lost three years of math knowledge.  But he really couldn't tell.  He didn't know what he had lost.  It was as if he had never learned it in the first place.  He couldn't even think of a problem to test himself on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney gave Josh a kiss on the cheek while saying \"Thanks.  I was so worried about this test.  But I think I'll ace it now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The girl screamed.  I don't know what the big deal was, I was just having a little fun.  I didn't mean any harm.  This was true, the boy was still a freshman.  It was a foolish trick, but he didn't have an inappropriate intent.  He just thought it was funny.  Sort of like when you give a boy a wedgie because his underwear was showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to the other students, Josh thought it might be better to swap the reason they were in the guidance counselor's office with one of them.  Josh worried that even if he swapped back math abilities with Courtney that his assessment results might already be scored and he might end up in a remedial class (or worse) after he swaps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

But I really don't want to change classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I guess that is OK.  My mom is going to complain about this.  She is always getting on my case because of what I wear, but this is the first time she was called by the school.  I'm a little bit worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the fighting boy was taken into the office.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had been thinking.  He didn't want to take the placement test.  He didn't know what would happen if he failed it?  Would it effect him even after he swapped back?  Josh decided that it would be best not to take the test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Josh whispered to the girl.  Josh couldn't place the girl, but she did look a little familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Catherine,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catherine, I have this ability.  I can swap traits with another person.  I have an idea, let's swap why we are here.  That way you won't get into trouble.  All you have to do is take a silly test.  You'll ace it, it'll be no big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been good.  My mom won't mind this.  Besides what's a day's suspension.  I'll just stay home and hang out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little convincing, but Catherine finally agreed.  She didn't think it would work anyway.  After the swap, Josh was wearing the trench coat.  It was covering a sexy policewoman's outfit.  But what Josh didn't know was that there was also a slight coating of lipstick on his lips and his ears were pierced in four places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later, Catherine was taking to a private room for testing.  A few minutes after that, Josh's mother arrived.  They were shown into the counselor's office who explained the problem to both Josh and his mother.  Josh tried to look apologetic and said he was sorry.  Then he was taken home for his one day suspension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's mother lectured him in the car.  She told him that she expected more from him  Josh smoothed it over the best that he could.  But Josh was grounded for at least three days: no computer,  no phone and he had to come back home straight from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got home, he went to his room to change out of the costume.  But when he got there he found that his entire wardrobe had changed.  It wasn't Jenn's wardrobe anymore, everything was in black.  Now Josh knew who Catherine was.  She was one of the goth girls.  He had never seen her wearing anything but black.  That wasn't strictly true.  She more mostly black, but there was sometimes parts of her outfits that was blood red or a metallic gold/silver.  That was it.  That's why he hadn't recognized her, she was so out of character wearing 'colors'.  Catherine wore black all the time so for Halloween she was going to wear something colorful.  The opposite of other people who wears colors through the year and then wear a black witch costume on Halloween.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh put on black panties with a black bra, a black flowy dress with black boots and black stockings.  The boots were high enough to hide the stocking from view, but he still felt compelled to wear them and they had to be black...not that he had stockings of any other color.  But he still felt half way dressed.  He put gold hoops in all four pairs of his ear piercings.  Then  he replaced the stud in his tongue.  Finally he completed his outfit with a thick cross hanging from a gold necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at himself in the mirror he felt compelled to make his face look paler with some white powder.  Then he thought he would finish it up with black lipstick and black eyeliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was while he was powdering his face, that Josh realized what he had done.  How could he swap back with Jenn.  She would get his new Gothic wardrobe and preferences.  She probably wouldn't even know that this wasn't how it was supposed to be.  She would remember swapping clothes with him, but would Jenn remember what her style was before the swap?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had gotten out of hand so quickly.  He would have to swap back with Courtney, Catherine and Jenn.  But to make things right did he have to do it in a particular order?  Josh didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Josh felt like his  mind was drained, and filled with completely new memories. To Josh' surprise, he now knew everything about his new pussy, like if he has ever had it. He know when he's on his period, what to do then, how to take care of his clit etc. But to his horror, gone were  memories about his penis. He couldn't remember what it's like to have an erection, or even how his old genitals looked like! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jenn, I'm not sure if I'm happy with this swap.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" I can't remember, how my penis used to look like.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's how it should work, I think.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But it's freaking me out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't cry. Actually... how does it feel like, to have a pussy?\" - Jenn asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" It feels... normal. I don't know, how it's like, not to have it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, I feel the same with your dick. I mean... although I know I shouldn't  have it, it feels like if I've always had it. Actually... you were right. It is weird.\" - Jenn said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's what I tried to tell you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't really know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" Maybe we should swap back? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-NO!\" - Jenn protested - \"I don't want to have a period!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" It sounds ridiculously, coming from your mouth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, I'm totally mixed up. Not only physically, but also mentally. Maybe the swap wasn't a good idea?\" - she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But you said, you don't want to swap back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\" 'Cause I don' t want to. I mean, I know, that my current predicament isn't right, but I don't want to have a pussy. I don't know what to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think, we should stay like this for a while, focus on something else. Then we might get used to it.\" - Josh proposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe you're right... how about studying biology, for a while?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Sound good to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started  learning. Josh rather than about biology, Josh was thinking about his clothes. He was feeling really sexy in his short denim skirt, tights and high boots. The skirt fitted him well now, as he didn't have his manhood. He was quite contented with the swaps he made. He liked his new clothes, and the way his lack of manhood suited them. He realised, that Jenn also wasn't focused on studying. - \"What's going on, Jenn?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm thinking about your powers. What they can do is unbelievable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ok, I see, that we can't focus on studying. Maybe let's swap something else?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do you think we can swap back?\" Josh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine.\" Jenn said. Another flash then followed, and Josh had gotten his sweatpants back while Jenn was once again wearing his skinny jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, those pants were really uncomfortable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" His friend replied while rolling her eyes. She didn't know why he was complaining when he wore the pants for at most a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you want to watch that movie or maybe even study now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we test this power out more? I want to see what it can do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but as long as the swaps aren't too drastic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea, why don't we swap siblings?\" She proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you never get tired of your siblings. I just thought it would be fun for the two of us to see what it's like to have new ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right.\" Josh said as Jenn's idea started to grow on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, I know you and Kira are on decent terms...\" She referred to the times that he and her little sister played video games together. \"And, Courtney is more feminine than my sister. The two of us will be able to relate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Bri?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be cool to have a younger sister, one that's  even younger than Kira and Courtney. I do consider myself to be good with kids.\" Jenn said. Josh knew she was right, as the two of them sometimes took babysitting jobs together and Jenn was obviously more fit to do the job. Jenn could see her friend's facial expression changing by the second. She could tell he was giving it consideration. \"Is that a yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you've convinced me.\" The flash once again filled up the room, but nothing was physically different this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" Jenn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so, we didn't swap anything physical. We'll have to look for clues.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we just go to your sisters' old room?\" Jenn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends started to make their way toward the room that they were guessing now belonged to Kira, formerly belonging to Bri and Courtney. On the way however, Josh noticed something odd with a picture on the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenn, check it out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a couple steps back and with Josh saw a surprising sight. There was a picture frame hanging on a second floor wall that used to show Josh with his two sisters, as he had an arm around each other one. The frame now had Josh standing with only his left arm around Kira, smiling with Josh and sporting her signature ponytail. \"Wow! That's so cool, you're swaps can alter reality!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, this picture shows that you and Kira have always been siblings. The world has been altered so everyone else thinks it is normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our sibling swap just worked and that's the first thing you think of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I find it interesting. I am a more advanced thinker than you after all.\" She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Josh said hurt, although he knew it was try. Jenn just shrugged with a smile on her face. \"Anyway, what should we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They exchanged notes, and quizzed each other with flash cards that Jenn created. After about 15 minutes of studying, Josh heard a knock on his door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" He told the mystery person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person who walked in was Kira, and Josh was surprised because he forgot about the swap he had earlier made with Jenn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kira? What are you doing here?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... I live here, I'm your SISTER.\" Kira said to her new brother as if it was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right. Why are you in my room though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to play on our PlayStation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... our PlayStation?\" was very confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we share this for the last time. It's not just yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" He said, not very convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish mom would let me get my own. Or at least let us move this one downstairs.\" Everything about this was weird for Josh, Kira was acting as if they'd always been siblings. He looked over to Jenn, who could only crack a smile. \"Oh hey Jenn, didn't see you there.\" Kira added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kira, nice to see my friend's little sister again.\" Jenn said waving. She was just toying with Josh's emotions at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe studying for Josh and Jenn continued, but not for long. Once Kira fired up the console, the game became too loud for the two high schoolers to focus. \"Someone should tell her to turn the volume down.\" Josh told his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do it, she's YOUR sister after all.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I will.\" He said standing up. \"Hey sis, we're trying to study here. Can you turn the volume down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, that won't be a problem.\" She said not looking back. Josh saw her reach for the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Josh sat down, he heard the volume being adjusted. It didn't go down though, it went up! \"Umm... I said turn it down Kira.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why didn't you turn it down?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kira, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No just leave me be. You can be annoying sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Because your being the pest right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pest who's got more friends than you.\" She retorted. She didn't have as many friends as Courtney, but she had her fair share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh heard his door burst open. His mom was standing in the doorway. \"What is the meaning of this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kira's blasting the volume in my TV and we're having trouble studying over here.\" He said gesturing to Jenn and himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kira, why can't you just leave your brother to do what he wants?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I want to play video games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then either turn the volume down or leave Josh and his friend alone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And one more thing. Apologize to your brother.\" She said pointing to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts, now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Josh. I'll turn the volume down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now I better not have to come up here again.\" The eldest of the four said, before leaving the youngest three alone once again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When looking through, he noticed some of the movies had been changed. He figured that the new movies were meant to match the preferences of Kira instead of his two former sisters. \"Ah here it is.\" He finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What movie is it?\" Jenn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" Josh said, trying to force back some laughter. \"Its a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason Josh wanted to hide his movie from Jenn was because if she found out what it was she would have immediately said no. The movie he picked was a horror film, a genre that Jenn hated. His plan was to get his friend scared so she would end up clinging on to him. He hoped that his presence would make her feel safe, so she could see him in a different light. Maybe even as more than a friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the movie started and Jenn figured out what was going on, she immediately tried to get out. \"Come on Josh, you know I hate horror movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a good one though. And don't worry, I'm here for you if you get scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed to be going to plan. Jenn was getting frightened, and she was using an unfazed Josh as a human pillow. Then about halfway through, Josh's plans were derailed when Jenn got an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the remote and paused the movie. Seeing as they were halfway through, Jenn pitched her idea. \"I got an idea.\" She exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This movie is really scary for me, and you roped me in to watching it. I think it's only fair if you're scared too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Was all Josh could muster. He was incredibly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap bravery with you. We're halfway through the movie, I was scared for half and you'll be scared for the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're fine the way we are, do you need me to protect you again?\" He teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious. If you don't do it, I won't study with you. We both know you need some help for that test on Wednesday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh knew she was right. He needed all the help he could get, or else he would probably get another bad grade and be grounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I agree to swap bravery with you.\" He announced. The familiar flash consumed the living room, and left as quick as it came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Jenn said. \"You feel any different?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... no.\" Josh lied. There was no physical swap, but he could tell it worked. He was already nervous for the second half of the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right.\" Announced a now confident Jenn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a new person entered the room. It was Josh's new sister Kira, whom he had almost forgot about. \"Hey big bro. And Jenn, didn't see you there. You mind if I watch the movie with you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" Jenn said. \"It's scary though, just to warn you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine, Josh is probably really scared though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh trust me, he is.\" Jenn said sadistically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two minutes in to the continuation of the movie, there was a minor jump scare. Josh immediately squealed and buried his head into Jenn's breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira paused the movie. \"Geez Josh, we're thing to watch a movie here. Your little sister and girlfriend aren't scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not his girlfriend.\" Jenn intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough Kira!\" Josh said removing his head from Jenn's chest. He guessed Kira figured out his crush on Jenn in this reality, but he was not about to let Kira tell her. He refrained from looking at the screen though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira was about to reply but the phone started to ring. Kira found the phone in the kitchen and answered. When she came back, she place the phone next to the remote on the table. \"That was Courtney. She said Josie's having a sleepover, I'm gonna go pack.\" She left Josh and Jenn to themselves on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the movie scared Josh so much that he wasn't sure he'd be able to go to bed unless he got his bravery back. The second half was definitely scarier than the first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like it Josh?\" Jenn joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that was terrible!\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Because I kind of liked it.\" She said. \"By the way, that's what you get for making me watch a scary movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you win. Can we swap back now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He immediately felt a difference once the light cleared the room however. He was no longer wearing socks and felt discomfort and tightness in his feet, and he looked down to see he was wearing a pair of brown high-heeled sandals that were bigger than originally to fit his bigger feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! It actually worked!\" Jenn exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was too surprised to say anything, but he glanced at her feet to see that she was now wearing his red and white sneakers (but smaller) that were accompanying a pair of socks she didn't have on before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I don't have to wear those heels now. They're so uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you put them on in the first place?\" He questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, I was rushing out the door to get to your house so I wouldn't get caught in a downpour. Those where the only shoes I could find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why you wouldn't willingly choose these.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to walk in them.\" Jenn suggested, not able hold back a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... how about I don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try it. I want to see what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh figured nothing terrible could happen, so he just got to his feet using his chair as support. He took a couple of steps without falling. \"Hey, this isn't so ba...\" He started before losing his balance and falling flat on his face. He was not hurt, but the experience was embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn failed to hold back her laughter. \"Are you okay?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm not hurt, just embarrassed.\" He announced, turning over from his stomach to his backside,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, that was your first try. It wasn't that bad actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tried to get back up, but wiped out again, this time landing on his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh left the door a bit open after letting Jenn in, and after his second time falling, someone knocked and opened it fully. The person was his sister, Courtney, who started to laugh at the sight of seeing her brother on the ground. \"Geeze big bro, you can't walk in those heels for your life. I don't know why you even try anymore.\" She said before closing the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's initial reaction was confusion. \"Why did she act like me wearing heels was so normal?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. I guess your power makes the people around you think it's normal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right, there's no other answer that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's cool though, we won't have to hide swaps from other people.\" Jenn said while standing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of swaps, can we swap back our shoes now?\" Josh inquired, finally getting back up to his feet,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I want to yet. Your shoes are much more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I can't walk in heels!\" He remarked, pointing down to the heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't have to, I have some sneakers too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still, if I ever have to wear them I won't stand a chance of staying upright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not ready yet. But I'm nice, so I'll cut you a deal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Josh's facial expression went from angry to hopeful very quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two options. One, we can swap our skills so you'll be able to walk in heels. Two, I'll give you back your sneakers in exchange for another swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the other swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm declining to say at this point.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, but if we swap skills I won't be able to play my video games.\" Josh pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. That's my final offer, you can pick from one of those two options.\" Jenn commented, folding her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of thinking, Josh came to a final decision. \"Okay, I'll take your _________.\" </span></div></div>",

Admittedly, he was interested in trying her legs and especially her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine\", he sighed finally in defeat. \"I agree to swap everything from the waist down, including our genitals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick flash later, Josh felt weird instantly. Quickly he looked down to see his legs having been replaced by Jenn's and his member missing, being replaced by Jenn's vagina. But that was not all! He also now wore her skinny jeans, explaining why he felt so weird, as well as her shoes, which were in actuality the shoes he wore before he started swapping with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did we swap clothes as well?\", asked Josh surprised and looked over to Jenn who had one of her manicured hands inside Josh's old baggy pants. \"Seriously? That's the first thing you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn looked up, a bit embarrassed. \"Sorry. I was just curious. What were you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did we swap clothes?\", repeated Josh annoyed. \"I thought we would only swap the parts of our body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn made her thinking face for a few moments before signalling she knew what was going on. \"It's very easy. Remember how you phrased it? You said you wanted to swap EVERYTHING from the waist down. You arbitrarily adding the parts about our genitals wasn't really necessary. In any case, that means we also swapped clothes because EVERYTHING includes clothes, obviously\", she explained with a smug grin, one of her hands rubbing her new-found member through her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just great\u2026\", sighed Josh. \"Can we at least swap the clothes back?\" He was glad that he had his shoes back but did not want to wear Jenn's tight jeans.</span></div></div>",

The next thing he noticed was the black hair that fell into his view as he tried to look down at what he was holding right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, this feels weird\", he heard a familiar, yet distorted voice say. It took him a moment before he realized that it was his own voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that out loud\", he said with a voice that sounded like Jenn's but different, now that he was hearing it from inside his body. Josh let go of the orbs that were now on his chest, fearing for a moment that they would really fall off, but they stayed. As he brushed a strand of hair away from his face, he noticed his new slender hands. He then looked over where Jenn was sitting, and a laugh escaped his mouth as he saw what was sitting in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of Jenn's usual self he now saw himself with Jenn's legs. That would not be so funny, but the two had retained their clothing.

He also noted happily that his breasts were now supported by a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something is odd though\", mumbled Jenn as she looked at Josh with his own face. \"You don't wear my make-up! And my earrings are also missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it's not clothes then. Let's swap make-up as well as accessories\", suggested Josh to which Jenn immediately agreed.

He no longer had that lingering fear that these new orbs on his chest would fall off, as silly as it sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe curiously took a glance underneath his blouse and could spot that the bra he was wearing was white with some lacy pattern he could not make out very well from this perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Did I allow you to look at them?\", Jenn suddenly said in a jokingly manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well their mine now\", grinned Josh. \"So, I don't need your permission for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth had a good laugh and Josh noted that the way Jenn normally laughed sounded absolutely horrible in his voice, which made him laugh even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\", asked Josh when they had finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn then suggested\u2026</span></div></div>",

Josh reluctantly followed her example and took out his stuff as well, admiring his manicure for a bit as he took his book out of his bag. As always, he was rather unmotivated with studying and the different feelings from his new upper body and clothes did not help him very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we really have to?\", grunted Josh as he sat down in front of Jenn. \"I'd rather watch a movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why, my dear Josh, your grades are this bad\", she replied and looked at her notes. \"That's strange\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? Did you do a mistake?\", he asked surprise and got a head shake as a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Look. This is definitely not my handwriting. This looks more like yours. And it's written all over the place, with no real structure\u2026 Just like yours\", she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what?\", shrugged Josh. \"Maybe we mixed up notes or something. Big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that IS a big deal. It may look like you have written it, but everything on his correct. I remember writing every sentence. Let me take a look at your notes\". Without even waiting for Josh's reply, Jenn had already grabbed a handful of his notes with her now bigger hands and was vigorously shifting through the papers. \"As I thought. Look! It looks like I wrote it, but it is as wrong and inaccurate as humanly possible. Seriously, do you even pay the slightest attention in class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh ignored her snarky comment and concentrated on the notes she held in his face. He understood what her problem was and to prove their theory, he grabbed a pen and began writing something. Sure enough, his handwriting had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this possible?\", he asked surprised. \"We just switched upper bodies. Did I suddenly inherit your HANDwriting, because I got your HANDS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous\", sighed Jenn. \"Remember the skill swap we did earlier? The one that allowed you to walk in those heels.\" She pointed at heeled sandals Josh was currently wearing. \"We did not specify skills, so we must have swapped all of our skills. You're probably able to put on the make-up you now have on your face or know how to handle your bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo illustrate her point, she grabbed the hem of Josh's blouse and pulled it up, revealing the white bra he was wearing that was holding his breasts in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\", exclaimed Josh surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, it's not like I haven't seen this before. In fact, I put on these clothes myself. Now help me get 'your' blouse off\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh did as he was told and felt weird sitting just in a bra. He got a good look at Jenn's naked upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now take off your bra\", she commanded, and Josh complied. Just like they had figured, he had no problem opening the hooks. He let the straps slide off his slender shoulders and let his breasts fall free. Once again, he felt this pulling feeling on his chest, but he also got a strange feeling around his nipples. It felt like they hardned, maybe because he was looking at the breasts of his crush, although from an unusual angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This felt\u2026 natural\u2026 Like I've done this countless time before\", explained Josh and looked at the cups of the bra. They had a lacy flower pattern and looked really sexy. He was curious now if Jenn had a matching pair of panties.</span></div></div>",

Jenn you better go now, I'll talk to your mother later. First, I'm going to have a talk with you, young man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn wanted to explain the situation, tell her that this was all just a misunderstanding, but she knew that this would be pointless right now. She grabbed her stuff, looked at Josh for a second before quickly leaving the room, so she would not anger Kim anymore. Kim closed the door as soon as Jenn had left the room and then looked angered at her son, who had just finished putting on his bra again and was in the motion of slipping his blouse over the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What has gotten into you?\", asked Kim and went over to his bed and sat down. \"I should have known, I mean, you both are teenagers after all.

He could not tell her that he had the ability to swap with others as long as they gave him their permission, could he? But how could he explain what the two were doing? For every bystander it looked like he had just undressed in front of his best friend who has the other sex and was exposing his breasts. There are only a handful of logical scenarios why he would undress in front of Jenn and the most logical one would be sex. She would not believe any lie like \"I have spilled a drink over my blouse and had to change\", that sounded as absurd as the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh brushed a stand of his new black hair behind his ear and finally gave his mother an answer to her question.</span></div></div>",

We both know what you two wanted to do here. Yes, I am mad, but it's also something completely normal. You don't have to come up with these stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm telling you the truth, mom\", whined Josh. \"My complete upper body half, my upper body clothes as well as my shoes and skills are not my own. They're Jenn's. Hence why I undressed. We wanted to check if I could take off and put the bra back on again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous\", replied Kim sternly. \"You've been wearing a bra since you hit puberty. Of course, you are able to put it on. Same with your shoes, you've been wearing heels for years now, of course you can walk in them, why wouldn't you with years of practice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed. His mother would not believe him.

Go ahead, pick something\", he told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim raised an eyebrow. Either her son has gone crazy and truly believed this story or he tried to hide something even more embarrassing.

He had to get Jenn back here as fast as possible, which was made impossible as soon as he looked at his phone to tell her to come back. The good new was, that she made the wise decision to not tell her mother anything until Josh's mother would call her mother. The bad news was, that she had to help her mother around the house with her \"strong arms\", whatever that meant. This of course meant that he was stuck like this for at least the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just great\u2026\", he sighed, still not used to his new voice. Whenever he said something, it sounded as if Jenn was talking through some voice modulator. He knew that it was just because he was hearing Jenn's voice through his body rather than his ears like he normally did, but the knowledge did not make it any less freaky. His gaze went through his room, noting all the similarities and differences between now and before the swap. The biggest instantly visible difference was the vanity table he now had in his room. The next difference could be found in his closet, where all of Jenn's tops, blouses and surprisingly her dresses were located, hanging alongside his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. They're probably here because dresses are just longer shirts\u201d, he thought while looking through the closet. At the bottom of his closet he found Jenn's shoe collection. While it was not as expansive as his mother\u2019s was, it was still a huge step up from the three pairs he owned. He grabbed a high-heeled boot and looked at it from all angles, knowing full well that he would be able to walk in it like Jenn would normally do. Putting the boot back and closing the closet, he walked over to the vanity table and looked in the mirror to see Jenn looking back at him. Inspecting his face, he was surprised that he somehow knew how he would have to apply all the different items to achieve the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all so freaky\", he whispered and poked himself in the cheek, Jenn's reflection doing the same. \"Ah well, nothing I can do right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went over to his console and started to play some videogames, soon noticing that due to Jenn's skills he had no problem using the controller with his longer fingernails, but he had trouble playing the game at all. Frustrated, he turned the console off when his mother called everyone for dinner. Thankful for that he went downstairs, where he noticed the next surprise: With her upper body, he had also inherited her taste. The food his mother cooked was the same as usual, but it tasted vastly different. His sisters also found nothing out of the ordinary and just behaved like they always did. His mother on the other hand was unnaturally quiet, probably because she was still processing what she found out about her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Josh decided that it would be a waste to play videogames for the rest of the night. He would be too frustrated, and he had a better idea how he could kill some time. Opening his closet, he again looked at the collection of various tops, blouses and even dresses. A grin formed on Josh's face as he grabbed a tank top that looked way too small for Jenn. He remembered seeing her wear it years ago, when she was smaller, especially around the breasts department. She probably forgot to throw it away, but he did not care. It was perfect for what he was planning to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueezing himself into the tank-top after undressing his upper body completely, he felt as if his whole corpus was being crushed and he could barely breath, but it fit, even if he had his doubts that he would get it off in one piece. He then grabbed his phone and went over to his vanity table, fixing his hair slightly. It should not have surprised him that he was able to do this like anything else, but it did, nonetheless. Starting the camera on his phone, he began filming his mirror image. Jenn looked so sexy in the top that barely looked like more than a bra. He tried to squish his two girls together and leaned forward to give a good look into his cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, Josh\", he purred as seductively as he could. \"I wanted you to know, that I just thought about you and your big thing.\" He pursued his lips with his manicured finger. \"And that I want to feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh initially wanted to move on, but the ridiculousness of him saying that, even with Jenn's voice, was too much for him and he had to laugh. He had wanted to hear Jenn say something like that to him since he hit puberty, but being the one saying that? It was weird, and he could not stay serious. He finished his recording and looked at it. Looking at the video, even knowing that this was not the real Jenn talking, it still sounded hot and his member sprung to life. Since the tank-top was getting uncomfortable real fast, he decided to get rid of it before he turned his attention elsewhere. Surprisingly he managed to get out of it without destroying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh noticed as his breasts hung down, being relieved of any kind of support, that he had somewhat accustomed to them. He did not fear that they would fall off his chest anymore. Due to the arousal he had gotten from the short video he had made; his nipples became hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should try to enjoy this while I can\", he thought with a broad grin.</span></div></div>",

Normally she would not have said anything against it. Why should she? With the recent revelation about his powers though, it was something different. \"That is exactly what I wanted to talk about!\", she said sternly and sat down on his bed. \"If what you told me is true, then this is Jenn's body and you shouldn't do that to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it's only her upper body and I'm not doing anything she wouldn't do either\", replied Josh like a typical teenager. \"Or should I keep on my clothes until tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim sighed. \"No, I guess not. But please, be respectful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever\", he rolled his eyes. As if he would be anything but respectful. \"Was that everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually no. I wanted to ask you a favour. You see, we've just received this new computer software in the office and I am at a complete loss with it. Dr. Wright said that it would help us immensely when it is set correctly, and I thought I could do it, I'm no computer ace but I got by so far\", explained his mother. \"But I can't do it. So far, I was able to get by, by telling him that I needed some time and so on. I tried reading the manual, but I just can't get it to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded and understood what his mother wanted. \"So, you thought that if we swapped knowledge about computers you would be able to set everything up tomorrow, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim nodded. \"Yes. I would really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shrugged with his small shoulders. \"Why not? It's not going to harm me and when it helps you. I agree to swap knowledge about computers with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a flash, Josh only knew the most rudimentary things about computers, like he had been using them for years when he had to, but nothing more. He knew how to browse the internet, how to check e-mails and such but nothing more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\", asked Kim carefully to which Josh replied with a nod, which caused his black hair to fall into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did. Just think about some computer stuff. You should know everything I knew\", he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. Now that I think about it, the problem I had is very simple. I can easily fix it and get everything running first thing tomorrow morning\", said Kim blissfully. \"Thank you, Josh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, mom. Glad I could help you\", he said as he finally grabbed the bra he had been wearing earlier and put it on. Not because his mom told him so, but because his breasts felt heavy. \"Anything else I can help with?\"</span></div></div>",

He was glad that he could help his mother with her computer problem, but the whole swapping thing was still strange and terrifying for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see\u2026\", she looked around and blushed. \"I erm\u2026 cut my leg when I made dinner. The knife slipped and now I have a cut.\" She slipped up the hem of her pants to show him the bandages. \"Nothing serious, don't worry. But the wound hurts a bit, especially when I am walking. Courtney has a very important beauty pageant tomorrow. Aside from the long car drive, I also have to help her get ready and will be on my feet for quite some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh doubted that her leg hurt that much that she could not do it. After all, she did not go to the doctor when it happened. \"You really sure that is the reason?\", he asked her with a raised eyebrow. \"I find it quite hard to believe that this is the true reason you want to swap\u2026 what exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim sighed. \"Okay, yeah. It's not the true reason, well not the only one. I really did cut myself. I wanted to swap lower body halves with you, partly because I don't want to appear with a hurt foot on pictures when Courtney wins. The other part is\u2026 Well\u2026 To be honest, I found it quite interesting to have your genitals\", she explained to Josh's surprise. \"And I wanted to escape wearing heels for the day, my feet hurt after every of Courtney's pageants but as her mother I have to look just as good as she does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you wanted to swap lower halves so that you could a.) experience a penis, b.) not present your 'imperfect' legs to some idiots at that boring beauty pageant and c.) want to wear dress shoes and pants but still be considered dressed appropriately and fancy\", summarized Josh her request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim blushed and nodded. \"Yes. I know it's much and I know I sound a bit like a hypocrite after, well after berating you for your swap with Jenn, even though I still can't believe that this is not your normal body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought for a second and then decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay fine. If it helps you, I agree to swap legs with you\", Josh sighed, and the bright flash appeared just as he had spoken the last syllable. He immediately felt a shift as he had gotten smaller. He also felt a pulsating pain at his ankle. As he looked down, he could see that his right ankle was now bandaged and that his legs were more feminine in shape and smoothly shaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This won't do\", she said as she had just noticed that his legs were unsurprisingly coated with hair. \"I can't wear a dress with this much hair on my legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you can, mom\", Josh replied. \"Reality adjusts. Nobody will notice. They all think that it's perfectly normal for your legs to be hairy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will notice!\", she hissed at him. \"Sorry. I didn't mean it. It just feels weird for me to have so much hair on my legs. Even when no one notices, I will. I can't go out like this. I guess I have to shave it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's eyes went wide with panic. \"Oh no, you can't do that, mom! If you shave 'your' legs now, I will have shaven legs when we swap back. And I definitely can't go to school with shaven legs when we swap back, because everyone will notice THAT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right\", she muttered. \"I haven't thought about that.\" She looked at him thoughtfully for a few seconds. \"How about this? We swap the hair on our legs with each other. Thus, I have shaven legs again and you can keep your hair afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh saw no other way out of this situation and agreed. With the familiar flash, his legs felt warmer again as the hair he had grown over the last years had come back to him. His mother's legs, which now belonged to him for the time being, looked rather unsightly with the coarse hair. Not that Josh minded, he had no intention on going out and showing off his legs. Even then nobody would say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Josh\", smiled his mother delighted. \"You're a life saver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim then walked slowly to the door of the room but turned around before leaving. \"But please\u2026 Be respectful to Jenn's body\". She then closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mom, I will\", he replied and looked down on his legs. He brushed over them. They did not feel that different from his legs. Chubbier and less muscular, not that his were that muscular to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could have gone way worse\", he mumbled and sat down on his bed. \"At least I won't really notice the legs, I guess. Unless I do sports or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh then got up and thought about exploring his wardrobe again, but his mother's visit had taken him all the fun in that. Besides he probably had more time for that tomorrow morning. \"Come to think of it\u2026 We never specified how long we're going to stay like this\", he thought and looked at his phone and texted her. It took him longer than usual to find the chat between him and Jenn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I swapped computer knowledge with mom. I guess smartphones are basically small computer nowadays\", he thought and began writing his message, noting that this took longer than usual. \"Man, I hadn\u2019t though that mom was this bad with computers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how long should we stay like this?\" \u2013 Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno. How about tomorrow afternoon? My mom wants me to help with grocery shopping tomorrow.\" \u2013 Jenn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. Anything particular you wanna do?\" \u2013 Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the mall? Watch a movie?\" \u2013 Jenn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Sounds great.\" \u2013 Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then see you tomorrow. And don\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do with my upper body \ud83d\ude0a\" \u2013 Jenn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you're sounding like my mom. Btw, haven\u2019t told you. She wanted to swap with me. Now I have her legs because she cut her leg and doesn\u2019t want to be on Courtney's pageant.\" \u2013 Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suxx. But could have been worse. At least you have more muscular legs now. Maybe you don't get exhausted as fast this time around, lol\" \u2013 Jenn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was surprised to hear this. His mother was not in bad shape at all, but he guessed that age and a desk job takes away from the endurance of the youth. His legs must get tired rather easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reality adjusts, remember? What you think are my legs are really my mom's.\" \u2013 Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I guess you're right.\" \u2013 Jenn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh got curious with the reality changes now. Since Jenn was not present when he swapped with his mother and thought that this were his legs, he wanted to know how he got the wound in this reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, how did I get this wound?\" \u2013 Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should I know? You were perfectly fine when I was with you.\" \u2013 Jenn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Wanted to see how the reality changes worked but forgot that my mom got the wound after you left. You couldn\u2019t know.\" \u2013 Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask your sisters. Anyway, going to bed now. Night.\" \u2013 Jenn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh wished his friend a good night as well and put the phone away. He could ask his sisters but was he really curious enough to do that right now? </span></div></div>",

Before leaving his room, he took a quick look inside the mirror. During the whole talk and swap with his mother and the chat with Jenn, he had forgotten to get dressed at least completely. He was still wearing his pants, which now hid his mother's legs, but from the waist up he was only dressed in a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that Courtney wouldn't have seen breasts before, but I think I should cover up either way\", he thought and went back to his wardrobe. It was late already, so Josh decided to simply pull out a silky blue pajama top. It clashed with his pants, but he could not find a matching pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenn probably still has it, since she kept her lower half\", he shrugged and put the top on. He had to admit that he could get used to the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed he walked outside and began looking for his sisters. The door of their room was locked and Josh was not really excited to interrupt them while their changing. So, he decided to first check the living room if one of them can be found there. Luckily for him, Courtney was, watching a  show about models or something like that. He did not really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sis\u201d, he greeted her and sat down on the couch beside her. \u201cStupid question but do you know how I injured my leg?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you so stupid that you forgot?\u201d, Courtney asked, annoyed to be disturbed while watching her show. \u201cIf it keeps you quiet: You dropped your knife during dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you're right. Thanks\", he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, the reality just changed as minimal as possible\u201d, he thought. \u201cThe wound had been inflicted DURING dinner instead of during the preparation of it. Kinda disappointing, but that makes it at least easier to imagine what went on in this changed reality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I could have breasts as big as hers...\u201d, muttered Courtney, referring to a model she just saw on TV. With a quick look over to her brother she added: \u201cGod, I would even take my brother's breasts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh who was too busy with his thoughts and did not even listen to his sister.

She looked at him with a raised eyebrow but then shrugged her shoulders and turned her attention back to her TV Show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should try something more interesting with Jenn next time. I'm rather curious how these reality changes work\", he thought. \"Though I guess most changes will be something like \u201aIt was always this way', I guess. At least it seemed that way when I talked to mom and Jenn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had auto piloted himself back to his room. \"I guess I should go to bed. It\u2019s not like I can play videogames or surf the safely with mom's computer knowledge\", he thought and began changing into some brown pajama pants. Again, they clashed with Jenn's pajama top he had put on easier, not that he cared right now. He simply wanted to sleep and let it be tomorrow. Tomorrow afternoon he would have his upper body back and come evening he probably would get his legs back. Then he would only have to live with his mother's computer knowledge and everything will be back to normal. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned the light off but could not sleep. His mind was racing. On one Hand he thought about how he had helped his mother. His power could really help people. He just had to be careful who he would help. Helping the wrong Person and he would be stuck with whatever he swapped with. Just like he was currently stuck as half a Jenn for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I could do an insurance swap or something\u2026 But then I'd have to know the person better\", he thought. \"It's best if I only swap with people I trust for now. To help them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole thought had brought him back to his body though. His round, perky breasts he currently possessed. They were his right now. So why not enjoy them for now? Besides, if he felt really guilty for using Jenn's upper body, he could offer her some swaps tomorrow. Everything was fine. With a sheepish grin he began messaging them and awakened his little friend. He continued to play with his mismatched body until he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Josh awoke with his bed sheets cast to the side and his pajama top and pants misplaced, showing off most of his skin. At first, he was confused by the strange pulling feeling on his chest and the tickle on his neck before remembering the strange day yesterday. His meeting with the old lady, studying with Jenn, swapping with Jenn and his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill slightly sleepy, he got up and looked at his alarm clock. 8 am. It was sooner as he usually woke up on the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again, I went to bed earlier as usual\", he thought as waved stray locks of black hair out of his face. \"Can't go to sleep anyway, so why not get up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big yawn he straightened his mismatched pajama and went downstairs to grab something for breakfast. He was not really surprised as he found his sister Courtney already awake and eating her cereals, while his mother dressed, in a bathrobe with make-up on her face and her hair already done in a fashionable way, fixed her daughter's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical pageant morning\", he thought and grabbed some cereals for himself, after greeting his mother and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're up early\", said his mother without looking up from Courtney's hair. \"Thanks again for, you know what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\", replied Josh and took seat at the table. \"I'm happy to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney looked at Josh for a moment, probably curious what this was all about, but then looked back at her cereals. She had to concentrate on her pageant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what will you be doing today?\", asked his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenn and I are going to see a movie this afternoon\", he told her in between shoving food into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds nice. I hope you to behave\", she said with a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. We set things straight today\", he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\", nodded his mother before completely turning her attention back to Courtney's hair. Josh silently ate and watched interested. He had never really cared when his mother was helping his sister to get ready for her beauty pageants but now, he was rather curious. Maybe it had something to do with having long, feminine hair himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney finished her breakfast before Josh and just in time as her mother finished her hair. Her hair was pinned up and had several pearls braided into it. He was mildly curious what the theme of today's pageant was but not curious enough to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth his sister and mother left the kitchen and went upstairs to finish their outfits. When Josh was finished, he pondered what to do with his morning. Gaming was out of the picture, so he would probably watch TV. He was too afraid to browse the web, if he was not careful, he would probably catch some viruses with his mother's lack of expertise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and decided he would shower first, so he went upstairs, past the room his sisters shared where he could hear shuffling as Courtney got ready. Then\u2026</span></div></div>",

Josh was pretty much completely female at this point as he looked over his new lower body.<br>\r\nHe once again had his mom's vagina, which felt really awkward to him, but now he also had his mom's feminine hips and legs dressed in some comfortable mom jeans, his hips and butt felt a lot bigger than his own, which caught him a bit off guard, as he saw his mom's petite feet on the end of his new legs with her 'at home' slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom on the other hand now had his lower body, he could notice his former equipment in the pants his mom was now wearing. Her curves were much more masculine and her feet were a bit bigger, but she was now wearing Jenn's shoes, since Josh swapped that with her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't disagree it is interesting at least.\" Josh said forcing a smile to his mom.<br>\r\n\"I think I made a good choice, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n\"If you're happy with it, you have.\"<br>\r\n\"You don't like it?\"<br>\r\n\"I have my MOM's lower body, of course I don't really like it, it's really awkward.\"<br>\r\n\"Give it some time, you will get used to it.\"<br>\r\n\"Give it some time?

He noticed how softer it felt, probably due to having more flesh around his butt right now. \"What did I get myself into?\", he sighed, already getting used to his now higher pitched voice. Rubbing his forehead with his manicured hand, Josh thought about what he should do next. He was completely a woman right, an amalgamation of Jenn and his mother and he had no idea how long he had to stay like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can at least get Jenn to swap back with me\", he thought as his eye casually glanced over his phone laying on his desk. \"That way I can be me again, at least half of me... And I don't have to tell mom that. She'll think I still have Jenn's upper body... Yeah, that's a great idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith new found energy, Josh jumped up his bed and stumbled forward to his desk, not being accustomed to the different balance of his body and sprinting towards his desk did not make it any easier to maintain balance. Thankfully he was able to catch himself by grabbing unto his desk. With a sigh of relief, he grabbed his phone and without a second thought called Jenn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why are you calling?\", asked Jenn. \"Don't worry, I didn't say anything to my mom. Don't want her to think we were doing naughty things over at yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\", sighed Josh in relief. \"Unfortunately, I had to tell my mom about my power and am now stuck with her lower half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? So, you have her penis right now?\", asked Jenn gloatingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that penis is mine. I guess you wouldn't notice the swap since you were not present. Just believe me that me having shapely legs and a vagina is not normal\", he explained and noticed a skirt lying on top of his desk chair. He had truly gained everything from his mother below the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to believe, but fine. So that's why you called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I wanted to ask if you could swap back with me. My mom wants to teach me a lesson and I don't want to be completely female. If I swap back, she'll think I still have your upper body half and be off my back, thinking I had a learning experience or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long pause, Jenn said...</span></div></div>",

So, let\u2019s study\", Jenn suggested and even for Josh these words sounded strange coming out of his mouth. He would have never suggested studying! Then again, it was neither his mouth nor his voice anymore, so could this really be strange?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\", he replied in Jenn\u2019s voice. He was not in the mood of swapping more with Jenn, so it was better that the two were now studying than having her persuade him into another swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, they made themselves comfortable on the ground where they had enough room for their notes and books. It was also then that they noticed that their skill swap had more consequences than Josh being able to walk in heels. At first Jenn was confused when she looked at her notes. While everything regarding the subject was correct, it looked messier, the handwriting especially. Josh\u2019s notes on the other hand were neatly written and structured but had more mistakes than Jenn had thought humanly possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, write something!\u201d, ordered Jenn and pushed a pen in Josh\u2019s smaller hand. Confused he complied and soon understood why she ordered him to do so. Without concentrating, his handwriting had drastically improved! In fact, it actually looked a lot like Jenn\u2019s handwriting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe swapped all our skills!\u201d, exclaimed Jenn surprised. \u201cMy handwriting skill. My orthography skill. Thinking about it, you probably also know how to apply make-up, because I certainly don\u2019t anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my notes are all incorrect. Shouldn't I also now know everything about biology?\", asked Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn shook her head. \"I suppose that would fall under 'knowledge', hence why my notes are messy but correct, while yours are incorrect but nice to look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\", he sighed. \"And for a moment I had hope that I don't have to study anymore\u2026 Hey\u2026 How about we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", interrupted Jenn. \"I won't make it so easy for you. Especially since I would lose with that trait. Now come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike always they began talking about what the latest class was about, went through some older stuff and so on. Like always, Josh was not very concentrated, but the reason was a different one this time. This time he was distracted by the different feelings of his new female upper half. The hair was annoying for sure, always falling in front of his face, forcing him to push it back behind his ears. He wished Jenn had her hair in a ponytail prior to their swap but he had no idea if she had a scrunchie on her or if he could find one in his room now. Looking at his different, manicured hands was also distracting, not to mention holding a pen with said nails. But the most distracting thing were definitely his new acquired breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every motion they were swinging back and forth, thanks to the lack of a bra. Thankfully he had Jenn's skills and thus knew how to move and keep the swinging to a minimum, but it was still distracting. He also felt the urge to touch and squeeze them, but obviously could not with Jenn sitting in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a break\", he announced and got up. \"I'm going to the bathroom really quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn looked at him and grinned, full well knowing what he wanted to do.</span></div></div>",

Looking at his chest confirmed that he was only imaging it, as not the slightest bump was indicating that his heart was trying to get out, only his heavy breathing was giving his condition away. This of course made him even more excited, looking directly at the breasts of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe casually registered how strange Jenn looked in his shirt and her face devoid of any makeup. How strange he looked with Jenn's upper body on his lower body. The main processing power of his brain was concentrated on something else though: The nipples of his newly acquired breasts were now pushing the fabric of his shirt outward, resulting in even more arousal on his end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unbelievable\u2026\", he muttered and got closer to the mirror, still not believing that the Jenn he was currently looking at was a reflection of his own appearance and not the real one. Seeing Jenn copy his every move, even the faintest twitch, was horrifying yet strangely arousing. He extended his hand towards Jenn's face but was unable to reach it as Jenn was mimicking his move and their hands met. The coldness of the mirror told Josh that everything was real. He really was half Jenn. His hand moved away from the mirror towards his chest. The closer he came to the alien orbs that were fastened on it, the more his hand began to tremble and the more his heartbeat and breathing accelerated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of him told him to stop. This was Jenn's body, half of it at least, and he should not violate it like this. A bigger part encouraged him to continue though. It was not her body anymore. If he controlled it, it was his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing wrong if I look at my body, right?\", he thought and groped his right breast. He winced as he applied to much pressure at first. He tried squeezing it gently and felt a pleasurable feeling running through his body. Brushing over his now rock-hard nipple got him even more excited and his other hand went down into his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis excitement continued to grow as he made the necessary pleasurable movements on his new upper body as well as his old lower body. The feeling was overwhelming, out of this world. Josh tried to be as quiet as possible, almost an impossibility in his opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking you so long Josh?\", he suddenly heard his old voice say, making him startled. He winced in pain as he tightened his grabs too much in his surprise. Jenn of course had noticed that this took way longer than his usual bathroom breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't rush me!\", he replied embarrassed and did what he told Jenn he was in here for. He suspected she knew what he was doing right now. \"Didn't her voice sound teasing?\", he thought. With a shrug he finished his business, washed his hands which felt familiar and strange at the same time, and reunited with Jenn who had a big grin on her face which Josh tried to ignore.</span></div></div>",

He was however surprised to suddenly see it dangling inches from his face as Jenn stood up and pulled her pants and underwear down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool.\" Jenn said wrapping one of her hands around her new penis and slowly stroking it. \"Isn't this cool Josh?\" she asked looking over to where he was still sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, cool, whatever.

He also figured it would be difficult to masturbate with it and even though 99.9% wanted his penis back, there was that smallest bit of curiosity hiding within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this news, Jenn jumped for joy. \"Thankyouthankyouthankyou!\" Josh was surprised at how excited she was, because she had a tendency to talk fast but only when she was really excited. She pulled Josh into a big hug. However, Josh suddenly felt something pressing against his upper leg mid-hug. He looked down to see Jenn had an erection. \"Whoops, sorry!\" She said, embarrassed and blushing. Breaking up the hug, she reached down within her pants to her groin area and tried to fix it so there was no tent coming from her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, that's normal for every guy. Including me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, cool. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to use the bathroom.\" Jenn said with a smirk on her face. She went to a bathroom in the hall and not the one connected to Josh's room in order to get some extra privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething crossed Josh's mind after Jenn left the room. They had only traded their genitals, which he was pretty sure didn't add sexuality as well. And, she had gotten a hard-on when they hugged. Was it possible that she was sexually attracted to him? He sure hoped so, but Jenn had also made it clear before that she just wanted to be friends. Maybe she was hiding her feelings though, she wasn't the most outgoing person after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in thought, Josh snapped back to reality when his boxers felt a bit damp to him. \"Great!\" He said out loud as he peaked inside. \"I should probably change these now.\"</span></div></div>",

He's just stepped out of his damp boxers and was reaching for the clean pair when he heard a gasp from the doorway. Jenn had returned a lot quicker than he's thought she would and was standing there staring at his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice butt there Josh.\" Jenn said stepping into his room and closing the door behind her. Josh turned to face her and quickly covered his crotch with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just...\" Josh started before Jenn cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just checking out your new goods?\" Jenn interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Changing my underwear. Do you mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I don't mind at all.\" Jenn said with a mischievous grin. \"In fact, I think it's kind of sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was startled by this and looking down at her crotch he could see the evidence that she was telling the truth: Her penis was very erect and stretching the fabric of her pants obscenely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Josh asked somewhat shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Definitely. Like I said you've got a nice ass. And this.\" she said caressing her penis through her pants, \"definitely likes what you've got going on behind your hands there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked down at where his hands were covering his crotch and slowly brought them away from his crotch and held them to his sides. It was the first time he'd ever seen a pussy in real life and even though it was his own at the moment, it was still pretty exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Josh,\" Jenn said taking a step closer to him, \"I know that you've had a crush on me for a while. And honestly I've thought about us being together a few times but it just didn't feel right before.\" By now she was standing right in front of him, only inches away. \"But now, I don't know. Something is different this time. This time I really want to...\" she never finished her sentence instead leaning forward and kissing him full on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh reach forward and pulled her body against his own. It was the first time either of them had ever kissed anyone before and though it started out awkwardly they soon got the hang of it. Josh was surprised the first time he felt Jenn's hands caress his still naked buttocks but he quickly recovered and reciprocated by sliding his hand down the back of Jenn's pants and grab her butt as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued this way for several minutes, kissing and feeling each other's body. Josh reveled in the feeling of Jenn's body pressed against his. He could feel her breasts pressing hard against his own. Due to their heights being exactly the same, thanks to swapping half of their heights, he felt her erection pushing against his own groin and though he thought he would be disgusted by it he actually felt really aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was momentarily disappointed when he felt Jenn shift her hips backward so that her penis wasn't pushing against him anymore. Suddenly his disappointment was replaced with a sense of shock and and even stronger sense of pleasure as he felt Jenn slip one of her fingers between his labia and begin to stroke his clitoris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's knees started to buckle from the unexpected and overwhelming pleasure that was running through him. Jenn took advantage of Josh being off balance and gave him a small push backward onto his bed. Josh lay there catching his breath, naked from the waist down, and legs spread wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh heard a shuffling sound and looked to see that Jenn had slid her pants off as well, her penis standing fully erect and straight out from her body now that her pants weren't holding it back anymore. She approached the bed her eyes locked on Josh's pussy and he knew exactly what she wanted.</span></div></div>",

Yet another flash filled the room, but nothing appeared to be different when everything was visible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it not work?\" Asked Jenn, who noticed the lack of a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm guessing it did.

He quickly found a blue, 'retro' looking 'School House Rock' T-shirt and slipped it over his head.  Taking a moment to look at himself in the mirror, Josh certainly didn't look any different.  Deep down, he was afraid that he would be blue and have fiery red hair.  He breathed a sigh of relief to find that he looked, well like himself, no blue skin and no fiery red hair.  Having enough of looking himself in the mirror, Josh decided it was time to get his game on.  Going over to his dresser, he turned on his Playstation to see if any of his friends were on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than he logged into his account, Josh had a text message waiting for him on his phone.  Picking it up to see who it was.  \"Wonder what Kira wants?\"  Josh wondered to himself as he opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Josh noticed that you logged in.

Checking it he read.  '<i>Actually, I have some homework to do and Jenn won't let me leave until I get it done.'</i>  Josh sighed as he read it and knew that Jenn could be that way.  Always putting homework and school ahead of fun and games, but this is what he liked most about her.  Just then, a small light bulb went off above Josh's head.  If this power was in fact true, he decided to go over to Jenn and Kira's to see if it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to see what Kira thought about it.  <i>'How about I come over and help you out and then we can play</i>.'

He hoped Kira or really somebody other than Jenn would be the one to let him in, as he knew she wouldn't be happy to know Josh was coming over to play video games with his sister. Even if she was starting to come around. He eventually heard someone walking to the door within the house and it turned out to be Kira. \"Hey Josh, glad you could make it.\" She opened the door and let him in. \"I've made some progress on my homework, there's just a couple of problems that have me confused. Once you help me we can get right into playing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed her upstairs. \"Sounds good. Where's Jenn?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she and my parents just left. They're driving to the airport since my father's going on a business trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was a skeptical about how Kira's parents would feel if they knew she was home alone with a boy. Especially since he was around 4 years older. But he had no cruel intentions and he remembered if Jenn and her parents would trust anyone it would be him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira sat at her desk and Josh stood beside her, guiding her through the problems. He were easy for him since they were 6th grade level problems, but he made sure she understood. As they went though his mind started to wander. He couldn't help but think about his encounter with the elderly woman earlier. He was intrigued by what she had said, but the concept seemed too ridiculous to be true. He maintained enough focus to help finish the problems, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they started playing it became a different story. Josh had already showed her the 'spot' he had messaged her about. But after that, he couldn't keep his eyes on the game and Kira started to destroy him over and over. \"Are you okay Josh? You're normally better than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? Because I'm winning.\" She pointed out. Josh just nodded a yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Josh continued to die over and over, Kira started to get concerned. \"Your not okay Josh I can tell. Anything you want to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just figured he could get it off of his chest, and then let it go afterward since there was no chance she would believe him. He admitted what was wrong and told her the entire story. From missing the bus, to meeting the elderly woman, to his good deed, to receiving his 'gift.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's cool! We should try it out.\" Kira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you believe me?!?\" He asked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it wouldn't hurt to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should try swapping ______!\" She exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just for a couple of days.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine.\" He said, which triggered a bright but brief flash. He then found himself sitting where Kira had been and he was wearing her clothes. He was wearing a white long sleeved shirt that felt tight, a white bra underneath, a black pair of sweatpants, and a white pair of panties that matched her bra. He also had pink fuzzy slippers she had on before the swap. Kira was typically a casual dresser, especially when she was at home lounging around, but she was willing to doll herself up every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira now sported Josh's wardrobe which included his blue 'schoolhouse rock' shirt, and her hair was down since Josh didn't wear hair ties. Josh was pretty sure it was the first time he'd ever seen Kira's hair down. It looked identical to Jenn's, only lighter in color. The amazing part about the clothes swap was the clothes were resized to fit their original bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is so cool!

When the match started, the both of them were on the edge of their seat, trying their best to vanquish the other player in order to claim victory.  The match lasted a lot longer than Josh had expected.  For the next 10 minutes, the cat and mouse game continued, with each player losing a small amount of health during each exchange.  Soon the final altercation happened.

He'd been playing this game for the past couple years, while she had only been playing it for the last 6 months, at least.  In the eyes of an outside observer, it was a total upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\"  Josh stammered looking at the screen, not really knowing how to handle it.  \"I totally had you in my sights, but this remote of yours.\"  He looked down at the remote in his hands, thinking that it was the perfect scapegoat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"  Kira giggled as she nudged him in the side.  \"I know for a fact that remote is as good as the one that you have at home.  So don't be such a bad loser and blame it.\"  She scolded him.  \"Speaking of which, it's time to pay up.\"  She got up and found that she was the same height as Josh, when he was sitting down.  Looking him over, she knew what she wanted and decided to see if he would go along with his wager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked at her in the eyes and noticed that they were the same color as Jenn's.

Never being the type of person to go back on a bet, he nodded his head.  \"Okay, I will swap my height with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?  I think I don't want that now.\"  She replied with a malicious chuckle, which caused Josh to second guess his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you want then?\"  He asked, afraid of what he was about to hear.  '<i>Was it going to be his dick?</i>' He thought to himself, as he absentmindedly brought his hand down to his crotch in an effort to block it from her view and to keep it out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira acted like she was thinking about what she was going to get from him, but actually she already knew what she wanted.  \"I want to swap our gaming abilities.\"  She stated as she crossed her arms across her chest and cocked her hip a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh chuckled a bit at her demand.  \"What do you want to do that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my reasons.\"  She exclaimed.  \"Come on, let's swap them.\"  She kept the pressure on him, in an effort to get what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I agree to swap our gaming abilities.\"  He succumbed.  After muttering the phrase, a bright light filled the room causing the two of them to cover their eyes in an attempt to protect them.  Several seconds passed before they were able to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\"  Kira asked, not really knowing if she got what she wanted.  \"I don't feel any different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's only one way to find out.\"  Josh surmised as he picked up the remote.  \"Let's try out another round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we can do that and if I win, can I try to gt something else?\"  Kira asked, trying her best to get him to say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it worked, but sure why not.\"  Josh shrugged as he tussled Kira's hair, much like he would do with Courtney to piss her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing her best to fix her hair, Kira sat down right next to him and started up the next match.</span></div></div>",

Looking at the level, she felt at ease, almost as if she knew what to expect and where to best hide to wait for her target.  Strangely enough she'd only played this area once or twice before.  When she was able to spawn her character, Kira instinctively started to make her way to the multi story building to have a great vantage point of the area.  She stopped for a moment.  'How did I know that?'

She could see the gears moving in his head.  Looking below her hiding spot she could see something moving and bringing up her rifle with scope she could see Josh's avatar.  He appeared to be looking for a spot to lie in wait, all in an attempt to get the better of her and win the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, because I'm about to find a great spot to wait...\"  Within that quick span of time his screen had a spray of red.  \"What the hell?\"  He exclaimed glancing up at his health bar and noticed that it was now missing over 85% of his health.  Looking over at Kira, Josh noticed that her smiled seemed devious in knowing that she almost one shotted him with a head shot.  It was almost as if she had been planning this entire thing.  \"You did this?  But how?\"  He wondered out loud looking back to the screen and attempting to get out of her line of sight.  Scrambling around the open area in trying to find a hiding spot to avoid her line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to look where you're going.\"  Kira warned chuckling slightly.  \"You'll never know what will jump out and bite you.\"  Josh could feel his remote vibrate once again and noticed that the screen went back to the declaration screen showing the winner of the match.  Kira seemed to be beaming with joy at her latest win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\"  Josh asked over at Kira.  \"That was my favorite area and I didn't seem to know much about it.\"  Everything from the past 10 minutes seemed to flash back to him.  The previous game and what Kira wanted from him.  \"Give it back.\"  He protested over to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give what?\"  She asked, acting as if she didn't know what he was talking about.  \"All I see is that I'm the winner again and you.\"  She leaned over playfully nudging him in the side, almost as if she was egging him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know full well what I'm talking about.  I want my gaming abilities back.\"  He told her with a hint of anger in his voice, scooting away to get out of her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you do another swap with me, I will give them back to you.\"  Kira bargained, hoping to get what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that he either had to working at getting his skills better, yet again, or barter with Kira so that he can get wanted back from her.  \"Fine.\"  He responded with a sigh.  He thought about keeping her gaming skills and working them back up to his standard, but he didn't know how long it would take or if he would be the same after he did.  \"What is it that you want?  I just hope it's not anything that I will regret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, seriously it's not going to be that bad.\"  She replied back with a grin.  \"For you to get your gaming skills back, I want us to swap ________.\"</span></div></div>",

Honestly, I'm tired of being treated like the youngest child.\"  She then let out an exasperated sigh to help let out her frustration.  \"I've only recently been able to convince my Mom in letting me stay home by myself.  As a matter of fact, if she found out that you came over, I will probably have that taken away too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't know what to think and was speechless.  Then he thought about how easy Bri and Courtney had it compared to him.  Not having to do as many chores and still get their allowance, when they didn't want to do something all they had to do was complain a little and possibly throw in a puppy eye here and there.  \"I don't see what the big fuss is about.\"  He replied to her with a shrug of the shoulders, almost as if he was brushing away her complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira looked over at him with a faint glimmer in her eye.  \"Well, I guess you don't have too much to lose then, huh?\"  She grinned, knowing that she would soon not be treated like the youngest daughter, but instead as a teenager that she was soon to be.  Trying to push it along she looked back over at Josh.  \"I want to swap the way people treat and see us for your gaming abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will make it so that I get them back, right?\"  He asked, trying to be sure that everything will go back to being somewhat normal and that he would be able to play the games that he enjoyed so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but only if you agree to swap what I wanted.\"  Kira pointed out to him, waiting for him to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not.\"  Josh confirmed and added.  \"It might make things easier on me, so I agree to swap those with you.\"  He chuckled but soon found the light blinding them both.  After they were able to see again, Josh, wondering if he got his gaming skills back.  Thinking back to the previous level that he played with Kira and knew of several different locations where he could easily lie in wait for easy shots from several different directions.  \"Looks like I got my game abilities back.\"  He chuckled looking over at Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it.\"  Kira replied looking around the room to see if she could find anything that meant that they swapped the other trait that she wanted to get rid of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh noticing that Kira was looking for something couldn't help but ask.  \"What are you looking for?\"  But soon felt his phone vibrating in his pocket.  Taking it out, he could see that it was his Mom.  \"Hold on, I need to answer this before I get grounded.\"  he swiped the screen to accept the call.  \"Yeah, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you young lady?\"  Kim demanded to her oldest child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm over at Jenn's.\"  He replied, deciding to keep quiet that Jenn wasn't there and he was just here with Kira, thinking that it would get him in trouble. <i>'Wait, did she just call me young lady?'</i>  He thought to himself finding it a little odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I need for you to come home now.\"  Kim said with an exasperated tone in her voice.  \"I come home to find your sisters here, but you're gone.  Just hurry up and come home and see if Jenn will walk you home or even Kira, he's always nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.. Okay.\"  Josh let out, not really knowing what was going on.  He put the phone up and looked over at Kira.  \"Uh...  I need you to walk me home.\"  He replied, blushing slightly at having to ask his sister's friend to walk him home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that?\"  Kira wondered as she went to go get her shoes and found that they appeared to be different than they used to be.  Normally her Mom would buy her pink or purple shoes, since it was 'becoming of a young woman' to wear.  Not wanting to say anythings, she just put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Mom just said it.\"  Josh answered with a shrug of his shoulders not wanting to go more into it.  \"Come on, lets go before I get grounded.  Kira looked down at his shoes and noticed that they were slightly pink with purple highlights, much like the ones that she would normally wear.</span></div></div>",

She didn't have any problem as people treated her like a 15 year old boy instead of a little girl walking home alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh,\" Kim lectured, \"what were you doing going to Jenn's house alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kira called and I was just going over to play video games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unescorted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She isn't that far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have to cross a street that is too far to go alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM,\" Josh whined.

Something is really wrong here.  But he didn't realize the extent of what had happened until he got to 'his room.'  It wasn't his room anymore.  None of his things were there.  It looked like a guestroom as it was decorated in neutral colors with none of his personal things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is happening,' he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he realized through some sort of intuition that his room wasn't his room anymore.  He shared the girl's room with his two sisters, Bri and Courtney.  Josh walked the few steps to his new room to find that not only that he shared a room with his sisters, but he shared a bed with Bri and most of his wardrobe with Courtney.</span></div></div>",

As he reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone, he felt somebody grab it from his hand.  \"I will take that.\"  Kim replied as she grabbed it from his hand and put it away so that he couldn't get to it.  \"You can get it when you learn to act like the young lady that I raised you to be.  I need to know when you're not going to be at home so that I can keep track of you.\"  She looked over at her son, who was only an inch shorter than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"  Josh interrupted, but was cut short by his own Mom, who was holding up a finger.  It was something that she usually did when she wanted to say something, but haven't done it to him since he was younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm talking and you shouldn't interrupt.\"  She reminded him.  \"Look.\"  She sighed as she brought her hands up to her head, in an attempt to relieve a small headache that started to develop when she got home and found out that Josh wasn't there.  \"I know you don't like having to share a room with your other sisters, but its good for you and your character.  I shared a room with my sister growing up and we turned out to be the bestest of friends when we grew up.\"  She brought her hands up to Josh's hair and started to rub it in a loving manner, one that she would usually use with her daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about I get my own room?\"  Josh suggested to her, in an attempt to get it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anybody is going to get their own room, it would have to be Courtney.\"  Kim suggested to him.  \"With her being the oldest one in the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't know how to take this.  Even though he was the physically older than his siblings, thanks to Kira's swap, he was seen as a 11 year old girl.  \"But of course.\"  He said out loud, mostly to him self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look maybe this weekend we will go look at getting a bunk bed so that you don't have to share a bed with Bri.\"  Kim offered.  \"I know you've been wanting to do that for a while and now that I got a small bonus this week, we will finally be able to do it.  Or maybe something even better.\"  Kim said out loud, Josh looked over to her to see what she had in mind.  \"When I was your age, I was able to join girl scouts and that helped shape me into the woman that I am today.  Your sisters never wanted to join up and it would mean the world to me if you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought about it for a moment and decided that it wouldn't be too bad if it meant that he would be back in the good graces of his Mom.  Hell, he might even get his phone back so that he can fix this mess with Kira.  \"Sure Mom.  I think it would be great.\"  He lied, but wanting to keep his Mom happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Kim shouted out with a bit of surprise in her voice.  \"You mean it?\"  She watched as Josh nodded his head, she was so happy that she enveloped him in a huge embrace.  \"Thank you so much.  Now I get to know what Amber feels with her little one being in scouts.  I will give her a call to see how soon we can join.\"  She gave him another deep hug to show her appreciation and made her way to her room to give her co worker a call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I didn't just open a can of worms.\"  Josh said to himself as he made his way back down stairs to the living room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh instinctively knew what was his stuff in his new room.  He found that everything he owned had become distinctly juvenile and somewhat girly.    The 'violent' video games that were meant for teens and above he didn't have anymore, although he did have some racing games. He also had games that he must have gotten as gifts that he didn't intend on playing ever.  On his computer, (or at least his account on the family computer in his sister's room, Josh found that his access was limited by the net nanny type program that was on there.  It had been on his computer too before the swap, but his restrictions had been increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found that his new life was somewhat tomboyish.  It looked like he had his things, but his parents particularly his mother was trying to make him accept things of a more girly nature.  She thought this tomboy phase would pass in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest shock was that he was no longer in high school.  He was back as a sixth grader in grammar school.  What he swapped was more profound than swapping ages, since he swapped how he was being treated and that effected more than something as simple as his perceived age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bedtime was an hour and a half earlier than it had been.  He looked through his nightwear and selected blue cotton pajamas which had unicorns on them.  Most of his nightwear was tomboyish, meaning cotton PJs, but there were a few in girly colors, or some made of nylon and even one nightgown which didn't seem to get much wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was time for bed, his Mom entered the room and gave everyone a kiss.  She hadn't given him a kiss before bedtime for quite some time.  It was then that she informed him of the good news, \"You start Girl Scouts Thursday.  You'll be in the Juniors group.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled back at his mother like he was enjoying the news and said \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce lights were out, Josh couldn't go to sleep, he started to think about his new life.  He knew how it had changed and what was expected of him.  He found that his new life was the conflict between what he wanted to do and what people expected him to do.  Much like it had been for Kira.  The problem was worse for him though since he still had the maturity of a fifteen year old and he was in fact really a boy.  Everyone expected him to act his age and give up his tomboyish ways, something he didn't want to do.  Kira on the other hand wanted to be treated like she was older even though she didn't have the maturity to handle it.  But as far as being a girl, she didn't have a problem with that, she was a girl in body and spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest problem was that adults wouldn't listen to what he had to say.  They would mostly talk about his looks.  How pretty he was, or how much prettier he would be if he wore this or that.  This is why Kim was so happy that Josh was going to join the girl scouts.  She saw this as his first step away from being a tomboy and into becoming a young lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis swap also effected his sisters in two ways.  First was that he now lived in their room as there wasn't any reason to keep them separate rooms as they were all preteen girls.  The other thing was that since there wasn't a teen in the house, they had to attend after school programs (i.e. day care) until their mom got home.  Also, Courtney was now considered the 'big sister' which changed how she treated her two younger sisters.  She felt more self important as the oldest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this awaited Josh.</span></div></div>",

Just an hour prior, her Mom wouldn't let her walk alone without some sort of supervision, be in bed by 8:30, and plus she was wanting her to join the girl scouts in an attempt to help out the community.  But deep inside, Kira felt like her Mom just wanted her to be more like her sister.  It was then that she felt a vibration coming from her pocket.  Reaching down into her pocket, she was certainly loving these deeper pockets in her boy jeans, Kira then pulled out the phone noticing that it was Jenn.  \"Hello?\"  She replied into the smart phone, not knowing what to expect in this new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bro.\"  Jenn's voice called out from the other line.  \"Just letting you know that Mom brought home pizza for dinner and we're eating now.  Did you still want help with the biology homework?\"  She asked trying to see if she needed to free up some time that night in order to help her brother out with some questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think I'm good.\"  Kira answered back, not really knowing what she was talking about.  She hadn't taken biology yet, but was certainly having trouble with Social Studies.  \"I'll be home soon, I was just walking a friend home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that was nice of you.\"  Jenn complimented.  \"Yeah, I will see you soon.\"  She heard the line go dead and she put up the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot looking where she was going, a girl around the same age as her had accidentally ran into her as she was chasing her sister.  \"Sorry sir.\"  She smiled to Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem.\"  Kira replied while returning the smile.  \"Just watch where you're going.\"  The girl nodded her head and continued her chase after her sister.

It wasn't until she was half way through that she realized that neither her mom not her sister was saying anything or giving her dirty looks over her eating style.  No longer were they saying eat slower or take smaller bites.  \"This is what I have been talking about,\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next 'surprise' was that she now has her own room.   It was filled with video games and sports memorabilia as well as other things that had always been hers.  She remembered going to sporting events with her dad.  She found She was closer to him than she was before the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her computer she could access sites she wasn't permitted before.  She could stay up later.  In her drawers, her clothes were still 'girl's' clothing, but it was all unisex.  She didn't own a skort, dress, too without sleeves or even leggings.Her wardrobe now consisted most of jeans and tshirts , and to a lesser slacks and button down shirts.  She owned a couple pairs of PJs but she didn't wear them if it was warm, preferring only wearing boxers and an undershirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter playing a video game, Kids decided to talk to her sister to see if they were still close.  She entered Jenn's closed door to find her changing.  She had done this before too many times to count.  But this time, Jenn crossed her arms over her chest.  \"Do you know to knock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I'm sorry.  It's nothing important.  I'm come back later. \"  Kira was embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her biggest shock came when she went to school.  She attended high school now.  Her friends were mostly boys.  She got along better with them than Josh did with her friends since she has a love of video games in common with them.  The shock was when a girl was openly (and physically) flirting with her.  This girl didn't flirt as openly with Josh since he was saying Jenn.  But Jenn was Kira's sister, this they weren't dating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, Theresa, was hot for Josh and now she sees her opportunity with an unattached Kira.  When she saw her, not only did she give Kids a hug, jamming her boobs into Kira's chest, but she also kissed her On the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

This meant that his friends were all girls.  He acted cordial to them, but he tried to avoid too much contact.  He didn't want to insult them or make them feel bad, this wasn't their fault.  The boys treated him like a girl which meant that they ignored him for the most part and teased him when they could get away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost impossible to contact Kira.  His phone was still confiscated as part of his punishment.  But even more than that, he didn't have time.  After school he was in 'daycare' although it wasn't called that.  After that when he was home he was watched like a little girl and couldn't get away to make a phone call.  At least not a phone call to a 'fifteen year old boy' as Kira was now thought of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did join Girl Scouts, but he didn't like it.  There wasn't much that was fun to do, it was all arts and crafts and silly merit badges.  He wished he could play ball or do what boys would be doing, but not in Girl Scouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one girl who Josh hung out with a bit.  Her name was Clarissa.  She wasn't too tall but she was playing in a softball league.  She played well but didn't like it.  Her father wanted to have a boy, so he had her try out for softball when she was in Kindergarten and he wouldn't let her quit.  She had all the skills needed to play but not the desire.  She wished he was in Girl Scouts instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a way that we could switch activities,\" Josh told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Dad won't let me.  I tried.  I asked him dozens of time.  He won't let me join Girl Scout, even if I stay in softball too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guarantee he won't have a problem with it.  All you have to do is agree with me to swap and you won't have to play softball again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeap.\"  This would be a good swap for Josh.  It wasn't baseball but there wasn't anything wrong with softball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swap was made and Josh was out of Scouts.  After school he went to softball practice instead.  He was of course the best on his team, in the whole league really, he was still playing with a bunch of pre-teen girls and he was a fifteen year old boy.  But some of the girls could play and anything was better than Scouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Josh hadn't realized was how his change would effect his mother.  To make this swap possible, his mother had never been in Girl Scouts herself,  she played softball when she was younger instead.  She loved it and wished one of her children would join a league.  Josh joining was a dream come true to her.  She also had a new appreciation for baseball and other sports.  Josh swapping with Clarissa had changed Kim more than it changed Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't know whether to swap back with Clarissa to return his mom to normal, or to continue as he was.  Clarissa seemed to be having a great time at Scouts and didn't seem to want to swap back.  There was also a changed to her Dad.  He would think about it.  Maybe he would have to swap with someone else to get into Girl Scouts.  But his first priority was to swap back with Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh finally made his way through the rain over to the Marshall's. He come up the front steps and rang on their doorbell. He hoped Kira or really somebody other than Jenn would be the one to let him in, as he knew she wouldn't be happy to know Josh was coming over to play video games with his sister. Even if she was starting to come around. He eventually heard someone walking to the door within the house and it turned out to be Jenn. \"Hey Josh, what are you doing here, I thought I was supposed to come to your place later. No?\" She asked, still having yet to let him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonesty was something Jenn valued in their friendship, so Josh proceeded to tell the truth as always. \"Actually I came for Kira. She wanted help on her homework and then we were going to play some video games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" She said with a disappointing tone and a frown. But she finally did open the door and gesture for him to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she in her room?\" Josh asked after walking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually she's in the shower. The two of us were helping my mom bring in groceries and when he finished she ran out to close the trunk and she slipped and fell in the mud.\" Jenn explained while pointing to her hair as proof, which was still soaked from the rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that stinks.\" He said before the two burst in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come to my room though until she's out.\" Jenn said signaling for him to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got up there, Josh took a seat on the edge of her bed. \"So what should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I finished making flashcards to study for the upcoming biology test just as you got here. Perhaps you could quiz me until Kira returns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" He agreed. Jenn sat at her desk and handed him a thick stack of cards. \"You did this all in one sitting?\" He asked with astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've been working on them for the past week.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat surprised Josh even more since the test wouldn't be until the middle of the next week at the earliest. \"Anyway, question 1...\" He asked about 6 questions, all of which Jenn got correct. He loved the fact that she was so smart. That's one of the things he found most attractive about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to try a few?\" She asked in the interest of helping her friend as well as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh declined, not wanting to embarrass himself because he still had yet to start studying. He kept on with asking Jenn questions about unit the upcoming test was based of off. He noticed that Jenn was getting annoyed with her wet hair. She was trying to keep it behind her shoulders, which presented difficult since she had longer hair. He thought about telling her of his power, because he was dying to tell somebody and he wanted to see if it would really work. He figured she would be willing to trade off her hair since it was wet. As the questions went on, he started to wonder what Kira was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Josh?\" She asked, snapping her fingers in front of his face. \"It's been a minute since you last asked a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine, sorry.\" He told her, not having made up his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. I'm all good.\" He lied blatantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh we've been friends for years. I know when you're lying, just tell me what's up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured he would've ended up telling her eventually, so he just decided to get it off his chest. He went through the story from leaving school, to meeting the woman at the bus stop, to his good deed for her, and eventually her giving the 'gift' to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a load of bullhonkey.\" Jenn told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it does.\" The encounter was so weird and I was just dying to tell somebody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you. The story's actually kind of funny.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep asking myself though, 'what if the power was real?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're joking right? Josh it's not scientifically possible to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, but just tell me. If you could swap one thing with me right now, what would it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell me.\" He said in a softer tone, taking her left hand in his right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's so many options. Right now... I would swap hair since it's stiff right now.\" She answered thinking alike with Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done.\" Josh said and there was a surprising bright flash that filled Jenn's room. Once Josh regained his vision, he looked across from him to see that Jenn now had his shorter hairstyle in the exact same color he had! He remembered there was a mirror so that he could see himself in, if he looked past Jenn. Sure enough, he had a shade of black hair even darker than his brown which reached all the way down to his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... it worked!\" Jenn said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you.\" He responded, rubbing it in his friend's face. He had a feeling it would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Jenn checking her new hair out in the mirror. \"Something's off.\" She said before placing one hand atop her head and then one on his. \"Yep, my hair's still wet. Yours isn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh realized that she was right when he felt the long raven colored locks on his head. He found them to be dry. \"How could that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess since my hair was wet from I got groceries, it stayed that way since I was the one who did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not following.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Jenn reached for her wallet within one of her desk drawers. Then she pulled out her school ID. \"See, look.\" She pointed to her head in the picture. To his surprise, she had the same hair cut and color she was sporting at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could that be?\" He asked, shocked with the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think everything's been altered to make this seem normal and like we've always been like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there was no point in swapping then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, there was. Trust me. My hair will dry twenty times faster now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's good.\" He said. \"How long should we stay like this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just until my new hair dries, that should do the trick. I'll want it back then, though. I love my hair, just not when it's wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another thing Josh liked about Jenn. She had a confident about her look and didn't care about what others thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So should we continue quizzing?\" He questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No actually, I was wondering if we could make one more swap.\" She told him. \"I want to swap _______.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Would everybody see me as you?  Would I get your body?  Would I get your clothes or what?\"  She rambled on with her scientific mind going into overdrive trying to get to all the conclusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"  Josh looked a little overwhelmed.  \"I don't know.  How about we talk it over and see what else we can swap.  Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Josh was talking, Kira was starting to walk past the door and overheard part of their conversation.  \"What are you guys playing?\"  She invited herself into the room and sat down next to them, only to see that they weren't playing anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kira, Josh was showing me his new ability.\"  Jenn quickly replied not really thinking about much about it.  Josh really couldn't blame her too much though.  He knew that when she got excited, she tended not to have a filter and everything tended to come out all at once.  \"Look he has my hair.\"  She leaned over and grabbed a small portion of Josh's new hair and showed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, I think you've been studying a little too much.\"  Kira replied with a sarcastic tone.  \"You've always kept your hair short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's true.\"  Jenn quickly replied trying to prove herself.  \"Here let us show you.\"  She sat there for a minute not knowing if Kira will know about the swap.  \"Wait a moment.\"  She turned over to Josh and whispered in to his ear.  \"I think that we might need to involve Kira in a swap too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Josh asked with surprise.  \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know if she will see the swaps if we don't involve her.\"  Jenn pointed out to him.  \"Look, my hair is all dry now.\"  She replied as she brought her hand up to her head to show him.  \"How about we go ahead and swap our hair back and we will discuss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I still have to agree for all the swaps to happen.\"  He was quick to point out.  \"I don't want to swap with your little sister if I can help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn sat there for a minute to think it over.  She had an idea to make Josh do what she wanted.  She has always known that Josh has had a 'thing' for her.  Ever since the 7th grade, she's noticed the way he reacted when he was around her.  \"How about this.\"  She looked over at Kira.  \"Josh and I are going to swap back our hair and he's going to swap lives with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\"  Josh asked looking confused.  \"Why am I going to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn leaned back over and got close to his ear.  \"Because I want to see how a life swap will work and plus it's Friday night and we can have a slumber party.\"  She looked over at Josh and noticed that he was blushing a deep red.  She pulled away from him and asked him once more.  \"Josh will you swap hair with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\"  He cleared his throat.  \"Yeah, I will do that.\"  The bright flash enveloped the room and Josh found that his hair was once again short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.\"  Kira exclaimed.  \"That was wicked.\"  She stood there slack jawed for a minute, not really knowing how to comprehend it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See.\"  Jenn gestured between her and Josh.  \"That is what he can do.\"  She looked over at Josh and nudged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Josh sat there in a somewhat defeated manner.  He sighed and looked back over at Kira.  \"Kira do you want to swap lives with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira sat there for a moment not knowing what to do.  \"Actually, _____.\"</span></div></div>",

Please?\"  Kira pleaded with both of her hands out in front of her.  \"Besides we will always have the PlayStation to talk, anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem a little too eager for this.\"  Josh replied with a side glance, wondering if she had an ulterior motive for the whole thing.  \"You're not going to kidnap my family or anything?  Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira looked a little surprised.  \"WHAT?  No, nothing like that.\"  She chuckled.  \"I just wanted to see if Courtney talks about me behind my back, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked over at Jenn, who seemed indifferent.  '<i>Man, she's hard to read</i>.'  Josh thought to himself and he drew out a long sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you want to swap lives?\"  Kira asked with a bit more fervor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, let's do it.\"  Josh replied back, but they were all blinded by the bright light that soon enveloped the room.  When he was able to open his eyes once more he himself sitting where Kira had been and he was wearing her clothes. He was wearing a white long sleeved shirt that felt tight, a white bra underneath, a black pair of sweatpants, and a white pair of panties that matched her bra. He also had pink fuzzy slippers she had on before the swap. Kira was typically a casual dresser, especially when she was at home lounging around, but she was willing to doll herself up every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira now sported Josh's wardrobe which included his blue 'Schoolhouse Rock' shirt, his blue jeans, black and white sneakers, and her hair was cut short in Josh's normal hair style.  It looked identical to Jenn's, only lighter in color.  Seeing this, he immediately brought his hands behind his head and felt the longer hair that now graced his head.  The amazing part about the clothes swap was the clothes were resized to fit their original bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I wasn't expecting that.\"  Jenn replied with a gasp as she brought her fingers through Kira's newer hairstyle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly I didn't know what to expect.\"  Josh chuckled as he kicked off Kira's fuzzy slippers and noticed that he also had on her light purple nail polish, which was chipped in places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir exploration was short lived, of course, with Jenn and Kira's mom popping her head inside.  \"Josh, your mom called and said that you need to be home in 10 minutes or your going to be grounded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Josh and Kira replied back at the same time.  \"Okay.\"  But before Josh could say anything else, he waved Kira good bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well girls, how do you feel about pizza tonight?\"  Jenn's Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Josh replied with a smile as he brought a segment of hair behind his ear.</span></div></div>",

Maybe if I'm good at them for once, I can share that with her and we'll bond over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that time, Josh finally knew why Jenn hated it when him and her sister played video games. \"Yeah, I can see how that would get to you.

But he couldn't remember the controls to Call of Duty anymore, which was a problem since he was supposed to play it with Kira in a moment or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a light knock on the door and Jenn told them to come in. Sure enough it was Kira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are Josh! Are you ready to play CoD now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kira. I actually cramped my hand trying to hold on to my umbrella in that weather out there.\" He lied. \"Maybe Jenn could take my spot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good! No offense, but she's a lot better at it than you are.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira invited Josh to watch in her room while she played with Jenn. Kira showed him the 'spot' she had been talking about, and then had some fun with Jenn. The two sisters had a ball, having a good match which Jenn actually won. \"Wow sis! That was great, we should play more often.\" Kira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, it was a lot of fun!\" Jenn replied, turning to Josh and giving him a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was starting to feel like a third wheel. \"Maybe I should just go.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to yet, we'll only play a little longer.\" Jenn insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I gotta make it home for dinner anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" She called to him. \"Here sis, just play without me while I walk him out.\" Jenn told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the bottom of the steps, Jenn broke the silence that lingered during their trip down the stairs. \"Josh, is it okay if I make a rain check on coming to your house tonight? I want to spend some more time with my sister.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that's fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to test this out for the weekend with Kira. How about I give your skills back at school on Monday?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't like the idea of not having the ability to play over the weekend but was willing to make that accommodation for his friend. \"Yeah, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I almost forgot! My hair's dry now. Let's swap back.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right.\" He said triggering a swap. Seeing that they were physically back to normal. Josh showed his gratitude for Jenn's promise on swapping back. \"Cool, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing.\" She told him. \"That was really cool. What you did for me up there, you're a great guy and friend.\" She gave him a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh went from a bit down to feeling great. Any person would if their crush had just kissed them. \"Alright, see you around!\" He said with some energy, taking his umbrella and heading out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then he realized that the rain had abated and what day it was. It was Halloween and obviously since it wasn't raining anymore Jen had taken Kira out trick-or-treating.  He finally noticed the scores of trick-or-treaters in search of candy walking around the neighborhood. He decided to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home, it didn't take long for the trick-or-treaters to knock on his door. Josh handed candies to the children and commented on their costumes.  Josh loved trick or treat but he was getting too old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually the children arrived in groups of three or four. But as luck would have it, one young girl arrived alone. Her mother was waiting at the front off the walkway as she knocked on the door and said the usual reframe \" trick or treat\".  Her mother was too far away to hear the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl up about 8 was dressed in a Southern Belle costume.  It was mostly peach in color, with a white front, hat, fan and gloves.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.chasing-fireflies.com/product/peachy-southern-belle-costume-for-girls.do\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.chasing-fireflies.com/produc...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wow, that is a very pretty costume,\" Josh said.   He just gave the girl a lot of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at him and said  getting into character, \" Thank you, kind gentleman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I wish I could wear a costume like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah, Halloween is a time of pretend. When you can be anything you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You are right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea.   Would you like to swap with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl thinking that this is all pretend said, \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did they swap?</span></div></div>",

The streets were barren from any cars and all the animals were wise enough to seek shelter, leaving the streets empty and desolate.  With his hurry to get home, Josh didn't notice the dark blue van creeping up behind him, like a cat sneaking up their prey.  Almost sensing that something was a miss, Josh turned around just in time to see the doors open and several men in white lab coats approaching him.  Not really knowing what was going on, he instinctively backed away, but found his way blocked by a wall.  The men in lab coats raised their hands as if to calm him down.  \"It's okay.\"  The taller of the men replied.  He looked older than the others, with the grey air starting to show along the side of his head.  \"We just wanted to talk to you about a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Josh answered back in complete disarray.  \"A job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shorter man, who looked like he was also the youngest of the trio.  \"Yeah.\"  He said.  \"You see, we're from the local university and we're in need of somebody to help test an experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Josh repeated in disbelief.  \"You want me to be a guinea pig for an experiment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes and no.\"  The older man started to explain.  \"You see, we really need somebody, but you're underage and we will need your parent's permission before we can go through with anything.\"  The professor was always the type to cross the t's and dot the i's when it came to the proper paper work.  \"If you're willing to do this for us, have your parent or guardian sign these forms.\"  He brought out a manila folder and handed it to Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this experiment and why did you choose me?\"  Josh asked as he put the folder into his backpack to help protect it from any potential downpour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we really can't disclose that information right now.\"  The older man answered.  \"You see, it's rather top secret and we really don't want to tell you unless you can get one of your parents to sign the form.  As why we chose you, well without going too far into the experiment, I would have to say you're the most compatible with the equipment.\"  With that said, the trio of gentlemen got back into their van and drove off, leaving Josh wondering exactly what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurrying home, Josh decided to take a shortcut and go through an empty lot to his home.  As he grew closer, Josh noticed that the driveway was empty.  \"I wonder where Mom is?\"  He wondered to himself as he went through the door and found it empty.  \"Hello!?\"  He called out but was meant with no answer.  Shrugging, Josh tossed his backpack onto the dining table and noticed a note from his Mom.  Saying that she took Bri and Courtney to visit their Grandmother the next state over.  \"I guess they won't be back for a couple days.\"  With a mischievous look in his eye, Josh took out the folder and started to look over the paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading it several times, Josh really didn't see the harm in doing it, and with a bit of dishonesty, took out a pen from his backpack and quickly signed the form.  \"I will stop by there tomorrow and see what this is about.\"  Josh chuckled to himself as he put the paperwork back into his backpack</span></div></div>",

As he drew nearer to the corner of Elm Street, he knew that he was close to home when he saw the abandoned lot where they played baseball in the summertime.  He stood there for a moment to remember playing there last summer, where he almost broke Mrs. Buchanan's window with a rogue foul ball.  He remembered having her a couple times as a substitute teacher and always enjoyed it when she came in.  \"Well, I better get going.\"  He said to himself, knowing that if he didn't get going, he would more than likely get in trouble because of his wet clothes.  As he started to get going again, something caught his eye.  Jason turned his head to see a blue book laying on the ground in the middle of a puddle, or at least it looked like it was on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason drew closer to the mysterious book and as he got closer, he noticed that the book was actually glowing and hovering just above the top of the puddle.  \"What in the world?\"  He muttered to himself as he reached down and touched the book.  All of a sudden, a bright blue light suddenly appeared and he felt a small shock on his outstretched hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the blue light cleared from his vision, Josh started to hear a faint voice seemingly coming from the back of his head.  \"Mortal.\"  The deep voice said out of nowhere.  \"I don't have long for this world and I would like to bestow one last gift.\"  From the inside of his head, Josh felt a slight vibration and he started to freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>What's going on?</i>'  He thought to himself.  '<i>Do I have a tumor?</i>'  As soon as it started, it had stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not a tumor.\"  The voice seemingly yelled.  \"What I have given you is what the old ones call <i>The Power of Empathy</i>.  Long ago, the wisest person in the village had the wisdom because of empathy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empathy?\"  Josh asked, not truly understanding the real meaning of the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Empathy.\"  The deep voice confirmed.  \"The ability to know what others are going through by having to deal with is themselves.  All you have to do is get their permission for it to happen.\"  Josh felt a small pulse go through his head and a dull headache remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"  He said, wondering if the odd voice was still there, but his questions were met with silence.  He groaned as he brought his hand up to his head to help alleviate some of the pain.  \"I need to get home.\"  He picked up the pace to get home before he could get into too much trouble.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh continued in his attempt to dry off and getting into some drier clothing before his overprotective mother caught him. He quickly found a red, 'retro' looking 'Flash' T-shirt and slipped it over his head. Just in time too, because just then he heard a light rapping on his door. \"Yeah?\" He called out to the mysterious visitor behind the doorway. The door creaked open and in walked his younger sister, Courtney, carrying her clothes under her arm so that she can put them away in her room. \"Hey there Courtney, what's going on?\" He asked as he picked up the drenched shirt and tossed it into the hamper across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you wet?\" She asked him as he eyed both him and the shirt that he recently tossed into the hamper. \"What happened to your umbrella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably wouldn't believe me if I told you.\" Josh sighed as he motioned her to his used office chair next to his desk. \"Do you need help with something?\" Courtney nodded and caused her strawberry blonde hair to fall into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was just putting my clothes away before I get grounded again.\" She responded as she grabbed the rogue pieces of hair and brought them back behind her ear in an attempt to bring them back under her control. Courtney then placed the clothing on his bed. \"I hope you don't mind if I lay them here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not at all.\" Josh chuckled as he lay down on his bed next to her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened to you today after you missed the bus?\" Courtney wondered as she started to refold her clothes that had come unfolded when she laid them down earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought about it for a moment and whether or not he should tell his sister everything.  He thought back at his Great-uncle Phil, who lives out in the desert surrounded by aluminum foil to 'help keep the aliens from reading his thoughts'.  His family never really talked about him or really talked to him at all.  He sighed as the tried to make a decision.  \"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, it's okay.\"  Courtney reassured him as she finished refolding her clothes.  \"Remember when I caught you coming in late from that concert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought back to a couple months ago when he got back from a local band concert, but completely lost track of time and had to sneak back in before his Mom caught him.  Courtney, of course, covered for him and kept his Mom from coming into his room while he quietly slipped inside.  \"Yeah, but I had to do your chores for a week because you threatened to blackmail me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney chuckled at the thought of her brother having to do her chores too.  \"But it was worth it.  So won't you tell me what happened to you today?\"  She clasped her hands together in a pleading manner to help win her case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes of silence, Josh finally caved in.  \"Fine.\"  He went about to tell her the story about the book and the odd Djinn that seemed to pop out of it.  Josh looked over at his sister who didn't really change her stance or anything.  \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need any tin foil or anything right?\"  She asked her older brother as her smile grew across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh, not really able to hold it in, pushed his sister.  \"I mean it.\"  Knowing that his sister wasn't going to believe him, he reached over and turned on his Playstation and noticed that Kira was on.  Josh noticed a sigh coming out of Courtney's mouth as she saw one of her friend's names on her brother's game system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why she plays with you.\"  She replied, still sour at the fact that since Kira bought the Playstation almost 6 months ago, she has seen less and less of her friend since then.  \"I wish I had your skills so that I could understand why she likes it so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost like some of the old cartoons, Josh felt a wave of illumination.  \"How about we see if that little genie guy did give me something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"  Courtney replied as she tried to shy herself away from her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we try it and see if anything happens.\"  Josh suggested.  \"I will swap my skills with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess.\"  Courtney replied, but felt nothing different.  \"I told you it wouldn't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh shrugged his shoulders as he started up one of his favorite games.  Much to his surprise, he found himself dieing much more than usual.  \"What's going on?\"  He cried out in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to hide behind the barrels so that they won't see you.\"  Courtney started to point out to her brother.  \"Then you can pick them off one by one.\"  As this last sentence came out of her mouth, she brought her hands up to her mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\"  Josh replied as he handed her the remote.  \"See what you can do.\"  Courtney nodded as she eagerly grabbed the remote.  Much to the surprise of them both, where Josh had a hard time, Courtney easily defeated the npcs and began to progress further into the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it worked.\"  Courtney giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's swap back.\"  Josh declared as he tried to grab the remote, but Courtney had other ideas.</span></div></div>",

Less than five minutes ago, he was almost an expert at his favorite game and now he barely knew how to work the controls.  He knew that the left joystick would move the character and the buttons on the right would do various things, but if you asked him which button did which, he wouldn't know.  \"Let's swap back Courtney.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Courtney replied defiantly as she shook her head.  \"I kind of like having your video gaming skills and now I will be able to see what the big deal is about.\"  She was referring to her friend's seemingly unnatural obsession with it.  She looked back over at her brother who was starting to give her the stink eye for her seemingly betrayal.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh sighed as his sister's clear obstain from returning back to normal.  \"You know clear well what I want.  I want my video game skills back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we wait a little bit before we swap back.\"  Courtney suggested as she started to play again.  \"I mean, it's not everyday that something like this will happen.  So give it a couple days before we swap back, that way we can see what all has been swapped.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't really know what to do.  On one hand, he could keep his sister's video games skills for a couple days, and on the other hand, he could go to his Mom to demand that she do it.  Deciding to go with prior, Josh begrudgingly nodded his head.  \"Fine, but we swap back after a couple days.\"  Josh demanded as he left his sister playing his games in his room.  Instead, he decided to go outside to the basketball hoop and shoot for a little bit.  Grabbing his ball from the downstairs closet, Josh went out side and started to dribble the ball.  Or at least he tried to dribble the ball.  As he did it, he felt a little bit off and his body wasn't doing what he wanted.  Hearing the ball roll off, Josh looked down at his hands and wondered what was going on.  He grabbed the ball once more and instead of dribbling it, Josh just shot it at the backboard.  Again, he felt a little off and watched as the ball fell a few feet short from going into the basket.  \"Great.\"  Josh yelled to nobody in particular.  \"I guess I got her sport skills too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   Meanwhile upstairs   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney was having the time of her life with the game she was playing.  Her friend, Kira, messaged her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Hey Josh what's going on?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Hey Kira, this is Courtney.  Josh isn't really feeling like himself today.'</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh hey Courtney.  I was wondering why your brother had the game system and you didn't.  I'm glad that you're starting to come around and embrace your skills.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney chuckled as she read on, deep down glad at what had happened between the two of them.  Off in the distance, she heard her brother yelling at something.</span></div></div>",

The experience that she got from her brother was certainly life changing and made her start to rethink her life.  The beauty pageants that she'd been doing since the age of six, being the social butterfly at her school, and even her thinking of joining the chearleading squad at her school all of which seemed like another life completely.  She sighed as she finished the level and watched as the loading screen for the next level.  \"This is taking way too long.\"  Courtney replied as she watched the loading bar slowly inch its way to the finish line.  She looked around her brother's room and noticed some of his clothing laying around on the floor and bed.  Grimacing, Courtney picked up one of the discarded shirts and balled it up.  Looking over at the corner, she noticed his laundry basket sitting there.  Taking aim, she threw the bundled up clothing to its final home and marveled at how it went in without an issue.  \"Wow, I usually never make it from this far away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because I think you got my sport skills too.\"  Josh complained nearly scaring his sister off of the bed.  \"Let's swap back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to swap back yet.\"  Courtney attempted to pout, but found it much harder to do and instead looked like she was trying to kiss something that wasn't there instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"  Josh wondered as he stifled a laugh at the odd look his sister was giving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying to give you the puppy dog look.\"  Courtney answered back as she started to blush.  She shook her head and looked back at her brother.  \"Look, I really want to try this out for a little bit more and you can't get it back until I agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh's face was starting to have a look of shock on his face as he realized that Courtney was telling the truth.  For the time being he was going to be stuck like this until she gets tired and wants to swap back.  \"Fine, but you owe me big time.\"  Courtney, who seemed extremely happy with what her brother was doing for her, quickly got up and gave him a huge hug.  \"But I want to be alone for a little bit and try to figure out all that was swapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess I will go and do the same too.\"  Courtney replied as she let go of her older brother and picked up her clothes before she left the room.  As she left, Josh promptly closed the door and looked around the room to see if anything seemed or looked out of place.  Noticing nothing, Josh decided to reacquaint himself with his Playstation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***   <i><b>Meanwhile A Few Doors Down</b></i>   ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney was eager to see if anything changed when she got back to her room.  Looking around she started to frown when she noticed nothing different about her room.  Shrugging her shoulders, Courtney decided to play around in her room a little bit before her Mom called her down for dinner.  She made her way over to her shared closet and pulled out a pair of her high heels that her Grandmother got her for winning one of her recent pageants.  Pulling them out, she eagerly pulled them on and was ready for her next pageant so that she could show up Jessica, a stuck up blonde that tended to win alot of the pageants that they were in together.  Stepping into the shoes, Courtney started to walk across the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*BAM*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Courtney found herself on the floor.   Remembering back, she'd hadn't fallen in heels since she was much younger.  Pulling herself up, she tried again but this time much slower.  As she walked, she noticed that her ankles started to roll slightly with each step that she took.  \"Looks like I will have to teach myself how to walk in these.\"  Courtney said quietly to herself.  Knowing that her next pageant wasn't for another week, she wanted to see if what she learned with Josh's skills would transfer over to him when she gave them back.</span></div></div>",

As she walked in them, no longer was she teetering or even falling down, nor did she have the grace that she once did.  She did decide that for the next couple days or until they swap back, she was going to work on thee skill and give her brother 'something nice' for letting her try something new.  Taking the heels off of her feet, Courtney started to make a list of all the things that she wanted to relearn.  As she did this, an idea creeped in.  Lunging for her cell phone, she noticed that she had to take her time to text her friend Megan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Hey can you come over tonight?</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed before she heard the 'ping' come from her phone letting her know that a message was received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>I guess, why do you want me to sleep over tonight?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Actually, I think that would be perfect.

Here was a girl who was 3 years his junior embracing him like a good friend.  \"Umm... Hey there Megan.  What do I owe the pleasure of you coming over?\"  He really didn't know what was going on or even why she was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"  Megan replied as she pulled away from Josh.  \"Your sister called me over to stay the night.  But while you're here, I have a couple questions about fashion.\"  Josh didn't really know what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but I don't know what I can do for you.\"  Josh chuckled as he helped Megan with her bag which seemed a little bit too heavy for only a single night.  \"Wow, this is heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked over at Josh carrying her bag up the stairs to Courtney's room.  \"Yeah, I brought over a couple outfits that I wanted you to look at to see if it looked good to you.\"  She was instructed by her friend to keep the real reason for the visit under wraps for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here you go.\"  Josh grumbled as he opened the door to his sister's room and set the heavy bag down.  After a bit of awkward silence, Josh left his sister's room and quietly made his way back to his room.  'That was a bit weird.'

So what do you want to learn first, your brother taught me most of the stuff that I know.  Speaking of your brother, why didn't you just ask him to show you this stuff instead of me?\"  With Megan's family coming from Ireland, they were a little strict with what their daughter wore and didn't want her to look like a whore.  So with that they pretty much sheltered Megan and tried to keep her away from such things, but like most teenagers today, she found a way around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney had to think about it for a minutes without giving her brother's secret away.  \"Well, I want to surprise him with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it will be good for the both of you.\"  Megan replied as she sat next to her friend and started to show her what to do.</span></div></div>",

Her long strawberry blonde hair seemed a lot less disheveled that it appeared when Megan first started to brush and style it.  It almost looked much like the way she would style it before she left for school every morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks Megan.\"  Courtney gushed as she ran her fingers through her hair.  <i>'I didn't think laying around playing video games would do so much damage to my hair.</i>'  She quietly thought to herself.  \"You know Megan.

And don't tell me it was nothing, I know when you're lying.\"  The both of them had been friends for years and out of all the friends that Courtney had, Megan was the one that came over the most.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promised that I wouldn't.\"  Courtney defended herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That certainly hasn't stopped you before.\"  Megan replied back as she indirectly brought up the several other times where Megan's most closely guarded secrets were spilled by her friend.  \"I thought we were friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guilt trip seemed to work on Courtney and she started to tell her everything.  \"And that's why I don't know what I'm doing with makeup and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that would make sense, but why do I remember Josh showing me all of the stuff?\"  Megan wondered outloud mostly to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that would be because originally I showed you and since we swapped that out reality changed to what you believe.\"  Courtney surmised.</span></div></div>",

They both made their way across the hall to Josh's room and lightly knocked on the door to get his attention.  Megan was about to say something, but was cut short by Courtney putting her finger to her mouth to silence her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing too, because a few seconds later Josh opened the door.  \"What do you want?\"  Josh asked as he saw both Megan and Courtney standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you wanted to swap our skills back?\"  Courtney wondered as she tried to play hard to get and seemed to be working, as the look on Josh's face looked to be intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's do it then.\"  Josh offered as he waited for the phrase to be uttered by his sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast.\"  Courtney stated as she made her way into the room, bypassing her brother's blockade of the door.  \"For me to swap our skills back, I want you to make a swap with each of us and we get to pick what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me.\"  Josh replied with his fingers at his temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to put her two cents in, Megan chimed in.  \"You'll be able to play your games again.\"  This seemed to put Josh over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told her?\"  He almost yelled over at Courtney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving her hand dismissively, Courtney looked over at her brother.  \"That doesn't matter right now, do you want to swap back our skills or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but we have to swap back first, before I do anything else.\"  Josh demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you'll do the swaps first and I will swap back your skills last.\"  Courtney counter offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I will swap with Megan first then with you, that way I have a little leverage.\"  Josh accepted as he looked over at Megan.  \"So what do you want to swap\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, looking amused at being able to go first looked over at her friend's brother.  \"I was wanting to swap _______ with you.\"</span></div></div>",

After a couple more seconds, Josh was now an inch shorter than his little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG.\"  Megan exclaimed with excitement.  \"I can't believe it.\"  With all of her excitement, Megan quickly made her way over to the mirror that she knew was in Josh's room and took a good look at herself.  Looking in the mirror, she noticed that she didn't look as odd as she thought she was going to look.  As a matter of fact, it looked like completely normal, almost as if she had always been that height.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right.\"  Courtney replied back to her with excitement, knowing that she was going to be next.  \"So how does it feel lil' bro?\"  She made sure to use 'lil' to aggravate him a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha.\"  Josh feignedly chuckled.  \"So how long are we going to stay this way?\"  He wondered, mostly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know yet.\"  Courtney replied before Megan could have a change of heart and offer to swap back in the next couple days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"  Megan started to say, but was soon cut off by her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know yet.\"  Courtney replied once again, but in a more forceful manner.  \"Besides, it's my turn now and I want to swap _______ with you.\"</span></div></div>",

With that being said there were worse options that Courtney had to choose from, not that Josh was a fan of the idea. Along with any kind of swap for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized that Megan likely had an odd reaction when Courtney requested this, as his thoughts were interrupted when his sister spoke up. \"What, my hair can be in the way sometimes and I just want to see what it's like to have shorter hair for awhile.\" She said to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that you take a lot of pride in your hair and it's a big part of your fashion style.\" Megan told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Josie has short hair, doesn't she?\" Courtney pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so.\" Her friend replied. It was a good example of Courtney's manipulative ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls then turned their attention back to the male of the group. \"Okay then, we're waiting on you bro.\" Courtney announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, fine.\" He answered. The next thing he knew, he could feel hair brushing up against his neck. He reached back and grabbed a few strands and pulled it in front of his face. He noticed the hair color had changed too. It was almost red, but was a bit lighter. He had heard his sister and mother refer to it as \"strawberry blonde\". Josh then looked over and saw Courtney was now sporting his brown, short, and boyish hairstyle. She also had some hair on her arms and legs as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think we're done here.\" Courtney said. \"Come on Meg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! No ones leaving until I get my skills back.\" Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably got it back automatically already when we swapped hair.\" Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how would we know that?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try doing something you're normally good at.\" Megan suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" Josh answered as he scanned the room for something to do as a test. \"Umm... Courtney, throw me that ball!\" He said pointing to a baseball-sized bouncy ball in the corner by his door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney picked the ball up and tossed underhanded. She lacked some coordination though, and the ball flew straight up toward the ceiling and then back to the floor without ever reaching Josh. \"What good does that do?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shows that you no longer have my athletic skills.\" He said, picking up the ball and tossing it back to her. She tried to catch it but it missed her hands entirely and hit her head right where her new hair was. \"You two can leave now.\" He pointed to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-\"I wish to swap clothing with you\" - she said.<br>\r\n-\"What?! Don't you like wearing girly clothes?\" - that one really surprised you. You have always been considering your sister to be girly. She might not be a girl, who wear pink dresses, all the time, but she liked her girlishness, and was making use of all the possibilities, that the world was offering her,as a girl. And she was happy with this. <br>\r\n-\"Yes, I do like, but I think you will look in my clothes just as good, as me. I cannot miss that chance. Besides, you must swap with me, if you want your video games skills, to be returned to you\" - she said, exhibiting you a controller from your console.<br>\r\n-\"Fine, I accept to swap clothing with you\"<br>\r\n\"Great\" - Courtney said before a bright light covered your eyes completely. When you were able to see, once again, you rushed to the nearest mirror. You began to examine yourself.<br>\r\nYou had a white shirt with a big, pink heart in the center. You had wore shirts before, of course, but that one was different. It had a completely different cut, and was much more loose, than your old one. It was in good size, but you weren't sure, if it has been resized to fit you, or that was because you now had Megan's height. You looked underneath your shirt, and saw, that you were wearing Courtney's light pink, training bra,even if you didn't have breasts. \"I guess, that  swaps underwear too\" - you thought.<br>\r\nYou examined your legs, and saw there were your sister's white leggings, on them. You were wearing pants-like-things all the time, but wearing leggings was a completely alien sensation for you. They were skin-tight, and didn't feel like pants, but rather like a second skin. You walked from wall to mirror several times, wanting to see, how do they feel like, while walking. They felt very nice, you almost felt, like you had nothing on your legs. They weren't constricting your legs, even a bit, and that was a real plus. You couldn't tell for sure, that there were better, than your male pants. They were different, not worse... but different. You assumed, they were for specific occasions. \"Girls have it good, to have so many different types of clothing.\" - you thought. You were wondering, if you'd worn leggings, from time to time, if they were made for boys too.There were some situations, when they'd  be better, than regular pants. You were happy, 'cause  Courtney was still maturing,so her hips and butt weren't that wide, and her leggings were fitting you almost perfectly. Almost, because they were made for girls, and you definitely wasn't one of them. You felt like your member was being crushed, by the fabric. You had to admit, that even, if leggings felt comfortable, they weren't baggy pants, and didn't give your  dick, a lot of free space. <br>\r\nYou finished examining your clothes, by looking at your feet. They were black-pink sneakers, and some socks there. Even, if they were sporty, it was definitely, girls' kind of sport shoe. You were surprised, but you even had Courtney's pink hair-pin, and small earrings. You were actually quite relieved, that your sister didn't wear something very girly today, like skirts or dresses. Even though, what you've been wearing weren't boy's in any way,it could still be worse. Your clothes were feminine, but a bit, not entirely.<br>\r\n-\"Oh, you look adorable in these clothes of yours, bro\" - you turned your head, and saw your sister, wearing your clothes. - \"And those, I'm wearing now are far more comfortable, than my old ones\"<br>\r\n-\"I'm actually quite thankful, sis, that you didn't wear anything too girly today\" <br>\r\n-\"I wanted. I was wondering, if to wear a skirt to these leggings, but lucky for you, I changed my mind\" - she said. <br>\r\nYou gulped,\"Thank Goodness!\" <br>\r\nYou opened your wardrobe. It was  full of your sister's clothes. There was everything: jeans(slim and regular) pants(baggy, yoga and more) skirts, dresses(plaid and cocktail, casual and official) leggings, pantyhose, shirts, all of them in every color a girl would desire. On the floor, of the wardrobe, there were your shoes. You found out, that now you didn't have only sneakers, anymore, but also plenty of flats, mary-janes, cinderella's, flip flops, open sandals, and, to your horror, high heels. You could walk in them for a year, without repeating, you thought.<br>\r\nYour mum entered the room.<br>\r\n-\"Josh! Girls! The dinner is going to be ready, in a few minutes.\" - she said and closed the door.<br>\r\n-\"That's strange\" - you said. - \"She didn't see anything unusual, in the way, we're dressed.\"<br>\r\n-\"So, I assume that now, you have  always been wearing girls' clothes.\" - Courtney said.<br>\r\n-\"It seems that the swaps change the reality\" - you heard Megan.<br>\r\n-\"I can't wait to see you, wearing my dresses and skirts\" - your sister was definitely happy.<br>\r\n-\"Why should I?\" - you asked - \"you ha... I mean, I have so many pants, that I won't have to wear a dress.\"<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry there will be situations, when you'll be expected to wear dresses\" - she said with a grim smile.<br>\r\nYou didn't say nothing. You decided to remove your training bra, because you didn't have breasts, so it was useless. You stripped, and took your bra off, to your sister pleasure. She enjoyed seeing you, uncomfortable like this. <br>\r\nWhat's next? </span></div></div>",

He didn't want to think about having nothing between his legs, even for a day or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're not backing out are you?\"  Courtney asked as she picked up Josh's game remote and turned on the game system and started to choose a game to play.  \"I mean, it would be a shame if I got to keep these awesome skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh just groaned as he looked back over at Megan.  \"Fine, I will swap that with you.\"  Just like before, there wasn't anything signaling that the swap had occurred or anything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that seemed to show that anything happened was Megan, practically yelling.  \"Oh My God, this feels so weird.\"  Josh looked over to see her rubbing her new bulge from outside her pants.  He then looked down at his own groin and noticed the absence of one.  Almost wondering what it was like, Josh brought his hands down to his groin and started to rub too.  Almost instantly he felt a bolt of enjoyment as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing there bro?\"  Courtney asked with a sly grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Josh just shook his head.  \"N... nothing.\"  He stammered bringing his hands back up and crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"  Courtney replied nudging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling as if he needed to defend himself, Josh pointed over at Megan, who seemed to be enjoying herself a little too much.  \"What about her, when I get it back it's going to be all bruised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"  Megan asked as she stopped short of actually maturating in front of them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, my turn.\"  Courtney turned back to her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I fulfilled my promise, can I get my skills back?\"  He wondered, slightly worried that his sister might go back on the agreement that they made together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I will.\"  Courtney responded back to him.  \"Don't get your panties all in a twist.\"  Both her and Megan laughed at his discomfort.  \"Let's see, I want to swap _______ with you.\"</span></div></div>",

Standing at little more than 4 1/2 feet tall, Courtney certainly made up for it with her outgoing personality  She could always be found with her friends talking about everything going on at school or practicing for her beauty pageants.  Josh's personality, on the other hand, was the exact opposite.  He'd rather stay at home and play video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want your skills back, then you will have to swap our heights.\"  Courtney repeated as she cocked her hip to one side and folded her hands across her chest in a seemingly defiant manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we do something else?\"  He wondered, not really wanting to be short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we can swap our friends if you want.\"  Courtney suggested as she nudged Megan.  \"I could always use a break from some of them.  I mean, Josie can get kind of demanding from time to time, right?\"  She turned to Megan, who also nodded her head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, if you swap back my skills, then I will swap my height with you.\"  Josh replied with a defeated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept.\"  Courtney eagerly replied back and watched in awe as Josh quickly shrank down to her height.  \"Wow that was a rush.\"  She shook her head to see if that would relieve some the dizziness that came with the height change.  She looked over at Megan, who seemed so much smaller.  \"Wow, you're so short.\"  She giggled at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not short.\"  Megan complained defiantly.  \"You're just so much taller now.\"  She then looked over at Josh, who was now only an inch taller than her.  She always had a thing for him and as she looked over at him, she felt her new appendage stir sightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the other swap work too?\"  Josh wondered as he grabbed the remote and found that he could easily play the game now.  He breathed a great sigh of relief when he didn't die within a minute of starting a level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure doing business with you.\"  Courtney chuckled as she grabbed Megan and ushered her out of the room.</span></div></div>",

As Courtney walked her to the front door, Megan remembered something. \"Wait!\" Megan suddenly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about this thing?\" She asked while pointing to her groin area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it belongs to your brother. I'd feel bad if I left him with my vagina for that much time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it won't matter.\" Courtney told her, not concerned about her brother's possible predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few days? A week?\"  Not really caring if he would be stuck with it for a couple days, a week at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least two weeks, maybe up to a month.\" Courtney remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious!?!\" Josh yelled.

The only problem was due to their swapped heights, Josh was stopped as his sister pressed her hand against his head, leaving him unable to move and well out of her reach.  Much like he would do to her when they were to horseplay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" Courtney cheered. She marveled at the fact that she could pull off the trick her brother had always done to her. She suddenly pulled back and moved out of the way, leaving Josh to fall flat on his face. Courtney just laughed and walked out, leaving her older, but smaller, brother alone in her fit of rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You just couldn't get used to the new emptiness in your boxers. You reached to it. Your new pussy was very sensitive. Touching it, gave you some kind of pleasure, but you wanted to say goodbye to it as soon as that was possible. You even found yourself sitting, with your legs crossed, just like girls do. Nothing was preventing you from doing this now. Your new height was also awful for you. You couldn't remember, when were you shorter than your mum, for the last time. Your mum, was average for a woman, being 5' 6\" in height.  Now you were shorter, than her,and that was driving you crazy. Not only that, your legs were now so short, that you couldn't reach the floor, sitting on the chair, anymore. You found them swinging in mid-air. \"I won't survive that month, no chance.\" You didn't know about it, but female hormones, that now  were being produced by your new pussy, were causing you to start, to behave like a girl would. You felt powerless, vulnerable, and foremost, very emotional. <br>\r\n-\"I don't want to be like this...\" - you bowed your head, and started sobbing, releasing the fork you were holding in your hand. You were completely helpless.<br>\r\n-\"Josh, sweetie, you are not eating. Why? Did something happened? - your mum interested in what were you doing.<br>\r\n-\" No\" - you said, wiping your tears - \"Actually, I just don't feel like myself today.\" - you noticed grim smile, on your sister's face.<br>\r\n-\"I wonder... maybe your menstrual cycle has started, and that's the reason.\" - your mum said.<br>\r\n-\"What?! No! My pussy is fine, I'm not having a period! \"<br>\r\n-\"Don't use such words to describe your female parts. You must call them nicely, at least in front of me.\" - your mum was a bit angry.<br>\r\n-\"Okay, mum.<i> My vagina is fine\"</i> - you noticed, that Courtney barely managed to hold her laughter.<br>\r\n-\"That was better. Remember, if you'd have any questions, about the changes of your body, just let me know. And I want you to know one thing, pregnancy and birth-giving isn't scary. It's actually beautiful.It's amazing, when you feel that something is growing in your womb. I remember, when I gave birth to you. I was the happiest person, in the world. \" - your mum began to dream -\" Don't think about it as a curse, it's just a task, all women have. When you'll have your children, you'll understand, what I'm saying. \"<br>\r\n-\" You'll be a great mummy, elder brother. \" - Brianna said -\" I know it for sure\"<br>\r\nIn that moment, Courtney couldn't stop her laugh, any longer, and busted out in laughter. Mum was definitely angry.<br>\r\n-\"What was that, young lady?! You think, you can laugh at your brother, only because he has a vagina?! That wasn't kind! YOU'RE GROUNDED, 'till I change my mind! Now, apologize to your brother, for laughing at him!\" - your mum demanded.<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry Josh, that I laughed at you.\" - she said, bowing her head innocently. Even though, she was still taller than you.<br>\r\n-\"Now go to your room!\" - Courtney didn't say anything, but you could see, she was happy. Although she was grounded, she thought it was worth it.<br>\r\nYou decided to check something.<br>\r\n-\"Mum, why do I have a vagina, as a boy?\"<br>\r\n-\"I don't know, you were just born like this. Although you had a vagina, doctors told me you were be a boy. You have grown up to be a healthy boy. Fortunately other adults and children accepted you, even if you were different.<br>\r\n-\" And why is Courtney so much taller than me?\"<br>\r\n-\"She just hit her puberty very early and forcefully. You know sweetie, that girls mature earlier than boys. Courtney had hers. You, on the other hand, are a late boomer and haven't hit yours, so you're still the same height you had, when you started the puberty. But don't worry, you'll be big and strong in a while.\"<br>\r\n-\"Thanks, mum\"<br>\r\n-\"And now eat. Even if Courtney was so mean to you, you need to eat a lot, if you want to grow as big, as her\"<br>\r\n-\"I do want, mum\" - you said. \"Poor her, she don't understand anything\"<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

He honestly thought about playing a game, but seemed a little dull and wanted to try something different.  As he lay there reading the book, the void between his legs felt completely foreign to him and even though he tried his best to ignore it, the void seemed to beckon to him.  Giving into the temptation, he brought his hands down between his legs and lightly rubbed it.  \"Oh my god.\"  He nearly screamed as the wave of enjoyment flowed through his body.  \"Wow, I didn't think it would be like that.\"  He chuckled to himself as he started to unbutton his pants for a better look.  But before he was able to do anything a knock came from the door.  Begrudgingly, Josh got up off his bed and made his way over to the door to see who it was.  Taking a moment to unlock the door, he called out to the unknown visitor.  \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, why didn't you do the one thing that I asked you to do?\"  Kim's voice called out to him.  Thinking back to what his Mom asked, his memory came back to remind him what he missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Mom.\"  Josh apologized.  \"I forgot to take out the trash and bring it up front for tomorrow.\"  He looked over at his Mom who looked livid at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing a big sigh, Kim looked over at her son.  \"Honey, I'm a little disappointed.\"  Josh held his breath as he knew that with the tone that she was taking, he was in trouble.  \"I asked you to do one thing and I come in here to see you messing around? Don't get me wrong.  I'm glad that you're reading a book, but you should do it after all your chores are done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, I was going to do it.\"  Josh groaned as he started to go around his Mom to finish the task.  \"Geeze.\"  Josh knew that this was a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, look.\"  Kim sighed once more.  \"I've been spending a lot of time with your sister's as of late and you've been on the back burner.  So how about tomorrow, Courtney can watch Bri so that you and I go out and have some fun.  Hmm?\"  Josh couldn't believe what he was hearing.  It's been years since he had been able to spend time with this Mom and didn't really know how to take it.  \"Well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure.\"  Josh replied in a bit of shock.  \"I guess we can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I've been meaning to get you some new underwear.\"  She chuckled as she kissed her son on the forehead and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I just agree to?\"  Josh said to himself as he went to take care of his chores.</span></div></div>",

You couldn't stand your sister's best friend, masturbating with your penis.This, actually, turned you on a bit, and you started to feel wetness in your groin area, but, at the same time, you have never felt so uncomfortable and awkwardly. <br>\r\n-\"So, have you made a decision?\" - Courtney interrupted - If you don't swap us, you'll never have your package again. You may hesitate, but your girlfriend, wouldn't be happy, if you do so. She may be a bit disappointed, if she finds out, her boyfriend has a cunt.<br>\r\n<b>-\" You bitch!!! \"</b> - you shouted.<br>\r\n-\"It's your chose, Joshie - Courtney said calmly.<br>\r\nSo, do you do the swap? </span></div></div>",

Like if you have had it all your life. But you have, right? Although it felt strange in some way, you didn't remember, how it's like not to have a pussy.<br>\r\n-\"AAAAAARGGGHH\" - you heard your sister's shriek. She was also examining her pussy. <br>\r\n-\"What happened to me?! Why do I have a vagina?!\" - she was shocked.<br>\r\n-\"How:\" Why do I have?\" You're a girl, you have to have a pussy, there's no other way.\" - you said<br>\r\n-\"But... I was born with a penis, and have always had it\" - she said weakly.<br>\r\n-\"Courtney, I am older than you, so I remember better. You have had a pussy, since I can remember\"<br>\r\n-\"But I do not! \" - Megan was keeping track on your conversation. She was frightened what the swap costed. It took your and Courtney's memories,and twisted them. She didn't know, what to do. She decided to wait and see, how it would go.<br>\r\n-\"Josh, how could you have a vagina? You're a boy!\"<br>\r\n-\"Just look.\" - you took your pants down, and show your sister, what you've got.<br>\r\n-\"You're right... but... but I remember...\" - she didn't know what to say.<br>\r\n-\"Actually, I have to tell you about something.\" - Megan decided, she can't hold it any longer. \"Josh, you can swap traits, between people, right?\" - she wanted to check, if you remember.<br>\r\n-\"Umm, yes, why?\" - you were surprised.<br>\r\n-\"All that mess, is because we swapped. That's how I got a penis.\" - she pointed at the bulge in her skirt. You didn't want to look at this. You haven't ever seen a real penis(only on porn videos) and the thought of seeing one, was making you feel disgusted (you received a bit of Courtney's childish personality, so you felt more disgusted thinking about other sex' genitals. Courtney on the other hand was braver and more bold, like you were used to.).<br>\r\n-Hey,it's...it's my penis! But how do you get it?\"-Courtney was surprised.<br>\r\n-\" We all swapped, using Josh's power, and I got your penis.\" - she was lying, but she decided, that it was  best to play this game-\" I wanted to see, how it was like to have a penis. \"<br>\r\n-\" But I do not remember, swapping with you. \" - Courtney said. <br>\r\n-\"I think this genitals swap twisted your memories\" - Megan was lying again. <br>\r\n-\"Josh, we must swap back. I must have my dick back!\" - she grabbed you. <br>\r\n-\"But Courtney...\" <br>\r\n-\"Please!! I can't stand not having a dick!\" - she said in despair. <br>\r\n-\"Sis... Ok.\" - you said after thinking for a while. <br>\r\nCourtney felt a massive relief. <br>\r\n-\"Thank you elder brother\" - she hugged you. - \"Now, swap my private parts with Megan's.\" <br>\r\n-\"Sis, it's not that easy. I cannot swap traits between two different people. One of the swapped has to be me, and Megan, my vagina has ginger public hair. Does it belong to you?\" - you asked. <br>\r\n-\"I think it does.\" - \"It seems, that they don't have a clue what happened to them. That's ridiculous! \" - Megan thought.<br>\r\n-\"So, if you swap with Megan, and then with me, Megan will have her vagina, you will have yours, and I'll have my penis back. We all will be back to normal.\" - Megan couldn't stop her laugh. - \"Oh crap!\" - Courtney grabbed her tits - \"What's this, I didn't have them before\" <br>\r\n-\" Hey, those are mine! Gimme them back!\" - you shouted. <br>\r\n-\"Josh, only girls have boobs, how could these be yours?! Even if... they're not mine either.\" - Courtney began to think. <br>\r\n-\"I think this swap changed your memories in some way. Courtney, you don't remember Josh having vagina and breasts, and Josh don't remember you having penis, although you have always have them.\" - Megan wanted to keep you like this. <br>\r\n-\"But... how?\" <br>\r\n-\"I am not sure\" - she was still lying. <br>\r\n-\"So, if you want to have  boobs , and I do not want to, then nothing stops us from swapping?\" <br>\r\n-\"Yeah, even if having nothing on my chest was quite a relief for my spine, I still want them back. They are not very big, after all.\" - you have always been quite upset, with your cups size. They were A's, much smaller, than every girl in your class. That didn't hinder you, but it was hard to grow up in the society, where women are expected to have large cleavages, if they want to be pretty. <br>\r\n-\"Yeah, I want to swap with you, too\" - Courtney said. Then a light appeared, and when it faded, you saw your breasts on your chest, again. <br>\r\n-\"Courtney, could you give me my brassiere? I have breasts again, and it would be useful.\" - you asked. <br>\r\n-\"Sure, I don't need it.\" - she stripped of her blouse, and then took your bra off. Her chest, was flat and hairy, like boy's. - \"Here you are. Watch it bro!\" - she threw it to you, you managed to catch it. You began to hesitate if to put it on now, or go to the toilet. <br>\r\n-\"You can wear it here. You don't have anything, I haven't seen before.\" - Megan said. <br>\r\n-\"Yeah, don't be ashamed, Joshie.\" - Courtney added. She now had your old, boyish libido, so she thought that seeing naked breasts would be nice. <br>\r\nYou took your shirt, revealing your bare breasts. Courtney couldn't help but got turned on, and began to feel moistness in her new vagina. <br>\r\n-\" God, what's going on with me?! Is that, what people with vaginas feel, when they're aroused?! This is so awful!\" - Courtney was definitely feeling discomfort. It was quite pleasurable, but that feeling was so alien for her, that she couldn't enjoy it. <br>\r\n-\" If you get aroused, your vagina is getting wet. \" - you explained(you now had Courtney's knowledge, about these things) - \"It's completely norma... wait! Are you turned on, by looking at me?!!\" <br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry, bro. Just... I... seeing bare tits, is making me aroused. I can't help it.\" - she was ashamed. <br>\r\n-\"You're such a perv, Courtney. I didn't expect you to have sexual attraction to your own brother.\" - you said. <br>\r\n-\"I'm so sorry, bro! It won't happen again! I swear!\" <br>\r\n-\" It's ok. Just... don't do it again. We're a family, that's too much.\" <br>\r\n-\"Sorry... can you swap our groins, finally. That feeling, I was having, was really odd. I don't wanna feel it again. It's just ... disgusting.\" <br>\r\n-\"If you had vagina all your life, it 'd be a completely normal experience for you.\" - you said. <br>\r\n-\"I know, but... I want to have my dick back. It' s strange, not having anything swinging, between my legs. I can't get used to it.\" <br>\r\n-\"Right, Megan can we swap your penis, with my vagina?\" - you asked. <br>\r\n-\"You know what... I'm not sure. I think it'd be much easier for me, to live, if I had a penis. Having it may be odd, but on the other hand, it's also very nice.\" - Megan said. She didn't want to have penis for the rest of her life, but thought, she might gain something on this situation. <br>\r\n-\" Megan, you must! I'm begging you!! \" - tears appeared in your sister's eyes. <br>\r\n-\" I will swap it with you, but only if you agree to swap one more thing with me.\" - she pointed at you. <br>\r\n-\"Swap what?\" <br>\r\n-\"I'll decide\" <br>\r\nYou hesitated. You didn't want to swap something with Megan. You looked at Courtney. She was looking at you with puppy eyes. She used to annoy you, but you couldn't let her feel so much pain. She was your sister, after all. <br>\r\n-\"I will. But in the end, after we swap groins.\" <br>\r\n-\"No problem. And, actually... can I go to toilet one last time? I want to see how it's like to pee, while having this thing.\" <br>\r\n-\"Sure. Do you want Courtney's knowledge, how to use it?\" <br>\r\n-\"No. Then I would feel, like if I had a penis all my life. I want to see how does it feel like, to pee with penis, for the first time.It will be funny.\" - Megan began to laugh. <br>\r\nShe went to the toilet, and you followed her. She took her skirt and panties down, revealing her member. -\" What now? How is that supposed to work? \" - you wanted to help her, but you didn't have a clue, how to use penis. <br>\r\n-\" You just have to aim urine, into the lavatory. And you have to be really careful. Aiming with this is not easy, for the beginners\" - Courtney said. <br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Megan finished. It was difficult for her to aim directly, where she wanted, but she managed to do it. <br>\r\n-\" How was it like?\" - you asked<br>\r\n-\" Nice... odd... but nice.\" - she said. <br>\r\n-\"Okay let's swap groins.\" <br>\r\n-\"Fine\" - as she finished these words, a light appeared. When it faded, you have been having a male genitalia. It was extremely strange. <br>\r\n-\" So that's how having it feels like.\" <br>\r\n-\"Now you know, what I was feeling, having this.\" - Megan added<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, it's a bizarre feeling. It's like having a glued sausage, between my legs.\" <br>\r\n-\"If you had it longer, it wouldn't be such an odd feeling, for you\" - Courtney said. <br>\r\n-\"Yeah, but I don't want to have it for longer. I want to get rid of this ASAP. It's freaking me out\" <br>\r\n- \"And I do want to have it back, ASAP, too\" - Courtney said. When she was saying this, you felt you were changing. When she finish, you have been having a vagina, once again. <br>\r\n-\" I have it back!!\" - Courtney said, grabbing a bulge in her pants. - \"Thank you!\" <br>\r\n-\"I couldn't let my little sister suffer\" - you said. She couldn't help but got red. - \"Ok, Megan. Swap what you desire, I accept.\"<br>\r\nWhat does she do? </span></div></div>",

I'm tired of people laughing at me, only because of my ginger hair. Hello!! It's not like I chose to have red hair. Everyone in my family is ginger, I couldn't avoid it!\"<br>\r\n-\" Are you serious?! Both your mum and dad have red hair?\"<br>\r\n-\" Yes, they have! Now you see, what I am content with. I was meant to be ginger, before I was even born!\"<br>\r\n-\" Do you really hate that so much?\"<br>\r\n-\" It's not hatred. I actually like it. There's something... unique in me, 'cause I' m a ginger, and I like it. But I can't stand stupid jokes, about my hair color. What have redheads done to you, to make such jokes?! I just don't understand it. I love my hair, but it'd be nice, not to be ginger, for a while. I think I need  vacations, from these\" - she grabbed stripes of her hair. <br>\r\n -\" You know Megan, you can always dye your hair, if its current color hinders you\"<br>\r\n-\"Yeah, but... my parents won't allow me to do that. They're very strict, and don't allow me to do some things. I'm stuck with them... unless I swap with you.\"<br>\r\n-\" Wait, let's clarify. What do we exactly swap?\"- you said. <br>\r\n-\" We swap only hair color, that means length and cut stays the same. \" - she explained.<br>\r\n-\"Wouldn't that be strange? You see, Courtney has blonde hair, Bri has brown, and I'd have red. Wouldn't that be suspicious?\"<br>\r\n-\"I think the reality will alter, to conform our soon-to-be-current state. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n-\"Ok. I think I can swap this with you. It's not very big, so I can handle this.\" - you said. How bad could that be? <br>\r\n-\"Ok. I want to have your hair color!\" - Megan pointed her finger at you. Then the familiar light appeared. When you could see again, you rushed to the nearest mirror. You looked at yourself. You looked exactly the same, except for that, you've now been having ginger hair. The most ginger you've ever seen. Your hair was still short and cut like boy's, but it was in intense orange color. You don't know how this happen, but you even had a lot of freckles, on your face. You looked at Megan. Her hair was still long, and curly, but it was now in your old, dark brown color. Her freckles completely disappeared. She looked bizarre, not being a ginger. You couldn't get used to her looking like that. <br>\r\n-\"I don't even look that bad, in your colors.\" - she said examining herself in the mirror. <br>\r\n-\"Megan, we only agreed to swap color of our hair. Why have I gotten your freckles?\" <br>\r\n-\" It's normal for reds to have freckles. I think that one was included with my hair colour. I'd look odd with freckles, if I'm not a ginger now. But you've got to believe me. I didn't want to give you my  freckles, too.\" - she explained. <br>\r\n-\" Yeah, I trust you. \"<br>\r\n-\" Oh God! I've completely forgotten! You see, we're going for my cousin's birthday tommorow, and we'll stay there both Saturday and Sunday. My mum told me to pack, what I'll need, but I haven't done this yet. \"<br>\r\n-\"I assume your cousin is also ginger.\" - you said. <br>\r\n-\"Of course she is. All my family is.\" - she said, laughing. <br>\r\n-\" Are you sure, you don't  want your ginger hair back? You'd differ with mine.\" - you said. <br>\r\n-\"Nah, that's not important. Sorry, but I really have to go now. It's very late.\" - she said running down the stairs. - \" See ya Court' and Josh!\" - she said leaving your house. <br>\r\nYou sat on your bed. \"So I guess I am a ginger now. I'll have to get used to it,because I'll stay like this, 'till Megan decide to swap with me back. Or at least for the weekend.\" <br>\r\nCourtney sat next to you. <br>\r\n-\"You know bro? You really look nice in red.\" - she said smiling. <br>\r\nYou didn't know what to say. <br>\r\n-\"Are you honest?\" <br>\r\n-\"Sure\" <br>\r\n-\"Thank you sis.

You remembered, that Megan forced you to swap groins, and that you should have a penis. But at the other hand, a different part of your mind was telling you, that you have always had a vagina. And the most horrifying was that, you remembered that too.<br>\r\nYou remembered growing up, having a pussy, remembered sitting down to pee, wiping your pussy, after peeing, remembered sensitivity of your slit, remembered asking mum, why you don't  have a wee-wee, while other boys do(you didn't even know how to call penis, at the time, as you didn't have it). Remembered fingering sessions you had, having the most pleasureful experiences you  have ever had. You remembered, how it's like to have a period(although you didn't have it. That's, because you have swapped memories with Courtney, who has already had her first menstruation. But the clit you had, was Megan's, and as Megan was  a bit immature, she hasn't had her first period. [Although Courtney's memories were letting you know that she had] So that created a paradox.)<br>\r\nYou remembered all the emotions and feelings that come together with period:  emotional variation, moodiness, feeling that everything wants to annoy you, and different body warmness. Remembered drawing your Menstrual Period Calendar, which was now in Courtney's room, in one of the drawers(Courtney didn't want Megan to look at it, so she hid it). You even remembered your first period, which you had barely 3 months ago. You were playing video games, when, out of nowhere, it began. You ran to his mum, screaming, why were you bleeding.<br>\r\nAll of that seemed like not so far past. You knew it happened. But you remembered, that you had a penis too. You thought of your crotch, and couldn't remember how did it used to look. You tried to recall, how does having penis feel like. But  you were unable to.  You couldn't even imagine how does his penis felt like, or how did it look. You had no idea. You also couldn't remember, how it was like to have sex, although you remembered, you had it with Jenn several times. You took one more glance at your snatch. Seeing it between your legs felt completely normal to you, like you have had it, since birth.<br>\r\nUnknown to you, you haven't swapped only the way you feel your snatch (having an emptiness between your legs was comfortable, just like you were used to that) and the memory of having one (you remembered, having  a messy, since ever) but also the way you name your equipment. Josh (thinking he has always had a vagina) didn't call male groin \"a dick\" or \"a cock\", like he used to. 'Cause of the swap, he became unaccustomed with the penis, and that was the reason, he was calling it \"a penis\" or \"a crotch\", neutrally, because he was a girl(at least in one way) he was a bit ashamed and intimidated by male genitals.<br>\r\nOn the other way, he was more accustomed with  his vagina, as he  have had it since ever(or at least he thought so) he felt more freedom to call it more casually. That's why he preferred to call his vagina \"a snatch\" or \"a messy\". Courtney on the other hand, had it contrary.<br>\r\nWhat do you, after examining your slit? </span></div></div>",

Don't act stupidly! - you were losing your patience.<br>\r\n-\"I do not\" - she said innocently - \"and I also do not know, why do you make such an uproar about it.\"-saying that, she looked both at you and Megan. <br>\r\n-\"Courtney, let's  be clear! \" - you said upset - \"I am a boy, and I have memories, about your clit. That  happened.\"<br>\r\n-\"But you have always had a  clit\" - Courtney was definitely surprised. <br>\r\n-\"Wait, what?! What did you just said, sis'?\" - you were sure, you overheard her. <br>\r\n-\" You have always had a pussy, Josh, as far, as I can remember.\" - she said, feeling completely normal. <br>\r\n-\" But Courtney, every boy has a penis, and every girl has vagina. That's how world works.\"<br>\r\n-\" Yes, but you were born with a vagina, and everyone feels completely Ok with this, it's normal\"<br>\r\n-\"Courtney, how could this be normal? Boy cannot have a clit!\" <br>\r\n-\"Some boys have vaginas, and some girls have penises. Like you and me.\" - Courtney  felt nothing unusual in that situation. <br>\r\n-\" Wait. How : \"like me\"? \"That one caught you off guard. <br>\r\n-\" I have a cock, silly.\" - she said, in a careful way. <br>\r\nYou looked at your sister one more time, to be sure, you're right. Although Courtney's breasts were still developing,and weren't very big(they were A's), you could see  two mounds of flesh, pressing against the fabric of her shirt. They were at their place. Next, your sight went to her crotch. If she was wearing a skirt, you'd have a problem, to decide, if she has a penis, or not. But fortunately, your sister was wearing white leggins, so you could check her package. She had a flatness in her crotch. If she had a penis, her leggins would stretch to their limits, and they were completely normal. So yeah, Courtney still had her private parts. She was 100% girl.<br>\r\n-\"Courtney, you have clitoris, you're a normal girl.\"- you tried to convince her. <br>\r\n-Nonsense, I have always had a dick\" - she was shouting powerless. -\"I have it, just as I stand here. Guys, why don't you believe me?! <br>\r\n-\"Sister, don't you realize?! Just look at yourself!\" <br>\r\nShe dragged her head down.What she saw, were two mounds of flesh, sticking out  her chest, standing proudly. Courtney was petrified.<br>\r\n<b> - \"What!!! What the...\" </b> - she immediately looked underneath her shirt, and saw her light pink training bra. <br>\r\n<b>-\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!!!\" </b>- her scream was so high-pitched, that you were sure, it was heard in the entire hause. And you were in the freaking epicentre!!That sound was destroing your ears! <br>\r\n-\"What are these?!!\" - she said, disbelieving. Her hands went to her breasts and clutched them rampantly. That was a huge mistake. <br>\r\n<b>-\"Aaauch!!\" </b> -  she bent her knees,  to not  fall down, when a grievous shiver, spread across her entire body, from tip to toes. - \"That hurts! I didn't remember my chest to be so sensitive!\" - she said, while aching. <br>\r\nShe put her hands on her breasts, once again. Now Courtney remembered, to be much more gentle. Then she realized something. Her hand went to her  crotch, and grabbed the spot, where a  boy would have a penis. Instead, Courtney felt nothing, a void. A horror sensation appeared on her face. She slid her hand into her slit, touching another sensitive spot. This time, it caused her to moan with a characteristic o-like<br>\r\nshaped mouth. She wasn't prepared for these experiences, for sure. <br>\r\nYou heard steps in the corridor, and knew, what is about to happen - your mum wants to know, what the hell was that scream! Oh no! She can't know, what's going on here. Even, if the swap should alter the reality, you didn't want to risk. You and Megan exchanged looks, and began to hustle, to sort things up. What's strange, even if you didn't say anything, you exactly knew, what to do(maybe non-verbally... somehow), You grabbed your sister, and covered her mouth. She began to wriggle furiously. Your mom opened the door. <br>\r\n-\"What was that scream?  What happened? <br>\r\n-\"Nothing bad, Mrs. Mitchell.\" - Megan was trying to salvage you -\" Courtney just saw a spider, and frightened. <br>\r\n-Are you sure? Courtney, are you all right? <br>\r\n-\"She's fine, Mrs. Mitchell. She is just shocked.\" - Megan answered. <br>\r\nYou did your best to act, like you were hugging your sister. Lucky for you, she stopped wringing, for a moment. <br>\r\n-\"I didn't know she still reacts to spiders like that. Josh, Megan, cheer her up, okay? <br>\r\n-\" Of course, Mrs.Mitchell.\"- said Megan,politely.<br>\r\nYour mom, closed the door<br>\r\nYou finally let Courtney go. She actually freed by herself,wringling fiercely. It was like keeping a little devil. <br>\r\n-\"What has happened to my body?\" - she faltered. She began to walk slowly through your room. - \"Don't worry\" - she said catching her breath. - \"it's just a bad dream. A very, very bad, tits-growing dream.\"<br>\r\nThen, she stopped walking. You could see tears, coming to her eyes. She tried  to imprison her despair, but you knew, it's no use. Finally, she broke. She fell on your bed, hid her face in her hands, and burst out crying. <br>\r\nYou and Megan felt bad for Courtney, that the swap affected her so radically, and you were trying to comfort her.<br>\r\n-\"Courtney,please,cheer up\" - you said. <br>\r\nNothing happened. <br>\r\n-\"Bestie, please, don't cry\" - said Megan in a soft voice<br>\r\n-\"Sister,please, stop sobbing. <br>\r\nStill nothing happened. <br>\r\n-\" Courtney, please, get up. We may try to found out what happened. </span></div></div>",

'<i>I could use a little vacation from my life</i>.'  He looked back over at Megan.  \"What about school and everything.  I doubt that you will be able to keep up with my classes.\"  Josh chuckled at the thought of it.  Ever since he'd met Jenn, his grades have certainly took a turn for the better, hence why his Mom never seemed to frown when she came over.  But with his grades much higher, Josh didn't want his sister's friend to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you could swap schooling with me and I will be able to do it.\"  Megan suggested, still trying to get a new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we do it until Monday and we will swap back before we go to school.\"  Josh counter offered, but Megan still didn't seem like she was interested.  \"Or when Summer break gets here in a couple weeks we can do it for a longer time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan thought about it for a moment.  \"I think I can do that.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one?\"  Josh wondered thinking that he'd be able to get off easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about both.\"  Megan suggested.  \"I get to be you until Monday morning and this summer you can be me for a couple weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that can work.\"  Josh thought out loud, but it seems that phrase was enough his power to activate.  He blinked and instantly noticed that he was sitting at the foot of the bed, where Megan was sitting just a few seconds earlier.  \"What the heck?\"  He exclaimed as he saw the strand of red hair fall in front of his eyes.  Looking down he found that he still had his body, but was now wearing the light blue skirt and blouse that she had been wearing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it worked.\"  Megan exclaimed jubilantly as she looked down at her new clothes.  She went over to the mirror to see her reflection and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Courtney asked as she went over to Megan and laughed.  She looked in the mirror and saw her brother's reflection copying every movement that Megan made.  \"Josh you need to come over here and see this.\"  Josh, not really knowing what was going on made his way over and was speechless at what he saw.  Megan's lovely reflection met him with the dumbfounded look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, seeing the look on her face in the mirror, turned to Josh.  \"Oh, relax it will only be until Monday morning.  In the meantime, I think we should have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, it's my turn.\"  Courtney protested.  \"I mean, you want your skills back, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\"  Josh replied.  \"So what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will take your ________.\"</span></div></div>",

If you do that, then I will bring something for you two to do.\"  She looked at Josh and Courtney with her hands on her hips and didn't seem to think that anything was different.  Didn't bat an eye that her daughter was now 5 and a half feet tall, or that her son was now dressed in a light blue skirt and a blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mom.\"  Courtney chuckled as she grabbed her brother's hand and ushered him out of his own and across the hall to her and Bri's room.  As the entered the room, Courtney quickly shut the door and leaned up against it.  \"OMG, I can't believe that worked.\"  She then looked over at her brother, who was standing in front of her makeup mirror looking at Megan's reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too weird.\"  He replied as he brought a strand of rogue, red hair behind his ear. </span></div></div>",

From the red, curly hair that went down to his shoulders to the way he was dressed, she really couldn't take him seriously.  \"I'll think about it.\"  She replied with the biggest grin, but laughed even harder when she saw her brother put his hands on his hips in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you WILL swap back with me on Monday.\"  He demanded once more as he sat down on the bed.  Sitting down on the bed gave him time to cool off before he did something too drastic.  As he sat down on the bed, he sighed when he found that Megan's reflection showed in his sister's makeup mirror.  He shook his head, trying to clear his head, but felt his now longer hair swish in his face.  \"Grr... This hair is so aggravating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help you.\"  Courtney chuckled as she sat down next to her changed brother and put her hand on his shoulder.  He seemed to be calmed down enough to reason with him.  \"Trust me.\"  Josh sighed once more as he watched in the mirror to see Megan getting her hair fixed by her friend.  After a minute, he found the hair to be more reasonable to manage.  \"See, I told you to trust me.  Look, the reason why I wanted to keep your height a little longer was because of basketball tryouts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh was taken aback at what he heard.  \"Wait... Basketball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know what you're thinking.\"  Courtney smiled once more, but this time it seemed more sincere.  \"Oh, Courtney, little miss pageant queen, trying to get on a team.\"  Josh was in awe at the innocent outpouring that his sister was showing towards him.  \"I just wanted to be more than a beauty queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Courtney, I...\"  Josh was speechless at what he was hearing.  \"I didn't know.  Why didn't you say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to, but you looked so funny being mad and everything, that it slipped my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know that height alone won't get you on the team, right?\"  Josh pointed out to her.  \"I mean sport skill have a big part in it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think about that.\"  Courtney replied with a look of concern.  \"Will you do me a favor and swap that with me?\"  The look on Josh's face was certainly a look of shock.  After all, he'd just got back his skills at the price of a new life and a loss of height.  Courtney could see the look of concern on his face and decided to point out something.  \"I just want to have your basketball skills is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to calm Josh a little bit.  \"You know I haven't really played basketball in almost...\"  He took a moment to count out the years on his right hand.  \"In almost five years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you played for the school and if I remember right, you played really well.\"  Courtney replied back to her brother and tried to play at his ego a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I wasn't that good.\"  Josh thought back.  \"That's the main reason why I quit, I found that band was more my forte.\"  He laughed at his music joke, but saw that his sister didn't really get it.  \"Now, if I swap my skills with you what do you have to offer and how long do you want to keep them?\"  He really didn't want to have something from his sister, but found the negotiations to be a little bit addicting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm willing to give you anything.\"  Courtney replied after thinking about it for a moment.  \"But I want to keep it as long as I'm on the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only fair.\"  Josh replied thinking about it too.  \"How about you think about it for a little bit longer and let me know on Monday when we swap back, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I exchange something for your basketball skills, then we will be stuck until we swap back?\"  Courtney wondered out loud to her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that way I know I will get it back and I think it will need to be something that you will want back.\"  Josh pointed out to his sister.  \"I mean, I don't want to get your hay fever or your period.\"  He shuddered slightly at the thought of having his sister's period for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney chuckled at that.  \"Agreed.  I will think it over and will try to make it worth your while.\"</span></div></div>",

They both heard the door unlock and the dog's barking started to grow louder with the barricade between them gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Josh.\"  Kira replied with surprise, not really expecting to see him.  \"Oh and Megan what are you doing here?\"  She asked looking at Josh, not batting an eye at him wearing Megan's clothes or even her hair.  Josh felt a sharp pain as Megan's elbow was rammed into his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I heard that umm...\"  Josh started, trying to think of an excuse.  \"I heard that Josh was coming over and realized that I never really been here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you've never been here huh?\"  Kira giggled grabbing his hand and pulling him inside.  Once inside Josh found Walton jumping up on his leg wagging his tail with anticipation.  \"That's odd.\"  Kira noted as she bent down to pull her dog off of Josh.  \"He usually doen't like people the first time he meets them.\"  Megan knelt down in an effort to pet the dog, but was met with him growling instead.  \"Weird, just like that.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Monday has come. You woke up with a view, blocked by the stripes of ginger, curly hair. Megan's tripes... of ginger, curly hair. <br>\r\n-\"Hello, I missed you.\" - you said sarcastically. You tried to take your hair off your eyes, but it returned. You decided to just give up, trying to fix it. You sat at your bed(and the rapid move of your head, caused all your hair to fall in front of your face.), and tried to recall, what've happened, since you swapped lives with Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n On Friday, your new mum let you  stay overnight,at Courtney's. Fortunately, she was satisfied with the swap, and didn't want anything else from you. On Saturday, you returned to 'your' house. You didn't want to interact with the family of Megan, as you only will have lived in their hause by school's start. , so you examined your room. The walls were painted green, and there were a lot of boxes with plush toys. They took most of the room, actually. It look's like Megan still likes them. There was also a desk, big closet(bigger than yours!), a full-lenght mirror, and of course, your bed. It was next to wall, and was quite small, but you didn't mind it, as you now had Courtney's height, and she was only an inch taller than Megan. You slept in this bed , and it was fitting perfectly for your new, smaller frame. You were actually kind of thankful to Courtney, for giving you her height. You didn't want your legs, to stick out off bed. But that didn't mean, you enjoyed being 4'8.You were struggling  to reach several shelves in your room or bathroom. You were completely helpless. The worst was that, you knew, you could have reached these shelves, if you still had your old height. That was driving you crazy. Searching through her room, you found that Megan had hid her make-up tools, in the drawer with socks. You remember, that Megan told you, that her parents were very strict and didn't allow her to use make-up. But it seems, that she has found a way to bypass that prohibition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunday started awfully. You've found that Megan's family is quite religious, and goes to church on Sunday's. You didn't mind that at all, but your new  mum forced you to wear a dress  to church,even if you were sure <b>you don't want to</b>. You tried to get her to let you wear pants, but she said: \"You're a young lady, and have to dress properly, to a place like this\"(What a bullshit, everyone knows, that girls  aren't prohibited to wear pants, in  church). You didn't want to get Megan into trouble, once you switch back, so you agreed, and docilely put on the clothes, mom prepared for you. It was a green dress and brown mary janes. Through the entire eucharist, you just couldn't get use to wearing nothing, on your legs.\"Why are they wearing these? After all, they have trousers.\", you were wondering. After coming back, from church, Megan (having your live) came to you. You told her, what happened, and she told you not to object her mum, when it comes to, what to wear to church. She also would like to wear something different , but her mum was strict, so she didn't try anymore. Wearing dresses to church, wasn't that bad for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan told you how to behave in her house: what to do, what not to do,  that not to argue with her parents, and few more things. But a bit later, you found a reason, why she came to you. When your mum called you  downstairs, to do something, Megan took all your pants, and left. Now you were forced to  wear skirts and dresses, all the time. Fortunately, she didn't take your sneakers, so you weren't forced to walk in heels(<b>Thank God for that! )</b>. You shouldn't tell her, about the discomforte you have, while wearing dresses. That was a big mistake. Lucky for you, your mum didn't check your wardrobe, or you would have gotten into trouble. <br>\r\nAnd there you are, waking up, at Monday's morning. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked down at yourself. You were wearing Megan's peach pyjamas, you went to sleep in. You actually liked them. The fabric of the pyjamas was making your skin, feel very comfortable. You thought, that's because girls' skin is much more sensitive, so it has to be like this( you didn't complain, in your current situation).<br>\r\n-\"You're nice, but I have to strip you down\" - you told your pyjamas, as you stripped, and looked into the mirror. If that was 3 days earlier, you would feel gross, looking at the best friend of your sister, naked. But since then, you have seen her body so many times in the mirror, that you weren't longer hesitating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mirror, there was  a slim, eleven y.o. girl, completely nude. She had long, ginger, curly hair, part of which was falling, in front of her face, covering her right eye. She was standing at 4 feet and 7 inches tall. At her chest, there were two modest boobs, but because Megan's breasts were even smaller, than Courtney ones, they were barely visible. Between her legs, there was a pussy, with ginger public hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your wardrobe, and began to think, what to wear. Even though Megan took all your trousers, it was still full of various clothes. First of all, you had to put your underwear on. You picked some white panties. \"It doesn't matter, what they are.\" - you thought - \"They are not visible, after all\". Put slid them up your legs, and felt like your member was being crushed. They were meant to be for these, who don't have a penis. You could do nothing. You just had to get used to it. Next was her bra. Although you didn't have breasts, Megan instructed you, to always wear it, even if you feel there is no need, because her mum will get angry. You've already seen you don't have a chance in an argument with her, so you didn't try, and just wore it. You picked her black, training bra. It was weird not to have breasts, so you decided to fill your bra with handkerchiefs. It was much better now, because your bra wasn't hanging loose, on your chest anymore, and your 'breasts' weren't heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTop time! Unfortunately, you had to wear dress or skirt, on your legs. As you've already worn dress, and know how to put it on, you decided to wear a dress. You weren't sure what to choose, as Megan had plenty of them. Normally you wouldn't bother with stuff like: \"what to wear? \", but you were now a girl, and you knew, if you do a ridiculous colors combination, other students will gossip, about your bad taste. First, you picked the green dress, you've worn before, but because of what happened yesterday, you didn't want to wear it again. Next, you picked some good-looking orange one. Normally, you wouldn't have a clue, which colors match each other, but lucky for you, Megan told you something about it(at least she did something good for you, yesterday). She told you, that colors similar to red will be good for you. She said that they will \"emphasize the flameness of your hair\". You weren't sure, what did it mean. You didn't know if Megan was saying truth, about these colors, but as you didn't have a better idea, you decided to wear the orange dress. After that, you only had to pick some shoes. You remember Megan, said something that blue will do nicely with warm colors. Unfortunately, most of Megan's blue shoes were high-heels, <b> which you were sure, you don't want to wear. </b>When you were wondering, you dug a pair of green sneakers, from the end of the wardrobe. \"Hmmm, maybe green will make it?\" You didn't know, if green was good with orange. You lacked that girls' knowledge. But you remembered, your mum had wanted you to wear green dress to church, yesterday. You looked at your ginger hair in the mirror, and  then recalled what Megan told you \"Blue will do nicely with warmer colors\". You were pretty sure orange is a warm color. \"Maybe if blue matches orange, then green does too? They aren't very different.\" You looked at the sneakers, you were holding in your hands, once again.<br>\r\n-\"Screw it\" - you put the sneakers on your feet, together with some socks. They looked quite good, but the most important, were very comfortable. You looked at yourself in the mirror,and you could tell, you were quite satisfied. With the exception of  an alien feeling of your dress, you felt really nice. If the girl weren't you, you'd tell she was quite pretty. You looked at the clock, and realized, that you have been dressing up, for a half an hour. Now you understood, why girls start getting ready to school so early. <br>\r\nYou weren't sure, if you looked  nice, so you decided to ask your mum. You went downstairs and saw your mum, making a breakfast.<br>\r\n-\"Mum, do I look good, with these things on?\" - you asked and started to spin 'round, causing your dress to float, like in all of these movies.<br>\r\n-\"Nice one, daughty. You look really amazing.\"<br>\r\n-\"Thanks,I did my best\" - this caused you to giggle, just like girls do.<br>\r\n-\"What happened to you? Yesterday you didn't want to put the dress on.\"<br>\r\n-\"I think, I just was not myself\" - you felt funny, 'cause this was actually true.<br>\r\n-\"It's good, you're here already, because breakfast is ready\"<br>\r\nAt breakfast, you  hardly managed to eat one-third, of what you eat usually. \"I think that quantity of food, is just right, for a girl my age(or Megan's age).\" You went to bathroom to pee, one more time(lucky for you, you could still pee like a boy, standing up), washed your hands, said \"See you!\" to your mum and left to school. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You knew, that Megan goes to school by bus, but the bus stop is quite far, from your house, so you had to walk on foot, a few minutes. Unfortunately, it was very windy, and every gust was causing your dress to fly in the air, revealing your panties completely. <br>\r\n-\"Curse you, Megan!\" - you said to yourself,clutching your dress, trying not to let her fly- \"I wish, I put pants on.\"<br>\r\nYou reached the bus stop, and in a few minutes, the bus has arrived. It was full of people, and there were hardly any free places to sit. Fortunately, you found two free seats.You sat down, neating your dress, before you did. \"I have to get rid of this ASAP\". Next you saw some boy, looking for a place to sit. He was young, probably about Briana's age. <br>\r\n-\"Can you get out, and let me sit here?-he asked<br>\r\n-\" There are two free seats, here, so you can sit next to me\" - you said, moving yourself to the seat, next to the window. <br>\r\n-\"No, I won't sit next to the girl. Girls have cooties and stink.\" - you were quite in shock, by what he said. <br>\r\n-\"Then buzz off! No one wants you here! - you said angrily. Megan, better give me my live back, or you'll be in serious trouble. You couldn't believe, that that boy offended you, in a way like this. <br>\r\nNext you saw some girl stepping to you. <br>\r\n-\" Hello, can I sit next to you?\" - she said politely<br>\r\n-\"Sure\" <br>\r\n-\"Thank you\" - she said, sitting down, in the free spot, next to you. You looked at the girl closely. She was probably a bit younger, then you were now, but older, than a boy, you've met before. She had long, brown hair, that was cascading down her back, and big, blue eyes. She was wearing a green blouse, blue skirt, white pantyhose and green flats. She also had a blue hair-barrette, and there was a grey school bag, on her back. <br>\r\n-\"Do I know you?\" - you asked politely. <br>\r\n-\"Umm... no, I don't think so.\" <br>\r\n-\" I don't think so too.\" <br>\r\n-\"So, let's introduce to each other. My name is Nora\" - she said, giving you a hand, to embrace. So her name was Nora. <br>\r\n-\"Nice to meet you, Nora. I'm Megan.\" - you said, embracing her hand. <br>\r\n-\"Nice to meet you too. And by the way, that dress, of yours is very pretty.\"<br>\r\n-\"Thanks\"-you couldn't help, but got red. <br>\r\n-\"But hey, I see you're thinking about something. Did something happen?\" <br>\r\nYou told her about the situation, with the boy. <br>\r\n-\"What a meanie! I hate those boys! \"<br>\r\n-\" Yeah, I do not like them either.\" - you were conforming, to what she said.<br>\r\n-\"I know what you're telling about\" - Nora said - \"I have an elder brother, and he likes to make fun, of me.\"<br>\r\n-\"Fortunately,I don't have a brother\" - you said to her. <br>\r\n-\"Lucky you! Seriously, he's playing these video games, all the time. What's so amazing in them?\" <br>\r\n-\"I assume, there is something\" - you lied. It was quite interesting to see, what do girls think, about boys. <br>\r\n-\"Yeah, <i>boys</i>, I think I will never understand them.\"<br>\r\n-\"Yeah....\" - you actually found this girly talk nice. <br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would be funny.\" - you have just realized, what did you say. - \"Wait! Noo!!! Nononono!! - you were shouting, but it was too late. You saw a familiar flash of light, and lost consciousness, for a few seconds, Nora did the same.<br>\r\n-\" Urghh...\" - you were trying to get up, hoping that it didn't happen. <br>\r\n-\" What happened?\" - Nora asked - \"Megan, do you know, what was that light?\"<br>\r\n-\"I'm afraid, I know\" - you looked down. You still had Megan's ginger, curly hair. It seemed, that you will have them, 'till you swap back with Megan, no matter what other swap you would have. You examined your arms next. You saw, there was a lot less hair,  than before. Your hands were smaller, and your fingernails were slightly longer and more dainty, like girl's. You touched your arm. It was much more sensitive, than on your old one. You looked at your chest next. Fortunately, Nora hasn't started maturing yet, so her chest was completely flat. You ran over your new legs, and they were just like arms: sensitive, smooth and slender. Finally your hand went under your dress and grabbed your crotch. You felt an unfamiliar and unpleasant emptiness, telling you that you had a pussy now. No doubt, you swapped bodies with that girl, by accident. Now, not only you looked like a girl(for everyone else), but also had a body of one. You looked at Nora. She kept her long, brown hair, but her face was masculine, and looked just like your old one. She even had some facial hair. Her arms and legs were a bit thicker than before, her hands were bigger, and there was an evident bulge in her skirt.<br>\r\n-\"That's odd. I feel kinda strange, not like myself.\" - she said.<br>\r\n-\"Nora...just...look down at yourself\" - you forced yourself to tell her.<br>\r\nNora took her head down, and saw a tent in her skirt. <br>\r\n-\"What?!\" - her hand went  to it, and grabbed her new member. - \"What the... <i>Oh God... Oh My God...\"</i> - she said in a weak voice. - \"Megan something happened to me! I have a dick!\" - she said, disbelieving. Do you tell her your secret?</span></div></div>",

Just a few minutes ago her day was completely normal, and now she was a part of some Freaky Friday thing. But on the other hand, it was quite interesting for her<br>\r\n-\" I still don't understand, why we've swapped.\" - she said. <br>\r\n-\"To make a swap,  I and one other person, must agree to swap something. Nora, do you remember, what happened, when we swapped? You said you'd like to swap bodies, with some boy to punish him for laughing at girls, by letting him be one of them. I didn't pay attention and nodded in assent. Then we swapped. \"<br>\r\n-\" Yeah, that's right\" - now she was much more sure, that was a truth. <br>\r\nYou both paused for a while. <br>\r\n-\"You know, the more I am in this body, the more I'm unsure about something.\" - she said<br>\r\n-\"Fire away!!\" - you encouraged her, to confess to you. <br>\r\n-\"If  I have a boy's body, then what about my parents and friends?

Nora, do you have your school ID, here? <br>\r\n-\" Ummm... I should have, why?\" - she was surprised. <br>\r\n-\" Don't ask, just show it to me.\" <br>\r\nShe began to dig trough her backpack and in a while, managed to find it. <br>\r\nYou looked at the photo, first. Although Nora still had her long brown hair, she also had a masculine face, facial hair, and was looking more loke a boy, than a girl, actually. You looked at the rest of the information<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"><i>Name:<br>\r\nNora Rebecca<br>\r\nSurname:<br>\r\nDaniels<br>\r\nGender:<br>\r\nF</i></div><br>\r\n-\"So it's really true\" - she said in a weak voice, looking at the photo. - \"I'm a boy now...\" <br>\r\n-\"No, you are not! Nora, look here! There, where is gender, there is \"F\" checked. You're still a female and your name is the same! \"<br>\r\n-\" So, I'm still a girl\" - she said with a happiness<br>\r\n-\"Yes, just looking differently\" <br>\r\nYou could see the relief on her face<br>\r\n-\"You know, I think I will check mine,too\" - you said<br>\r\nYou began to dig, in searching of your school ID, and after several seconds you finally found it. <br>\r\nYou checked your identity card. <br>\r\nThe face on the photo was definitely Megan's. You could see her ginger, long, curly hair ( which took half of the photo, actually), her green eyes, and a lot of freckles, on  all of her face. <br>\r\nYou looked at your name. It was written:<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"><i>Name:<br>\r\nMegan Elizabeth<br>\r\nSurname: <br>\r\nMcCullay</i></div><br>\r\nHmm... so her middle name was Elizabeth. You didn't know that. You checked your gender, but as you assumed, it was \"F\" there. <br>\r\n-\"Have you found something interesting\" - Nora asked you. <br>\r\n-\"Not really, I'm Megan in all ways, from tip to toe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next? </span></div></div>",

She looks just like me, now\" - you pointed your fingers, at your chest - \"My sister let her swap something with me\"<br>\r\n-\"And she wanted to swap lives with you?\" - Nora assumed.<br>\r\n-\"Yes, and I think I know why\" - you grabbed some stripes of Megan hair - \"She was fed up with this thing, getting in her eyes, all the time. I have it for a three days, and it can't stop irritating me\" <br>\r\n-\"Girls' reality\" - Nora said - \"We all struggle with this. Don't worry, you'll get used to it. But I have to admit, that your 'messy' is quite impressive\"<br>\r\n-\"Thanks... I think\" - you weren't sure if that was a compliment.<br>\r\n-\"So, what did you swap, eventually?\" - she asked<br>\r\n-\"I swapped lives with Megan, and height with my sister. But the last one isn't important, because Megan is only an inch shorter than her\" - you explained to her. <br>\r\n-\"Could you tell me a little bit more, about your family?\" - she called on you. <br>\r\n-\"Well... so, I have 2 sisters. The older one name is Courtney, and she is 12,and the younger one name is Brianna, and she is 8.We live only with our mum, our dad left us alone\" - you found it strange, that you were confessing to the girl, who you met for the first time, only a few minutes ago. But you thought, because you swapped bodies with her, she was quite a close person to you now. You felt that you can trust her. <br>\r\n-\"Your mum has to be really brave, to raise three children lonely.\" - Nora felt sorry for Josh. Not having a dad must be really hard for him. She didn't know, what it's like to have mum only, she had both parents. - \"Not having a dad, had to be really  difficult for you.\" <br>\r\n-\"Yeah, he left us for some  bitch. But my mum was always there, when we needed her. Although we argue sometimes, she's a great mum.\" <br>\r\n-\" I'm quite envious of you, you know. I have always wanted, to have a sister I can turn to, I can confess to. But I've got my useless brother instead.\" - she said, full of anger. <br>\r\n-\" And I, on the other hand, would like to have a brother, but not as badly as you\" - you added quickly. - \" Sisters aren't that bad, but sometimes they're driving me crazy, especially Courtney\"  Then both of you realized something. <br>\r\n<b>-\"But I don't want to swap families with you!!\" <br>\r\n</b> - you said at the same time. Then both of you busted out laughing, because of the carefulness, you had after the swap. That was strange. Only a few minutes ago, you didn't know that girl, and now she was like a third sister for you.<br>\r\n-\" You're actually quite like a princess from fairy tale, enchanted and forced to be imprisoned, in the body of an ugly frog. She's imprisoned in other body, just like you are now\" - Nora said.<br>\r\n-\"A bit\" - you giggled - \"But my new body isn't as ugly, as frog's.\"<br>\r\n-\"Of course it's not\" - she giggled too - \"But will your prince, on the white stead, arrive to rescue you?\"<br>\r\n-\"I do not know, Nora, really\" - you began to think about your current situation.<br>\r\nYou were silent for a while. <br>\r\n-\"So, when you're about to swap back?\"<br>\r\n-\"Today, at school. When I meet Courtney and Megan.\"<br>\r\nNora hesitated for a while.<br>\r\n-\"But we'll still be friends, even if you'll be a big boy again?\"<br>\r\n-\"Of course. I do really enjoy spending time with you. Actually, I don't feel uncomfortable in this body when we talk.\" - you thought about, what it would be like, to be friends, with much younger girl. But you were friends with Kira, so it wasn't new for you.<br>\r\nYou looked through the window, and saw, that you were still riding.<br>\r\n-\" We haven't reached school, yet?! Man, this bus is a junk\"<br>\r\nYou began to think about what happened, and said:<br>\r\n-\"You know, Nora. I think I hurt you, by swapping <br>\r\nour bodies. I'll switch us back.\"<br>\r\n-\"Wait! No! - she stopped you - Having this body  may be strange, but other way it's... even nice. I'd like to see, what it's like to be a boy. For a while, but not too long. I don't want to be a boy forever, I enjoy being a girl.\" <br>\r\n-\"But actually, I'd like to swap something with you. <br>\r\nI mean, unless you don't want to, then I will understand.\" - she said<br>\r\n-\"No, of course you can.\" - you were pretty sure, that Nora won't try to trick, just like Courtney did. Even though, you were still a little afraid, what will she choose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We have never gotten on well . We didn't spend much time. That really hurt me,I felt alone.\" she said with sadness in her voice<br>\r\n-\"I always seemed to be a pest for my brother.\" - she continued - \"He has always been treating me like a pain in the butt. Laughing at me, because I was \" so immature and infantile\". I'm not sure, why he was so mean to me. I think that's because I was so much younger, and a girl,so we didn't have any common interests. I think, if I could play video games, just as he, our relations would be much better.  He has never been emphatic to me, and I on the other hand, used to call his video games passion \"stupid\", because I didn't understand it. I really want our relations to thaw, we were always so cold and toxic to each other. He's my only brother after all. Josh, please! - she begged you.<br>\r\n-\"How old is your brother?\" - you asked.<br>\r\n-\"He's 14\" - Nora said<br>\r\n-\"A year younger, than me. \"<br>\r\n-\"Will you swap with me, Josh?\" - she said, quietly.<br>\r\n-\"Nora... actually... I have just gotten these skills back. Courtney took them from me, and later wanted another swap, if I wanted to have them back. That's why I am looking like this.\" - you grabbed Megan's hair.<br>\r\n-\"So you won't.\" - she was disappointed - \"Okay. You don't want to lose them again. I fully understand\"<br>\r\n-\"No, Nora, you've misunderstood me! I just wanted to say, that I've just gotten these skills back. I'll swap with you.\"<br>\r\n-\"Really?\" - you could see a relief on her face... or rather your face now.<br>\r\n-\"Yeah\" - you weren't very happy, becoming a noobie again. But you felt, you have to thank Nora for her sensitivity, toward you.<br>\r\n-\"Thank you!\" - she hugged you tightly - \"You're the best, Josh.\"<br>\r\n-\"It's ok, Nora, but... please, could you... not hold me... so tightly?\" - you said, trying to catch oxygen. She wasn't letting you breath!<br>\r\nShe realized.<br>\r\n<b>-\"Oh My God, I'm so sorry!!!\" </b> - she released you - \"I have completely forgotten, that I have your stronger, male body now, and you have my girly, more vulnerable one!\"<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, Nora. Nothing happened to me.\" - you said,grabbing your chest, but felt it wasn't true at all. She almost suffocated you! \"Man, what power this girl has. \" - you thought.<br>\r\n-\"Okay, so what do I have to do now, to make a swap?\" - she asked you.<br>\r\n-\"You have to say, what do you want to swap with me\"<br>\r\n-\" Right... I wish to swap your video games skills with me.\"<br>\r\n-\"And I agree\" - you said. Then the familiar, bright light appeared.<br>\r\n-\"I don't feel any different\" - Nora said - \"Did it happen?\"<br>\r\n-\"I think, it did. That was a mental swap, so you don't feel different. Tell me: what are the controls, in \" Call of Duty\"? \"<br>\r\nShe explained everything to you, perfectly.<br>\r\n-\" Oh Gosh! \"- she covered her mouth - \"I haven't played \" Call of Duty\", before. I swear! You have to believe me! \"<br>\r\n-\" I believe you\"<br>\r\n-\"I haven't played any video games before, actually. I just didn't find them interesting. And now, I see all these possibilities, hidden in them.\" <br>\r\n-\" And I, on the other hand, don't know even, which weapon is which.\"<br>\r\n-\"This is my video games' knowledge.\" - Nora said - \"Or rather lack of it.\" - she giggled. - \"How long can I keep them?\" <br>\r\n-\"Actually, as long, as you want. Megan doesn't have any console in her house, so I won't have an opportunity to use them\" - you said - \"Maybe 'till Friday?\" - you proposed. <br>\r\n-\"Friday is longer, than I wanted. Fine\" - she said - \"Oh my!\" - she grabbed her head - \"It still can' t get into my mind, that I will be able to play video games, with my brother.

Okay\" - Nora answered.<br>\r\n-\"I wish to swap bodies with you, Nora\"<br>\r\n-\"I wish that, too\" - she nodded.<br>\r\nYou saw bright light, again, and when it faded, you were back to normal. You reached underneath your dress, and were relieved, that you had a dick again. You may be a girl now, but not having a dick was too much.<br>\r\n-\"It's good to be a girl, again\" - Nora said, touching all of her body.<br>\r\n-\"I feel good, too.\" - you answered. - \"Nora, can we exchange phone numbers? I'd like to talk with you more, later\"<br>\r\n-\"Sure\"<br>\r\nYou did this. You were sure to give her not only Megan's number, but also yours.<br>\r\nYou entered school, said \"See ya\" to Nora, and started looking for Courtney and Megan. Lucky for you, your school and Megan and Courtney's one, were next to each other, so there was no problem to  meet during lessons. After several minutes you found your sister.<br>\r\n-\"Wow, bro! You look outstanding!\" - she said, looking at your dress.<br>\r\n-\"Thank you, but actually it was just luck, and what Megan told me.\"<br>\r\n-\"But... no... seriously. You look great. Your clothes match each other, are yet stylish and comfortable, and yet official and casual. And that orange dress looks awesome with your  ginger hair. I think I'll have to buy orange dress for myself, too.\"<br>\r\n-\"I'm glad, that you appreciate my clothing, but I want to have my live and my height back.

I won't bear, wearing dresses and skirts, any longer!\" <br>\r\nCourtney began to think. <br>\r\n-\"I think I know, how to help you, brother. We may swap clothing preferences. You'd like to  wear dresses then.\" <br>\r\n-\"What?! No way! I won't do that!\" - you refused. <br>\r\n-\"Bro, I know you don't like it, but think about it, for a while. You have to stay as Megan much longer, so you'll have to wear dresses. If we swap, you'll feel nice in them. Otherwise, you'll struggle in them.\" <br>\r\nYou began to analyse it. That makes sense. <br>\r\n-\"And what about you?\" - you asked your sister. <br>\r\n-\"I think, I'll just wear pants, all the time. Don't worry about that, I have plenty of them.\"<br>\r\n-\"Ok, but even, if we swap that, I still want my pants back... I mean Megan's pants back! I know you took them.\" <br>\r\n-\"Don't worry, I will bring them tomorrow. We just wanted to play one-time prank on you. We wanted to see, how'd you handle to wear a dress or a skirt.It was just today, no longer.\" <br>\r\nYou both paused, for a moment. <br>\r\n-\"Do you want to do that swap, bro?\" - she asked you. <br>\r\n-\"Fine, but only, if we'll swap back, when I get my live back.\" <br>\r\n-\"Sure\" <br>\r\n-\"Ok, I wish to swap clothing preferences, with you, sis\" <br>\r\n-\"I accept\" - she said, and then the swap occurred. Your clothes were the same, but you were sure, they felt different. You looked below. Your dress felt really, really nice. You liked the sensitivity, its fabric was giving to your skin,and the freedom, the dress was giving to your legs, made you feel very comfortable. <br>\r\n-\"Oh... that stinks!\" - you heard your sister. You looked at her. She was wearing white blouse, light green skirt, and beige high heels. You were sure, that after the swap, she was feeling very uncomfortable,in that outfit.<br>\r\n-\"I must get rid of these!\" - she said, and took her heels of her feet. She was now bare-footed, and was holding her shoes, in her hands. - \"I don't know, how I could wear them. They are soooo uncomfortable. My feet hurt! \" - you couldn't help, but you had an urge to wear these heels. <br>\r\n-\"Courtney, are you... going to be bare-footed?\" <br>\r\nShe was wondering. <br>\r\n-\"You know, I have P. E today, so I can wear my <br>\r\nP. E sneakers.\"<br>\r\n-\"And what with your skirt?\" - you asked.<br>\r\nShe looked at it, once again. <br>\r\n-\"I don't know. I think I'll just have to bear it, for today.\" - she said - \" Oh Gosh\" - she said in a weak voice - \"Now I know, how you were struggling, in these girly clothes. I feel awful! At least tell me, that you enjoy, your new-self.\" <br>\r\n-\"More than enjoy, Courtney. I feel wonderful in this dress!\"<br>\r\n-\"I'm happy, that you're happy\" - she said, but it was obvious, that she was feeling a massive discomfort.<br>\r\n-\"Wait. If you have my clothing preferences now, it makes you a tomboy, right?\" <br>\r\n-\"Yeah, but I feel completely fine with this. I wouldn't stand, dressing girly. Besides, being a tomboy might be an interesting experience.\" <br>\r\nYou found it quite frightening, that Courtney said, she wouldn't mind being a tomboy. She was always so girly. <br>\r\nYou realized something.<br>\r\n-\" Courtney, you wanted my basketball skills, right? \"<br>\r\n-\"Yes, I've completely forgotten! Thank you! Can we...\"<br>\r\n-\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n-\"But, you're in my class now, remember? We might practice basketball, during P. E.\"<br>\r\n-\"Screw it.\"<br>\r\n-\"Thank you, elder brother.\" - she said. - \"I want to swap my basketball skills, with you.\" <br>\r\n-\"It's ok. I accept.\" - you said, and saw the bright light. Although you felt, like nothing happened, it was a mental swap, so it was normal. <br>\r\n- \"I offered you something in exchange, for your basketball skills.

You helped her, to get up. - \"Here!\" - she put her heels of her feet, and gave you - \"You should try.\" <br>\r\nYou hestitated. <br>\r\n-\"Courtney... I think it won't work. I have much bigger feet, than you. Your shoes won't fit me\" <br>\r\n-\"But I thought, that reality changed, and Megan's shoes fit you perfectly.

Then the bright light had  appeared, and you changed. You looked below. Although Couprtney was still maturing, her shapes were much wider, than yours. Your hips were much wider, and were making your dress look even better. You grabbed your ass,by two hands. It was much bigger, rounder, and more bubble-like. It was pushing your dress outwards, causing you, to look even more like female. Your legs were much more slender, and looked like, they were belonging to some really skinny lady. You even had Courtney's smaller feet, with pink and green nail polish.Thank Godness, you still had your cock!<br>\r\nYou looked at your sister. Legs that used to be hers were much shorter than yours. As you now had Courtney shorter legs, and she had your longer ones, you were much closer in height. You decreased from your 5'5 to 5'1 and your sister rose from 4'8 to 5'0,making you almost the same height.Her legs were thicker, with much more hair, and her feet were bigger. She also had much narrower hips, and her figure didn't look that great and feminine anymore. <br>\r\n-\"How does it feel, sister?\" - you asked. <br>\r\n-\"I feel much more... flat, in some regions\" - she answered. You could see, that her hips and butt weren't pushing her skirt outwards anymore. Her lower parts seemed, like they were belonging to a  boy in skirt, not to normal girl. They didn't have these female shapes, they used to have and weren't very sexy. - \"You know, I think I'll need to shave your legs. They look ridiculous, on girl's body.\" - she said. She was wearing a skirt, so your thicker, hairer legs were more than visable. <br>\r\nYou tried to walk in heels, one more time.This time, you found yourself swinging your butt in every direction, and your hips were swaying rhytmically, as you were taking your steps. It caused you to look and feel even more like a girl. <br>\r\n\"I walk like some really suggestive chick\" - you thought. - \"Now, I know why they do this, all the time. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime for your first lesson. What is it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Many people were running around trying to get to where they needed to be before the rain got worse. Cars were sliding around on the road, it looked like a dangerous time to drive. Josh realized that it might have been better if he didn't take the school bus. He started to run a few times, not wanting to be caught in bad weather. This plan came to no avail however, as he slipped and almost fell flat on his face a couple of times before deciding to take it slow and easy. A truck drove by a giant puddle, and Josh was the victim of the wet and muddy splash. Soaking wet and cold, Josh hurried home with the protection of his umbrella. Luckily for him, Josh found a note on the kitchen table when he walked in. It was from his mom reading that she went to go pick up Bri from elementary school, while Courtney stayed after school for some math tutoring. This bought him some time so his mom wouldn't catch him walking around the house in his current state, nor would his sisters witness to snitch later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as he was soaked, cold, and muddy, Josh decided it would be best if he took a shower now. It was Friday, and he wasn't planning on leaving the house anyway. He took a quick ten minute shower, not wanting his mom or sisters to walk in and ask questions he rinsed off, shampooed, and washed his body as quickly as possible. As he went along he thought about several things, such as his first move once he got out of the shower, what he would do over the weekend, remembering to get his paper to Mr. Jackson by Monday, and picturing him and Jenn as more than friends. It wasn't any weirder than his typical shower. He eventually turned the water off, ready to hop out of the shower. He was about to reach out for his towel, but he slippedon the floor! The last thing Josh remembered was his head hitting what he thought was the shower drain after his hard fall. Then he blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was unconscious, Josh had what he guessed was some type of dream. He saw his room around him and thought he awoke in his bed, but he was in a ghost form floating upward. He was eventually was out in the rainy weather again, but couldn't feel the rain whatsoever. He floated up to where he was then above the dark clouds. And all he could see was sunshine with nothing else but the sun and blue skies above his head before his long rise upward ceased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" Josh asked. \"Am I dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"NO YOU ARE NOT!\"</i> A loud booming voice suddenly roared, startling the ghostly boy. The voice reminded Josh of his late father's, but much deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Josh asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT! WHAT YOU ARE HEAR FOR IS!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I HAVE CHOSEN YOU AT RANDOM TO BE GIVEN A NEW POWER!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis booming statement seemed to pique Josh's interest. \"And, what is this new 'power'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"THE ULTIMATE POWER OF EMPATHY!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ultimate power of empathy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"YES! YOU MAY EXPERIENCE HOW YOUR FELLOW HUMANS LIVE WITH CONSENT!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means...\" Josh trailed off, hoping for a more clear answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"YOU MAY SWITCH INDIVIDUAL ATTRIBUTES WITH OTHERS WITH AN AGREEMENT OR THEIR PERMISSION!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, Josh could ask any more questions, he felt himself fall back down. Only now, he was human again dropping at an alarming rate. He was about to collide with the roof of his house. But the dream suddenly ended, and he opened his eyes. He looked over to his clock, with read 8:30 AM. Josh knew he hopped in the shower before 3:30 PM. It must have been Saturday now! <i>\"Did really sleep for 18 hours?\"</i> Josh thought, rubbing his head, still hurting where he bumped his head on the shower drain. He remembered the strange dream from when he slept, but didn't think anything of it, as he didn't think it actually happened nor did he really understand it. If the voice meant what Josh thought it did, then he definitely must have been dreaming. It was physically impossible to swap traits between two people. It was then he noticed that ______ was sitting there beside his bed, and they were just noticing his awakening.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rain continued to fall at a significant rate with no appearance of quitting any time soon. The constant pitter patter of the rain was only interrupted by the couple of cars that drove by. Josh walked on and soon found he was near a bus stop. \"Too bad I don't have a bus pass.\" He said to himself as he took refuge from the rain in the empty, enclosed stop. He furled up his umbrella and sat down in the enclosure. Back a few years back, the city started to put on these plexiglass enclosures up after much of the community complained about the long waits for the public transportation and having to do so with the constantly changing weather. 'At least, I can take a small break.' Josh thought to himself as he heard a squeaking sound. The sound reminded him of the horrible carts at the big-box store Wal-Mart and he couldn't help but roll his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this seat taken?\" A gravely voice asked as Josh turned to see an older woman pushing a well worn walker. Her hair looked like she had just got out of the shower and her clothes were sopping wet too. Josh got up and offered her the seat. He noticed that she seemed to be smelling of cat urine and deciding not to make eye contact with the woman, Josh continued to look straight ahead ignoring the lady almost as if he was entranced by the white noise that the rain caused. \"It's really coming down today, isn't it?\" The older lady asked him with a seemingly aggravated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just nodded his head and tried his best not to breathe out of his nose to help avoid the smell the seemed to be emanating from the old lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly a little irritated at the lack of interest her 'shelter partner' seemed to have, she replied.  \"Yes and I can certainly feel it in my old bones.\"  Josh looked over and noticed that she seemed to be wringing her hands trying to alleviate some of the pain that the years of hard work caused in her gnarled hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm....\" Josh replied as he noticed the rain starting to let up some.  Not wanting to assault his senses any longer, Josh left the shelter without saying a word or gesturing over to lady to tell her farewell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you a bit a pretentious asshole.\" The elderly lady responded back to him as she watched him avoid a puddle of water that began to fill up in a pot hole.  She narrowed her eyes as she watched Josh laugh at his freedom.  Having enough of his attitude, she brought up her gnarled hands and pointed both of them in his direction. As she replied under her breath, she chuckled slightly at her target as he stopped dead in his tracks looking around for something around him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Since you care about how you look around others, you shall be cursed to swap the traits that others wish to give you.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Josh replied while he looked around the street to find the mysterious voice, but soon found that as mysteriously and quickly that it had started, he noticed that it had ended, just as quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up and down the street in hopes to find the owner of the mysterious voice, but only found the occasional stray animal wandering the rain soaked streets. \"What the...\" He shook his head in disbelief. \"Well, I guess I better get back to getting home before Courtney and Bri worry.\" With the rain coming down even harder than before and his umbrella seemingly disappeared, Josh found he made better time by running. Several minutes later, Josh found his way back to the home and in the bathroom to dry off and put on some dry clothes. Having found some drier clothing, he made his way to his room to see about getting his homework done.</span></div></div>",
