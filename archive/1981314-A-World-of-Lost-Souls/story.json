You have just walked along the beach and were now heading back into town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I'm starving. Lets go get something to eat.\" Your girlfriend suggests. You agree and continue walking into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been so long since we've done anything like this.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I've missed this.\" You tell her. You then reach for her hand and hold on to it as you walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seems to be going great. You are both having a good time, and you have a feeling that you might even get lucky tonight. As you reach the center of town, you look around to see that there are tonnes of places where you can eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where do you want to eat?\" Your girlfriend asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to reply, but suddenly you feel something shoot into your back. This is shortly followed by a sharp pain in your head. You have no idea what just happened, but you begin to feel dizzy and your eyesight becomes blurry. Shortly after, you feel yourself black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling okay\" You hear your girlfriend say. Immediately after, your sight returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I felt this pain in my head and then I got dizzy for a second, but I'm fine now.\" You tell her. She doesn't respond to you and as you look up, you see that she isn't even looking at you. You wonder what she is looking at, so you follow her gaze. To your shock and surprise, you end up looking at...Yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!?\" You yell. Still nobody responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, babe. I just got a bit dizzy, that's all.\" Your body says. It then holds your girlfriend's hand and starts walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on!? Who's this guy!?\" You ask your girlfriend, but she doesn't acknowledge you. What's stranger, is that as she walked towards you, rather than going around you, she just walked straight through you. Confused, you look down at yourself. You still appear to look the same, but for some reason, you are transparent and you are floating a few inches off of the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came to the horrible realisation that your body had just been stolen. You don't know how, but something is possessing your body and left your soul bodiless. As you turn around, you see your imposter kiss your girlfriend on the cheek. You are completely speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

You stand there in shock as you watch your body walking away, holding hands with your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't walk away from me!\" You yell at your body, but there's no response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter another 10 seconds, your body turns to your girlfriend and kisses her cheek. \"I love you.\" Your body says. Your girlfriend then turns to your body and smiles. \"I love you too.\" She says and then starts kissing your body. Your eyes are wide in shock and your mouth is hanging open, speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a fit of rage, you fly towards your body. \"I said get back here, imposter!! Give me my body back!!\" You scream. You then direct your soul straight into your body. Everything goes dark and you feel yourself weaving back into your body. Just as you think you are making progress towards taking back control, you hear a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need to try harder than that, kid.\" The voice says. You then feel yourself being forcefully ejected from your body. You are sent flying about 20 feet and crash into a pile of trash bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour girlfriend jumps at the sudden noise from your direction. \"What was that?\" She asks, grasping your body's arm tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably just a rat. Nothing to be scared about.\" The imposter says. You aren't sure if that was supposed to be an insult directed at you, but you notice the body smirk at you before walking away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Stay away from her! Leave her alone!!\" You yell from your slouched position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to take back your body, what do you do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had dirty black hair, along with azure blue eyes and tan skin. He had on a black hoodie and blue jean shorts with sandals. You instantly fly in through the window, causing a bunch of papers to fly around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDan! I need your help!\u201d You shouted, causing your friend to fall back into the ground in shock. Almost as if he heard what you were saying, which makes you extremely relieved. \u201cDan! Can you here me?\u201d Your friend looks up at you and goes wide eyed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAH!!!! Ghost!!! A Ghost!\u201d Dan shouts throwing stuff at you, only for it to go through you causing you to glare slightly in annoyance. After a few minutes, your friend stops throwing stuff and soon got a good look at you. He goes wide eyed at the realization of you being a ghost. \u201cDude, is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it\u2019s me and I need your help.\u201d You then explained what happened between you and this strange specter who took over your body. You then explained how he\u2019s also using your body to get to your girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, sounds like you had a busy day.\u201d Dan smirks as he had his hand in your chest. \u201cHeheheh, so you\u2019re a ghost now?\u201d Dan keeps moving his hand in your chest, only for you to basically glare at him. Suddenly, his hand stops moving in your body causing you to look alarmed. \u201cHey! Let go!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I do that?\u201d You questioned, as your friend\u2019s hand slides out of you through hesitation. \u201cI did crash into trash cans earlier. Maybe I can touch things in the real world?\u201d You walk over to a nearby coffee table as you decide to test this theory. You lift up the table with ease, causing you to smile widely. \u201cYES!! Maybe I can use this to get my body back from that jerk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how can you be touched by me? You said your hand passed through your girlfriend.\u201d Dan remarked as you look to him while placing a hand on your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I can touch people I know personally?\u201d You questioned. \u201cOr maybe you\u2019re like that woman on the show Ghost Whisperer. If it\u2019s the latter, please try not to make me pass on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t, but let\u2019s test and see what else you can do as a spirit.\u201d Dan suggested. Soon you two began to figure out your spiritual powers that might aid you in getting your body back. After a few hours, you learned how to turn your body solid and opaque. As you continued to train, your friend decided to get some sleep leaving you alone. Just as you finished you get bored and looked to Dan\u2019s door. You start to think about what a good friend Dan is to help you out, as you did your body started to glow brightly causing you to look alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah what\u2019s happening?\u201d You look around and stop as you see your best friend in a mirror. \u201cDan, where are you- \u201cYou stop seeing the mirror mimic your movements. \u201cOh my god, I can shapeshift!\u201d You smirk changing back into your original form. \u201cHmm, I wonder what my mother would look like as a young royal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk as you surround yourself with another light. Soon, you looked nearly identical to your mother excluding the regal outfit. You had dark purple hair with a pink streak going through it, your eyes were a lavender purple. You had on a white dress that showed off a lot of your midriff, and barely covered your breasts. You instantly pose in the mirror, before giving a slight twerk-fest before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got to show this to Dan.\u201d You instantly run to the door and was about to kick it open, only to go through the door. \u201cDamn it. Stupid spirit body.\u201d You instantly, go over to Dan who was sleeping happily. \u201cAww, your sleeping so peacefully.\u201d You smile as you instantly turn into a Bengal tiger, climbing up into his bed and letting out a loud roar in his friend\u2019s ear. Dan jumped out of bed startled as you laugh at his shocked expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell!?\u201d Dan shouted in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha!\u201d You smirk turning into your normal form. \u201cI can shapeshift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the best way to do that was scaring me?!\u201d Dan glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome now,\u201d You smirk as you shapeshift into an Egyptian styled version of your girlfriend. You had a white headdress covering your short turquoise hair, wearing cyan blue eye shadow that matched your eyes. You had on a green necklace, along with a white tube top with a see-through veil, along with gold arm bands and a white skirt dress. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t stay mad at a cute girl, in fact you\u2019d do anything to please me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat necklace doesn\u2019t match your outfit.\u201d Dan smuggly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare you!\u201d You snap back. \u201cThe necklace pulls the outfit together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any green on you.\u201d Dan points out as he just stares at your breasts, yet you didn\u2019t notice because of how shocked you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea what fashion is! It\u2019s all about a splash of colors!\u201d You defended in anger, as Dan looked up at you. Suddenly, Dan gives you a deep kiss, yet for some reason you don\u2019t shy away you just melt into it. You move your hands all over your friend\u2019s back, who easily feels your entire body and soon gripped that ass of yours. You blush breaking the kiss, causing your friend to blush looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we cuddle for a bit, it\u2019s the least you could do for waking me up.\u201d Dan remarks, only for you to nod your answer to him.</span></div></div>",

You thought about practicing possession, but then you\u2019d be dealing with your friend spirit then. \u201cHey, I have an idea.\u201d Dan spoke up smiling. \u201cYou could use that new shapeshifting power of yours to turn into a fine hot lady. Man you get all the luck, first you get to walk through walls now you\u2019re a shapeshifter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not sure being out of my body counts as being lucky.\u201d You remarked, with a slight glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, I just want to help you get your body back.\u201d Dan looks down, as you look on worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa know, I\u2019ve read somewhere that the living can alter their appearance to others if they concentrate hard enough.\u201d You suggested. \u201cMaybe, you can help me about by creating an illusion around yourself.\u201d Dan smiles as he starts to concentrate on his appearance, as you shield your eyes while a bright-light surrounds your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light faded, your friend\u2019s appearance had change drastically, more than normal. He had long purple hair with sky blue streaks, his eyes were a dark lavender purple, wearing cyan blue pearl earings with a small flame inside. He had a breast size of two Ds, covered by a purple top with a jewel in the center of it, wearing a purple skirt with a purple jewel in the center of the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, you look like one of those Snob girls.\u201d You smile looking at Dan who grins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, OMG you just figured that out? You totally got some brains.\u201d Dan laughs snobbingly, his voice sounding high pitched and feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you even act like a snob girl.\u201d You look annoyingly at your friend, who smiles and poses cutely.  \u201cNow, let\u2019s get this done and trick that guy into giving my body- \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, hang on. I just need to post some twitter updates on my profs.\u201d Dan smiles as she was on her phone just now, causing you to slightly glare at your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour acting is awful.\u201d You cross your arms in annoyance, as Dan winks to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, you don\u2019t know that?\u201d Dan smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see you use like too much. If it wasn\u2019t me, you\u2019d fool anyone else.\u201d You remark quietly. \u201cI got to say though, those earing are pretty nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like?\u201d Dan smirks happily. \u201cThese were like totes expensive, I had to sell like a bunch of my private islands just to get one. They\u2019re also the new one instant fashion trend that is hitting Paris- oops. No, I mean Pariee. In fact, these were custom-made for me they were each made light so that my ears don\u2019t get hurt for fashion.\u201d Dan smiles happily, unaware of the fact he was annoying you to no end. You sigh as you sit down next to him, looking at the earing very closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do have to say, this is a pretty cool plan.\u201d You smile turning next to him. \u201cIn fact.\u201d Suddenly, you transform back into your Egyptian princess outfit from before with just a few alterations. Your earrings were golden arched hoops, your tank top veil reached to your shoulders. Your skirt was shorter along with a longer veil, and the finest trim gold bracelets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, its different this time. How did you make the earrings?\u201d Dan asks curiously, causing you to grin mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like, its made of the finest gold.\u201d You went on. \u201cIn fact, I had to rent out a few of my pyramids to the finest buyers, just to make one of them. And, mine are way better for they feel weightless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re both two fashionable ladies aren\u2019t we?\u201d Dan smiles happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat we are.\u201d You look your friend over as he does the same, and in the heat of the moment you two lock lips with each other and made out right then and there.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At one bar in particular, you spot a drunk man being thrown out, after refusing to leave. He remains outside after the bar closes. Shortly after, a young woman in her early 20's walks past, and the drunk man starts yelling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sugar tits! You want some of this!?\" He yells, while pointing at his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman gives him a look of disgust and keeps walking. Not satisfied with this, the drunk man begins to follow her. Not liking where this is going, you decide to keep an eye on him. He continues to follow her, until there is nobody else around. He then grabs her and pulls into a dark alley, where he pins her against a wall. Terrified, the woman begins to struggle and scream, but stops when the man threatens her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, or I'll kill you, bitch!\" He yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide that you can't just sit there and let this go any further.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Floating in the alleyway, invisible to the young woman and the drunkard, you realise that nobody is coming to help. It's too dark for anyone to notice this young woman, struggling to free herself of the larger man's grip. To prevent her from screaming, his mitts are clutched around her neck as he forces her to the ground. Whatever might help her get away is inside her purse, but it is beyond her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to fly toward the drunkard, hoping to tackle him much like you did with the motorbike several hours ago. Perhaps you can knock him off guard long enough for the woman to escape. You ready yourself and direct your spiritual energy as hard as you can at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the man lurches! He drags the young woman away from the wall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... And right into your flight path!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect to send the young woman flying, but instead all you see is red. Her red, strappy dress envelops your vision until everything fades to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you feel after coming around again is the sharp pain in your head. Your heart is beating like crazy. You find it difficult to breathe. A hand is wrapped tightly around your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on your knees, bitch.\" The drunkard slurs, and looking through her eyes you know he's talking to you now. You somehow possessed the young woman in the red dress and heels by accident. This isn't what you wanted at all. You smell the man's booze-addled breath, it's hot and putrid and would make you gag if you could breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour knees fold onto the ground as his grip tightens, looming over you like a giant. You know you don't have much time before you pass out. And if that happens, you don't even want to think about what this man might do to her. Do to <i>you</i>, at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while this young woman's arms and upper body aren't as strong as your own, you recall all the years you spent doing martial arts. As a blackbelt, you know every technique to subdue someone much bigger than you, to analyze their weaknesses and use them against them. Your girlfriend's father manages a dojo, and enrolling in his courses helped you bond with the man you had hoped to make your future father-in-law. Karate, kung fu, taikwondo: tools in the self-defense arsenal you refined and mastered with time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis man's weakness, you discover, is his balance. The man is inebriated and his depth perception is poor, especially in this dark alley. With all of this woman's might, you sweep your leg out and connect with the man's foot. He tumbles to the ground violently, letting go of your neck in surprise. You stand up and gasp a big breath of air, feeling your chest heave as the stars in your vision slowly fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have much time, however, as the man cusses loudly and places his palms on the ground. You grab the first thing within reach -- a trash can lid -- by the handle and bash it over the man's head. There's a dull clanging sound... he's sprawled out belly-up on the ground wheezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he is simply dazed before, that knock seems to make him even angrier. In a storm of rage, he springs up and charges straight for you. Like a judoka, you upset his balance and use his own force against him, flipping him into another set of trash cans. He slams into a pile of rubbish, finding himself face down on the ground this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave this woman alone, or I'm calling the police!\" You shout in her voice, which doesn't come out as harsh as you'd hoped. But it seems to work anyway, as the drunkard looks at you with fright and hobbls away, wincing softly as he escapes. You didn't want a creep like that to get away. He deserves much worse than what he got, but with a body like the one you have now he would have overpowered you eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocking unsteadily in this woman's heels, you stagger over to her overturned purse and put its contents back inside before slinging it over your shoulder. This woman's heart is still beating rapidly, and her adrenaline is on overdrive. It took all of your self-discipline to remember your training and defend yourself against the drunkard. But with him gone now, her hormones let loose like a floodgate. The shock sets in: You slump down against the wall of the alley, bawling your eyes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself whimpering for more than one reason. The loss of your own body -- your girlfriend, your family, your job, your life -- comes welling up along with the hot tears streaming down this woman's face. You take off this woman's glasses and set them aside, rubbing your eyes with a hairless arm. Her vision isn't <i>terrible</i>, but you've never had to wear glasses before and without them everything is blurrier than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, you sniffle and stand back up. Smoothing out your dress, you shiver in the nighttime, coastal breeze. Thankfully, this woman's hair is tied in a ponytail which didn't get in your way while fighting the drunkard. Still, you feel it pulling against the back of your head as you adjust the scrunchie keeping it secured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take stock of your current female body. Besides its smallness, you feel your weight totally shifted around. While her boobs are pert and decently sized (maybe a C-cup), they throw off your center of gravity and strain your back a little. You feel bra straps digging into your shoulders, which you adjust before roving your hands down your new waist and hips. Your fingernails are painted red just like her dress and heels, as red must be her favourite colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs suggested already, the dress is a stretchy, light piece that extends down to the middle thigh. Sardonically, you find yourself wishing it were longer, or wishing this young woman had worn a pair of jeans or something less overtly feminine. Wondering where she came from, you guess she might have just gotten off work. She doesn't look like a streetwalker, and nothing in her purse looks out of the ordinary (based on what you know from your girlfriend, anyway). You want to take off this woman's heels, which are pinching your toes and are altogether shitty to walk around in, but refrain from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning your hands lower, you feel in between your legs and find... nothing there. Just her underwear beneath the dress. If it isn't perfectly clear that you're a woman with all of the parts a woman should have and none that a man should have, it's pretty evident now. Below her dress her thighs are smooth and hairless. Her pale legs lack the strength and muscle definition that yours had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through her purse once more, you find a driver's license with her name and address. Along with her smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Emily Lynn Snyder</b>. That's this young woman's name. That's who you are at the moment. Blue eyes, brown hair. Five feet, two inches tall. One hundred and five pounds. Sex: Female. Twenty four years old... a few years older than you, but still in the flower of her youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discover a set of car keys and realise you have a few options at present. You could drive to this woman's home, get changed into something more comfortable, and use her to somehow get revenge on your bodysnatcher. It would mean effectively stealing her body, but in this case the ends justify the means, don't they? Once you get your own life back, then you can return Emily to normal as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you could try to phase out of this woman's body and return it back to her. Though you have been a ghost for only a few hours, and you don't know how all the rules work, you figure it might be possible to hop from body to body. And especially if you want to pursue the revenge angle, wouldn't it make more sense to steal a powerful, manly body instead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third option would be to simply live this young woman's life from now on. You could become Emily Snyder permanently. She's pretty, even if she's slightly older than you, and presumably has a decent life judging from her possessions. And if you're never getting back your own body and life, becoming her is a better option than remaining a lifeless soul forever, isn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's getting late... what do you decide to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Concentrating, your head gets dizzy and all of a sudden you're staring into the eyes of a pretty young woman. Thank God you don't have to be stuck as whoever you're possessing. You're a translucent ghost once again, levitating in front of her while she stares back with a vacant expression. Though her eyes are open and she is breathing calmly, you can tell there's no consciousness behind it. No soul underneath to give it a personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait a few minutes hoping that she springs back to life. Hoping that you didn't accidentally eject Emily's soul when you possessed her, much like your thief did to you when he stole your original body. But she just sits there against the alley wall. Emotionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on... wake up!\" You grunt, knowing that you can't just leave her body here like this. What if that drunk guy comes back? If he brings friends, or a weapon, she'd stand no chance no matter who was occupying her form. She needs to get home. You feel responsible for at least doing that -- making sure she stays safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you sigh, sidling up next to her body again and feeling yourself get drawn inside like a magnet. Colour returns to the world again. Realising that sensations like sight and smell are muted as a ghost. Compared to being human, being a ghost is numb. Gray. Like living in an ethereal fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot so anymore, as you again feel Emily's heart beating in your chest. Her bosom rising softly as you blink and push her glasses up the bridge of your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding her car in the nearby parking lot is more challenging than you thought. Even after closing time, many of the bar patrons haven't left yet, so there are a lot of cars around. Pressing her alarm button on her keys, you wander around listening to her heels clicking smartly on the pavement. You aren't falling over in them, but you wobble and stagger a few times getting used to her balance. If anyone were to look they'd probably think you were drunk. But it's the city and people are used to keeping to themselves. Ultimately you find her car and climb inside, entering her address using the GPS on her cell phone to find the way to her house. The seat and mirrors are adjusted to her perfectly, even though you have to really extend your legs to tap the accelerator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer single-story house is small and the neighborhood is quiet. You pull into her driveway and unlock the front door. Thankful that she seems to live alone, and not having to deal with a boyfriend or roommate, you take off her heels and kick them aside glad to be rid of them once and for all. The house is tidy but you get the impression it hasn't been lived in for long, like she recently moved here from somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inspect each of the rooms in her small house, paying close attention to the framed photos standing by the furniture. On a coffee table in the living room, a younger Emily is dressed in a graduation cap and gown. She's sandwiched between a group of four other girls that look like her, all posing for the camera. There's a few family portraits, a photo of her cuddling with a black border collie, another photo of her parents, and so on. Next to her television is an opened DVD case of <i>The Notebook</i>. Her refrigerator is modestly stocked, and you grab some leftover food as you realise Emily's been hungry all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinsing off the plate in the sink, you check her laptop and see several tabs still open from a previous Internet browsing session. She has a Facebook profile with... over one thousand friends? A recent post shows her smiling with friends on a recent backpacking trip to the mountains. You click on her profile and read about her curiously, discovering that she works as an administrative assistant (read: secretary) for the Prometheus Corporation. You don't know much about them except for the big logo they have on one of the skyscrapers downtown. She's a vegan, goes to church occasionally, and voted in the last election.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has a decent life by all accounts. But it's not the life for you. She is a <i>woman</i>, after all. A fact you're reminded of when you feel how full your bladder is and realise you need to use her toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the washroom door and stare down at the toilet and then at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be... interesting.\" You hesitate at hearing her voice again. But, throwing caution to the wind, you lift the lid and gently sit your big butt on the seat. Reaching underneath her red dress, you pull down her panties and are shocked to see she's wearing a garter belt! The hooks are connected to a pair of nude hosiery encasing her legs that you hadn't noticed back in the alley. They've gotten tears from the fight, unfortunately, and she's got a scrape on her knees from where the drunkard manhandled her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLosing focus, you sit there with your hands in your lap and let nature take its course. You hear splashing into the bowl, relief washing over you as the pressure in your bladder fades. She must have been holding it in all day at work, you think to yourself. You don't forget afterwards to fold a wad of toilet paper and wipe 'down there,' trying to ignore the utterly alien feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashing her hands then, you finally get a good look at the body you're currently occupying. The alley was too dark and you couldn't see Emily clearly before. Now, her eyes gleam back at you behind her dark-framed glasses. Her nose is small and upturned... slender face with cheekbones giving her a youthful expression... cherry red lipstick still fresh from earlier today... smooth fair skin. You poke your face with a fingernail, watching Emily match your movement in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulders are slender and her figure is petite. But that doesn't detract from her waspish, womanly waist and childbearing hips. The red dress clings tightly to her frame, highlighting the contours of her breasts, hips, and ass. You lift up her dress to get a better view of your new bulbous ass, grabbing a handful of the red fabric as you pull and smooth it upwards:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/nb7dbKI.gifv\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/nb7dbKI.gifv</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/a/1LPHpoU\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/a/1LPHpoU</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit...\" You gasp, unzipping the thing, shucking it off, and posing in front of the mirror in nothing but Emily's bra, panties, and garter belt. You cup her breasts in your smaller hands, tracing a fingertip over her nipples and marveling at how sensitive they feel. You've been intimate with another woman before (your girlfriend, most recently on the second anniversary of living together), but the sight of Emily's vagina and pubic mound makes your head spin. Especially seeing them from this angle, feeling her fleshy lips as your fingers caress them gently. Her vagina doesn't seem as responsive to stimulation as your penis, but then again a woman's biology is altogether different from a man's. What gets her engine revved up is way different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling satisfied that you've encroached upon her 'private' life enough, you fully undress and slip into the first outfit you pull out of Emily's clothes drawer: a pair of spandex boyshorts, cotton pijamas, and a white blouse. Opting to go braless as you couldn't fully get used to the sensation of constriction around your chest area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling into Emily's bed, you feel you've done your duty in keeping her safe for the night. Not wanting to take over her life any longer than necessary, you concentrate on phasing out of her body once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, the doorbell rings, jolting you awake. You pray for whoever it is to go away, but the bell rings again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would visit this woman's house so late at night? You step into Emily's fuzzy pink bedroom slippers and trudge up to the front door. Looking through the peephole, you see a uniformed police officer waiting on the doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaps into your throat. The last thing you wanted was to get Emily in trouble with law enforcement. You remember how strange you looked stumbling around the parking lot looking for her car. Did someone suspect you were under the influence of something? There are laws against driving a vehicle while drunk or high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, you cautiously greet the officer. \"Good evening, sir.\" You squeak in Emily's voice. \"Can I help you with something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello miss,\" He rumbles in a deep voice. His badge shines against the front door lights. \"We received reports of an altercation outside the...\" He looks down at a small notepad in his hand, \"... the Uptown Pub. I understand you were accosted by a vagrant. I was hoping to get more information about the incident and file a police report, so we can track down the perpetrator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding the door open, your eyes go wide. Stammering, you reply, \"Oh, that \u2014 that's okay sir, I-I don't really need \u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the officer, glancing around the street, refocuses on you and pushes through the doorway. \"Please, miss, I insist. What I have to say is very important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man is much stronger than you and he forces the door open easily. You stagger backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closes the door, and his personality completely changes. He titters, \"Wow! I didn't think I could pull this off. I've always liked a man in uniform, I just never thought I would <i>become</i> a man in uniform!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolls up his sleeves and flexes a bicep. He prances over to the washroom, admiring himself in the mirror. You follow behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the officer stick out his tongue in the mirror and prod his cheek with a fingertip, you quietly squeak out, \"Emily Snyder, is that you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guessed it!\" He giggles. Then he embraces you in a tight hug. \"I can't thank you enough for keeping my body safe and sound tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the mirror, you see a small woman practically smothered in the man's beefy arms. His scent floods your nostrils. Gasping for breath, you push him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain,\" Emily leads you back out to her living room, sitting down in a chair and crossing her uniformed leg in a feminine manner. \"At first, I was mad that someone tried to steal my body and life. But then I watched you kick that drunk guy's butt, and I knew I could never do something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" You reply. \"That's what ten years of blackbelt training can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues her story: \"So after the drunk guy ran away, I wanted to make sure he would get arrested. It was hard to fly around as a soul, as I imagine you probably wanted to possess the drunk guy instead of me, right? Anyway, I flew around and possessed the first police officer I could find. It took a while to track down that drunk asshole, but eventually I found him and arrested him for attempted rape. I took him down to the police station and held him until he could be processed. I would have arrived here sooner but apparently the guy I possessed had some other work to do which I filled in for. His shift ended a few minutes ago, and I headed over here as quickly as I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. I'm glad he was brought to justice.\" You nod. \"But I wonder what happened to the police officer's soul? Was he ejected from his body too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowns. \"Gosh, I didn't think about that. I was so angry about that guy that I kind of reacted without thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you, Emily.\" You interrupt gently. \"But if you repossess your body right now, what will we do with this officer's body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could possess his body for now,\" She suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"Thanks, it is a nice body, but I'd rather get my own body and life back. I've had enough distractions for one night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your temples, sweeping Emily's hair behind your neck and shoulders. \"I got possessed by somebody just like you and the officer. I was hanging out with my girlfriend, walking along the beach boardwalk earlier today. Suddenly I felt something pushing against my soul and forcing me out of my own body. Whoever took over in my place pretended to be me. My girlfriend didn't suspect a thing, and I followed them for a while before deciding I needed a body to confront them directly. Maybe I could at least convince my girlfriend about what happened, you know? That's what I was thinking at the time, and then I found you struggling to defend yourself against that drunkard in the alley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily listened soberly. \"I'm sorry to hear that. You already know my name... what's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Steven, although I probably don't <i>look</i> like a Steven now...\" You joke, looking down and cupping your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Steven, I just want to say <i>thank you</i>. Without your help tonight, things could have gone down a lot worse for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stands up and approaches you, leaning in for a kiss. You're too dumbfounded to react, feeling her five o'clock shadow bristle against your face as she plants her lips onto yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlinching, you rub your mouth and adjust your glasses. \"Eww! I'm not into snogging other men!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily blushes. \"It wasn't so bad if you ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. So can you drive that officer back to the station or something, de-possess him, and come back to take over your own body? I really need to get going.\" You fold your arms over your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I want to stay as this guy for now.\" Emily says, getting an embarrassed grin on her face. \"I've never felt so confident in my life! I'm tall, strong, and...\" Her hands trail downwards to her junk, patting the bulge between her legs lightly. \"I'm kind of interested in trying on a penis and balls for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow. It was the way she said it, <i>trying on</i>, as if it was some Halloween costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't take over that guy's life. He's a police officer. It's a dangerous job with lots of responsibility.\" You protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it, Steven.\" Emily explains. \"If we're going to track down your body, shouldn't we try to get as much power and authority on our side as we can? As this officer, I can take the person occupying your body into custody. Then we can keep an eye on him and maybe work out a way to get you back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a decent proposal. You feel bad about Emily taking this officer's body and life, but at least she might put it to good use helping you find your old body. Which brings up another point...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What do you mean, <i>we</i>?\" You ask. \"This isn't your business, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think I'm letting you off that easily, do you?\" Emily smirks coquettishly, which looks weird on the man's face. \"You may have my body, but you're still a guy on the inside. This is absolutely my business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I just decide to possess someone else?\" You retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need my help. We both know it's true.\" Emily pleads. \"Come on, you helped me out of a dangerous situation tonight. Let me help you! Besides, two people make a better team than one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems really cool about letting you impersonate her. Either that, or she wants to keep a male body and not have to look after her lifeless form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Fine.\" You sigh. \"But can we get started tomorrow? I'm really tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Steven!\" Emily giggles. \"But I insist you sleep in my bed tonight. I'll be the <i>gentleman</i> and sleep on the sofa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fetches a blanket out of the closet and throws it over herself on the sofa. Meanwhile, she pesters you about making sure you've brushed her teeth, washed off her makeup, charged her smartphone, and a dozen other things. Finally, she lets you alone to sleep in her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes, you reflect on the day's turn of events, before sleep finally overcomes you.

A violent pressure builds up trying to force one of you out. Within some sort of spiritual recess of Sam's body your souls acknowledge each other for one final moment. The shared feeling of comfort in this embrace resonates, and the pressure suddenly implodes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything you were is forced into your girlfriend's being. You had been Matt but no longer. You are part of Sam now. Rather, as two individual identities no longer exist, you simply are Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come back to awareness upon the sidewalk pavement. The sensations of life return to you, but your head feels extremely hazy. Thoughts, memories, and feelings are jumbled and disorganized inside. A group of strangers has amassed around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" one asks. \"You suddenly started shaking and collapsed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you reply. \"I think I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis situation is very confusing, as you can not remember what had happened. Looking through the crowd you see Matt, your boyfriend, looking down at you with an amused smirk on his face. Suddenly, it hits you. You remember everything. That is not Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" you murmur, pointing at the imposter Matt. You try to rise to your feet but your legs shake in protest.

You don't have enough energy for objections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs imposter Matt carries you away from the crowd he remarks to you, \"so, how about you show me where home is?\" You can imagine that amused smirk still sitting uncharacteristically upon his stolen face. There's nothing you can do right now, so you give him directions as you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your weight settle into his back and shoulders. Confused emotions swirled inside you. You felt scared, angry, sad, and then scared again. Part of you, however, felt oddly comforted. Being carried like this made you feel safe and loved. You liked being this close to Matt. Even though it was a stranger inside his body, even though you had been Matt until recently, you still possessed the original Sam's attraction to Matt. You felt warm inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one.\" you said as you pointed out the house to imposter Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rested your head upon his shoulder as your vision hazed and you embraced sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know what both are thinking and how each is feeling. You relive the first kiss you shared and find yourself overwhelmed by the sensation and synergized feelings. Suddenly you are alone in your spiritual recess. You identify yourself as Sam, but you now can clearly reference all of Matt's memories, thoughts, and feelings. \"Matt?\" you call out. \"Where are you?\" There comes no response. \"That's right,\" you somberly affirm. \"Matt doesn't exist anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to find that you are back in your bedroom. You wonder, was it all just a dream? You can feel the soft  bed sheets against your naked body and Matt's arm comfortably wrapped around you. \"Hey babe,\" he says into your ear as he awakens too.

Just a moment ago you felt so peaceful, but now the anger of past-Matt takes full control. \"Fuck you!\" you scream as you lunge at imposter Matt. You begin to repeatedly hit him, but he is unfazed by each blow. \"Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you...\" you yell as your shouting becomes sobbing and feelings of sorrow replace your rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImposter Matt wraps his arms around you and pulls you into his embrace. You rest your head upon his chest and cry. You can feel his heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up into Matt's eyes. How strange, you think, only yesterday that was your face, but as Sam you also recognize it as the face of your loving boyfriend. You feel confused and vulnerable, and you find yourself yearning for that same feeling of safety as when he carried you home yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt brings a hand to your cheek. It's comforting. He leans in and kisses you, and you kiss him back. You don't resist. You don't want to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull away from his kissing and lie back upon the bed. Matt is now over you. Looking up at him, your mind is blank, but you feel so warm inside. He lowers himself down and kisses your navel and then kisses you again even lower. He continues to move down, and your  anticipation builds until you suddenly feel his tongue caress your insides. You moan as he continues to pleasure you. The warmth in your body is now a raw heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt raises back up and looks to you. You feel so hot and your breathe feels heavy, but you need more. Without saying a word you reposition yourself and spread your legs to receive him. Matt eases into you and begins to thrust. You moan louder now and begin to buck your hips with the motion. Wrapping you legs around his waist and pulling yourself up by his shoulders, you begin to kiss Matt again as you continue to grind your hips upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you've climaxed, you both lay in bed for awhile. Neither of you say anything and just enjoy the afterglow. Eventually you leave to the shower. You follow the original Sam's standard process of showering, cleaning yourself, and remembering to take your birth control pills. All of this feels strangely new and foreign to you yet also completely familiar and natural. You feel your mind fog up again as your memories try to further organize themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror you study Sam's face. \"That's right,\" you reassure yourself. \"I'm Sam.\" Still, you wondered, were things okay like this? Was there even anything you could do about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrap yourself in your bathrobe and return to the bedroom where Matt is still relaxing in bed. First, you figured, you should find out who this new Matt is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Matt...\" you say. \"Who are you really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt smirks as he looks up at you. \"I'm...\"</span></div></div>",

I had the dream job, I had the mansion, I had the fashion model wife. I may not have been a young man anymore, but I wasn't gonna let that slow me down. I kept very fit, exercised every day, and it showed. My life must have looked pretty awesome from the outside because one day, out of the blue, I found some lost soul had just stolen everything from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I was so pathetic. I hung around for awhile trying to figure out how to get my body back, and once I gave up I just wandered aimlessly. With so much time to think things over I eventually realized something: In my old life I had all things desirable but I was never happy. I came to see that this was a gift, a chance to start over, so I started searching for the perfect life to take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I considered a few here and there, but I knew there was no rush. I was patient and eventually I found Matt. 23. Young, but already done with school. Looks are on point, kept very fit. Comes from a bit of money, not too much but enough to have a house in an affluent beach town albeit further from the beach. The real icing on the cake though, I shadowed your date yesterday and the passion I saw... Naturally, I wanted it for myself, so I took it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was out of the bed now and making his way to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand me on some level, don't you?\" said Matt. \"Funny thing about being a lost soul is that even after taking a body you can still see other lost souls. The vision sticks with you, so I got to witness your whole fiasco yesterday. You're still Sam, but the original Matt is all mixed up in there too now, right? Didn't take any more than a few minutes of being bodyless before he decide to try hijacking his girlfriend's. You two are one now, or something like that. It's not like you even need my body anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was right in front of you now. You're thoughts felt clouded again as your emotions conflicted. Maybe he had a point? Was it only natural for him to take over a life? Being a lost soul had felt pretty scary after all. Since the original Matt and original Sam were now your single soul, he seemed correct in that you had no need for Matt's body. You didn't know what to believe. \"I... I... I don't know.\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe,\" said Matt. You looked up into his eyes. \"In my old life I made many mistakes. I didn't know what was important, and I lived like a fool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped closer and brought a hand to your cheek . \"I want to do things right this time. We can live an extraordinary life together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt frozen. Matt leaned it.</span></div></div>",

Tears running down your face as you desperately try to put as much distance between you and Matt's imposter as possible, but unsure of where to go or what you will do next; or what you can do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like your whole world has just been shattered, but your jumbled thoughts and memories come to this conclusion in different ways. On Sam's side, you have just lost your boyfriend to a complete stranger and now feel lost and confused. Meanwhile on Matt's side, you have just lost your body to a body-snatching thief and are now stuck sharing your girlfriend's body with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling out of breath, you finally come to a stop. You turn to face the direction you just came from, still worried that Matt's imposter might be coming after you. After a few minutes of catching your breath, you conclude that you must have gotten away, but decide to keep moving anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn to walk in the opposite direction from what you are facing, you feel yourself bump into someone. You apologise to them, but don't get a good look as your eyes are still filled with tears. As you continue to walk past them, you hear the stranger call to you. \"Wait!\" They said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop and turn to face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You take a second glance at the driver's license before stuffing it back into this woman's handbag. Aliyah Williams, huh? Rotten thing to steal her life, but if it means you can keep tabs on your old body (and the soul that hijacked it), maybe you can stop him from doing anything bad to your girlfriend. Just thinking of the trouble he could get your body into causes you to shiver. Or... maybe it's this woman's attire. Her tan tube top doesn't cover much above the waist:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/8bhrnaC.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/8bhrnaC.png</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rock unsteadily on Aliyah's heels, silently cursing yourself for not picking a bigger, manlier body to confront the body snatcher. You've got a snowball's chance in Hell of overpowering your old body like this... speaking of which, where did they go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit! Shit shit shit shit shit... you glance around the busy street, seeing dozens of other people but not them. To make matters worse, you have to move around people to see past them, as this woman's small 5'4'' frame doesn't help much. You trip and stumble a few times on the uneven sidewalks, built at a time when these streets were dominated by horse and carriage rather than motor vehicles. Several minutes of anguish pass as your hopes of finding them fade... but just as you are about to give up, you spot them entering a cafe down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course! Your old body was starving, having spent most of the day having fun at the beach. You follow behind and enter the cafe after them, climbing up onto a barstool at the counter so you can see them sitting at a table nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA server greets you politely and hands you a menu. You flick through it disinterestedly, flipping it between your new french-tipped fingernails, and order a water and salad. It isn't very appetizing, but it looks like something this woman might normally eat given her figure. Actually, given the lustful sidelong glances of the other male patrons at the counter, it seems as though <i>you're</i> the most appetizing thing in the cafe at the moment. Getting 'the male gaze' for the first time turns out to be a lot more discomforting than you expected, especially since you didn't want anyone getting between you and the hijacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes this woman have any food allergies? You aren't sure but decide to pick out the walnuts from the salad anyway. Meanwhile, the hijacker is laughing away with your girlfriend, placing his hand over hers and leaning in for a kiss. She doesn't seem disturbed at all, instead receiving the kiss with as much love and passion as if she thought she is kissing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's not you sitting there anymore. You doubt your girlfriend would find kissing you very appealing at the moment, as a Black woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo but how is that possible? The hijacker doesn't know anything about you or her, yet he's aping your behaviour and mannerisms perfectly! You can't catch every word of their conversation amid the clinking of glasses and plates, ambient chatter of patrons, and light jazz music piping in from the loudspeakers suspended from the ceiling. But you can definitely hear the hijacker talking about things only you would know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow is he doing that?? It is frustrating, you grit your teeth and resist the urge to confront them right then and there. That wouldn't be wise; the hijacker could simply call you a crazy person and your girlfriend might believe it. Unless you manage to tell her something a random stranger shouldn't know, something only her boyfriend would know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ponder what you might say to persuade her without coming across as completely bonkers, you notice them paying for their bill and standing up to leave. You desperately reach into Aliyah's purse and snatch out some cash, slapping it down on the table and hurrying out the door behind them. Making sure not to follow too closely behind, you tail them for a few blocks wondering where they're going. You're still wobbling on Aliyah's high heels, thankful for the height boost and lucky you haven't fallen and broken your neck yet. You can't get over the womanly pitching of your hips and wiggling of your bum with every step either. It's as if this body is designed to be as feminine as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hijacker looks behind him and makes brief eye contact with you. He turns around again and resumes holding your girlfriend tight at the waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaps into your throat. Oh no! Can he be on to you?? You dart over to a fruit stand on the street, pretending to browse while they increase their distance slightly. When they've gotten far enough away, you continue pursuing them.  Another errant thought crosses your mind momentarily: What happened to the real Aliyah Williams? When you possessed her body, did her soul get expelled just like yours did?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun is beginning to set by this point, and the streets are slowly calming down as people leave the beach, get on the metro and depart to their homes in the suburbs. Shadows descend from the skyscrapers overhead, hanging down like curtains against the orange sky. The hijacker and your girlfriend are sitting on a bench in a park. He's running a hand through her hair as she places her head on his shoulder. You're hiding behind a nearby statue, finally ready for the confrontation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, feeling your chest rise and fall, before mincing out to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Stop right there, you body snatcher!\" You cry aloud. A few people turn their heads for a moment to watch the unfolding scene, but they lose interest and go about their evening. You point an accusatory finger at your old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? I don't think we've met before, miss.\" He replies coolly, placing extra emphasis on the <i>miss </i>part. They remain sitting on the bench at you stop in front of them. Your girlfriend eyes you up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin telling her about the hijacking, as well as a memory you two shared from a recent holiday in Paris. The trip cost you what little savings you had, but the memories were enough to last a lifetime, a lifetime you were ready to spend with her as your wife. You hadn't yet proposed to her, instead waiting for that right moment.  It was a delay which you sincerely regret now, looking in as a third person on the relationship. Pangs of jealousy bubbled up within you this afternoon as you witnessed the hijacker so close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you explained everything to your girlfriend, the hijacker simply stood by doing nothing. You were surprised he didn't try to stop you or disprove your claims as the ravings of some insane, hysterical woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the reason why he keeps that smug grin on his face becomes all too apparent, unfortunately. You're about to discover why!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But i couldnt give any less off a damn.\" She cackled at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, but how?\" You demanded. Your former girlfriend smiled back at your old body before strutting towards you swaying her hips. \"Its simple really, im not her. I never was, i found myself this ( she begins to rub her hands down to her hips ) new skin and decided to make it mine\" she said seductivly towards your new body. She closed in sliding her hands up and down your new found feminie form. \"Mind you i wouldnt have minded taking ahold of that new piece of meat your occupying right now\" she whisperd into your ear squezing your new found breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation shocked and excited you the mixture of feelings created a rush never previously experenced before. \"I found you, or rather I found you and your little hottie getting down and dirty one night and i decided i want in. I jumped at the chance to be young again but when i opened my eyes i found your lips touching mine and your dick around my figures.\" She explained. \"At first all i wanted was your body, a fresh new start and hey if i ended up with a brand new hottie all to my own i could have had it all, but then she had climb on top right that second and i found myself locked within her body.\" She continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these memories flooded back to you, you remeberd back to that day it seemed so long ago almost three months now. Three months a stranger had been inside your girlfriend and you never even noticed, all those times you kissed the time you went to paris all the times you slept together it wanst her. As your girlfriends body began to walk seductivly back to your old body she continued to explain the situation. \" i too lost my body, some old bimbo babe i picked up took it from me. My fame, my money even my family. I wonderd for days exploring places i could never have. Eventually i stumbled upon you two and all i wanted was to be a young stud once more.\" She clambered over your old body steeping behind it sliding her hands from your previous chest sliding them downwards ever slower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i found myself in her body and i just couldnt help myself. She stayed you know, watching over you trying to reclaim her body. I think she left in the end who knows where she wonders now. Time passed and i ran into samantha another wondering spirit, she too yurned to be younger and well sex with you was just getting so vanillia. So i gave samantha your body and now she knows how to put this to good use\" she proclaimed looking you dead in the eyes as she clutched your previous manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now you know, it was fun miss?\" She asked you smirking once more. Your old body kissed your girlfriends body grabbing her ass as he did making sure you had a good view.<br>\r\nYour girlfirend pulled away from your former body and walked foward once more. \"But ill tell you something else, how about we make a deal?\" She smirked as she outreached her hand for a shake.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a moment you are speechless, practically trembling with rage. Standing before you is your girlfriend: the love of your life, with her dazzling smile, sparking blue eyes, and golden blonde hair. But at the same time you have to remind yourself she isn't really your girlfriend. Someone else is occupying her form and had done it so well these past three months that you never realised it happened. The way her smile turns into a sneer, the way her eyes betray a twinkling maliciousness, and now the way she gropes your former body in public like a common whore... it is almost too much to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ball your fists, pressing your new nails into your palms almost till they bleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't antagonise her, Jared, it isn't fair.\" Your former body says, grabbing her by the shoulder and pulling her back. So the wretch whose soul is now piloting your girlfriend's body is named Jared? And the soul who hijacked your own form is named Samantha?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look how angry she is,\" Observes Jared aloud, running her hand once again down Samantha's masculine chest. \"What shall we do with her? She knows too much about us... she could cause us trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Please...\" Your anger subsides into sorrow. Mostly at the apparent loss of your girlfriend's soul, the soul you originally fell in love with, having gone wherever three months ago. Seeing that you may have to deal with these two hijackers for the time being, you add, \"Please don't leave me like this. You don't understand how much I care for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave you? Like that? You chose that body, love, rather than remain a wandering soul.\" Snaps Samantha in an effeminate tone, his limp wrist looking out of place on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I know how much you've cared for her. Mind you... not just the sex part but I've got access to all of her knowledge and memories too.\" Explains Jared. Then, pointing to Samantha, \"So does he. We know everything about you two. Accessing the body's mind: It's one of the powers a soul can develop with training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that explains how Samantha was able to impersonate you so easily in the cafe earlier, and how Jared managed to fool you so convincingly that he was your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the only power we have,\" Adds Samantha, \"We can also jump from body to body. That one's significantly more difficult... I wouldn't expect a fledgling like you to get it so quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fledgling?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our term for new souls like you. Kind of like a bird who hasn't got his wings yet. You'll likely be stuck as that Black woman for a while, so I suggest you start by accessing her mind to learn about her family, her job, daily routine, that sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another power that's not too hard to develop is the ability to communicate with other bodiless souls floating around.\" Jared mentions. \"That's how I knew your girlfriend stuck around for a while after I possessed her form. You can see and talk to them if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there any souls around us at the moment?\" You ask, darting your eyes around the park. You see a few children playing and laughing (one holding a balloon playing keep away), a homeless man dozing beneath a pile of blankets underneath a tree, a woman wearing earphones whilst walking her dog... but no souls floating around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Jared confirms. \"But if you learn to see them, we'll take you to meet some others whom we know. Souls have social circles too; it's a way to dull the boredom in between possessions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bugger of it is, we can't tell whose body is being possessed by whom,\" Samantha adds, \"So like we wouldn't have known you became that woman until you approached us in the park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we don't know that for sure,\" Jared interrupts, glaring at her boyfriend. \"It's rumoured to be another power you can develop, but we have yet to meet anyone who knows how to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you telling me all of this?\" You sigh. \"You expect me to... join your merry band of body snatchers or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then get stuffed cunt!\" Scoffs Samantha indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared elbows him in the side sharply, causing him to grimace. \"What he means is, we want to make it up to you for stealing you and your chick's lives. We know it's rough going out there as a new soul without any support. Believe me, we've each been there before. We'll be willing to train you so you can get those rudimentary powers like the ones we just described. Y'know, accessing the mind, communicating with other souls, that sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in exchange?\" You mutter, intuiting that there was some kind of deal afoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In exchange, we want you to clam up.\" Replies Samantha, still wincing from the jab to his side. \"Keep your pretty mouth shut and don't make any trouble for either of us. From now on, you call us by our body's names in public and our real names in private. And don't make any attempts to get your own body back. Even the most powerful souls can't overtake their original body if it's being possessed by another soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's the deal: They take you under their wing in return for getting chummy with them. It's not the worst deal imaginable, but they clearly don't want you blabbing about their imposture to the world. It also lets you keep an eye on your old body. Plus, they're even willing to help you develop your newfound powers. If that means being able to communicate with other souls, and being introduced to their larger (if not otherworldly) network of souls like them, then maybe one of them might know what happened to your girlfriend. You don't like the idea of pretending that Samantha and Jared are you and your girlfriend, respectively, or that you're now Aliyah Williams, but you've got no other appealing choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, a deal's a deal.\" Samantha reaches out his hand again and you shake it, feeling your own dainty hand getting crushed by his larger grip. He smirks, \"Right then... shall we head over to <i>our place</i>?\" Presumably knowing where it is from once again tapping into your body's brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk alongside them, trying not to stare as they continue subtly fondling each other and snogging in public. They don't stop when you get on the metro, which had become rather crowded as people continue to leave downtown. They're seated in front of you while you hold onto a bar for support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train lurches around a corner and another man presses himself against you, squishing your breasts for a moment. Reeling from the odd sensation, you quietly apologise and turn around. Another man tears his eyes off your bum and glances away sheepishly. Again you can't help but feel exposed in this young vixen's body, like a piece of meat for all to feast their eyes upon. You can't blame them.... since you would have done the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've lived in the city long enough to know generally where everything is, which is why you know (from her driver's license) that Aliyah lives only a few blocks away from your own flat. It would take no more than 30 minutes to walk there, and less by metro. But since you know nothing about her life and suspect she doesn't have a husband or children (she's not wearing a wedding ring), you prefer not crossing that bridge quite yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, you three get off the train and walk another few minutes till you arrive at your own building. Home sweet home... although it's not yours anymore. Five floors up, third from the left, Samantha pulls the keys out of his jeans pocket and lets you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Watching them get hot and heavy in your and your girlfriend's bodies, respectively, makes you gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to join us for a threesome, luv?\" Asks Samantha, coming up for a breath of air after locking lips with Jared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can reply, Jared snaps, \"What's all this? Am I not enough for you, baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I know that's not true,\" Samantha retorts, tapping into your memories of the times you had sex with your girlfriend. \"But look at her, isn't she <b>sexy</b>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never been called sexy... or a woman. But you can't argue that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose we can make room on the bed for one more,\" Grumbles Jared, annoyed at the idea of sharing your body with another woman. She (Jared) throws her arms around Samantha's broad shoulders, then leaps up and locks her legs around him (Samantha) as he catches her. She shucks her dress up past the thighs as he clutches her ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not joining your fucked up threesome!\" You place your hands on your hips, watching them warily as they make their way to the bedroom. \"Hey... aren't you going to at least use protection??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, can't hear you!\" Samantha cries out from the other room. They slam the door shut, followed by a locking sound, and you kick off your heels and strut over to the TV angrily. Sitting your big butt on the sofa, you turn on the TV to try to drown out the sound of them going at it. To your chagrin, you can still hear the bedsprings rocking, the occasional moans, and the slapping of flesh onto flesh. Ew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you fix yourself a drink in the kitchen which is followed by another and then another. You've no idea what this body's tolerance is to alcohol but you feel pretty tipsy by about the third stiff drink. At least it makes the time pass, and you have a few more drinks. Just enough so that you can only focus on the TV running in the background. Before long you can't keep your eyes open and pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to a bright flash. The whole room is blinding.

You're in the bedroom for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a tattoo under your left breast. Super cute by the way.\" The voice shows you her smartphone along with the photo snapped of you lying in bed just now:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://imgur.com/zskdtYI\" target=\"_blank\">https://imgur.com/zskdtYI</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is the young Black woman in the picture? Why does your body feel so top heavy? And why do you have... breasts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, that's right. You remember yesterday's events: going to the beach with your girlfriend. Getting possessed by a spirit who ejected you from your body. Wandering the streets as a lost soul. Jumping into this woman's body. Relocating your old body. Learning about the spirits who possessed both you and your girlfriend. Following them back to your flat. Their promise to let you into their clique of otherworldly contacts, so you might be able to find your girlfriend's soul and get out of your current body. Having... how many drinks last night? While they had sex with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now your head is pounding and you feel like you're underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn off the lights, please,\" You groan, turning to your side and feeling your boobs get squished underneath an arm. Thankfully, Jared dims the lights, sits alongside you on the bed, and thumbs through your girlfriend's smartphone. He hands you a glass of water which you drink greedily. That alcohol last night leaving you really thirsty and dehydrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I in the bedroom? What happened last night? And why am I wearing lingerie??\" The questions come forth like a floodgate. The last thing you remembered was passing out on the sofa last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In reverse order,\" Explains Jared, \"One: that woman was already wearing that lace buttfloss; you don't think your girlfriend would ever own something like that, do you? The shirt is something we dressed you in so you wouldn't get too cold last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two: we came out of the bedroom and saw you positively knackered. We tried to rouse you, and we had to guide you to the toilet so you could do your thing. Well, her thing. You get the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three: After pissing, you could hardly pull up her trousers... much less stand up... so we placed you down here in bed. Between you and me, a woman of your size might be better off wearing skirts or leggings, something to hide that enormous ass of yours. Can't have the gents staring too much below the neckline, can we? That answer all your questions, poppet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand,\" You reply, your tongue tasting like fire. \"I didn't drink <i>that </i>much.\" You've been drunk before of course, and know when to call it quits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, there's the problem.\" Jared smiles, wagging her finger coyly. \"You're not <i>you</i> anymore! You have whatever tolerance to alcohol this foxy lady has... which isn't much, it seems. What a pity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that.\" You brush her comments away with a wave of your hand. \"Please tell me Samantha used a condom last night... or you're on the pill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared giggles. \"What kind of a girl do you think I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One who is going to need an exorcist soon enough...\" You groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An exorcist, huh? That's my favourite film by the way. Kind of inspirational, don't you think?\" Jared stands up. \"Let the power of Christ compel you! Haha. I used to believe in that sort of thing. The afterlife has plenty of angels and daemons, of course, but exorcism is a lot like voodoo. Parlor tricks to show your friends. It doesn't really work as far as I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared slaps your leg. \"Well, don't lie about all day long. It's almost noon! Samantha's got breakfast cooking in the kitchen... come on out and join us. Then we'll begin your training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Samantha and Jared begin your soul training by asking you what you want to learn first. Each ability takes some time to develop and practise, which is why they recommend focusing on one ability before starting on the next. So which ability will you learn first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look around franticly for your former body but find yourself lost within the multiple crowds boarding thier various trains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to choke up on something in an almost vomit-esc fashion.

Mindy couldn't resist, even if she wanted too her new male body was ready for round two, no matter what it might be.

Mindy bit down gently and began to toy with Aliyah, this forced Aliyah to let out a loud moan in Mindy's voice further exciting Mindy who was now all to happy to take her old body elsewhere and fuck herself raw.

Mindy grabbed ahold of her old bodys hand, gripping it down tightly onto her cock. \"C'mon, don't you wanna know just how good this feels?\" Mindy asked Aliyah. Aliyah soon began to catch on to Mindy's plan. Mindy was wanting to enjoy sex in her own body, but since Aliyahs spirit was currently occupying it she wasn't able to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliyah decided to come up with a plan of her own. \"Tell ya what. Ill trade bodys with you, but youve got to pleassure me anyway i please, deal?\" Aliyah let out in mindys voice, the slyness of her actions trickled through her wording. In a haze of pleassure Mindy agreed, by this point all she wanted was to conquer the stud she had brought back home. Mindy closed her new manly bodys eyes and ejected her spirit from it, the mans body went limp only his cock was left as stiff as it ever was. \"Ok your turn\" Mindy reminded Aliyah who had now realeased the mans cock. \"Aight, now its my turn to get \"my\" dick sucked for a change\" Aliyah said out loud in Mindys voice. Aliyah too closed her eyes and focused on ejecting herself out from within Mindys body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both mostly naked bodys now vacant, each one slumped up against the other.

Not only had Mindy re-gained control over her original body, but she had also inherited all off the hormones and feelings that Aliyah had just been experincing in her body. \"Aight, my turn then\" Aliyah proclaimed rubbing her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliyah shot her soul directly into the mans vacant body. Aliyah began to open her eyes now feeling the increased wieght of the mans body, her new muscles tensing up giving her a new found sensation of strength. Before long Aliyah to began to experince the aftermath of what her and Mindy had just been up too. Before Aliyah could even say a word Mindy had turned herself around on the sofa and had began to wrap her lips around Aliyahs new cock. The sensation sent Aliyah into a fit of estacy, she had never felt anything like this before, no wonder every man she ever slept with demanded such a thing. Aliyah continued to experince wave after wave off pleasure. \"Yeah thats right bitch, suck my dick like you want it\" Aliyah found herself ordering out loud, her new manly voice catching her off gaurd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy pulled herself away from Aliyahs new cock giving it a few pumps with her hand before once again going back down and smothering it with her mouth. Aliyah could feel Mindys tounge wrapping around her new member, but she coukd also feel the occasional scrape off the tooth, clearly it was Mindys first time. Aliyah began to find herself holding back Mindys hair and helping to move her head up and down on her new shaft. All Aliyah could hear was the gulping and gagging sounds that escaped Mindys mouth. Aliyah wasn't the only one enjoying herself though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy had never done this before, well not as herseof anyway. She had possessed other bodys and had experinced sex in the past but never in her own body. When she woke up today she decided to experince shat it was like to be on the recieving side off things as a man, even if that ment testing it out on her empty body. Mindy enjoyed the thrill of it all. She began pumping away harder and harder, Mindys black lipstick leaving marks all over Aliyahs new dick as she did so. She wanted to be dominated, to be owned. She placed Aliyahs free hand onto her own ass, aliyah gripped into the dark leggings covering her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy kept going and going with each passing moment Aliyah let out a deep moan louder and louder and louder until she finally climaxed. Aliyah had never felt such a rush as her body ejected the Hot cum deep into Mindys still moving mouth. Aliyah leaned back and attempted to regain her strength, Mindy finally pulled her face away from Aliyahs now limp cock. Mindy licked around her mouth tasteing every last drop, she even went as far as to open her mouth wide to show Aliyah that she had swalloed it all down. </span></div></div>",

She never could have imagined such an experince in her life, Aliyah could kind off start to see why someone like Mindy grew curious herself. Mindy was now sat beside Aliyah and her new masculine body on the sofa. Mindy was now trying to cover herself back up from her little rustle with the new manly Aliyah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally re-aranging her clothes back to how they where prior to there little ordeal, Mindy turned her attention back to Aliyah who still by this point hadn't even botherd to cover herself back up and was instead still sitting there enjoying the aftermath. \"C'mon \"stud\". If what you told me was true l we should probably try to get you back to your original body\" Mindy said as she slapped Aliyahs now limp dick, which in turn caused some slight pain to Aliyahs new body. Aliyah recoiled at the pain shooting through her new manhood waking her up as it did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, oh yeah. (Panting) my uhhh... my body is outside\" Aliyah said still trying to recover. \"Outside!? What do you mean its outside? Come on youve got to get dressed, we can fix this right now\" Mindy exclaimed. Aliyah didn't focus too much on Mindys words, she was too busy enjoying her new self. \"Put that dick of yours away, were restoring your body imediantly\" Mindy protested. \"So uh... what will happen to this one then?\" Aliyah asked as she reluctintly began to redo her jeans covering her new body up. Mindy grew puzzled by Aliyahs question. \"It wasn't exactly vacant when i found it, he was asleep after all. Most likely well either have to give it to the spirit in your body or return it back to its owner\" Mindy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliyah began to get a little dissapointed by her answer. Whilst Aliyah did want her body back she was also enjoying her new one a little to much. \"Well sort it out when we get to it. For now lets go get my body\" Aliyah stated in a deep tone. The two of them finished getting dressed and exited Mindys apartment taking the elevator downstairs and exiting the building. Aliyah began to re-trace her steps as she didn't have to go far to find Mindys body. A short minute walk later and the two arrived back at the alleway that Aliyah flew away from as a spirit.</span></div></div>",

Mindy now blushing slightly looking towards Aliyahs current body before looking back at your who now resided within Aliyahs original body. \"I... i guess you could say that, yes\" Mindy answerd.

Mindy sat up from her chair, now understanding the situation. \" right then, luckilly for you two i happen to be an expert in this kind of spirit swapping thing\" she declared out loud. \"Spirit swapping thing? What the hell you talking about?\" Aliyah demanded. \"Well it simple, the proffesional term is astral projection. Basically its when you master your spirit and leave and enter any other body freely. From what i can tell you there in Aliyahs body have plenty of spirit power, but no way to control it.\" Mindy began to explain as she made her way to her book shelf, examining it closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spirit?\" You asked. \"Yeah, like your soul you know? A couple of years back a old friend and I used to try this kinda magic supernatuaral stuff out together. But one thing led to another and nowadays i hate that bitch, weve been rivals ever since. Fortunatly for you two though you came to the supior one\" Mindy boasted. \"So are you swapping us back or not?\" Aliyah demanded once more. Mindy pulled a book out from its shelf giving it a good blow, sweeping the dust from its cover. \"Here, this should do the trick, though it wont exactly help us out fully\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" You snapped at her, now beginning to sound like Aliyab yourself. \"Sadly im missing some pages, the bitch from earlier has them still. I can swap your spirits back, but you wont go back to your original body.\" Mindy explained. \"Its fine, you said i have alot of power right? Well find a way.\" You said now standing up to, jiggleing Aliyahs boobs. \"Aight, lets do this\" Aliyah said as she too stood up, now towering above you.\" Ok then, incartus, soulois, shift\" Mindy yelled aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to feel yourself being pulled from Aliyahs body, your vision begining to blur.

She eveantully opend it before you could ask, Mindy clenched ahold of Aliyah and dragged her once more into the room. They hadn't noticed you yet so you continued to follow. As you entered the apartment you could here the two rumiging around in the open bedroom. You entered the room finding the two bickering once more. \"What do you mean, ive gotta give up my body!?\" Aliyah yelled at Mindy. \"Look its not yours ok, its his. I was only borrowing it\" Mindy answered. \"Well then give him your body when he wakes up!\" Aliyah snapped back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats... whats going on\" you asked as you creeped in. Upon entering the room you noticed a floating soul hovering above the bed, it was just floating there, dormant and asleep. Mindy took in a deep breath \"this body belongs to a guy named mark, he works night shifts so he sleeps during the day. So sometimes when hes asleep, i just kinda borrow his body for a bit ya know? For stuff.\" Mindy tryed to explain before being cut off by Aliyah. \"No, you borrow it to fuck yourself\" Aliyah snapped. The though wierded you out a little considering that you was now inside Mindys body, the knowledge of knowing what it was most likely up to before you took over it got to you a little. \"In any case, he has work soon. Hes going to need his body back soon\" Mindy stated. \"Well i aint being a spirit no more, Im enjoying his body anyways\" Aliyah said. \"Fine then, how about you? You got any ideas what we shoud do? His soul will wake up soon so i suggest you hurry\" Mindy asked.</span></div></div>",

Sam held his phone towards you pointing out at the screen. \"look here, she's gone and taken a photo in your body, best part is they've left the gps tracking on it. If they keep on moving around the town we can find them in no time\" Sam yelled out cheerfully.

Sam looked downwards, now becoming disheartened by your question. \"well, they haven't upload in like an hour or so. at the moment they could be anywhere\" he mumbled out. you noticed how much this was getting to him.

Your chest expanded outwards growing a modest pair of b-cup breasts and your legs and hips grew more smooth and feminine. you felt yourself shrink just a bit coming to shoulder height with Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam turned his attention back towards you studying you up and down. \"ok who exactly are you meant to be, cause honestly i don't recognize those tit's in that shirt\" Sam said in a sarcastic tone. the words alone offending you somewhat. \"well firstly, i enjoy this shirt, it used to be comfy on my old body. secondly these are my tit's... or at least they would be if i was a girl. now i know what boob envy is.\" you snapped out at him, his sarcasm bittering your mood. Sam was shocked, rather than become someone else you had decided to shift into a female version of yourself. \"well you could have at least tried a little more effort to look nice\" Sam blurted out. \"well im sorry, i thought this would cheer you up. im not exactly a fashion expert now, am i?\" you asked him sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, your the one with the powers. you figure something out\" the passive aggressive words Sam let out from his mouth irritating you further. \"fine\" you hissed back, now infuriatingly trying to use your powers in order to gain some mental attributes as well as appearance attributes. you focused long and hard but noticed nothing different. \"well?\" Sam asked breaking your concentration. \"oh thanks a lot. there I am trying to think of a way to do such a thing and here you are interrupting me, god its like you want me to keep wearing such horrible trash rather than a two piece that would highlight my peachy glossed skin. hmm maybe something in blue would work nicely with...\" you stopped yourself wrapping your hands around your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was that!? you began to realize that it had worked. you had managed to not only change the appearance of your spirit, but had also somehow gained knowledge of something that mere moments ago you never even cared for. \"are... are you ok?\" Sam asked reaching out to you. \"IM FINE!\" you yelled back still confused by all this. you could now gain personality traits and skills associated with someone else spirit, something that when that spirit would be in it's body would come naturally to them. you had to test this out for yourself. you decided to embrace your new sense in fashion and change your attire to what you had been ranting on about prior. your shirt and jeans soon turned into a bright blue bikini highlighted by yellow ascents. you hair had now been neatly done up, still covering either shoulder on each side. and you now had a pair of beautifully shaped heart earrings in a matching blue, going well with your bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"woah\" Sam let out astonished by the sight of all this. \"well then, here you go.\" you said to him sarcastically once more. both of you now felt sorry for the little fight you had moments ago...</span></div></div>",

Sam once again brushed his crotch up against your read, this time it was bigger than before. You soon began to notice Sam's hand move its way upwards towards your bikini clad breasts, his hand resting upon them. once more you felt Sams crotch brushing against your ass, only this time he wasn't moving it with his hips. Sam's member began to poke your behind, the only thing stopping it was his pants and your bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im... im sorry. it has a mind of its own and...\" Sam began to try and explain himself as he grew ever increasingly embarrassed by the situation. \"no, its ok. If anything im like it. It's like a compliment, in it's own kinda messed up way, ya know?\" you replied to him, trying to comfort him and his new feelings. you turned your head away from Sam looking back away from him \"you know, i remembered what you did last night. what happened between my clones and you. even though i was asleep i was still there.\" you began to explain to Sam. \"wait so that was you?\" he questioned. \"well kinda, why do you think copy's of my girlfriend started making out with each other? i was dreaming but i still kinda had control.\" you explained, the words making the both of you blush. \"so uh... what now then?\" Sam asked hesitantly. you lye down as Sam lay down behind you still a hold of your physical spirit form. \"you could keep going if you like? i don't mind\" you said trying to re-assure him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam remained silent, making you begin to feel awkward about such a suggestion. You layed your head back down onto the pillow and stared back at the wall across the room. Sams hand squeezed your breasts tightly from behind, the sensation catching you off guard by a little. Sam's dick continued to push harder against your ass. If it wasn't for the clothing you where both wearing who knows what he would have done. Sam moved his free hand down your exposed tiny midriff and dug his hands deep down into your bikini bottom. once again Sam had caught you off guard as he began to toy with your new vagina. you remembered how the clones had felt, but this was nothing comparable to that. Sam's hand that had been gripping into your breasts worked their way under your bikini top and placed itself onto your boobs directly, the bikini top being stretched slightly as Sam worked his hand underneath it. you layed there blushing as you began to enjoy these new feelings. you decided to help Sam along and began to move you hips back and forth, nudging your ass up against his now stiffened dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to have your new feminine bikini clad form ravished by Sam who worked his hands all around you, you reached around with one hand and grabbed ahold of his cock and helped press it harder into your ass. you lay there moving slightly just enjoying all these new feelings, you started to hum to yourself. nothing fancy or recognizable. just an innocent tune like that of a nursery lullaby as you continued to enjoy these new pleasures.</span></div></div>",

By the time you was finished with their appearance they no longer resembled their prior form, instead now resembling that of a slightly overweight nerd who usually sat by himself in class. \"now, time to have a little fun\" you said aloud as you swiveled your attention towards the clone at the far end of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out you moved you hand around altering its performance, its shape now changing into a more feminine and much taller form, resembling that of your old french tutor from high school. but rather than focus on her normal appearance you decide to have a little fun and instead turn the clone into a duplicate of Miss Fillmore from the trip to France. the clone now looked indistinguishably from Miss Fillmore, except rather than being adorned in formal attire, she was stripped down to just that of a tube top bikini that stretched itself as it tried to conceal the d-cup breasts of miss Fillmore, the bikini itself leaving her caramelized skin exposed. as she leaned over and balanced her wrist against her hip the light glistened off her Egyptian styled golden necklace, the thick plated necklace rustling as it did so. her hair was pulled back into a pony tail showing off some off her jewelry that her former husband had given her as a gift, the thick round ovals of amber within her earnings always catching your attention. there she stood, a duplicate of your old fantasy Miss Fillmore except now she was always dressed in her irresistible bikini, her luxurious jewelry on display. she looked around the room inspecting it, pouting her lips outwards slightly. Almost instantly Sam rushed towards her un-able to pull his hands away from her form. \"wow, i now shes not real but boy she sure does feel real\" Sam said now amazed by the copy of Miss Fillmore stood before him. \"that's right honey, i even sound and act like her too\" the clone responded to Sam's statement. Sam looked back up at the clone before looking back at you, who was now laughing away at the look on Sam's face as you had caught him off guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"don't worry, that was me. well technically it was. They seem to be a copy of their respective body's spirits, and with my powers focused right i can make the physical. though i can only handle it for a short while. it seems so long as they look like their respective spirit they can mimic their spirits personality too.\" you explained to him. Sam looked at you before once again turning his attention back to Miss Fillmore's body and began to rub his hands up and down her, soft caramelized skin. Sam was even going as far as to run his hands around her breasts, something that you yourself was hoping of doing at some point. but you couldn't let yourself get distracted, you too needed a disguise but who? you needed someone who could get close to your body without either off those thieves suspecting you. Then it hit you, Jenny. she always had a crush on you, even going as far as to be stalker-esc. the thought of shifting into her made you shudder slightly, but you bumping into her was a common occurrence so maybe they wouldn't suspect anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou felt yourself loosen up as your form became somewhat smaller and more feminine. from your chest grew a modest pair of c-cup breasts covered by your now bright pink attire. you felt the breeze across your softer legs as you found yourself now wearing a bright pink dress that reached down to your thighs. you could feel your long silky hair reach down to your lower back as your shift completed. \"wow, it ...\" you said before cutting yourself off, surprised by your higher pitched voice. you glanced over at Sams mirror admiring your form. spot on, there's no way anyone could tell you and jenny apart now. you turned around and yelled out to Sam \"hey Sam, what do you think?\" you asked to no response. Sam was head first in Miss Fillmore's breasts, rumigeing around finding himself lost as the clone simply stood there and allowed him to do so. hmmmmm, I could use the clone but I have something else in mind. with that you closed your eyes and focused deeply on Jenny's personality. Once you re-opened your eyes you had all her thoughts, memory's and traits. you now rushed over to Sam ecstatic and took hold of his hands bringing his attention towards you. \"LOOK, LOOK, LOOK!\" you yelled in Jenny's voice. \"See, Im Jenny now. mind, body and spirit. Isn't that cool Sammy?\" you continued to shriek at him in excitement. Sam just stood there in awe as you clasped his hands, he was amazed by all of this. \"wow Sammy, your hands sure are strong, don't suppose you would mind showing me how strong you really are?\" you asked teasing him. You would never call him Sammy outside of this form, but right now with Jenny's personality you just couldn't help yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grabbed a hold of your ass, gripping deeply into it. he then ran his other hand around your form causing you to shudder slightly. \"wow, this is... i mean...\" Sam began to stammer out before you cut him off by placing your finger over his lips. you then began to run your hand downwards towards Sams trousers grabbing a hold of his embarrassing erection. The thought made you giggle slightly, the thought of just how easily you could manipulate your friend just by simply altering your spirit form into anyone.</span></div></div>",

Sam stood there gobsmacked his childhood crush now stand infront of him only better than he could have ever believed.\"wow\" Sam said flustered in awe of your new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou loved this new sensation you was feeling. control. control not only over your own form but other those around you. you knew what Sam wanted, what his intentions where. so you played his little game only now it was by your rules. you walked seductively towards Sam, placing one long leg in front of the other, a walk that would put any model to shame. you lowered your face to meet his letting out a sly smile as you did so, locking your eyes with his. you felt your hair brush your shoulders slightly only being interrupted by the blackest of black earrings that contrasted against the pure whit of your hair. your earrings now working like a metronome hypnotising Sam into your own plaything. As you reached Sam you towered over him now taller \"well, aren't you going to help yourself?\" you asked in a seductive tone. Sam didn't hesitate, like a good slave he clenched his hands around your new tight ass before squeezing your tits, that easily out shined Aliyahs. he worked his hands towards your hair gripping it, taking in just how soft and silky it was before caressing your new earrings feeling the coldness of there deep black stones. he leaned in planting a kiss upon your lips as you to responded in kind, forcing your tongue deep within his throat before pulling away and licking your purple lips.</span></div></div>",

This feels so strange.\" You say, hearing Emma's soft voice coming out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that being the opposite sex for once feels strange, but keep your hands to yourself while you're piloting my body.\" You hear Emma's voice warn you. It seems that even though you are in control, Emma is still inside her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I've just never felt like this before. So, where do I go from here?\" You ask Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just start walking and I'll give you directions as we go.\" She tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start walking, and every now and then Emma tells you to turn in a certain direction. You resist the urge to touch Emma's body as you feel the light bouncing of her breasts as you walk. You also notice that while you are seeing the world through Emma's eyes, you can see a bunch of bodiless souls just wandering around.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You feel something press into your chest.  Not your new chest, YOUR chest.  You try to keep walking but feel your progress slow to a crawl, and eventually your view starts moving backwards.  Looking down you see your ghostly body sticking halfway out of Emma's corporeal form, your forearms trailing into hers and your lower half still inhabiting her own but your entire torso and head now protruding from her, leaning back heavily while her own upper half leaned forward.  You also see the source of the pressure in your chest, a ghostly and distinctly feminine hand pushing you out  of Emma's body.  After a few more seconds you feel yourself falling backwards, losing all sensation in Emma's body as your spirit is launched out of it and sent sprawling onto the... well, you don't actually land on the ground.  You kind of just hover an inch or so over it in a lying down position.  As you fall back Emma stumbles forward a few steps, clutching her forehead and wincing for a few seconds before righting herself and wiping her brow.  \"Sorry about that, I'm gonna need full control of myself for a little while.  I'll be working on things that'll help you get by as a ghost, and maybe a thing or two to help you reclaim your body.\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could've just told me to get out!  Didn't need to throw me out like that.\"  You grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma rolled her eyes.  \"Don't be such a baby, I just wanted to test how strong your spirit was.  See what I was working with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow as you rise back onto your feet.  \"And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma shrugged.  \"Well, the good news is that you're stronger than most souls I've encountered.  Most spirits only last about five seconds when I try to push them out, whereas you were able to hold on for about fifteen.  The bad news is that you're still nowhere near as strong as the body snatcher.  There's no way you'll be able to steal yourself back head on, and even with my help it'll still take at least two weeks of training and some powerful incantations to get yourself back, probably even longer.  We only have one shot at this, you see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  You ask, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the body snatcher isn't exactly what I'd call a 'good sport'.  If you try to steal your body and fail to take it back, or can't fully eject him well... he may make you kill yourself. \"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops.  \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  And he also tends to get 'reckless' with bodies he gets bored with.  Typically it takes him about a month to get tired of whatever body he's in so you probably have nothing to worry about right now, but we have a time frame.  We have to wait at least two weeks before you're ready, and the more you practice and I perfect my spells the better chance we have of taking your body back.  But the longer we wait the more danger your body is in.  So... yeah.  Let's get a move on.\"  She says, motioning you towards her front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou float towards her house, your mind racing with worry.  Why did this have to happen to you?  You wait behind Emma as she unlocks the door to her house, realizing only after the fact that you probably could've just passed through it.  Still, at least it made you look polite.  Disembodied spirit or not it's still rude to enter someone's home before the host.  Following Emma inside you are greeted by what looks like a haunted mansion.  Dilapidated floorboards that creaked and groaned as Emma stepped across them, austere architecture with doorways that were ever so slightly crooked and walls that were painted ever so slightly different shades of grey, and dust covered antiques that looked more at home in a scrap yard then inside someone's home.  You then realized that Emma's home didn't just look haunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's your new friend, Em?\"  A new voice inquired, a very peppy and girlish voice.  You watch as a translucent figure sinks through the ceiling, slowly decending towards the floor until she's hovering just an inch or so over it.  It takes you very little time to realize that this figure is female, her flowing and multi-layered dress and long locks of brown hair framing a gorgeous figure with full curves and a tender face with big blue eyes.  It also takes you very little time to realize that while she's a spirit like you she's no lost soul.  No, what you were looking at was a genuine ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood soaked bandages wrapped around her neck starting at her shoulders and rising all the way up to her jawline, the fabric now a dull brown in the center and white only along the frayed edges.  Her head sat at a 45 degree angle on her shoulders leaning to her right, as though her neck had been broken and she could no longer hold it upright.  She'd clearly suffered some kind of horrible death, though whether it was at the hands of the body snatcher or some unrelated circumstance was unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Victoria, this is... uh... huh.  You know I don't think you ever gave me your name.\"  Emma says, scratching her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damon.\"  You say, extending your hand towards Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Damon!\"  She says cheerfully, taking your hand and shaking it violently.  To your surprise her had was rather warm and solid, much like a living woman's hand felt.  You suppose it made sense, spirits could interact with one another as though they were physical since they existed on the same plane.  \"It's quite rare for Emma to bring company over, she's usually such a shut in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma frowns.  \"Well it's not my fault that most people freak out when they realize that my roommate is a ghost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Landlord, thank you very much.\"  Victoria corrects smugly.  \"Let's not forget who this house actually belongs to and who is just living here.  No pun intended.\"  She turns her attention to you.  \"So, what brings you to my humble abode?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh... my body got stolen.  And Emma says she could help me get it back.\"  You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria frowns.  \"I'm sorry to hear that.  Emma tells me that there's been a lot of body snatching going on around theses parts.  If it makes you feel any better Em's the best spiritualist I've ever met in my entire afterlife!  If anyone can get you your body back, she can!  Sure she's never successfully beaten the body snatcher before, but it's only a matter of time before she gets her first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks...\"  You say, wishing she hadn't added that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\"  Emma says, trying to sound more confident than she likely felt.  \"You're a strong spirit, and while I've yet to beat the body snatcher with my incantations I've gotten closer and closer every time.  I swear, I will do everything I can to get you your body back.  And if I can't?  Well, I'll do everything I can to help you adjust to your new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, I've got a lot of work to do.  Victoria, why don't you entertain our guest while I whip something up ?\"  Emma suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be my pleasure!  It's been ever so long since you've brought a man home , especially a cute one like this!\"  She said, causing you to blush.  \"Come, right this way!\"  She says, taking your hand and pulling you behind her.  She pulls your incorporeal mass clean through a wall and into...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As your head glides through a series of rusted copper pipes and chipping plaster you find yourself in a large and antique parlor, the sort of thing that had long since been replaced by the modern living room.  Two of the four walls were covered from floor to ceiling in book cases, hundreds upon hundreds of leather bound books lined up in neat rows and sorted in alphabetical order.  The wall opposite you was dominated by three paintings, on the left hung a family portrait featuring a very much alive Victoria and four people you didn't recognize, in the center an outdated map of the world prominently featuring Tsarist Russia, and on the right a beautiful if somewhat faded painting of a red rose bouquet held between two feminine hands.  On the right facing wall a large set of bay windows with two chairs facing them looked out onto the garden, though much like the homeowner all of the greenery had long since died.  In the center of the room an mahogany and velvet pool table was set up, in the back left corner a chess set with ebony and ivory pieces sat in the middle of a small table, and in the back right corner an antique gramophone faced towards the rest of the room with a small stack of 10 inch records next to it.  Considering the age of the map on the wall, that must've been an absolutely cutting edge home entertainment system back when Victoria was alive.  \"Nice place you've got here.\"  You say, letting go of Victoria's hand and floating around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, dear!  I do what I'm able to keep the house looking like a proper home.\"  She said, floating over to the gramophone.  \"As I'd said not many people come through here other than Emma, but even so I'd hate to have a guest arrive and have the house looking an unkempt ramshackle.\"  She reached down to the stack of records and to your surprise she was able to pick them up with ease, her ghostly hands sifting through the paper cases until she found one that struck her fancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you do that?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\"  She asks, setting down the pile while holding up her chosen track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That.\"  You say, pointing to the record gripped in her translucent fingers.  \"How are you able to hold those?  I've passed through everything I've come into contact with so far, how are you able to interact with the physical world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that!  Well, anything your body interacts with on the material plane gets imparted with trace amounts of your spiritual essence.  The more time you spend interacting with a particular object, the more your essence gets rubbed off on it.  Over time these objects effectively become extensions of your spirit and as such you are able to interact with them on a spiritual level even after your spirit and body part ways.\"  She explained.  \"That being said you may still pass through these items at will, if such is your intent.\"  She said, demonstrating this by holding the record up with her right hand as though the limb was still solid while passing her left hand clean through the center of it like the ghost she was.  Setting the record on base Victoria positioned the needle and switched the device on, a raspy and distorted but still distinct tune echoing throughout the parlor.  \"So, are there any further questions you have for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment, several questions popping into your head immediately and several more piling on as you considered those questions.  After a few moment you decide on one to start with.  \"Victoria, I hope it's not impolite but... I couldn't help but notice that you and I are a bit... different.  I'm a spirit who was kicked out of my still living body while you look like someone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murdered me?\"  Victoria finished without a hint of shame.  \"Yes, your presumption is correct.  I'm not a lost soul like you are, but a full fledged ghost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.  I didn't even believe in ghosts yesterday.  Then again, I suppose I didn't believe in body snatching either.\"  You say, causing Victoria to giggle.  \"So if it's not too much of a personal question, how did you become a ghost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria shrugs.  \"Frankly it's not a very interesting tale.  My younger sister was always jealous of me.  She thought mother and father didn't love her as much as I because I was the more beautiful one, she thought my social standing was unearned and based solely on my appearance, and when she heard that it was I who would inherit this home after our parents passing... well, she lost her head.\"  Victoria scratched at her bandaged with the left hand while curling a lock of hair with her right.  Before you could say anything Victoria suddenly hooked her fingers beneath the fabric and and pulled it away from her neck, tugging her hair in the opposite direction.  You watched in shock as Victoria's head came clean off her body, a ragged neck stump dripping ghostly blood onto the wooden floor.  Her headless body swung its arm forward and released its grip on her hair, sending Victoria's head flying towards you.  You feel it smack directly into your chest and you scramble to catch it, managing to get a hold of her just inches away from the ground.  \"Well, I suppose it would be more appropriate to say that I lost my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\"  You exclaim, eyes darting between Victoria's still standing body and her still blinking head.  You suppose that you shouldn't be too surprised that she was able to survive self decapitation, she was a ghost after all.  Standing up you hold Victoria's head at eye level, her soft cheeks feeling warm in your hands despite having no tangible blood passing through them.  \"So then what?  You came back to haunt her from beyond the grave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, initially yes.\"  She said, slightly embarrassed.  \"I admit that in the immediate aftermath of my beheading I was rather cross with my sister.  However the more I thought about it the less practical revenge seemed.  I was dead, driving her to madness wasn't going to change that.  I could possess people, sure,but unlike you lost spirits who can roam wherever you so choose we ghosts are confined to the area in which our spiritual energy was strongest in life.  I cannot leave the grounds of my estate, so taking command of someone's body would be an exercise in futility as it would simply whither and die in here.  So, rather than acting spitefully or with bitterness I decided simply to go on living here as best as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a... positive way of looking at it.\"  You say.  \"So, if you forgave your sister why is this house so... abandoned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most folks don't take kindly to things they don't understand.\"  She said, frowning.  \"They didn't have the sight like Emma does, they could see the things I moved but they could not see me.  I tried to write them notes explaining that I was still here and that I wasn't mad about what happened and that I held no ill will they were still terrified.  They moved out en masse and sold the house for a tiny sliver of its true value.  When the new owners found out about me they too sold it off for peanuts.  The house was kicked about from owner to terrified owner, none of whom would simply listen when I said I wasn't going to hurt them and that I just wanted someone to talk to.  The property was on the verge of being condemned and demolished, until the keys landed in Emma's hands two years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone who could see you.\"  You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes lit up and a smile stretched from one cheek to the other.  \"Exactly!  Someone who could see me and hear me and wasn't frightened of me in the least.  It was a dream come true really!  It's true that the girl has is austere in demeanor and doesn't care for the tidiness and presentation of my estate as I wish she did I do very much appreciate her company.\"  She said, adding \"Though, it is also nice to have some new company.  I do hope that you return after you've dealt with the body snatcher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I get my body back I'll definitely stop by again, you're the coolest ghost I've ever met.\"  You joke, eliciting a small giggle from her disembodied head while her body waved its hand dismissively.  \"I'll even bring my girlfriend over, once I explain the situation I bet the two of you would get along great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh.  You... you have a companion?\" She said, surprised and almost a little disappointed.  \"Well I... I'd be delighted to meet her!\"  She said, her lips smiling but her eyes screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can say anything the door to the parlor opens and Emma steps in, still tinkering with a small item clutched in her hands.  \"Alright Damon, this little doohickey should help you get by in the short run while I work on the runes to get your body back.  Just-\"  She stopped, looking up at you holding Victoria's severed head up to your face while her body stood uncomfortably on the other side of the room.  \"I'm sorry, am I interrupting something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just talking!\"  You say, walking over to Victoria's body and handing her blushing head back.  As she sets it on her shoulders and begins tying her head back on you ask Emma \"So, what've you got for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma shows you...</span></div></div>",

After she finally found a safe place in an alleyway way far away from the two, she finally took a moment to catch her breath and relax. It had been a very long time since Natasha had a body to call her own, the day her original body was stolen was even longer. She could remember that day very well, she was performing as a pole dancer for a group of rude men. They called her names such as slut and tramp, she tried to ignore it all but the men got rougher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey actually began to grope her on the pole and ask her for nasty favors, it was then that she finally had enough. She got right off the pole after she crushed their balls with nothing but her foot and marched right into the backstage dressing room. Her boss came to visit her, asking why she attacked his visitors and she replied by saying that she quits. Unfortunately, her boss wasn't going to allow her to leave his establishment just like that. Well, at least her body. Her boss was a Lost Soul who managed to work his way back to the top by finding himself a body. Being a Lost Soul, he had a few friends who were in desperate need for a body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Natasha was about to leave, she felt an odd force ram itself into the back of her head. It forced her soul right out of her body and that was the day she became a Lost Soul herself. Of course she was unable to return to her body but she made many countless attempts anyway. Years past and she tried to live as a Lost Soul, without a body to feel, touch, taste, and much more. Never again was she capable of experiencing the feeling of being truly alive and to make matters worse. Her soul was unable to overpower anyone else. There was no hope for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she found this new vacant body to call her own. A very fine body too, not as great as her original but it was still pretty fine. She took out Emma's phone and looked at her own reflection in it to get a good look at her new face. Afterwards she tried to decide, what she might want to do with her new life.</span></div></div>",

After, you never get the chance to lose your virginity twice. There was also the fact that if she waited, she'll simply be dodging the inevitable pain the first intercourse would bring. Might as well get it over with sooner than later so she could move on to far more pleasurable sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroping her new breasts, Natasha realized that she couldn't just go in her new body's usual outfit. It simply didn't show off the Goth girl's body to its fullest potential. Natasha needed a new look and she needed one fast. Her sexual desires were growing ever stronger as she observed her new magnificent body. With that in mind, Natasha rummaged through Emma's closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 2 hours, Natasha had finished piecing together a makeshift outfit and redone her hair. Her tits were wrapped in bandages and taped down to make them appear far fuller and perky. For bottoms, she wore a black miniskirt that totally contrasted with her white thong but gave anyone lucky enough to catch a glimpse of her panty shot, a very pleasing sight to behold. Her hair was cut slightly shorter, brushed completely straight, and dyed black with red white highlights. The dye in Natasha's hair was mostly used to pay homage to the Goth girl she stole this body from but she had to admit, it suited the body very nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow dressed to impress and to snatch a man to have sex, Natasha made her way to her home's front door. Only to come face to face with an older woman... Whom bared a striking resemblance to Natasha's new body. Luckily for Natasha, she saw this women before in Emma's wallet. Putting two and two together, Natasha was able to form a very educated guess as to who exactly this person is. \"W-Why... H-Hello Mom.\", Natasha nervously said as she attempted to cover up her taped breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's Mother gave Natasha one stern lock before saying, </span></div></div>",

You possessed her body and taken fertility pills, then deliberately knock her up?\" She laugh. \"Whoa, I never even thought of that. Giving the host's body an extreme pregnancy and throw it away like a used condom.\" Natasha gave Melissa a devious grin and said. \"That sound like a fun way for this slutty-virgin to lose her virginity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plays the role as Emma. \"So mother, who the lucky guy that carelessly knocked you up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa smile brightly. \"Dear, do you want the same baby's daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha nods her head and pop the entire pills into her mouth to consume. \"Yep, this is going to be the best sex ever.\" She lower her eyes to her stomach and deviously grin. \"Say bye-bye to your flat stomach, Emma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa eyes went wide. \"Goodness dear, I have only taken eight pills, but you consume the entire bottle. Are you trying to win a pregnancy contest?\" She winkss and continue. \"With that many pills, your poor body will have at lest two dozen babies, but since your body is young and healthy, it could be more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha realized her mistake and laugh. \"Opps...oh, well.

You wouldn't care once you have his cock penetrating your virgin pussy.\" She turns her attention to Michael and said. \"Alright, here the deal. No foreplay, just pump your cock and fill her up with your cum. Understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael laugh and shoved Melissa onto his bed. \"If that what you want, I can't complain.\" He places his cock near her entrance and slam in without remorse. \"Ugh, god.

It hurts, but it's starting to feel so fucking good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa whisper in Michael's ears. \"I have only taken eight fertility pills, but you know what my daughter did?\" She giggle. \"She has taken the entire bottle.

She might have more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael speed up his penetration and blurt out. \"Holy shit, that's fucking hot.\" From hearing the information, his lower testicle twitches. Like a jet propulsion, he blasted his seed deep into Emma's womb. \"Ah, shit. I'm cumming, you needy little slut.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha place a pillow underneath her hips and tightly close her vagina with her fingers. \"Well, I'm going to be a single teen-mom.\" She winks to Melissa.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa laugh and said. \"See, you had fun.

Of course, there is no limitation on how many babies the host's body will conceive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a mischievous twinkle in Melissa's eyes. \"No limitation? Now you're thinking like a ghost.\" She laugh. \"Alright, I accept the challenge, but all the babie's daddy needs to be like Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha considers the possibilities of her host's body and it's starting to make wet. \"Alright, the challenge all set, but remember. Cram as many babies you can within a month and use whatever method to win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the entire day indulging themselves with reckless sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Emma explain to you. \"This is seriously bad and we don't know what type of souls inhabited my body.\" She can sense your cluelessness and took a deep breath. \"Look, some died without losing their virginity and others just enjoy sex.\" She shook your shoulders. \"We need to find my body fast. If the wrong soul taken over my body, they might be overwhelm and misuse my body for pleasure.\" She shout. \"Oh my god, they can even get my body knock up, or worse!\"</span></div></div>",

If you and I were to share a body, I would say that the person who isn't in charge would be pulled out of the body.

But I'm not an expert on the subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, might work as some sort of trap.\" You think out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably, but I think they would easily get pass them. It's just to keep the fools out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen souls wandering around your house before then?\" You ask her as she sits down on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I've noticed that lately more lost souls are around the area then before. During the winter I would always see more beggar and whore souls, you know because of the cold weather,  but it's summer now and it hasn't slowed down yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird, do you think it means something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma shrugs her shoulders. \"I don't know, it might be because of a warm summer that more people would die of a sunstroke or something like that or it might be something else. But that's not our concern. We have to find a way to get you inside that body of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some book about the occult, maybe there is something inside it.\" Emma points to a book case. She walks over to it and opens it. Your mouth goes wide open when you see how many books there are inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we suppose to search through them all?\" You ask her a bit shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you mean with \"we\" me, yes.

He tries to escape the pentagram but he can't get out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curse you kid, you think I did this for fun? I only take over people to survive. Nobody would notice a thing if it wasn't for you. I'll be real surprised if you can survive being a ghost without paying the price. No one can.\" As Emma chants the last word, the pentagram takes effect. A bright light shines as it shocks Ron spirit. He slowly disappears until nothing can be seen of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma stands there for a second as she suddenly collapses. \"Emma you okay?\" You ask her as you lean over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, but the spell took some of my life-force in return. I'm just a bit weak, but I'll be fine soon.\" She sits down on her bed. She then notices her mother lying on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Speak to me.\" Emma asks as she kneels next to her. Emma pulls her on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of it....</span></div></div>",

Even if you inherited the driving skills of Emma's mom, you don't want to cause an accident. Emma only tells you which way to go. It's about ten minutes driving. When you arrive at the house, you can't shake off this weird feeling. It's like your ghost senses are tingling to warn you about danger. You stop in front of the house and after shutting down the car you step outside looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can feel it, can't you?\" Emma said. You nod slowly. \"Something's up.

Still you\u2019re traveling at a pretty quick pace, and just as you reach Emma\u2019s body you lose all acceleration and speed and fall to the ground. Your head hurts pretty badly, and it feels like you just ran into a brick wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d You exclaim as you attempt to reach for your pounding head. Only you suddenly realize you can\u2019t move your arm. What\u2019s going on? You try to stand back up on your two feet, but you can\u2019t do that either. You\u2019re stuck on the ground just looking up at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on!?!\u201d You ask as panic begins to set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you must be pretty weak. Are you okay?\u201d The familiar voice of Emma asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t move any of my limbs. What\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Emma\u2019s head comes into view as she stands over you. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, you really are\u2026\u201d She paused for a second. \u201cOkay, so here\u2019s what happened then. When you tried to enter my body you were immediately pushed out as the gap between our powers is vastly different, and well, you\u2019ve shed your spirit form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What do you mean I shed my spirit form?\u201d At your question Emma looked around for a moment seemingly searching for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Hold on just a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t leave me here.\u201d You shouted to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later Emma returned holding up a piece of broken glass that was likely from a mirror. \u201cSee? You shed your spirit form. You\u2019re simply a naked soul now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed upon your reflection in the broken mirror to see a small orb of blue light flickering weakly. \u201cTh...that\u2019s me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. It seems that when you collided with me you sustained enough damage that you lost your shape. Still, to think that this happened even after I relaxed my spiritual defenses is crazy. You must be exceptionally weak. The only way to regain your spiritual form is to possess another body, and even then it will take a while. You can fly, can\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma\u2019s words filled you with dread. First you lost your identity, and now you even lost your very shape. You slowly lifted off of the ground and rotated towards Emma, completely at a loss on what to do. \u201cWe can just try again right? Make sure you relax your defenses completely this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo can do. You might actually be erased from existence if you try again with my body. Maybe you should try an easier target. Hmm...\u201d Emma looked around for a moment before her eyes widened. \u201cOh I know! Come with me.\u201d Without any warning Emma grabbed you with both of her hands and started to sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Where are you taking me?\u201d You shouted, only Emma ignored you completely. Minutes passed as you finally arrived at an alleyway. Emma then let go of you and pointed towards a sleeping cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook!\u201d She whispered. \u201cTry and enter that sleeping cat. Animals are known to be more attuned to the spirit world, and in addition to being easier for spiritual entities such as yourself to possess, the fact that it\u2019s asleep will make it even easier. You should have no trouble now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, let\u2019s see if this works!\u201d And with that you dashed towards the black cat as you could feel yourself begin to seep into it\u2019s flesh, albeit very slowly. \u201cI\u2026I think it\u2019s working.\u201d You said as you pushed yourself in deeper. A few moments later and you had entered the cat entirely.</span></div></div>",

Slumped against a brick wall in the alleyway is the body of a young woman, eyes closed, raven-coloured hair tussled and messy. Her dress is torn at the waist. Her pert breasts rise and fall gently with each breath, though you can tell her breathing is very shallow. Her skin looks unnaturally pale, to which you attribute her body's ebbing vitality. Furthermore, you notice the track marks on her forearm and wrists, the pronounced cheekbones, the disheveled appearance and worn out makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman, whoever she is, must be a prostitute, one who seems abused in more ways than one (you can only imagine the drugs coursing through her bloodstream right now).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this woman, who you've just met, suggests that you possess this body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spin around and glare at the woman suspiciously, who floats there calmly without a care in the world. Obviously, she isn't possessing this body, so why should you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want this body... I want my old body back! Someone stole it from me! Can you help me get back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ethereal woman shakes her head and replies, \"I'm sorry, Lost One, but that's quite impossible. Once one of our own possesses a fledgling and their soul is ejected from their body, they become one of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... fledgling?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very much like a newborn bird, having fallen out of its nest. You are struggling in the leaves on the ground, coming to terms with your new abilities, not fully appreciating the destiny awaiting you.\" The woman explains in her strange tone. \"Although we all begin that way: mere fledglings abandoned from the nest of the living, but we all learn how to fly eventually. Some of us choose to occupy another nest... and others like myself choose to wander the skies forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch other people walking about the sidewalks, entering and leaving stores, talking and chatting without any of them noticing you or the enigmatic female apparition levitating next to you. Going about their lives, some of them even pass through you! But you feel nothing. You notice you're no longer starving, no longer feel the cool sea breeze or the warmth of the mid-day sun. Like your faded, semi-transparent form, everything feels muted. You begin to calm down, even though you're still pretty distraught about having your life stolen by what sounds like another of these so-called \"Lost Ones\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us take a stroll along the beach, shall we?\" Suggests the woman, and you two hover across the boardwalk and back to the golden sanded beach, where you and your girlfriend were less than half an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have always liked the beach. The rhythmic cresting of the waves, the occasional ship on the horizon, the carefree attitude of beach goers.\" She narrates, more to herself it seems than to you. You follow alongside her as you stroll down the beach, not saying much for a while as you eventually find yourself alone with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she had forgotten you were there, she turns to face you. \"My name?\" She repeats pleasantly. \"I used to have a human name, but I haven't gone by that for decades. I suppose you can call me Sapphire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire. The name makes as much sense as any, you surmise. Between her bluish spiritual aura and her jewel-like azure eyes piercing through you, or her elegant demeanor as if she hadn't a care in the world, she seemed like a woman who carried herself with poise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you I guess... my name is --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not important anymore...\" Sapphire interrupts you gently, stopping for a moment. \"It's better to forget the person you used to be. Release yourself from your old life in both body and mind, and you will know peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be fine for you, but I came to the beach with my girlfriend and now someone else is in my body! What if he... does something <i>bad </i>to her? Something bad to me?\" You sputter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be harmed now?\" She replies undisturbed. \"Here you are with me... as a Lost One, nothing can harm you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether she understands your concern or not, she hides it well behind her neutral visage. Or perhaps this woman has been a wandering soul for a long time... she did say her body was stolen decades ago, right? So you ask, \"Why didn't you take that body from earlier? Why give it to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already said, some of us choose to take a new human form for ourselves. I prefer to remain unbounded, free to roam wherever I please. Of course, you do not have to occupy the same body, once possessed, forever. I imagine the Lost One who stole your body saw something about your life it liked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then... he could de-possess my body and leave it like... that woman's body from earlier?\" You ask uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire pauses for a moment. \"Yes, I suppose it is possible.\" Causing a chill to run down your incorporeal spine. She adds, \"Without a soul, the human body is frail, like a seashell. It can expire within 48 hours if left empty. In addition, if a human body expires whilst a Lost One is occupying its form, then both body and soul perish forever. As a free roaming spirit, however, nothing can cause you to expire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't get to enjoy being alive... being human.\" You retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For every benefit, there is a cost.\" She answers simply. \"For every blessing... a curse. How you choose to view it is your affair. But this is how we Lost Ones get by over time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over time...\" You muse aloud. \"So how long have you been like this? As a 'Lost One'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember the day as clearly as if it were yesterday,\" Sapphire begins. \"It was the 18th of April, 1920. I was in the flower of womanhood at the time, having borne my third child to a man employed in the merchant marine of a country that no longer exists. On his many voyages, he would return with the most exotic gifts and stories that made my heart ache for the unknown. The romantic appeal of journeying to a new life, a new world, unburdened by caring for the children and the farmstead and a dozen other tedious and frustrating problems that humans no longer deal with regularly. The chance to begin anew spoke out to me in my dreams... but they would remain dreams for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the Great War came, and a lot of young men lost their lives in the tragic struggle. My husband was one of them, along with two of my children when the flu came and went. The Four Horsemen made their respite at my door and would not leave until they were full and satisfied in my misery. I found no reason to live, with my third child having died shortly thereafter in a carriage accident. Released from any life purpose, I decided to sell my belongings and purchase passage to this country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While out on the sea, that 18th of April, I remember standing out on deck overlooking the shoreline. The ship was about to make port. And as clearly as I see you right now, I saw a spirit appear before me. Where she came from I'll never know. She possessed my body and expelled me from it, in much the same way as happened to you I imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first, I was furious and confused. I tried to overshadow her, but it was fruitless. For several months I haunted my old body, never tiring, reminding its new occupant of whose life it had stolen. None of this was interesting, and her willpower was too strong. She outlasted my patience, and then one day she was murdered. A robber broke into her house, there was a confrontation. That left me alone, until I found others like myself. Other Lost Ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire recounted her story as dispassionately as if she were retelling someone else's life. That caused you to ask another question. \"You seem to remember a lot about your old life. Yet... you told me to forget about who we used to be. You said it's easier that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe that... no good can come of dwelling upon one's old life.\" She nodded. \"I keep it as a reminder of the fleetingness of human life. The robbery occurred by chance; he could have selected any house within the dozen or so around where she lived. Death comes upon us at any time... but as Lost Ones we can escape his grasp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're afraid?\" You conclude. \"Afraid of dying? Having seen it over and over again, you don't want it to happen to you... so you won't even take the chance to be human again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is my preference,\" Sapphire replied, more icily than before. \"Life is nasty, brutish, and short. Death always follows wherever it goes. But to escape this cycle, to exist eternally as a soul, has a lot to recommend it. Not everyone thinks as I do, but I am not alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about her perspective, about being a soul <i>existing</i> but never really <i>living</i>. Never really dying. You could go on like this, but there's so much more to life isn't there? Maybe Sapphire is right, maybe you can't return to your old body. But you could at least assume another human form and live a decent life. Maybe you could even persuade Sapphire to take a risk, to try becoming human again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are others like us,\" She announces to you. \"I can take you to see them, but the journey is quite long. Are you coming with me? Or shall we meet again, some time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you respond?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When this happens, your soul is ejected from your body.<br>\r\nIt is almost impossible to get your body back once your soul has been ejected. It is only possible to get it back through special means. <br>\r\nIn the mean time, you will either have to roam around as a lost soul or hijack someone else's body. When hijacking someone else's body, their soul will also be ejected, unless you choose for them not to, or they have a strong enough soul to resist ejection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soul that stole your body can freely jump between bodies and can return to bodies that it has possessed before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA body that is not inhabited by a soul becomes lifeless, but is not dead. However, If it goes uninhabited for 48 hours, it will die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bodiless soul is not a dead soul. A soul can only die when the body it is inhabiting dies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease use good spelling and grammar.
