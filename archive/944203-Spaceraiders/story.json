Mankind finally could unite and act as one voice in the galaxy. The future science got improved in many ways. The probably most important invention was the Omijumpdrive, which allowed a ship to skip 100 of lightyears in a few minutes. But also on the weapon sector made great strides. So every earthship is equiped with deadly plasmaparticlelaunchers and destructive zerropoint rockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now it seems there is comeing some kind of new conflict with \"The Directive\".The Directive is a group of six alien species (the Favooda, the Tre'Joo'Van, the Oos, the Xayotites, the Mandatoress and the Liiress, the leader species) who never really have spoken their happyness about the power gaining of Earth. Earth Intelligence has collected different signs, that The Directive has started to produce a great armada of battleships, which only could forfil the reason of attacking the mankind. Spacenaut Headquater set DefCon to level 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo make up your decision on which playfield you want to act:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) ESS Ionstorm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClasification heavy cruiser<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptained by John Evers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrew: 2300<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mission is the investigation of the border between the Human and the Directive territories. Everything seems to be calm, but something tells you that a storm is about to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) ESS Sherlock Holmes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClasification scout vessle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptained by Henry Towns<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrew: 65<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the report of EI (Earth Inteligence) that The Directive is building an assault fleet, the Spacenaut Headquater needs more information to be able to make up a defence plan. Your ship has to get deep into Directive territory and spy the situation. It will be very important, that you are not detected and get as much information about the enemy as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) ESS Nova<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClasification light cruiser<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptained by Lukas Hawking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrew: 240<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are on a deep space mission, exploring the galaxy. Actually you mustn't care alot about the conflict that far away from Earth, or should you? Your crew detected some strange space anomaly which no one has ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) ESS Newton<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClasification medium cruiser<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptained by Angela Moon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrew: 680<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are simply one of the lucky ones beond the Spacenaut captains because your duty is to patrol around Earth, what meens, that you can go home every weekend. But you don't want to take your work too easy. After all your sensor officer had detected some strange neutrino signatures...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) ESS Holly Crow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClasification escort vessle (prototype)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptained by Lana Caine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrew: 120<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are young, you are unexperienced. This is your fist command. You have gotten a new ship, a new crew. You are actually on a training mission to test the defence and offence skills of the new shiptype. You have also some new weapons on board which are that secret, that even you don't know anything about them. You are escorted by the ESS Thunderbolt. An old ship with an old, but experienced captain: Thomas Evens. You are in the out of nowhere, practiseing tactical manoeuvres. But maybe this area of the galaxy is not that forgotten.</span></div></div>",

Till now there were no signs of<br>\r\n   Directive activities. This whole mission<br>\r\n   seems to me like a bloody waste of time. It<br>\r\n   wouldn't match to the Directive actions to<br>\r\n   take the direct way. If they attack, they<br>\r\n   surely won't take this route. But job is job<br>\r\n   and so I have finally time to end my work on<br>\r\n   the hyperspace paralaxies therory for the 9th<br>\r\n   and 10th dimension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Evers, a 35 year old experienced officer of the Spacenauts entered the bridge with a quite boring look in his face. Three weeks! That were 21 days and all what they had found was a tiny pice of a comet. This truely was a waste of recources. No ships in sensor distance, neither enemy nor friendly. No planets, no systems. Not even the smallest quantum singularity. This part of the galaxy was really empty. No use to observe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvers really was a bit angry. The Ionstorm was a ship of the Predatorclass, a heavy destroyer. Maybe the best equiped ship of the whole human fleet. Such a ship shouldn't be missioned for some irrelevant border controlings. And his crew surely was the same mind. He could see it in their faces. They all seemed to be loosing their nerves. It wouldn't take long till real problems would apear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA he sat down on his chair, the holography infront of him seemed to show still the same picture as it had as he last left the bridge three hours ago, olthough the ship muast have moved over a distance of about 700 million kilometers. It really was frustrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir\", Lt. Free reported suddenly.<br>\r\n\"Go ahead Lieutenant!\" Evers didn't even try to hide his frustration as he talked to his officer.<br>\r\n\"Sir, I think I have there thomething on the longrange sensor array.\"<br>\r\n\"Exciting\", Evers said with a quite boring sound in his voice.<br>\r\n\"So what's it? Another three inch comet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommander Landan, the first officer next to him couldn't resist a laughter. Evers ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Sir\", Free answered.<br>\r\n\"It's a kind of... radiation.\"<br>\r\n\"What kind of radiation?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\"<br>\r\n\"Then get sure!\"<br>\r\n\"I think it's a tachyon emission.\"<br>\r\n\"Tachyon? A local tachyon spot?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Sir.\"<br>\r\n\"How is that possible? Tachyons travel with superlightspeed. They don't stay on one place.\"<br>\r\n\"Theese do.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe there is something that is responcible for this anomaly.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Where is this tachyon emission Lieutenant?\"<br>\r\n\"Direction 043.006, distance 190 million kilometers. And Sir, it's on Directive territory.\"<br>\r\n\"So is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvers had to think. This truely was something strange. After all it could be some new weapon of the Directive. But for nearer investigation they would have to pass the border. And this would be in a conflict to the contracts. A conflict which in the current situation could easily break off the war.<br>\r\nSo what should he do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   \"We don't want to start a war out here all alone. We stay on our side of the border,\" Evers declared. Despite his even voice, Evers was shaken. He didn't like old things behaving in new ways. Especially on his patrols.<br>\r\n   \"Sir, the radiation is gone,\" Landan said. His eyes flicked over numerous screens, and a look of horror stole over his face. \"CONTACT OVER THE BORDER! FIFTY CRUISERS!\" The alarms blared and the bridge sprang to life. Clearly visible through the forward view screens were the shapes of a fleet of cruisers that rivaled Evers' ship. They steered towards the lone human ship. Evers was filled with dread, and went through the motions of combat while already mentally saying goodbye to all his loved ones. His silent thoughts were interrupted by commander Landan yelling again.<br>\r\n      \"The tachyon spot is back, our side of the border. Less than 500 miles distance.\" Evers simply rubbed his eyes and wondered what death would be like. All of a sudden, the transparent dome over the bridge lit up a brilliant blue. I swirl of lights appeared, and the ship was rocked like a dinghy in a tsunami. The Directive ships were also affected, and some of the closer ones collided. Finally, the lights faded and above Evers's ship, there was a section of the night that was totally black, not even stars. Across the border, the Directive ships fired all their weapons at once. The arcs of plasma and burning missile trails seared spots into Evers' eyes. He closed them and braced for the end. When nothing happened, he opened them and saw they had exploded on whatever was above his ship. Slowly, running lights lit up on the darkness and illuminated a massive ship above the human cruiser. Now, three points of light flashed on its forward surface and three white trails sped through space to impact on the Directive ships. What happened next was only describable as Hell.<br>\r\n     The first ship to get hit by the light was destroyed instantly. Its shields flared, died, and the ship exploded. The same happened to the other ships unfortunate enough to get hit by these weapons. While the Directive ships recovered from the until shock, this new ship was further illuminated by lines of plasma traveling through transport tubes. Then it erupted from dozens of points on the ship's surface and streaked into the Directive armada. The smaller ships were completely engulfed by the balls of plasma, but the bigger ones had a second to stay together before their metal structures were boiled away. Within minutes the armada was nothing but a collection of derelict hulls and clumps of liquified metal. The new ship seemed to stand down, the plasma lines cooling and almost appearing derelict itself.</span></div></div>",

Towns reached for the lighting control.<br>\r\n\"Leave it dark, Henry,\" Muench muttered. Towns walked over to his friend and sat down across from him.
