You got up and showered, having no idea that soon your life would change forever.  You went to work, went to lunch, and as you started to head home, you felt a wave of nausea and shut your eyes tight.  When you open them...</span></div></div>",

One moment ago you were on a bus home, and now you seem to be in what appears to be a small cornfield.  There are tan colored stalks shooting up around you, almost up to your knees.  The sky is dark and starless, but you see a bright light up ahead. You begin to force your way through the stalks and start to see an object that unnerves you.  There is a roundish object up ahead, with large support beams coming out of it.  One of them goes upward, the others connect to other round objects.  You get closer and see beyond these objects are enormous buildings, but as your eyes adjust to these impossible objects, you begin to understand their shapes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them is a couch, impossibly large.  Another is a chair, and a coffee table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they are so gigantic that only a fantastic giant could possibly use them.  You reach the round objects, just at the edge of the darkened area you are in and the lighted world beyond, and look up to see that they are the wheels of a computer chair.  You are under a desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you nearly begin to panic, you see to your left in what could be miles to you a pair of objects that frighten you more than any of the others: A pair of black flip flops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God...\" You say to yourself, feeling sweat begin to soak your body.  Suddenly, the ground begins to shake like an earthquake.  You struggle to keep your feet as the floor shudders again and again, loud booming sounds filling your ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see a pair of blue jeans, rolled up to her knees and a zebra striped shirt around her upper body.  You can see her massive bare feet crashing into the carpet beneath them.  You look up to see her brown hair swishing like a waterfall around her shoulders, her dark eyes eyeing the room around her.  You finally lose your balance, both to the shaking of the floor and your complete awe of her massive and beautiful form.  You drop to your knees, and look up as she closes the amazing distance between you in moments.  </span></div></div>",

You hear her weight settle into the chair, and her feet settle onto the ground mere inches from you.  Her plump toes are painted bright red, and the scent of apple lotion fills your tiny nostrils.  The toes wiggle, as if greeting you, and waft more of the scent over you.  She must have just rubbed lotion on them.  In one physics defying moment, one of the feet swiftly lifts into the air as she casually crosses her legs, and you feel a sinking feeling as you realise how powerful this mysterious woman is in comparison to you- her every simple movement threatens to blow your mind.  You can hear her computer start high above you, and her fingers begin to click on the keys, echoing in the air around you.  Her left foot still lays scant before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing hard, you decide to attempt to her get her help.  Walking carefully over to the massive foot, you compare yourself to her little toe.  \"God, it's bigger than me...\" you say to yourself.  You...</span></div></div>",

Her skin is soft and is still slightly moist from her lotion, and you bounce off of them quickly.  You crash to the floor and watch as the toes lift and flex before you, as if laughing at your pathetic attempt to gain their notice.  You feel even smaller now, unable to even get her toes to notice you.  You wonder briefly how it is that you came to be here, tiny and insignifiant at the feet of this large woman, but you put it out of your head.  Only she can help you now, you reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run forward again, this time slapping your open palms against the flesh of her big toe.  \"Hey!  Please!  I'm down here!  Help me!\" You cry.</span></div></div>",

You will either be shrunk to a tiny size, with or without her knowledge. How will things turn out for you?  Will she notice you and give you aid?  Will she conquer your tiny and insignifigant life?  Will she crush you beneath her giant feet, or her magnificent rear?  Or will she shrink you herself, to keep you as her pet or slave?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Goddess KayaNee is both a personal friend and a Goddess, so she will be treated with respect, if not worship, at all times.<br>\r\n2) Goddess KayaNee is, as a Goddess, always to be in control.
