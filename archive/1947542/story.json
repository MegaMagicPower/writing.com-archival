To their fortune the found a cache of strange look spider like creatures in what appeared to be stasis tubes stashed in what was only described as a \"destroyed craft\". Once loaded onto a large truck the specimens were sent on their way to a top secret research facility. However will driving along the normal route the truck driver ran into a detour and was forced to take a more civilian highway. All was going well along the route for a while unto a wild deer leaped out onto the road. The driver quickly tried to avoid hitting the creature but only succeeded in jackknifing and over turning the truck. The vehicle veered off the main road and proceeded to tumble down a slightly forested hillside, crashing violently into a the ground at the bottom. The driver was killed instantly but the same couldn't be said of his cargo which was now awake and well. The crash had ruptured the truck's side and the strange creatures were unknowingly released. They scurried and crawled through the tree line and brush and reached an all girls private academy. They scuttled close to it with one thing in mind, to breed. These creatures sought out hosts who were undoubtedly present and blissfully unaware of what was to come.</span></div></div>",

Not remembering what had happened in the park she ran to the building with a sore throat and a slight chest pain. The girl had made it to the school and started to catch her breath, wondering why she had such terrible chest pain. Seeking self aid she slowly entered an empty girls bathroom. She went to the sink and washed her hands and face. The girl looked into the mirror for a brief moment of self inspection when suddenly she was struck with a sudden coughing fit. Attempting to catch her breath in vain she fell to her knees as a sudden and painful sensation hit her in the center of her chest. Gasping for air she clutched her hand to her chest and tried to regain her composure only to be hit with the same pain once more, knocking her to her back.<br>\r\nMoaning in pain she could feel her ribs being pushed forward, slowly cracking from some unknown force within her. \"Crack!-Crack!\" another sudden jolt of pain made the little girl cry out in pain. She popped open her school blouse and looked at her chest in an effort to asses what was happening to her. Her eyes widened in fear. It looked as if something was squirming around under her skin trying to get out, a growing patch of red started appearing where blood vessels had broken under the skin. \"Crack!\" with one last jolt of pain the little girl arched her back forward gripping her exposed chest as she screamed in agony when suddenly \"Crack! Crack! Cra-ack!\" her chest burst open in a splatter of blood and viscera. The little girl's back dropped back to the floor one last time as death took her the only things to be heard in the bathroom was the screeching of a newly born alien slithering out of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?

Not recalling what had happened she slowly rose for the tiled floor of the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch, I must've slipped and hit my head.\" she said looking about the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't see the facehugger which had attacked her, having crawled into a slightly open locker and dying there shortly after. Hiyori still groggy from the ordeal was wondering why her throat was so sore and why her chest felt heavy. Assuming it had something to do with her \"accident\" she paid it little mind. She heading back toward her locker when she noticed a long scaly looking thing sticking out of a nearby locker. Slowly approaching it she began to cough a bit, nothing much she thought, just needed a drink of water perhaps. Hiyori opened the locker, her heart beating heavy from caution, she looked down and yelped in shock as she found the dead facehugger in the foot of the locker. The surprise once more put her on the floor. After a moment she inched closer to it to get a better look at it, her heart beating faster which each passing second and breathing getting short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this thing? Eww it looks like a big spid....\" Hiyori's sentence was cut short as she started coughing quite hard and the slight pain in her chest suddenly became a sharp one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh...Ahhh......Owww!\" she gasped as she leand her back against a locker. She wondered frantically why she was feeling such pain as she placed a hand on her bare chest, trying to sooth herself. Hiyori got in a few stable breaths only to to once again feel a hard pain surge from the center of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...what...is....wrong....with...my chest?\" the young girl asked gasping and gagging. With her back to the locker she looked down and saw that something was moving around inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this...Ahhh!?!....Feels like something is inside my; Owww!\" before she could finish her thought she was struck with another pang, feeling something push against her ribs making a sickening cracking sound. The poor girl twitched and curled in pain against the locker, coughing up spats of blood occasionally. Hiyori glanced at her naked chest now showing a red bloody spot in the middle, listening to the squirming sounds and cracking noises coming from within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*cough* *cough* ...*gasp* Hiyori could only suffer as the pain within her mounted. Every few second the pain would force her to thrust her chest forward, as if the source of her agony was trying to force its way out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh God!....Ughh...Ahh....AHHHH!\" Hiyori screamed as she clenched her eyes shut and thrust her chest forward for the last time as the creature within her burst forth from her rib cage in a horrifying splash of gore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Hiyori's body went limp and her head dropped down giving her a final glance at the creature she had just \"birthed\" from her chest. Then the light faded from her eyes as death took her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

In the process of getting closer in search of a host, the facehugger attempted to traverse a couple of suspended cables from the tree it was perched in. These cables hung over a small electrical grid just a few yards from the academy. While crossing the cables, the facehugger's tail dangled to low and touched one of the power couplings and as a result was mildly electrocuted. It fell to the ground unconscious just outside of the small safety fence around the grid and there it laid for a good while. This was all about to change when Dr. Penny McAllen, a young biology teacher at the nearby academy walked by.<br>\r\nTaking notice of the fallen creature with a slight shock she slowly walked over to it. Ever the curious one, she poked it with a twig to see if it was alive. Seeing the slight singe marks on it, Dr. McAllen assumed it was electrocuted by the power grid, as some other animals often are. Wondering about what the creature before her was she decided to take it to the biology class she taught in at the school in order to further examine or even dissect it. She entered the classroom and took it to the back lab and laid it out on a metal tray. She then proceeded to leave it be for a moment to get some latex gloves on. Before she could return to it, she heard the phone ring and went to go answer it. While in said call the facehugger on the table slowly began to regain its consciousness.<br>\r\nIt slowly struggled to regain its footing still dazed from the shock earlier. By this time Dr. McAllen had finished with her call and was returning to the table only to be surprised that the creature was alive and moving. Once again ever curious she slowly approached the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little guy, I thought you were a goner. Guess I was wrong huh?\" she said getting closer to it as it curled its tail in a tightly packed coil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh its ok, I'm not going to hurt you. Don't be afraid.\" she said once again drawing ever closer to it, now as it seemed to back up slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only want to examine you a bit; what are you exactly? Some type of insect or a spider perhaps?\" she asked getting practically right in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point the facehugger fully regained its cognition. Making a quick twitch, it locked onto its target, blissfully ignorant Dr. McAllen who gasped in surprise as the facehugger launched itself toward her, latching firmly onto her face. Having no time to react at all, Dr. McAllen could only try in vain to attempt removing the creature from her face. She couldn't get it to budge, as its grip on her head was shockingly strong as was the amazing strength of its tail, now coiled tightly around her neck restricting her air flow. Struggling in futility, Dr. McAllen backed against a wall and slid to the floor. She tried to mutter out a yell for help but only felt the sensation of the facehugger's determined and forceful proboscis enter her mouth and slide down the back of her throat. Shortly after, she blacked out from the lack of air and slumped off to her side hitting the floor unconscious. From here the facehugger proceeded to impregnate her with its embryo. Curiosity killed the cat.</span></div></div>",

She awoke to find herself on the floor in the lab at the back room of her biology classroom. Groggy and unsure as to what had happened to her she jolted back toward the wall upon noticing the dead facehugger lying on floor beside her. She recalled nothing of what it had done to her, save for it jumping out at her.<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, are-are you dead little guy?\u201d, she said while making slight pokes at it.<br>\r\nGetting up slowly and with a bit of soreness from being on the floor for a while she picked it up and placed it on the tray it was once on, this time she would definitely try to dissect it.<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess there is only one thing to do with you then. Now let\u2019s see what makes you, *cough cough* tick.\u201d, Dr. McAllen said with a light cough in her voice.<br>\r\nBut then just as she was about to reach for her scalpel she heard the school bell, signaling the change of class periods. She took notice then of the time and saw that her biology was to start now. She couldn\u2019t believe it was time already, she had been unconscious for three hours. Dr. McAllen had figured whatever the strange creature had done to her, had kept her knocked out for quite some time. And as much as she was begging to know what this things was made of, how it functioned, and perhaps what it did to her would have to wait, much to the displeasure of her scientific curiosity, she had a class to teach. Looking into a small mirror on the wall she made herself as presentable as she could be and walked out into the classroom, leaving the dead facehugger behind for now.<br>\r\nShe made her way to the front of the classroom as students started coming in. Taking a piece of chalk into her hand she began writing notes and drawing diagrams on the blackboard behind her. Once done she turned to greet her all girl class.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning everyone. Let\u2019s begin, there is much to discuss.\u201d, She stated to the class.<br>\r\n\u201cJust as a refresher, can anyone tell me where we left off last class in the text?, Dr. McAllen asked.<br>\r\n\u201cSymbiotic and parasitic reproductive patterns and growth.\u201d, called out a student.<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, Ashely thank you. Now everyone open up your books to page 395. *cough cough*\u201d, She replied with another slight cough.<br>\r\nFacing the chalk board she began to lecture the class.<br>\r\n\u201cNow who can tell me the difference between a symbiotic organism and a parasite?\u201d, Dr. McAllen asked.<br>\r\n\u201cSymbiotic organisms are creatures that tend to form cooperative living patterns with another living thing, while parasite tend to just feed of a host organism to further its own survival.\u201d, a student answered.<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent, now regarding parasites, according to our last lecture there are several different kinds of parasites. But can someone give me an example of one? How about you Vanessa?\u201d, she asked turning once again to the board with yet another slightly harder cough.<br>\r\n\u201cA good example I guess could be the amazon lynch mite.\u201d, Vanessa answered<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful example Vanessa, care to elaborate?\u201d, Dr. McAllen asked, while giving a minor cough and noting a slight congested feeling in her chest.<br>\r\n\u201cWell the book made reference to it in chapter 4 but I think it is a predatory bug that hunts other larger bugs for two reasons, food and breeding purposes.\u201d, Vanessa continued.<br>\r\nDr. McAllen nodded in agreement and turn to the board to elaborate with a diagram.<br>\r\n\u201cSaid mite seeks out other, often larger bugs, to either feed upon or to\u2026.*cough cough* use for breeding.\u201d, Dr. McAllen roughly said.<br>\r\n\u201cYou ok there teach?\u201d, asked another student.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, I must be either coming down with something or my allergies are acting up again.\u201d , the doctor answered.<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, the mite in chapter 4 often feed on other bugs but it did so in a rather gruesome,\u2026..*cough*, way.\u201d, she continued while facing the board.<br>\r\n\u201cIt would find an insect larger than itself, and\u2026\u2026*cough*, attack it and render it hepless with a poisonous bite and\u2026\u2026*cough cough*.\u201d, she said in between coughs.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but can anyone pick up from the book while it address the diagram? Can seem to can\u2019t seem to get a word in as it were, *cough*.\u201d, the doctor asked while pointing at Ashley and then returning to the board.<br>\r\n\u201cOnce paralyzed the mite attaches itself to its prey and begins to lay eggs within its target.\u201d, the girl stated as Dr. McAllen gripped her chalk a bit tighter.<br>\r\n\u201cOnce it has done so, the mite dies and detaches from its prey.\u201d, Ashley continued, now as Dr. McAllen leaned over the front desk slightly panting and sighing.<br>\r\n\u201cDr. McAllen are you alright?\u201d, Ashley asked.<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026go on\u2026.*cough* I\u2019m fine.\u201d, the doctor staggered to say.<br>\r\nShrugging her shoulders Ashley continued reading aloud. \u201cThe bug, once regaining mobility will go on as if nothing happened while the eggs inside will grow into larva that would sap nutrients for the host insect\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\nWhile the girl was talking, Dr. McAllen was experiencing an increasing discomfort, She felt as if her chest had grown tighter, and for a moment, could swear she felt as though something was moving about in her. She leaned forward at the desk and felt her chest with her hand, in an attempt to sooth herself.<br>\r\n\u201cThe maturing larva within would then go on grow, and eat the host from the inside and then burst out of\u2026.the\u2026host. Dr. McAllen are you sure your are alright?\u201d, Ashley asked as she stopped reading.<br>\r\nDr. McAllen was panting and coughing heavier now at her desk. Facing down at her papers she cringed in growing pain as she felt a pain starting to emanate from her chest.<br>\r\n\u201c *cough cough* Go\u2026.get\u2026.arghhh\u2026. the nurse p-please.\u201d, Dr. McAllen said clenching her eye and gritting her teeth as a student ran to fetch the nurse.<br>\r\nShe tried to regain her posture and composure, trying to slow her breathing for a moment until suddenly, CRACK! She lurched forward grasping her chest as the students in the classroom jumped back in their seats. She fell upon the desk before her and started to convulse an seize.<br>\r\n\u201cUgghh\u2026..rrrrahhh! *gasp gasp*.\u201d, she grunted and moaned as the pain within her mounted.<br>\r\n\u201cDr. McAllen! Come on we have to help her!\u201d, shouted Vanessa as she and two other students rushed to her side.<br>\r\nThey tried to hold her still but to little avail as she was thrash about to hard.<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh\u2026\u2026..crack-crack\u2026..*gag*\u2026\u2026.oh God!\u201d, Dr. McAllen yelped and gasped as sickening sounds of bones cracking were heard.<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh\u2026.c-crack.\u201d, she gagged as she arched her chest upward. Upon laying back down she ripped open her buttoned shirt in a vague attempt to see what was happening to her. All she could see was a growing bloody patch blooming in the middle of her chest and a repeating bulge appearing, as if something inside her was trying to get out.<br>\r\nShe gripped her chest with both hands and briefly glanced around at the faces of the horrified students around her as some backed away.<br>\r\n\u201cHhhhgggg\u2026..Urrraaghh\u2026..*Cra-Crack*\u2026\u2026.AHHHHHHHHH!\u201d, Dr. McAllen screamed as she clenched her eyes shut and threw her head back, arching her back upward one final time as her chest ruptured open and a small snake-like creature burst forth from her now bloody rib cage just as a student returned with the nurse.<br>\r\n\u201cHoly Shit!\u201d, screamed one student as all of them leapt back, sprayed with the blood and gore of their teacher.<br>\r\nThey looked on in horror as the small alien creature let out a piercing and shrill cry leading them all to scream in terror as it slithered out from Dr. McAllen\u2019s chest and out of the classroom. The rest of the horrified class had only their fear, uncertainty, and dismay to accompany them as they looked on at the bloody scene that had just taken place before them. A lesson they and the late Dr. McAllen won\u2019t ever forget.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Access to the gym was normally unavailable during early hours of the morning, but Connie had managed to secretly have a spare key made when she had borrowed a key from one the instructors. Doing so could've gotten her in trouble, but that was also part her thrill. Plus it was nice to have all the equipment to herself and her friend Liz.<br>\r\nThe two sophomore girls picked up their gym bags and towels, and headed toward the showers. \u201cThis was a good idea Connie, thanks for inviting me,\u201d Liz praised. She had her blond hair tied back, her bangs hanging on either side of her forehead, her average framed compared to her friend who was older and more mature looking. Connie smiled \u201cNo problem. Just remember, snitches get stitches,\u201d She couldn\u2019t hold back a giggle as she finished as both girls laughed. Connie\u2019s red hair was cut in a bob, so she couldn\u2019t tie it back. Her face was bright and youthful, with high cheeks set just below green eyes.<br>\r\nAs both girls approached the threshold of the showers, a metal clang echoed through the gym, like the sound of a vent cover falling to the floor. Both girls stopped and turned, surveying the lockers and gym gear.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Liz asked, eyes wide open. Neither girl could've guessed what it was, or what it shadowed.<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence Connie turned to her friend. \u201cMaybe this gym is haunted,\u201d she said with a smirk, as both girls giggled again as they passed into the showers. They set their bags down and began to disrobe before entering the locker room shower.<br>\r\nThe next few minutes passed as the girls showered and chit chatted about other school mates and their plans for the next few days. As the showers filled with steam, both of the girls were blissfully unaware as the eight legged alien horror scurried across the gym floor. It would move quickly for a distance, then stop suddenly as it honed in on the voices of the girls. Their gossip was sealing their fate. The creature would them burst into movement again towards the shower, stopping for a moment to listen to the girls before resuming. If only the girls had left the gym when they heard the vent cover hit the floor, if only they had not picked this morning to use the gym. But their care-free nature had brought them to this point.<br>\r\nConnie finished her shower before Liz, and turned off the water before going to the bench to grab her towel. The girls could not see each other, the stalls prevented that, although they were comfortable enough with each other to not care either way. Connie picked up her towel and began to dry herself, as the facehugger entered the doorway behind her. She kept her back to it as it quietly crept in, now only a few feet from her. As she dried her face, she turned towards the door way.<br>\r\nWhen she pulled the towel from her face she only had a moment to wonder what she was looking at on the floor. She had never seen anything like it before, except maybe a spider. But this \u201cthing\u201d was as large as a cat, and it was fleshy colored. It that one moment of confusion and hesitation, the facehugger sprung up at her face, its legs stretched out wide and its tail flailing through the air as it rapidly closed the distance. It was like slow motion for Connie, the fear welling up in her, and the disbelief causing her to not move at all save for closing her eyes in a natural reaction. The creature landed perfectly against her face, obscuring her pixiesque features as its legs instantly gripped around her head and its tail coiled around her neck.<br>\r\nThe force of the impact knocked her backwards, and she stumbled to the ground naked and still wet. Now her disbelief had subsided and the fear took hold as she raised her hands and tried to pry the monster from her face. She rolled left and right on her back and kicked her legs wildly on the tile floor as she struggled, and opened her mouth wide to scream for her friend who was oblivious to what was taking place. When she opened her mouth, she was greeted with a slimy proboscis being rammed into her mouth causing her to gag. The tail around her neck tightened further, and she could hear her own heartbeat thumping in her ears. Her skin became hot, and her panic reached its peak as she realized she couldn\u2019t breathe and needed air desperately.<br>\r\nHer own voice screamed in her mind \u201cLIZ! HELP! WHY WON\u2019T YOU HELP!\u201d but all that could be heard was muffled gagging as the facehugger\u2019s porboscis was forcefully stuffed deeper down her throat. Even what sounds she could make were drowned out by Liz\u2019s shower, as Liz began talking again to her friend from the stall.<br>\r\n\u201cSo like, I was thinking about going to the mall after class today, but like, I just realized that we have that test tomorrow, so maybe we could go tomorrow, or like\u2026\u201d Liz continued totally oblivious to the struggle taking place just outside her shower stall. Connie could hear her friend\u2019s words, and at that moment she realized how dire her situation was becoming.<br>\r\nStarved for oxygen, her hearing began to fade and in the darkness under the creature she began to see stars and spots of light. Her struggling ceased, and the fear began to fade as she slowly slipped into unconsciousness. The proboscis worked its way deeper into the young girl\u2019s body, eager to impregnate her in her with its embryo. The tail tightly coiled around Connie\u2019s neck loosened its grip a little, and the creature\u2019s own lungs began to pump oxygen into her. Not enough for her to regain consciousness, but just enough to keep her alive and it a comatose state. And comatose she was, as every muscle in her body was completely limp and unresponsive, save for her beating heart.<br>\r\nLiz had finished her shower by this time, and she was somewhat alarmed that Connie had not responded. As she stepped out of the stall, she gasped at her friend\u2019s naked body lying flat on her back. She then gasped again when she realized there was a fleshy colored creature tightly gripping her friend\u2019s face. She slowly stepped closer, still wet from just exiting the shower. She knelt down and studied the creature, its eight legs gripping her friend\u2019s head, its snake like tail coiled around her friend\u2019s delicate neck. She noticed the creature\u2019s lungs inflating and deflating, and her friend\u2019s small chest slowly rising and falling as she breathed through the creature.Eyes wide, Liz whispered, \u201cConnie?\u201d There was no response. \u201cConnie, I\u2019m going to get help\u201d. Still no response.<br>\r\nLiz stood, and only then realized the gravity of the situation. She was still wet and naked, and so was her friend. On top of that, they were in the gym when they weren\u2019t supposed to be. What could she do? She had to dry off and get dressed. She grabbed her towel and dried frantically, trying her best to think it out. When she was half dry, she opened her gym bag and pulled out a wad of clothing. Sorting through it she found her clothes and proceeded to get dressed as quickly as she could. She struggled with the last bit, but managed to button and zip her jeans. Socks and shoes finished the endeavor.<br>\r\nBut Connie was still naked too. She couldn\u2019t get help and leave her friend like this. She worried for what might happen if she was found as she was. She would then dry and dress her friend. She grabbed her friend\u2019s towel from the floor and began to carefully pat dry her. All the while the facehugger paid no mind to Liz\u2019s actions, focusing solely on its mission of implanting its embryo. It truly was born for this sole purpose, as it proceeded impregnating the young girl with little concern for anything else. Connie didn\u2019t seem to notice the activity either, completely disconnected from time and space in her unconscious state.<br>\r\nWhen Liz had finished drying her friend, she got into her friends bag and pulled out fresh clothes and dressed her quickly and frantically.<br>\r\nShe knelt beside Connie, and held her limp hand in both of her own hands to give her comfort. Looking where her friends face would be had the creature not obscured it, she whispered \u201cWe will get through this Connie. I\u2019ll take care of you. We\u2019ll get you help\u201d.<br>\r\nAs she was so focused on reassuring her friend, she failed to notice the second facehugger that had entered the showers behind her. She felt guilt at then that it was Connie on the floor with this thing and not her. If she had been more alert, she might have been able to help Connie before this had happened. As she held her friends hand and wished this horrible day had never happened, the second facehugger made its move.<br>\r\nIt leaped through the air and slapped against Liz\u2019s face. Instantly she let go of her friends hand and rolled onto her back, reaching to her face in a futile attempt to remove the creature. Its tight grip on her head and it tail coiled around her neck made that impossible, despite her efforts. After a few moments, she was beginning to gasp as she opened her mouth to scream. She only made a muffled gag as a proboscis was forced into her mouth and down her throat. Still gripping the creature, her feet kicked wildly and her hips bucked left and right on the floor trying to resist. She began to relax as oxygen deprivation put her into a trace like state. In her last thoughts, she realized that seconds ago she felt guilty that it wasn't her unconscious on the floor. Now her wish had come true, much to her horror. But the fear slid away with all other thoughts as her body relaxed and her consciousness began to fade.<br>\r\nThe two girls lay motionless on the floor, save for their slowly rising and falling chests. They made small muffled moans now and then, or small gagging sounds under the facehuggers. In a moment of semi-consciousness, Connie reached out and gripped Liz's hand, in response to the reassurances her friend had given her moments earlier. It was only a subconscious acknowledgment, but it felt good to know her friend was with her. The two girls lay side by side, holding hands as the facehuggers continued to impregnate their newest hosts.</span></div></div>",
