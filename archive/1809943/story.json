The mutant known as Beast had been trying to make something that could help the X-men in the field, enhancing their speed and agility for a short amount of time. He was almost sure  it would work but wouldn't know until it was tested.<br>\r\nFiguring there would be minimal, if any, side effects, he decided to test it on himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed one of the vials with his paw-like hand and raised it to his lips. Downing it, he set the empty vial on the table and waited. He decided to bring out his notebook and write down everything he had done to get the formula. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he finished writing it down, he felt a rush of energy flow through him. He looked down at his furry body, which was mostly covered by a lab coat and found he was...</span></div></div>",

This wasn't supposed to happen!\" he said as he could feel his lab coat tighten. It quickly stopped and he quickly grabbed a measuring tape nearby to see how tall he had grown. Even grabbing it was hard, as it wasn't the same size he had remembered it. Looking at the numbers, his eyes widened. 8 feet tall? It couldn't be! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brain was flooded with thoughts. How long would this last? Should he try to make a formula to reverse the growth? Should he stay like this and use it for good? Should he try to focus on correcting the original formula first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that hardly anyone was in the mansion at the moment, Hank gently opened his door and ducked through it, stepping out into the hallway.

This prove to be a mistake on the X-Men's leader part as after he bumped into the bigger Beast, he fell right on his butt with his glasses falling off, and the full raw powers of his eye beam hit the very first thing he sees: Hank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, a raw blast from Cyclops' naked eyes would send even the sturdiest and heaviest foe flying, and while Hank was still not in that part of the league of mutants and super beings, even with his new size; the blast didn't budge him slightly. Instead, it made him fell all tingly,just like the time he took the serum. Before Hank could analysis what is going on, he notice that Cyclops was getting smaller, as well as the hall closing in around him. Somehow, the serum has trigger and 4th mutation in him, he can adsorb energy now and make into his mass. But, it was more than that. Beast then notice that Scott's glasses were in foot range of him. By this time, Scott closed his eyes, in risk of hurting anyone in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My glasses,\" he cried, \"Please, give me my glasses.\" He odiously didn't see it was Hank he bumped into, let along seeing his friends growth spurt, which lead the blue-fuzzbal to be around 10 feet by his calculations. Beast's lab coat now felt slightly tighter around him, as though it was an old shirt he had after having a good rounds with Twinkies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only did Beast felt different by his new height, he also felt his brain was buzzing more now, concepts that were loose to him when he hanged out with Hank Pym, Reed Richard, and Tony Stark seem easy to him now. His sense have been heighten as well, He could smell Wolverine's scent across the hall as tough he was right there in front of him and he had bath in a week, he could also hear murmurs of the his fellow X-Men as they continued with their lives floors above him. Hank assumed that his new growth in body as also lead to a new growth in his mind and sense.  He felt like he do almost anything now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that Cyclops is now close to his glasses, Hank</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as he stepped out of his lab he could smell Wolverine coming. The little Canadian often wandered the halls of the mansion at night; his healing factor meant that he required little rest, and being on so many different teams at the same time meant that he had an awful lot on his mind more often than not. They shared an easy and playful relationship, and he was glad for it. Considering all they had been through together and with Scott, it was far too easy to fall into bitterness or melancholy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hank?\" Wolverine's gruff voice was low in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Logan.\" Beast's voice sounded a lot deeper than before, and even though he tried to match Wolverine's tone it still carried quite a bit more than he meant it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have figured you'd be up. What do you need, like thirty minutes of sleep at this point?\" He could hear the weariness in the other man's tone. He wasn't up because he didn't need the sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast chuckled anyway. It was best to keep the spirit light when he was like this. \"Only slightly more as long as there are sufficient quantities of caffeine. I was...in the middle of a test trial, and thought I'd pop in to the Danger Room for a quick session.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got something on your mind, furball? I've never known you to resort to pretend violence to work something out.\" Wolverine had walked up so that they were standing face to face. Well, face to stomach. Logan had to have noticed how tall he was by now. He was likely waiting for Hank to bring it up himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. As you can see, there's been an...unforeseen result of one of my tests. I thought the Danger Room would be the best way to measure its effect.\" He leaned back and looked down at his friend. He had always been bigger than him, stronger too -- but not the difference was undeniable. Wolverine looked like a child next to him. He felt like a bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other mutant chuckled. \"Just don't break anything on your way there. You look like you might have some trouble fitting through some of the doors in the lower levels now.\" Wolverine was about to squeeze past him when he stopped and looked up. \"This ain't anything I need to be concerned about, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast smiled, his prominent fangs on full display. \"My dear Logan, you wound me. Everything is perfectly under control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine looked him up and down, then shrugged before walking away. \"Sure, Hank. Just make sure you're back to something resembling normal by your next class. The students have a hard enough time concentrating on mutant physiology without having to worry about whether a bear-sized professor is going to eat them or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One would think that would encourage better concentration,\" Beast said. He hadn't realized just how nervous he was until he head Wolverine's retreating footsteps. He took a deep breath before moving on. His clothes felt tighter than ever now, and he was sure he had popped a few seams on his lab coat and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out Wolverine was right; it was a challenge getting through some of the doors on the way to the Danger Room. He had to wonder how Colossus managed to fit down here, or if Piotr ducked all the time and he had just never noticed. Now that he was roughly his teammate's size, he had a newfound sympathy for how rough it was to be so tall in a world made for smaller people. He made a mental note to do something about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Danger Room doors, however, were immense. Over twenty feet tall, rising from floor to ceiling in a monstrous replica of the X-Men logo. Beast smiled as he fumbled with the too-small keypad, rather pleased with his design. His plans for the new school were ingenious, even if he did say so himself. The Danger Room, where the X-Men trained for threats both real and theoretical, contained some of the most advanced augmented reality tech in the world. And he had designed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped into the room and rose to his full height, which felt taller than it did just moments ago in the Lab. Was he still growing? A small shiver of alarm raced through him, though it changed into a small thrill soon after that. He had to admit he could get used to being this size. It made him look far more imposing, and, well, dashing when he wanted to. And, he theorized, he could be far more effective in combat out in the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer,\" he rumbled, rolling his shoulders. His lab coat tore further, and he felt the seams of his pants split several inches inside his thigh. \"Load routine X-233 please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vocal identification verified. Loading routine X-233 now, Dr. McCoy.\" The computer's feminized voice filled the bare metal room before it changed completely. In the blink of an eye, Hank found himself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Danger Room changed from a sleek and solid metal room to an outdoor scene. The moon rose high in the sky, and Beast could see a few bright stars glittering over the lights of the Westchester Mansion. This was its oldest design, back when he was a younger student of Professor Xavier. Everything had been designed to be as real as possible, even to mutants with heightened senses such as himself. He could feel the cool night wind brushing through his fur, and the Danger Room's systems pushed the scent of wet brick and grass, trees and flowers from the manicured lawns. If he focused, he could detect the slightest tang of chemicals underneath it all, but the facsimile was very good regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was on the lawn of Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, with his old teammates. Cyclops, Jean, Iceman, Storm and Wolverine were there, huddled with him in a defensive formation. Their backs were to each other so they could see in all directions, and both he and Logan were positioned opposite one another. Between them, they could sniff out any danger that was as yet invisible. It was a good formation, he remembered. They covered all of their bases, ready to spring into action at a moment's notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you picking up?\" Cyclops spoke to his right, but he knew immediately that he was speaking to Wolverine. Despite the fact that his senses were just as good, Scott relied on Wolverine far more in the field. Even then, he thought with the sting of wounded pride, Cyclops had been taking him for granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got trouble,\" Wolverine replied, his nostrils flaring under his mask. \"I make out two or three Sentinels a few hundred yards out. That's not all, either; we've got some troops on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast could feel his shoulders tensing, the muscles in his body coiling as he readied for action. He never told anyone this, but he actually liked being out in the field, fighting the good fight with his friends by his side. When it came down to it, it was surprisingly uncomplicated, and given the stakes involved it surprised him that it could be even fun. Most people -- even his own teammates, if he were honest -- grossly underestimated him. They either forgot how smart and quick he really was, or just how powerful and savage he could be. It always filled him with a small swell of pride to make people pay for that little strategic mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyclops sighed with the news. \"All right team. It's going to be a busy night. If we want to make sure they do as little damage to the school as possible, we're going to have to be smart, quick and decisive.\" Beast smirked inwardly. He knew that really meant \"Do what I say when I tell you to do it, and we'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Storm, you fly towards the Sentinels and see if you can't give them a little welcoming shock. Wolverine, go with her to make sure the Sentinels are focused on something other than the weather. Jean, you're with me. See if you can do something about the troops while I'll try to take out the heavy artillery. Bobby, you and Hank stay here and protect the school. You're our last line of defense, so if you see something coming through the tree line that's not us, it's your job to make sure they don't get past you. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast gave Iceman a sympathetic look that was immediately returned. Scott thought that his stressing the importance of staying behind would make them feel better, but what it really did was make them feel diminished, like they needed to be talked down to. Hank used this simulation to work out his feelings about Scott as much as he did to get combat practice. It always stung, but he hoped that eventually, somehow, he'd come to understand why Cyclops felt the way he did about him. It hadn't happened yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood,\" he rumbled, and patted Bobby on the shoulder. His immense paw came across the smaller man's back and made him stumble forward a couple steps before he caught himself. Cyclops nodded, and the X-Men sprung into action immediately. There was maybe a split-second before the trees erupted in red light from Cyclops' optic blast, and storm clouds gathered above the forest surrounding the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that makes us the B-Team, huh?\" Bobby shifted into his alternate form, a being made of living ice. He didn't appreciate being held back any more than Hank did, but he wanted to be ready when the time came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a far more exclusive club, at any rate,\" Hank told him, rolling his shoulders and focusing the rush of adrenaline he felt towards leaping towards a threat. \"Scott always knows to save the best of us for last.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quip was easy to say, though he didn't believe any of it. Iceman had the good nature to laugh with him, at least. \"You know it, Hank. Between my moves and your brain, we've got anything they throw at--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine came sailing through the trees just then, slamming into Bobby and taking them both back through the outer wall of the school. Logan and Iceman disappeared inside with a loud crash, the brick of the outer wall coming down around them. Beast turned his attention from his fallen teammates to the enormous Sentinel foot that had emerged through the treeline, the ground shaking as it stamped the young oak and maple underneath it. Hank felt his blood begin to boil and time began to slow down. His body was moving before he was even consciously aware of it. Can't let that thing get to the school, he thought. There are students in there. Some of them are still asleep -- somehow. They'd never get out in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast charged the enormous foot and leapt right in front of it, his claws digging through the reinforced metal as he created his own holds. They weren't as tough as Wolverine's adamantium claws, but they would do the trick nicely. He jumped from the ankle to the knee deftly, landing just long enough to steady himself and leap up towards the giant robot's waist. He had no idea what he would do when he got to the robot's shoulders, but if this was the model he remembered chances are there were fairly critical systems easy to access right between the shoulder blades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank was so concerned about making sure the Sentinel never got the chance to swipe him that he hadn't noticed his body beginning to grow again. Suddenly, it was easier to leap from the waist to the upper arm, and from there it was a surprisingly short hop to the monstrosity's shoulder. He actually overshot, nearly leaping over its head. His foot caught the top of it and he tripped, tumbling to the other shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted as he tried to stop his momentum. He weighed an awful lot more than he did before, though, so it was tough getting his bulk to stop. There was more being added all the time, meaning that each roll would take him much farther than he was used to. Nevertheless, he tries to dig his claws into the tough metal of the Sentinel to stop his falling. If he failed, it would be a long, LONG way down to the ground.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beast fell to the ground face-first, his broad shoulders growing more so as he rocketed down to the ground. He could feel the tug of gravity increase as his height steadily grew, pulling him down that much faster. It would be fascinating if he wasn't in severe danger of slamming against the metal floor of the Danger Room. He had to act fast to prevent that from happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe twisted his spine until he faced away from the massive Sentinel, then doubled over. He could touch his toes with his fingers, but instead he spread his legs and pushed forward. His claws met the reinforced metal of the giant robot's back and dug in. His arms jerked with the sudden slow of his descent, and he could feel his body change direction. His feet caught the metal as well, cushioning his fall a bit. Short, thick toes spread to give him a good grip. He slowed to a stop right over the Sentinel's belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank sighed in relief, then felt the odd sensation of his fingers and toes outgrowing the small tears they made. He was still getting larger, a little faster than before. His mind raced for a moment as he tried to think about how this could be. Did activity trigger some sort of second reaction? Could he expect more? How bad would this little growth spurt be? It wasn't good for him to be out in the field if he was still unstable. There was no telling what--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright light appeared to his right, and he looked to see the Sentinel's palm beginning to fire. Beast barely leapt away in time, slamming into the automaton's metal back just below the shoulder blades. He felt his weight hit it with much more force than he was used to, and his claws sunk into the metal a little more firmly. He shook his head and tried to focus on the mission at hand. There'd be time to sort through the growth issue later. Right now, he had to focus on making sure this thing didn't make it to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, he was careful when he jumped on the robot's shoulders. His heavy paws landed squarely on the giant's neck, and his eyes widened for a moment when he saw them expand visibly. How big was he getting? The access panel underneath the neck and right between the shoulder blades looked astonishingly small, and it was growing more so all the time. He put that thought aside for now and slammed his fist into the panel. Claws ripped through the metal easily, and he dug in his fingers and yanked. It ripped away easily, exposing a collection of blinking lights, small moving pistons, and a labyrinth of wires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe schematics of this particular model flashed before his eyes in an instant. He knew just where to hit it to disable it. Without a second thought, he squeezed his paw through the hole and ripped out a few wires to the right of it. That should take out the redundancies that help it recover from catastrophic damage. He ripped a bigger hole to the left of the panel and slammed his fist through a circuit panel. Now its weapons and targeting systems were off-line. Another swipe of his claws broke small pistons and a bundle of tubes that provided the super-computer located inside its head with necessary coolant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, the Sentinel stumbled around the grounds of the school, leaving footprints in the carefully manicured lawn, shaking the walls of the building's lobby. Beast nimbly twisted out of the reach of blind, grasping fingers, then took out its navigation system, its programming matrix, and the cable that connected its CPU to all secondary systems. He worked with a savage efficiency, and as his paws blossomed and his strength grew, the work got easier and easier. By the time the Sentinel was crashing to the ground, his fist barely fit within the expanded hole he had made, and his weight crumpled its shoulders when it slammed to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disorienting feeling of expansion was nothing compared to the vertigo experienced by being on the shoulders of a giant robot as it fell. It took him a few moments to get himself situated, and by the time he did it felt like his 'little' growth spurt had finally stopped. He hopped off the back of the Sentinel and felt the concrete powder under his paws. He winced, then stood up tall to look around. Everything looked so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mane could be seen from the second story, and if he stood on his toes he could just see inside its window. His shoulders were far too broad to fit within the school's front doors now, and he would take up an entire hallway walking on all fours. Monstrous didn't begin to describe what Hank was now. He was simply enormous...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hank...what happened to you?\" Iceman's voice sounded behind him. He turned and hunched over to see his friend, who was still quite a bit below his eyeline. The staggering difference in their heights took his breath away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...not sure I have time to explain.\" His voice was deep and booming, even when he tried to be quiet. It was hard to recognize it as his. \"We have to make sure the Sentinels don't reach the School.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" a gruff voice behind him said, \"I think the Sentinels can wait. Tell me what's going on, Hank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast turned to see...</span></div></div>",

As he was going down the stairs, he could feel his growing belly start to jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the empty kitchen, he opened the fridge and pulled out some cheese, meat, and bread for sandwiches. Normally he could eat three, but he was feeling like he could eat double that now. He made six sandwiches, put everything back, and got out a bag of unopened potato chips. Hank wolfed the sandwiches down and opened the bag of chips. Before he knew it, the whole bag was empty and there were crumbs all over the fur in his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly got up, cleaned his fur, and threw the bag away. As he passed a mirror, he stopped. His lab coat was starting to get tight because of his growing belly. His face looked a little softer as well.

He look down, pleased with himself when suddenly the feelings roared back, twice as strong as before. He stomach swelled dramatically before his eyes, putting on an unknown amount of weight. He grabbed his furry belly in horror, feeling it fill his hands and start to droop down slightly onto his belt line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditionally, his chest started expanding, growing first more barrel chested before the fat got to be too much and starting settling into two small but sagging moobs. Hank grabbed one in a panic and felt the new addition to his body, trying to get used to feeling so much more flesh on his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the growth slowed, leaving him with a belly that sagged onto his belt, love handles that supplied more than a handful and a chest that would turn any of his shirts into bras. Hank looked down at his new body, feeling a mix of anger at himself for not being able to get the serum right, embarrassment at his new body, and concern at the prospect of this being his new permanent body. And yet, there was something else, but Hank shook this feeling off.

It all combined to make him a really solid mutant -- 400 pounds of muscle and bone. Still, despite his size he wasn't the first name that came up in a discussion of the biggest X-Men. He didn't mind this; his mind made him a better fit for Xavier's grounds and his own lab, and others relished life in the field. He was more than happy to leave them to it. Hank contributed to the team in different ways, scientific advances being chief among them. If he were able to make a new drug that increased the physical abilities of mutants, it could give his teammates even more of an edge against the constant barrage of threats ready and willing to take them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving downed the first vial of his potion, Hank had a hypothesis of what he would feel if it worked as expected. He should feel his muscles coil and tighten, and then loosen again. His great lungs should pull in air more efficiently, and the rush of oxygen would make him feel more energetic. His bulk would be much easier to manage, far more flexible than it was before. Even folks like Colossus would be able to bend themselves into shapes that make yogic masters jealous. He felt none of these things, however. Instead he felt a burning through his entire body, then his muscles forming new and greater knots. As he took in several deep breaths, the sensation only grew more pronounced. He felt his body starting to push against his lab coat and spandex pants. His fur spread out to cover bigger bulges slowly growing all over his body. His chest swelled further with every breath. Instead of feeling light, flexible, limber, he felt even more hulking and brutish. Things were not going according to plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis golden eyes stared wonderingly down at his huge mitt of a hand, watching as his fingers grew thicker and his palm grew wider. It all but swallowed the pen he was holding, making it even more awkward to hold. \"Oh crumbs,\" he thought, \"and I just relearned how to write, too.\" His oversized hands lead to increasingly ham-sized forearms, which in turn lead to upper arms that were ripping right through his labcoat. He gasped softly was he felt his shoulders broadening and thickening, his neck widening so much that it all but disappeared into his traps. His back made short work of the stretchy material of his labcoat, the tatters falling away from arms that were crashing into his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted as his pecs pushed against the table, forcing him away from his workspace. His chair began to creak as his weight skyrocketed, and the sides cramped his body as his hips and rear widened. His thighs surged against each other, forcing his maleness on top of them as it, too, expanded. The feeling of power crashing through his body in such a constant, electric surge made him nearly hyperventilate. His muscles were growing so quickly that he barely had control of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why he couldn't do anything when the chair finally gave way underneath him. He fell back with a room-shaking crash, helplessly falling to his back as his body seized and virtually exploded with power. \"Oh my stars...\" is all he could manage to say between gasps, over and over. The size, the weight, the power...it was nothing short of orgasmic as it poured into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes passed this way, and Beast's body steadily pushed aside and destroyed the furniture nearest to him. A thumping paw slammed through a lab table that had been bolted to the floor, and an arch of his back crumpled the reinforced floors underneath his shoulders. His eyes rolled back in his head, and just when he thought it would come to be too much, the heat coursing through him finally cooled. He felt his muscles begin to loosen. His body was his to control again. \"Well...that was certainly unexpected,\" he purred. He was surprised by how deep and rumbling his voice had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he rose to his feet, noticing how easy it was to move his muscle-packed body and how much every movement sent shockwaves through his lab. He would certainly have to be careful with things until either the potion wore off or he could reinforce everything up to his new power level. The thought that these changes might be permanent made his heart skip a beat inside the tank-sized chest of his. In so many ways, it would make his life much more difficult. But he couldn't deny there was a certain thrill in the prospect just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis back and shoulders had grown so big he could barely turn his head. He looked at himself as much as he could, marvelling at how enormous his pecs were, how his biceps rolled under his pelt, how his paws felt big and strong enough to rip a bear in half. He stomped over to a scale as gingerly as he could and stepped onto it. It was the most open part of his lab at this point, and he was dying to know how much mass he had added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DNA recognition match: Dr. Henry McCoy, code name Beast. Indulging in one too many Twinkies again, are we, doctor?\" The computer's voice was high, authoritative, feminine. Hank rolled his eyes at the crack. Perhaps he shouldn't have added the AI personality subroutines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, Betsy, there's that wit I've come to love. Basic measurements for me, please, then run a full diagnostic of my vital signs. When you're done with that, let me know and initiate voice dictation. I'll want extensive notes on this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't write this down yourself, doctor? Very well then. I will store all data in my memory banks and initiate audio and video recording. Shall I use the standard encryption protocols?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank thought for a moment. \"No, Betsy my dear. You'd better add a few more layers of encryption to these files.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer chirped its acknowledgement. \"I understand you think you've stumbled onto something big, here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast rolled his shoulders. \"Quite possibly. The measurements?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment's pause before the computer chirped again. \"Current height: Eight feet, three inches. Current weight: 1012 pounds. Full medical diagnostics will be forthcoming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he felt far larger and way more powerful than before, it was quite a shock to be told that he had gained over six hundred pounds and two feet in mass. That...that should be impossible! Where was all of the extra mass coming from? Was it permanent, or would it eventually wear off? He had designed it to be a temporary boost, but if the effects were this pronounced, and this far away from what he had originally intended, there was no telling what it would do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant-sized doctor's mind raced feverishly with questions and hypotheses, even as he reveled in his immensity. An accident like this would require a vast amount of study. He'd better get to it!</span></div></div>",

He had set out to make a potion that would give the X-Men a temporary edge, boosting their mutant abilities for a short time. He had designed it to only increase the potency of the X-gene 50% at most, but a self-administered test had revealed he had gone far beyond that. In just a short time, he had more than doubled his weight and gained over two feet in height, all muscle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no telling why he had taken to the potion so well or how long he could expect the effects to last. In the meantime, he had to learn how to navigate the lab with his much bigger body. As he thumped from station to station, the big blue mutant was constantly misjudging his relationship to the space, knocking tables over with a casual bump of his hips or accidentally crushing his lab equipment with a paw that felt like it had doubled in size. He had to lean over quite a bit more to see anything below the barrel of his chest, and everything he touched felt...small and fragile. It made the going difficult, but he was determined to study this while he could. Strike while the iron was hot, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as the minutes ticked by Dr. McCoy felt as if he couldn't ever quite get comfortable. Just when he thought he could reasonably navigate his own bulk he felt bigger, bulkier than before. When he thought he knew how gentle he needed to be with his sensitive lab equipment, he found that his light touches were still breaking thin glasses, petri dishes and microscope slides. His pens and datapads felt even lighter, and his massive fingers were shockingly thick compared to the display settings he had grown used to. He felt himself growling under his breath before too long. Being this big was getting to be a pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the time there was a small buzz in the back of his head, this current of electricity running through him. Unnoticed by Dr. McCoy, the potion was still at work, making the previous changes permanent while introducing new ones. Steadily, surely, Beast was growing even larger and stronger, his weight ticking upwards with every breath. And, when his body grew thick enough that it couldn't possibly hold much more muscle, his height would inch upwards and the process would start again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his discomfort, he tried to take measurements, study the effects of the potion on his system and extrapolate data based on that. When he felt himself having to curl further against his own bulk to see inside a microscope, he finally figured out that something was up. He rose to his height and took a good look around the lab, noticing how much...further down everything seemed. And how much his immense blue-furred body took up his vision whenever he glanced in that direction. His shoulders were threatening to swallow his neck completely, and his chin brushed the pelt on his chest. He'd have to bend at the waist to see his own feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my....\" he rumbled, realization slowly dawning. \"I don't think the potion is quite finished with me yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous mutant thundered back to the weighing station and waited for the computer to acknowledge him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DNA recognition match: Dr. Henry McCoy. Welcome back, doctor. I see that you've gained even more weight since we last spoke. If this keeps up, you're going to weigh the same as a small car by sundown.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betsy my dear, that's why I'm here.\" Hank decided to side-step the computer's wit to get right down to business. \"Can you tell me how tall I am and how much I weigh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly doctor.\" There was a pause. \"At the moment...\"</span></div></div>",

That...couldn't be possible. In the span of a few short hours, he had grown four feet and gained nearly half a ton of muscle! Where was all of that mass coming from? Why wasn't his circulatory system shutting down under the strain of supporting so much additional bulk? Why hadn't he experienced any growing pains or other side effects of too-rapid growth -- stretch marks, lost fur, inflexibility? It didn't make any sense. What's worse is that it meant he was still getting larger and stronger, and there was no telling when his transformation would be finished with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my stars and garters... I...think I need to sit down. Betsy, please use the Colossus configuration.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank put one monstrous paw to his head while the lab changed around him. He could feel the way his biceps crowded the space between his shoulder and forearm. His back as broad as a wall and twice as thick; every movement sent muscle rippling along his hide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, his work space changed from the comfortable and cluttered, slightly disorganized study he was used to. His papers were put away and filed into storage. Delicate scientific instruments were hidden away and replaced with more spartan and hardy equipment. Every surface, from table to chair to shelves, were reinforced and broadened to handle the incredible strength of Piotr Rasputin. Now, it would have to deal with him. He was over three times heavier than Pete and who knows how much stronger now, but he had to believe it would hold. It worked for the Juggernaut when he was on the team, and it would have to do for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the lab looked completely different. It was outfitted with several heavy duty medical stations, adamantium-tipped needles and beakers that could withstand any hazardous or radioactive material. Now, it was just large enough for him to move comfortably -- but who knows how long that would last. Betsy chirped when the transformation was done. \"Ready for Colossus now, Dr. McCoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe growled his satisfaction and nodded. \"Very good, Betsy. When do you think you'll be done with those diagnostics, by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence before the computer responded. \"The results of the analysis are proving difficult to pin down, Dr. McCoy. The samples you've provided are mutating too quickly to get a stable reading. However, I can provide you with the most accurate information I was able to gather ten minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast stepped down from the weight platform. It felt odd still, one leg practically rolling around the other to propel him forward. His foot -- shaped like a cross between a bear's and a lion's -- made the ground thump notably underneath it. His toes splayed wide to hold his weight. His claws even felt strong. \"That might be for the best, Betsy. Give me the readings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer chirped again and displayed what it knew. The findings, to say the least, were incredible. It would appear that his own cells were mutating into multi-dimensional organisms, winking out of existence and coming back...changed. What's more, every time the cell returned from wherever it went, it quickly replicated. Then it mutated again, winked out of existence, and came back to do the whole thing over again. Beast even noticed signatures that could only have come from Pym particles, the very thing that made Giant-Man attain his fantastic size. Could it be that his body had become a factory for these wondrous sub-atomic particles?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was an incredible discovery on its own, Hank had to consider a troubling question that might have an even more disturbing answer. When would the cells begin to stabilize? There had to be some point where they would start to lose steam and settle into a final form. At least, that's what everything told him as a man of science.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly they weren't doing that. If anything, his own cells had become seemingly tireless machines of evolution, \"improving\" his body and adding to his considerable mass. At this point, Beast would venture a guess that he'd be immune to most injury, had developed a healing factor that might not be quite Wolverine-fast but certainly nothing to sneeze at, and his musculature was dense enough to make him even stronger than his overwhelming size would indicate. He was effectively one of the \"big boys\" now -- a Hulk, a Thor, a nearly god-like powerhouse -- and he was still getting bigger and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to say, he liked the sound of that. But if he didn't find a way to stop his mutation soon, he might end up being too big, too musclebound, or too powerful to keep himself in Wolverine's School. He had already nearly outgrown his lab -- if this kept up for much longer, he might end up hurting someone or causing irrevocable damage to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank wasn't too proud to admit that it might be time to bring in other minds on this. Perhaps a call to Henry Pym wouldn't be out of the question. Or perhaps Reed Richards -- the vast young minds of the Future Foundation might appreciate a good biological puzzle to put together. Still, he was Dr. Henry McCoy, the man who cured the Legacy Virus. He was no slouch in the biology department himself, and he was surely smart enough to get himself out of a problem of his own making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast looked over the readouts one more time and rolled his mountainous shoulders. What would be the best thing to do?</span></div></div>",

But if they're interacting with him to cause a <i>third</i> mutation -- that's a little beyond him. It would be best to bring in the world's expert on how they worked now. With Pym's experience on dimensional mass-shifting and his expertise on mutant genetics, they should have this figured out in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betsy,\" he rumbled, \"please call Dr. Henry Pym for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" the computer acknowledged. Hank looked down at himself, and was once again shocked by the size of his own body. He smoothed his fur a bit to make himself look more presentable, but it insisted on fluffing up. Either its consistency had changed or his own bulk was forcing it to look thicker than he wanted. He sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betsy, see what you can do about fetching me some clothes while you're at it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking your measurements and checking the school's wardrobe. Please keep still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast rolled his shoulders and stood up straight, staring at the monitor that had been lowered from the ceiling. The system was still trying to connect him to Dr. Pym. He tried to breathe deeply and relax, but every time he inhaled his chest surged alarmingly, then seemed to stick out just a little more when he exhaled. He could almost feel his arms and legs growing thicker, his back broadening, his height increasing. Or was that his imagination? The fur on the back of his neck stood up. Keep it together Hank, he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Henry Pym's face appeared on the screen. His blond hair was ruffled and he was rubbing his eyes. His voice was thick when he spoke. \"Mmm. Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Dr. Pym!\" Hank boomed, a bit too loudly. Was it morning? When was the last time he had slept? \"Did I catch you at a bad time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPym waved a hand. \"No, no, course not. You're going to pay for the next coffee shipment out here, though. What's up? Does Cap have something for us to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm afraid this is a personal call. I could use your help with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what's--\" Pym finally looked at his screen and his eyes widened instantly. \"Jesus, Hank. What happened to you? You look like a tank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast sighed. He was fairly sure he had broken the one-ton barrier by now. \"I know. And getting bigger all the time. In fact, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe told Dr. Pym about his experiment and what had happened so far. Pym, despite his sleep deprivation, asked him a number of questions he hadn't even considered. He had to admit, he was impressed. His mood lightened considerably. It was always good to be in the company of like minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's incredible, Hank. I've never heard anything like this before.\" Dr. Pym was holding a mug of coffee now, and he was considerably more alert. The bags underneath his eyes had almost disappeared. \"We've been using Pym particles with mutants for quite some time, and we've never had these results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but we had never bonded the Particles to the X-Gene itself.\" Beast couldn't help keeping a note of pride out of his voice. \"Frankly, I'm surprised that neither of us had thought of it before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Pym chuckled. \"Probably because we knew that something like this would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A runaway mutation? Just a hazard of the business, I suppose.\" Beast chuckled and rolled his shoulders. His neck was so thick and his shoulders so broad his head basically sat on top of them. He was getting better at knowing what was happening to him now. He had bulked himself to limited mobility with his musculature, so now the growth was focused on enlarging his frame so more could be packed on. He'd be gaining height over the next several hours, and then the process would repeat itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The business of mad science? That's full of unintended consequences, Hank. I know that better than anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, my friend. Which is why I came to you with this first. You alone would appreciate why I'm so keen to get this under control as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Pym nodded and looked at another screen. He tapped a few commands on a side terminal before continuing. \"I understand, Hank.\" He looked back at the screen, his expression serious. \"Listen, I feel like I'd be able to help you better if you could come up to the Satellite so we could meet in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast shook his head. \"Are you sure that's a good idea? Exposure to more particles might speed the rate of the mutation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPym winced. \"You're right, that's not a good idea. Unless you want to outgrow the only thing keeping you from the vacuum of space?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. McCoy chuckled. \"There are many things on my bucket list, Henry, but that's not one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, it looks like I'm coming to the school. It'll take me under an hour to get there, Henry, but in the meantime I think I might have a way to stabilize your mutation. Let me send the schematics to you and see what you think of them. If you like the way they look, I can help you develop the serum when I arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast smiled. His fangs felt a lot bigger inside his mouth, which itself felt like it had changed shape. \"Sounds like a plan to me. I haven't had many visitors since coming back to Westchester, it'll be great to have you. I'll put the kettle on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPym grinned wide. \"Now you're talking. I'm on my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hank?\" Beast stopped Dr. Pym from ending the call by putting up one enormous paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPym blinked. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help. It's a singular pleasure working with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Pym smiled. Henry knew how much he appreciated the sentiment. Giant-Man had so much to atone for, and it was the force driving him to do such great things these days. He opened Avengers Academy out west, helped Beast devise and maintain the base of the Secret Avengers, and helped any superhero at their hour of need, no questions asked. He wasn't recognized for it nearly often enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Hank.\" There was a silent moment of gratitude shared between them, and then Pym nodded. \"I'm on my way. Don't build anything crazy without me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen went blank, and Hank turned to Pym's schematics. He had hoped it would work -- chances are there would need to be a few modifications, of course, but Pym's science should be sound. If it did, he would probably be able to at least stop his growth before it got any more out of hand. Best case scenario? He could control it easily, allowing himself to outmuscle anyone on Earth -- possibly the Universe -- while remaining one of it's foremost scientific minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to admit, the thought appealed to him. But first things first. Would it work? He pored over Pym's schematics and discovered...</span></div></div>",

The way the Pym Particles had bonded to his genes would make the work exceedingly difficult, and it looked like this process was a quick modification job. Henry covered it well, but this was obviously created for a baseline human who had a theoretical allergic reaction to the particles. The science underneath it was sound, but his own genetic code was quite different at this point. At best, his body would just ignore the serum at its proposed dosage. If he got repeated dosages or an overdosage, then chances are he would further mutate as a reaction. There was no telling what would happen then. It might kick off something more extreme than mere growth. The thought made Hank shudder; what if he devolved further, from a feline-based sentient to something...else. He had seen all the possibilities of his mutations manifested in other timelines and dimensions. He knew how bad it could get. With his x-gene as unstable as it was right now, he couldn't dare push it any further with more experimentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant mutant's shoulders slumped somewhat. He had hoped it would work, really hoped. Every hour they delayed on finding a way to reverse this, the bigger he would get and the more likely it was that what had already happened would be permanent. He was over ten feet tall now and a solid ton or more of pure muscle, bone and fur, and he would be growing even more before they found out how to stop him. What kind of changes would he need to make to be comfortable? How much more difficult would it be for him to gain some measure of acceptance from the public? He sighed and shook his head. Just when his profile was just beginning to rise, too. He had distanced himself from Scott's militant practices, had joined Logan's school and done great work with the Secret Avengers. All of that would be erased the first time someone saw a great blue cat bigger than the Hulk stomping down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down in one of the reinforced chairs meant for Colossus, and felt just how small it was at this point. He stretched his immense shoulders and pushed his paws up over his head. It felt nearly swallowed in the muscle of his upper arms, fur and bulk tickling his whiskers. There really was nothing for it right now, he thought. Dr. Pym would get here and they'd work it out eventually. Two people that smart working on something together were bound to come up with a solution, given enough time. In the meantime, Beast would do what he always did when he found himself too stressed to think clearly. He would eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betsy,\" he rumbled. \"Prepare a meal. A dozen steaks, rare, two dozen chicken breasts and three boxes of Twinkies. With a nice cabernet reduction on the side. Oh yes, and be sure to make a few gallons of coffee for me and my guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer chirped its acknowledgement. \"Gladly, Dr. McCoy, but would you please reconsider eating quite so much? You're not getting any thinner you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank sighed, but he was forced to smile. \"Duly noted. I'll take your highly-valued medical advice under advisement. In the meantime, add six more steaks to the tally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what shall Dr. Pym require when he arrives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast thought for a moment. \"Half a dozen maple-glazed doughnuts. And French Vanilla cream for his coffee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Dr. McCoy,\" Betsy said. It only took her fifteen minutes to have everything ready. When the scent of all that meat hit his nostrils, his stomach practically roared in hunger. He walked over to the small eating nook he fashioned for himself like a man in a dream. He sat down, and tucked in without stopping for half an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steak was amazing, and so was the chicken. He polished it off with a gallon of coffee and two boxes of the Twinkies. Every time he felt like he was getting full, all he had to do was wait ten minutes before hunger began gnawing at his stomach again. Hank could have measured his metabolism with Betsy, and in fact, she was probably doing that right at this moment. But it was different feeling the physical effects of an increased metabolism directly. He could probably eat even more, even faster, and not ever be completely full. The thought frightened him, but it also intrigued him. His healing factor was probably increased, and it also likely meant that he would age more slowly. That definitely appealed to him. At the moment he needed only three or four hours of rest per day, but there was so much more he could do if that could be cut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he ate and basked in the afterglow of such a large meal, his body was busy putting the fuel to work. Beast's pelt stretched with the sheer volume of muscle being added to it, and he felt his skin tightening around his own bulk before the healing factor kicked in. He could feel when the muscular generation backed off so that he could add height, increase the width, length and density of his bones, make sure his other systems were able to keep up with the new demands being placed on his body. In a way it was beautiful, his own body working like a well-oiled machine towards making his power greater and more efficient. In other ways, it was horrifying. He was constantly growing, and in fact he only got better at it as time went on. It felt like his body was moving towards something unstoppable, that it was only a matter of time before he became a self-generating paragon of power. What would happen then? What would he become?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiet, friendly beep broke him out of his revelrie. He stood up and immediately knew that he was quite a bit taller than he was when he sat down. His own body seemed stuffed with power, each muscle tensing and bulging immensely before it came to rest. Soft but pronounced booms shook the lab with every step he took. Against his better nature, Hank found himself growing a little aroused at his own might. What he wouldn't do for Abigail to show up right now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofter footsteps sounded from the door. Beast could tell that Dr. Pym had treated himself with Pym particles before entering, and was now fairly big in his own right. He saw him standing just inside the door frame, having to duck slightly to get in. He had to have been at least ten feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Dr. McCoy looked down at him quite a bit. Giant-Man came up to the bottom of his chest, the barrel of it so large that he had to lean down a bit just to see the smaller human. \"Ah, Dr. Pym,\" he boomed, trying to smile without showing his teeth. \"So good of you to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis colleague's eyes widened considerably when he spotted the giant walking towards him. Giant-Man quickly recovered and smiled back, offering a hand. \"Well, you know me. Always ready to help a friend in need. Though I have to admit, I'm not quite sure what the problem is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast chuckled and turned to lead his friend into the lab. \"It's not stopping, is the problem. In a very short time I'll be too large to leave the lab, and by this evening I'll have outgrown it entirely. If my calculations are correct and the growth happens steadily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has it?\" Dr. Pym followed behind him easily, though he had to walk a little faster to keep up with the mutant's longer stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...not sure. I had a rather large meal before you came over and it seems to have...exacerbated the condition a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed,\" Giant-Man said. \"You still have a little bit of cream filling on your chin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast looked over one monstrous shoulder to grin at him. \"Thank you for telling me now instead of letting me look so undignified. You're a true friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant-Man chuckled. \"Thanks for saying so. I thought I'd size up a bit so you feel a bit more at ease, too. But it looks like I didn't quite get big enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but it's the thought that counts.\" Beast stopped at the coffee station and gestured towards the oversized pot with a massive paw. \"Here's coffee and doughnuts for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Giant-Man popped a full-sized doughnut into his mouth as if it were a small piece of candy and chewed thoughtfully. Beast took the opportunity to prepare another gallon of coffee for himself, and the two friends shared a comfortable silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how did the schematics look to you?\" Dr. Pym looked up at him, trying to keep his voice casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast shook his head. \"I'm afraid it won't work, Henry. My x-gene is a bit too stubborn to allow much outside interference. At your recommended dosage nothing would happen. If we upped it, it might trigger further mutation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Pym's shoulders sagged. \"Ah, that's what I was afraid of. I didn't have your genetic code to find a more specifically-tailored workaround. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't apologize. It's a good attempt. But I just live to make things difficult.\" The great feline rumbled a chuckle and downed half a gallon of coffee in one swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure do.\" Dr. Pym smirked and leaned back against the station. \"Well, what do we do now, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast thought for a moment and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beast stared at the schematics that had been sent over. To be honest, it was solid work. Perhaps it wasn't completely hopeless -- with a few modifications here or there, they might actually make something workable out of all this yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clapped a paw on Dr. Pym's shoulder and pretended not to notice when it made the smaller giant's knees buckle. \"Well, I think your work provides the basis for a solid theory. Perhaps we could tailor it to my, er, rather specific genetic structure and see what comes of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant-Man rubbed the back of his head and grinned up at his colleague. \"Well, if you really think so. Let's see what you've got in mind, though I think it might be best if we start with what you did in the first place. I think if we're going to have a prayer of reverse-engineering this, we'd better go there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast stepped aside, accidentally brushing a low bench with his leg. It felt like he barely tapped it, but he nearly wrenched it free of its bolts. He thought it best to ignore the accident, and smile instead. He gestured with a large paw. \"By all means, take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Pym brushed passed him, and Hank couldn't help but notice that the Avenger barely came up to his chest. He could feel himself growing taller slowly but steadily, his hulking musculature made to look all the more impressive on his taller frame. Beast felt his loins stir a bit, and quickly tried to silence that reaction. He was nowhere near decent as it was, and it simply would not do for him to walk around sporting an erection in front of company. Besides, he'd most likely produce pheromones if he got too aroused, and who knew what effect that would have on Dr. Pym at the moment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed close behind and brought up his notes on the experiment. It was slow going -- his paws were much, much larger than they used to be, and his chest crowded his arms impossibly when he tried to use the keyboard. Still, in just a matter of minutes all of his notes were up on the holoscreen. Dr. Pym studied them closely, tapping his chin as he pored over the notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. So your idea, in a nutshell, was to find a way to take my Pym particles and rewrite them into a mutant's genetic code? Using what we know of Bruce Banner's gamma-powered DNA?\" He said this some thirty minutes later, while Beast helped himself to more Twinkies and coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a nutshell, yes. We know that Banner's genetic code was rewritten to allow for great quantities of mass to be generated -- and expelled -- in just a few moments, with no resulting release or intake of energy. How on Earth does he do that? We're still not fully sure, but I believe we know enough that we could artificially recreate the DNA that allows him to do that. And if we can---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--not only could you recreate the Hulk, you could give Banner the means to control his transformation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast grinned, his fangs showing as he did. \"Precisely! It would be tremendous -- the power of the Hulk at our disposal, available to us whenever we needed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever someone wanted it, you mean.\" Dr. Pym turned to Beast. Hank watched his eyes widen when he realized that the monstrous mutant had grown even bigger in the time he was staring at the holoscreen. \"It's brilliant, McCoy, but I don't think it's smart. I mean...look at you? Just a small test run has altered your DNA to the point where you're taking on more and more mass. If we figure out how to stop it, that still doesn't mean we'd be able to get you back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho'd want to go back to normal? Beast found himself thinking this in response, but he merely nodded gravely. \"I know. I know, Pym. I think we're still a long way from perfecting the idea. But you have to admit it's an intriguing one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPym gave Beast a small, tight smile. \"Intriguing ideas are usually the most dangerous ones. I, of all people, know that. Look, I appreciate what you were trying to do here, but these kinds of things have a way of running away from you. Case in point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to Beast, and Hank nodded. He could feel himself getting bigger every time he took a breath. The rate of expansion looked to be increasing, even after all this time. In eight or ten hours, he had more than doubled in height and grown more than ten times his original weight. It was exhilirating, but Pym was right. They had to get this under control; there was no guarantee it would stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast sighed and rose to his full height. According to Betsy, he was now 13'10\" tall and weighed 4300 pounds. His muscles were not only growing larger, but quite a bit more dense. Underneath that relatively soft coat of fur was a wall of marble. He could probably get shot at point blank range without taking much damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, friend. As...as exciting as the possibilities are, I have to agree with you. I'm far too large as it is, and if this keeps up things could get rather...complicated.\" He leaned down to get a closer look at Pym. Even sized up as he was, his shoulders were only as wide as Beast's arm. \"What would you recommend at this point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPym stared at Beast for a few moments before turning back to the holoscreen. \"Well, what you've done is rather elegant, Hank. It works perfectly, and that's the problem. The gamma radiation has changed your genes in such a way that any tinkering or damage done to them is almost immediately repaired. It's what's allowing the Pym particles to add mass to you so well. As we've seen with the Hulk, once they start going, they don't really want to stop. It's why the Hulk has proven to be impossible to kill, or even figure out. He's remarkably resistant to any change but the ones that have been programmed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've programmed your genes for growth, so that's precisely what they're doing. And they'll resist any new input quite well. I mean, I could devise a barrier that could keep the Pym particles from doing their job, but your cells will find a way around it soon enough. And it'll be harder to pull the same trick next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast's ears flicked as the reality of that sunk in. Could it be that he had done something to himself that couldn't be reversed? How could he have? He had been so careful, made sure that the gamma-irradiated DNA he had injected himself with had a kill switch. There's no way his own cells could have beaten that, could they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed hard, and he winced as he felt himself grow an inch taller. His muscle tightened, his weight increase. The expansion was getting worse. \"At this point, I think it might be best if we try to stop the Pym particles. It will buy us some time, at least, until we figure a way around the Gamma problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPym nodded. \"Right. We're going to find a way out of this, Hank. With our two genius minds at work on this, how could we not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast grinned, but he wasn't sure. Maybe it was time to pull in Banner on this, as well...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next several hours were spent developing Dr. Pym's temporary fix. It was ingenious, really -- a virus was introduced to the system, designed specifically to stop Hank's genes from what they had been rewritten to do. The virus was designed to cycle through five distinct genetic sequences before a kill switch would activate, forcing the virus to grow inert and dissolve. The idea was to stop the virus before it had a chance to mutate or do something unexpected. They were both particularly sensitive to that possibility. The kill sequence was double- and triple-checked, and it's what took the most time to nail down precisely the way they wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of it, they managed to make six different variations of the virus, each scheduled to go through five genetic sequences before shutting down. Each genetic sequence would be able to be effective for around 24 hours before Beast's system figured out a way to beat it. Six injections, each lasting five days for a total of 30 days. Some time towards the end of that month, the virus would be less effective as Beast's body figured out a way to adapt to the presence of it. According to Pym's projections, Beast would simply figure out a way to grow more efficiently, and his height would bump up a little every day during the last week. If he didn't figure out how to stop himself, his growth would skyrocket as soon as the last kill switch was activated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix injections. That bought him 30 days to prevent an enormous problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Beast had grown steadily through the time he was working. By the time they administered the first dose, he had ballooned to a whopping 16 feet even. His shoulders were likely half that in width, and the aggressive expansion of his musculature had changed him in other ways. His claws and fangs grew longer, giving him a much more feral appearance. A mane of darker blue fur began to grow in around his head, giving him a truly leonine appearance. However, his proportions were so much bulkier than that. He rippled with muscle, his body outgrowing itself constantly. There were times were he was engorged with so much strength he had trouble moving, and then -- while his height increased more quickly than his width -- he would lose his dexterity. It made working in the lab a constant challenge; his size shifted constantly, and he had to find a way to work with increasingly small equipment. But his strength skyrocketed, and after a certain point even the reinforced fixtures used to dealing with Colossus and Juggernaut would fail if he grew too careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe weighed three and a half tons by the time the first injection was made. His strength, however, was boundless. He would need to test himself later, but he believed that he was significantly stronger than Hulk in a sufficiently enraged state, the Abomination in all states, and possibly Thor. He had become a being of such immensity that his power could only be equaled by one or two people on the planet, and only in extraordinary circumstances. Beast had to admit that it filled him with a giddiness to know this. Yes, this was an unintended effect. Yes, it still had the great potential to go horribly wrong. But he did what he had set out to do -- create something that could put him in the upper echelons of the power spectrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There.\" Pym smoothed the fur on Beast's forearm after making the injection. They used the same adamantine needle that was used on Colossus when he was stuck in his metal mode, and Pym recommended that McCoy use that for every injection. With that kind of mass and strength, it would take an awful lot to penetrate the skin at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Beast rumbled. He stood up to his full height and stretched, feeling his shoulders brush against his cheeks and then his ears. His arms rippled and surged with strength, and his whole body felt impossibly thick and heavy. When he stopped, he had to bend over to see Pym underneath his own chest. \"I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPym craned his neck to look up at the towering mutant. Even sized up to eight feet tall, he was only half Beast's size. \"You're quite welcome, Hank. I know you would come running to help if one of my experiments got away from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast smiled. \"Of course I would, my dear friend. Without hesitation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPym smiled back, but Beast could tell there was something else on his mind. He had an idea of where the conversation was headed, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to go there. \"If you still have some time free, perhaps we could work on finding--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this about, Hank?\" Pym stepped back once he blurted out the question, and he took the moment of Beast's stunned silence to elaborate. \"I mean, you should know better. Taking Banner's gamma research -- which has resulted in one of the most unpredictable and efficient engines of power on Earth -- and modifying your own genes with it? That's...I mean, I respect you and all, but that's just crazy. You're smarter than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast opened his mouth to speak, but Pym held up his hand. \"I think -- and I have to be blunt here, I mean, we're both friends -- that you do this to yourself when you're not happy with where the decisions you've made have lead you. I think you're actually trying to re-invent yourself, that you WANT these mutations. If you change into something better, or more capable, then you have more control over your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's bullshit, Hank. You...you can only control what you do. How you face the truly insane shit that pops up around you. You can only do the best you can with what you have, not get something else to do better with. You have to accept yourself, and that means accepting your limitations. I'm done.\" Pym added a small smile, nervously looking up at the giant blue mutant for his response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast didn't know how to respond, though. In a lot of ways, Pym was right. But it still hurt coming from a colleague, especially one with his own share of mistakes. Who was he to tell Beast how to deal with his shortcomings? To compensate for previous mistakes, Pym created Ultron, one of the worst threats the Avengers have ever faced. He's abused his wife in the process of dealing with his inadequacies, fallen victim to his own technology more times than anyone could count, and was in the process of atoning for everything he's done by operating his own school of Avengers out west.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a lot of ways, it felt like Henry McCoy and Henry Pym were in the exact same place. Only Beast never nearly wiped out his entire team with his scientific mistakes, nor nearly ended the world. He never raised a hand to his girlfriends; he never made anyone else miserable through his screw-ups. He cured the Legacy Virus, though. He single-handedly dreamed up and built the Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters. He's saved the world with the X-Men more than a few times. And while it was true that his dream of peace between mutants and humans seemed more remote than ever, that he was severely unhappy over the state of mutant affairs, he was also doing everything he could to make the world a better place. If that included experimenting on himself and dealing with the unintended consequences, so be it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast's immense shoulders slumped. Pym couldn't understand what he was doing here. But how could he? He had his own stuff to work through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the concern, Henry. But I can assure you that you couldn't be further from the truth. I'm doing this to help people, not...overcome an inadequacy you think I see in myself.\" He turned away, towards the giant bank of computers that served as his workstation now. \"Again, thank you for all of your help. I'll let you know when I get closer to figuring this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hunched down on the main computer terminal, and noted with some alarm that his fingers were now far too thick to operate the keys easily. He sighed to himself. This would be another thing he would have to relearn in order to work in his own lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast heard Giant-Man slowly shuffle out of his lab without another word. Too late, he thought he could have asked Pym how he dealt with tech being someone of altering sizes. Silence descended on the lab as he brought up his vitals report, and Hank tried not to let it suffocate him. He couldn't go to Logan with this, or Kitty. They'd only freak out when they say him and never understand just how he came to be this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor better or worse, Beast was alone in this. He'd need to figure it out himself.</span></div></div>",

Currently I'm at seven thousand, five hundred and fifty-two pounds, which is an increase of forty-five pounds over yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have steadily adjusted to the difference in my size and physiology, though there remain to be challenges regarding my effectiveness in the lab and with my studies. I am slowly developing solutions to these challenges, but this...mutation has drastically reduced my productivity. It's all I can do to keep the school running right now; I've had to suspend most of my other work to tend to Krakoa, keeping the bamfs in line and finding a way to keep my body from doing what it so desperately wants -- grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those studies have stalled in the absence of good ideas -- at least for a day or two. Attempting to use Pym particles to decrease my size on a more or less permanent basis is projected to work up to a point. According to the computer models my body will develop anti-bodies for the particles keeping me 'small', and use them to fuel my growth instead. The end result is a rather explosive growth spurt that will override the injections keeping me from expanding. I'll be bigger than ever before, with a lot more fuel for future, aggressive growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pym, bless him, has been working with me day and night to find an answer. However, it's clear that the stubbornness of my own genetic make-up is proving to be beyond even our prodigious capabilities. Henry is in agreement that if we don't come up with a good answer within a week, we'll need to call Bruce Banner. We've both agreed that Pym should make the initial contact, and that we should take every precaution to make sure Banner doesn't get too upset and decide to come visiting. The last time he came to Westchester, well...things didn't go well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of the school, Headmaster Logan dressed me up and down as soon as he found out what happened. It only took him a few days to piece it together -- he's a lot smarter than I give him credit for. After he and the rest of the staff had time to...adjust, they were most accommodating. They agreed to move my classes to the gymnasium or out of doors, as much of the facility is simply unavailable to me at my current size. The students are so impressed with my new size that I'm held in higher regard than ever. They are noticeably more attentive and less prone to disruption. I've even been able to make the irrepressible Quentin Quire turn in assignments on time. So I suppose it's not all bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I only have a little over two weeks left to figure a way around this before Pym's treatment is projected to stop working. If I don't, there's a rather drastic growth spurt waiting for me and I'm not sure this won't be more catastrophic than the first. I'll certainly be far too large for a lab -- or any building for that matter -- and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I realize you're dictating the next great American memoir, Dr. McCoy.\" Betsy broke in with the cool disregard Beast had programmed into her. \"But there is a rather insistent caller trying to reach you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. McCoy growled softly. \"I thought I programmed you better than that, Betsy. I distinctly remember telling you that I am not to be disturbed today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer wasn't programmed to be offended, but its tone sounded snippy to him anyway. \"Your request was duly logged, Dr. McCoy. However, the caller has tried several dozen times to reach you, and upon leaving many messages has now started to try hacking into my systems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast flicked his ear. Well, he had to admire the tenacity of the individual, at least. \"Very well, Betsy. Let him through. It'll save us all a bit of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer monitors that had held charts and graphs and diagrams of his body and just about every measurable part of it beeped and flashed. Suddenly, he was looking at the face of a familiar friend. He was human, but the oversized, beak-like nose hinted at his past quite well. Beast's face lit up when he saw him, his fangs flashing between his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barnell Bohusk, as I live and breathe!\" he boomed. \"It is a singular pleasure to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human formerly known as the mutant \"Beak\" returned that smile, wanly. \"Hello Dr. McCoy, it's great to see you too. Sorry I haven't kept in touch. I figured that since M-Day, you had a lot on your plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One's plate is never too full to share with one's friends, Beak.\" Beast rolled his shoulders, forgetting for a moment that his neck had disappeared inside them. He felt them brush his cheeks and the back of his head before he relaxed, then took a deep breath. His chest inflated enough to block his view of the monitor for a moment, and pushed his arms away from his body with its size. He pushed away the small tide of fear that rose in his mind; what if he couldn't find a cure for this? What if he had some sort of explosive growth spurt in two weeks? Could his body even handle that? He flicked his ears and refocused on the screen. It really was good to see Barnell. \"What can I do for you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's my kids, Dr. McCoy. Someone's stolen my children. We've turned in missing persons reports with the police, but they're just men and I think this is about something else. I didn't know where else to turn. Can...can we talk somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast was thinking of what he could make quickly to be modest enough for public. \"Of course. Where's the nearest park to your house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*           *         *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast had run extensive tests on the way that Hulk leaped great distances, but he had never tried it outside of the Danger Room. Still, this was the only way he would be able to get to New York City quickly -- he was far too large for anything else. He squared his shoulders and squatted, his immense calves flexing into the back of his thighs, and jumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made sure that his calculations were impeccable, and that he was pointed the right way. He knew from his notes that he would feel a tremendous amount of power lifting him from the ground, the forces he was capable of producing unlike anything he had ever experienced before. It was not unlike a rocket launch, only he was his own source of fuel, the wind whipping through his fur as he leapt into the air at hundreds of miles per hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beyond impressive. He felt his heart skip a beat as he soared through the air, an immense blue bullet creating a sonic boom as he passed. His goggles were holding up well to the tremendous speed, and his clothes weren't shearing off or bursting into flame from the friction. He allowed himself a grin and a growl of pleasure. This must be how it feels to fly. He could definitely get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found he could correct his course with the merest twitch of his gargantuan bulk, pushing out an immense blue arm or shifting a leg to turn left or right. It shouldn't be possible, this leaping from Westchester to the heart of the greatest city in the world -- it defied so many laws of physics. But here he was, doing it under his own power, his own strength. He laughed to himself as he started to lower, the pull of the planet's gravity overcoming his own exertion at last. When the planet tugged, it tugged hard -- 7500 pounds of muscle could only resist the lure of gravity for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast actually heard himself whistling through the air as he descended, the clouds parting around him as he shot towards the middle of Central Park. This was the most important part of the flight -- he'd create a tremendous crater and shockwave when he landed, and he wanted to make sure there wasn't anyone around when he did. He wasn't sure if he could stick the landing, either. His monstrously oversized paws would be good for it, but he was untrained in this sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landing came far more quickly than even he anticipated. Suddenly he was at the level of the smaller skyscrapers and the next second he hit the ground. The wind was knocked out of him by the force of it, and he came in so fast his bulk tumbled him over and sent him careening over the ground. The earth shook with each landing, his enormous body tearing up huge chunks of land and leaving deep craters before he came to a sudden stop, head-first in another long trench. It took him a moment to get his bearings, and for the dust to settle down, the ground to stop shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast slowly picked himself up and dusted himself off. He looked around and winced immediately. From the broad clearing he landed in, he carved an immense trail of destruction the length of a football field to his current location. He had even cracked several trees in half along the way, the whole area looking as if a bomb hit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh my stars and garters,\" he mumbled as he held his head. This...this would take some explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor...McCoy?\" He heard a sheepish voice a hundred feet or so to his right. He turned and bent to see underneath the tree branches, his immense body filling the space between a pair that survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there, gaping in shock, he saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before he could even start work on finding a way to ease his growth, he immediately feels a slight strain from down below. A strain that was starting to stretch the spandex he was wearing to it's limit. \"What in heavens name is this?\", he winces, feeling the pain down below becoming even more prominent. \"This...feeling... I can't...I can't control it...!\" It wasn't long before his underclothing gets ripped apart at the groin area, revealing his own male extremities in full form. Beast couldn't help but blush at the surprising display, enough to show a little red under the blue fur on his cheeks. He knew this formula would grow everything, but never expected this from his own, well, malehood. \"My... Ahem, I guess it is a good thing no one else is around to see this...\", he replies calmly, gripping his tool and trying his best to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his surprise, that wasn't the end of it. He could feel his own manhood swell up right in his meaty palms, until it was at full erection. \"Oh...Oh dear... <b><i>Hng...!</i></b>\" His beastly tool begins throbbing little by little in his hands, sending waves of stunning pleasure throughout Dr. McCoy's frame. The last thing he needed was to feel turned on but the effects of the potion were showing otherwise. His length soon begins to chub with each vibration, swelling futher with each beat as it fills out his gargantuan palms even more. It only became harder to hold in his seed as the strapping figure was about ready to burst. \"No...! Don't...! Not in my lab...!\" His hands can feel his jutting meat contract and pulsate even more vigorously, enough to feel even the blood rushing through the veins on his lengthening tool as his slit was starting to drip with pre. He could feel his body starting to recline as if it were ready to give in to his own desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith added strength, Beast uses his own newfound strength to hold his impending climax down. It seemed imminent as he was starting to spray mere shots of seed out and onto the large screen before him. <i><b>\"Nnno...!! Not on my equipment...!!\"</b></i> He gives it one more go, clenching his fists around his enraging member even harder than he ever could! The feeling was was both excruciating but orgasmic at the same time. Dr. McCoy had never felt such intensive waves of pain and pleasure in all his life! With one last tug, Dr. McCoy could finally feel his hefty load start to ease up and dwindle down his burgeoned length, thus leaving the sinewy beast to pant heavily as he falls to his knees. His intense feelings of gratification may have subsided but he takes no chances in it happening again, and grips his softened bishop in one hand for safe measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness... It's nice I managed to stop that from happening, but...\", he stares blankly at his empty, gorilla-sized hand, \"...what is this...other feeling I'm getting...?\" Before he knew it, his palm was beginning to grow even thicker right before him! \"What in heaven's name...!?\" Cables of veins start to writhe themselves up McCoy's wrist and up to his forearm, making the bump swell immensely as it tightens his forearm muscles  even more. The veins then sprial around his bicep and tricep, adding a surge of mass into the already overgrown tendons. His shoulder soon receives its addition amount of stimulating growth as well. \"I-I, I'm growing again...!\" Before he could say any more, his neck muscles begin convulsing his throat, gaining even more beef as his grits teeth from the sensation. \"My...<i><b>NECK..!!</b></i>\", he roars, his voice sounding more masculine than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis unaffected shoulder muscles blast themselves out to match his other, filling it with much meat and power as the veins became even more embossed. The same effect takes place down his large bicep, his rippling tricep and his hefty forearm. The last was his hand, which begins to make popping noises as fingers begin to extend a bit as his hand swells impressively, and is able to wrap itself more around his leaking length. His hefty pecs bulge themselves out further, his own chin surprisingly able to feel them swell as seconds fly by. His abdominals start to increase with added mass from the top row of muscles down, making the muscles look even more rigid than ever. His monumental thighs and hamstrings begin pushing themselves against each other ever more, that if his coconut-sized balls were caught between them they may have been crushed. His calves were the next to become part of the beastly, muscular giant as they fill out enough that he's practically able to feel them rubbing against each other if he were merely to stand. The last were his thick feet, which filled themselves up like water filling a balloon while keeping the sinewy muscle and cords of veins in view, and grew enough inches to make it easy for McCoy to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Beast's muscles were pulsating like crazy, his intense growth seems to have come to a stop, leaving the blue monster heaving while he takes a moment to catch his breath. This sudden amount of added mass may have made him bigger, and stronger, he's still pretty mobile, gaining more height in turn to even his body out so he could move and flex his body just like before. His head is on the smaller side though compared to his entire body. \"U-...Unbelievable...\", he gawks. He could see he was standing even taller than he originally was, compared to when he stood before in front of his computer. McCoy even took a moment of thought to why he had grown so suddenly. \"As...difficult as this may sound, is seems holding my...fluid, in has accelerated my grown even more.\" He holds an arm in front of his head, seeing the muscle that was his bicep being bigger than his own head. \"Incredible... My body...it's enormous!\" He immediately gave his muscles a few flexes. Nothing too big, but enough to get a feel of how much he had grown since. Plus his immense physique was enough to put 5 Hulks to shame. He did one where he lifts and flexes his arm, another where he extends one leg outwards while flexing his arm downwards, and even gives his massive body a most muscular pose, watching his muscles ripple and striate as they begin flexing against each other. \"My... This is indeed something.\" He takes a look at the vial he had just drank, which was sitting on a table. \"Though, I really don't think this is something that would be accepted by the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the beast could think of anything else, he suddenly feels an intense sensation running down below. He didn't realize it, but he was beginning to get aroused, watching widely as his flaccid member started to become very erect! Not only that, but it was beginning to quiver and fluctuate as it was earning its own dose of growth. \"N-no! Not again!\" He cups the head with both his hands, though he could feel his tool lengthening and growing right under his fingers. He watched helplessly as his fingers were beginning to be pushed out even further, revealing more and more flesh as it slowly grew on. He tries his best to keep his burgeoning manhood from painting his entire lab white, but his own sexual pleasure was starting to get the better of him. Clenching and holding his dick tight only felt like wonders instead of pain. His member began throbbing harder than he could ever imagine, in turn making it feel like he was pumping rather than hindering himself. The veins around his elongated meat began snaking to the top in small, timely beats as he could just feel his climax underway. McCoy grits his teeth, trying his hardest to keep his lab clean and stick-free as he begins yelling inside his head. \"Come on McCoy! Don't let his get the better of you! Give it one last push!\" With that, he manages to do his body the same. He flexes his arms with enough power to rip a metal girder, making his biceps swell and expand to proportions you would only see on a cartoon. He pulls his throbbing meat in and widens his rippling back to wrap his immense arms around his thick shaft, adding his plump pecs to the equation for some added help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fortunate as it is, his fate seemed neigh, as he could feel his juice only start to rush towards the surface and fill his massive rager even more! \"<i><b>NGH...! N-no good...!</b></i></span></div></div>",
