To help you choose I'm going give you some back round information on the characters.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<u>Lucas</u>: The son. He is 18 years old, has short black hair and steel gray eyes. Lucas is about 5 feet 7 inches. You can't read anything from his eyes, they look empty and dead. But he has a great sense of humor, which annoys his sister. He's great with a sword. What makes him so good is that he can guess his opponents next move. He can know almost everything about you just by looking at you, though not with magic. He is very strong. He is sent to be the actor, he poses as someone and gets information \"from the inside\".\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<u>Lilith</u>: The daughter. She is 15 years old, has dark red hair that falls to her waist and ice blue eyes. Lilith is about 5 feet 3 inches. She'd be beuitful if she tried. You can't read anything from her eyes either, they look a shell hiding something eles. Her gaze unnreves everyone she's met. She has trained herself to not care about anything but her family, her parents are worried about her devotion to the family. She's not a geart fighter instead she outsmarts her opponets. She is so agile and silent that it's wrong. She watches from a far and gets information that way.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<u>Princess Lida</u>: The owner of the Dragons Heart Ruby. She is 17 years old, has blonde hair and sky blue eyes. She loves adventure but her father tries to snuff her lust for adveture out, and is doing a good job of it. She can speak many different languages. She plays the flute. She will meet Lucas when he goes undercover. And maybe fall in love. She'll meet Lilith a few times though not in a friendly way.</span></div></div>",

For three days we were dodging arrows being shot at us.\" Kuronue said grinning from ear to ear. \"That was only one time.

On the wall there are large vines reaching up to the windows.\r<br>\n\"By now you'd think the bags would wise up to the fact the vines make it easier to climb.\" Lilith whispers and starts to climb.\r<br>\n\"Bite your tough! They might figure it out,\" you whisper back. Once you get to the top Lilith points to a window to the right and move over so you can see.\r<br>\n\"She's still awake.\" Lilith whispers. \r<br>\nWhen you look into the window you see the Princes combing her hair in front of her mirror, it looks like she's been doing it ever sine night began to fall. She has blonde hair that goes a little past her shoulders and, from the reflection in the mirror, sky blue eyes. She's beautiful. \r<br>\n\"Ow!\" you say, when Lilith jabs her finguers into your side.\r<br>\n\"Aw. Luccy finds someone he like?\" Lilith says, her grammer bad, as usual, \"Now come on we gotta get back.\" You look in the window on more time. Princess Lida is getting up and looking at the window! She must have heard you!\r<br>\n\"Lilith! Don't move!\" You whisper fiercely. She freezes. Princess Lida is now frowning out the window. Don't see me, you silently pray, don't see me don't see <i>please</i> don't see me.</span></div></div>",

Written in your mother's beautifully handwriting on paper specially procured for such an occasion and sealed with the very official looking emblem of a non-existent kingdom, it is unlikely anyone would doubt its authenticity. For the next three days you work with your father relearning to behave like a prince and on learning to inhabit the role of Prince Roderick from Kearn.  As you come from a long line of thieves, you each have many aliases you can turn to when the need arises, including a number of royals. Throughout your travels your family makes it a point to occasionally drop names and other details, such as the misfortunes of a certain small kingdom of Kearn, associated with your more illustrious aliases (royalty, infamous characters not to be trifled with, etc), which might make its way through the rumor mill. This way your target may have once heard some little detail about your alias. In the case of a prince alias, this should help eliminate any concerns the target has about a prince popping up out of nowhere claiming to be from a kingdom no one has ever heard of, which would hardly inspire the confidence needed during an undercover heist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days later Prince Roderick appears in the flesh for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter given your letter of introduction to a servant, again written by your mother and marked with your \u201cofficial\u201d family emblem, you find yourself alone in the large entrance hall with nothing to do but examine the many paintings on the walls. You are looking at a portrait of a rather stern and wrinkled individual when you sense someone has come into the hall and is now standing behind you. Turning around you find yourself face to face with Princess Lida herself. Immediately coming to mind is that night you snuck a peak through her window and thought your eyes met in her mirror. Over the past few days you\u2019ve convinced yourself if must have been a trick of the light. Surely if she had seen some stranger wearing a falcon mask she would have raised an alarm. No of course she didn\u2019t see you in the mirror. Nevertheless, looking at her now, you realize that no matter how absurd it is to think she saw you without doing anything about it, a small part of you can\u2019t help but feel certain she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments the two of you stand there subtly looking each other up and appraising one another. You examine her blonde hair tied up and out of her blue eyes, which don\u2019t seem to show any amount of recognition. You take in her sturdy boots and riding attire. While her clothing is clearly high quality, it all looks well worn in, even to the point of looking a bit worn out and old, the quality nearly hidden under a fine layer of dust and age. Surprising for a princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello sir,\u201d you hear her speak for the first time. \u201cI am Katie, is there something I can\u2019t help you with?\u201d Though you hide it very well you are momentarily caught off guard until you remember what Lilith told you about Princess Lida\u2019s consideration for commoners and her desire for more freedom. If she doesn\u2019t want you to know who she is, you\u2019re willing to play along, for now. You will have plenty of time to gain her trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, but no,\u201d you reply. \u201cI am merely waiting for the footman to return with my instructions. My name is Roderick.\u201d You doubt announcing your status would much impress this particular lady. But humility, if played right, can be impressive in itself. Anything to set you apart from Lida\u2019s other suitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you must be the prince who comes to visit,\u201d Lida/Katie feigned surprise. She curtsied, but it was clear she was not accustomed to bowing as low as is usually expected of servants to royalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return a bow as would befit a prince, \u201cIndeed you guess correctly. It seems I am not very good at hiding my identity. What gave me away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was nothing sire, only that we were told to expect a Prince Roderick within the day. Here you are and named Roderick, who else could you be. In truth I expected you to arrive with a grand escort as the other princes did.\u201d While she was careful to lower her gaze and speak submissively as servant tend to do, most servants would never speak so freely to someone of such a higher rank. Most moneybags don\u2019t like servants who don\u2019t always defer to their superiority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately I come from a small kingdom, and a recent flood damaged several villages. It did not feel right to take any knights or servants away from their work repairing my people\u2019s homes simply to keep me company on the journey. I can take care of myself, my people need help more than I do.\u201d If Lilith\u2019s information can be trusted, Lida is very sympathetic to the plight of commoners and should favor suitors with that same compassion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully watch for her reaction, but if there is any change in her facial expression, for some reason you don\u2019t see it. Normally you can read anyone in a matter of seconds, but so far you can see no indication of Lida\u2019s opinion of you based on these several minutes of conversation. Perhaps she just sees you as another arrogant suitor come to win the hand in marriage of a princess who is anything but interested. Maybe she does not care enough for you to have any opinion one way or the other about what you have said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately you have no time to continue speaking with Lida because just then the door at the end of the hall opens and the footman gestures you inside. You return your attention to Lida who has already begun to walk away. Quickly making up your mind you call out to her before stepping through the door, \u201cIt was nice to meet you ____?____\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"It was nice to you, Your Highness.\" You don't even look back as you say it; you simply walk through the door after the footman. It may not have been the best decision. If she is focused on keeping up the charade next time you meet, it could lower her guard allowing you to find a way in. And yet you feel good about your choice. She needs to know right away that Prince Roderick is no fool. Lilith suggested this princess would respond better to a prince who, like her, is not looking forward to being pushed into marriage. If Lida thinks you are a fool or trying to hard to impress her she will do her best to be rid of you as soon as possible. If, however, you give the illusion that she is breaking down your walls and not the other way around, she may wish to keep you around longer just to see how much cleverer than you she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footman leads you through the throne room and into a small adjoining room just behind the opulent thrones and closes the door behind you. A man sits at a grand wooden desk looking over several slips of parchment. Although you have never seen him before, you recognize Lida's father, the King, based on descriptions you have heard. You step up the desk and humbly bow, \"Your Majesty.\" You do not say another word or move an inch. Perhaps a true prince would have been more forward, being accustomed to preferential treatment, but you cannot afford to do anything to arouse his displeasure. While Princess Lida is your true target, without this man's approval, you would have not access to her or the castle. And so you patiently wait as he puts aside the parchment, rises from his seat, steps around the desk, and looks you over as intently as he had the parchments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome Prince Roderick,\" he finally addresses you as he stretches out his hand which you take in yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Your Majesty,\" you smile shaking his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat,\" King Merek commands as he gestures to two armchairs. You sit in one faces the desk while he leans back on the edge of the desk in front of you. \"We had not expected you this soon; we received your letter only a few days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I haven't inconvenienced you. Traveling conditions were more favorable than at first anticipated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" he replies. \"I am pleased to hear your journey was pleasant. I am afraid to say I do not know much about your home. Where exactly is Kearn located?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected this question and had prepared with your parents a meticulously planned answer. \"I am not surprised to hear so Your Majesty. Kearn lies just beyond the Bower Mountains. In fact, those mountains constitute the border between Kearn and Mideria. I doubt much information passes through Mideria to your ears.\" At this you detect a slight reddening of Merek's ears. This is just what you were hoping for. The lands of Mideria are ruled by King Warrick. Merek's and Warrick's kingdoms spent many years are war. Tensions between the two kingdoms goes back generations. Only recently were the two men able to form a truce, but that peace is tenuous at best. They put up with each other as kings for the sake of the many lives that would be put at risk if the truce was ever broken, but whenever possible they interact only through advisors and other go betweens. But as men, neither can bear the company of the other. You do not know why; who truly understands the complex rules and etiquette of money bags? Royal bags are the worst. Perhaps one chance statement or imagined slight damaged the frail ego of one man and led to a lifetime hatred. Whatever the initial cause, the antagonism between Merek and Warrick is well known throughout the kingdoms, and you can now see some proof of it before your very eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" As you suspected, Merek doesn't appear eager to discuss Warrick or his kingdom. \"South of the Bower Mountains did you say? I wasn't aware any peace had been formed down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso well known throughout the kingdoms is the constant state of turmoil south of the Bower Mountains. Those lands are filled with numerous warring factions. No real kingdom has existed there for generations. Occasionally one group or another will temporarily come to power only to be quickly toppled by another. Therefore any news of which group is currently at the top of heap which reaches beyond the Bower Mountains is usually outdated as soon as it is heard, which makes it hard to contradict any stories coming out of those lands. \"My family has an older claim to the throne than any of the other factions, and most of these groups have accepted my fathers terms as beneficial to all. It has been a hard won peace, in fact my father is still negotiating with several smaller tribes in the lands, but we have finally found some stability. Unfortunately, we have not yet had the time to begin formally introducing this newly united kingdom to the rest of the world. Call us superstitious, but we did not want to tempt fate by announcing a peace which had not completely been assured yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" These explanations seem to satisfy King Merek, at least for now. \"Tell me, do you and your retinue have somewhere to stay in the city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came unaccompanied Your Majesty. I did not want to spare a single man from the peace efforts or the reconstruction after a recent flood damaged several villages. Realizing that I have arrived sooner than expected, I was hoping you might be able to recommend a fine establishment at which I could stay for the duration of my visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, you shall stay here in the castle. I would not dream of refusing you any hospitality, especially as you so generously chose to travel without even a single personal valet. Chambers will be prepared for you immediately.\" Merek rose from the desk and gestured you to stand as well. \"Now if you'll excuse me, I have another meeting. But if there is anything you need, just ask.\" As you escort your to the door and tells the footman to show you to your rooms, you can't help but smile at how well this meeting has gone according to plan.</span></div></div>",

Two days have past since you were invited to stay in the castle and this is has been the first chance you've had to get home and tell your family how the plan has been progressing. You were just telling Lilith about a brief meeting you'd had with Princess Lilith the day before when your parents came home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is all this shouting about?\" your mother asks as she places her bags of goods acquired at the marketplace (some of them even paid for).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your son is gradually obliterating any chance he has with the princess and any chance we have a stealing the ruby,\" Lilith explains with her own overdramatic flourish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When is the last time your succeeded in seducing anyone Lilith?\" you shoot back at her. \"I know what I'm doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough,\" your father interrupts and takes a seat. \"Why don't you tell us what happened, Lucas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday I saw Princess Lida go out into the gardens, so entered the gardens at the other end and nonchalantly made my way to her, making it appear as unplanned as possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You and Lida met each other politely enough, but it was a cold civility as you each stiffly bowed. Clearly she was not pleased to run into you today. \"Good afternoon Prince Roderick,\" Lida curtly greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Your Highness. Beautiful day,\" you offered with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I suppose it is,\" Lida replied, uncomfortably shifted from one foot the other and refusing to make eye contact. Courtesy appeared to be getting nowhere, so you decided to change tactics to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, perhaps you prefer Katie.\" Bingo. The indignation and embarrassment flashing across her eyes when her head snapped up to glare at you could not have been more apparent. People often underestimate the seductive power of an argument. All the greatest couples know how to argue and to make up. It may not be the most pleasant or romantic route, but anger is still a starting point. You can recover from an argument in love. Apathy, however, is often incurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy yourself yesterday? Did you enjoy making a fool of me? You obviously knew who I was, why didn't you say something sooner instead of letting me carry on like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do now think you are fool princess, and I sorry if I made you feel that way,\" you apologized. \"At first I had no intention of contradicting you. If you wanted me to believe you were a servant girl named Katie I was ready to play along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I know how it feels to want to be someone else and escape myself even for a little time. Regrettably I never seem to get the chance though; so why would I begrudge you the same opportunity I yearn for?\" you state matter-of-factly. Again you hit your desired target, for Lida's expression softens ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you break the illusion we were parting? We could have left each other that day on good terms, instead you chose to throw it in my face that you were cleverer than I and could not be tricked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, and there is exactly the attitude that caused me to change my mind. You you seemed far too happy and far too sure of your ability to trick me, as if I were some stupid, silly country prince. I sympathize with your desire for privacy, princess, but I do not appreciate being made a fool of anymore than you do,\" you answered, showing all due respect and all due indignation. Without giving her a chance to respond, you continued, \"Now if you'll excuse me your highness, I came out here to be alone with my thoughts and the beautiful scenery. And so I will bid you good day.\" With one final curt bow...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I walked away. And we haven't spoken since,\" you conclude. Your parents take a few moments to contemplate where this leaves the plan, while Lilith continues to seethe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see! She'll probably never talk to him again. It's over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Lilith,\" you exclaim, exasperated. \"You said so yourself. She doesn't like the idea of being forced to marry. I'm sure the other princes said and did all the right things to please her, but she is smart enough to have seen through that and resented them for it. You said to act as if I'm resistant to a political marriage just like her. Believe me, my <i>honesty</i> will be a welcome relief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Lilith, it's not what I would have done, but Lucas has a point,\" your father reasons. \"I agree,\" states your mother, \"No woman wants a lost little puppy of a man following her around unable to make a decision for himself. She wants an equal, or as close to an equal as any man can get to a woman.\" Your mother smirks and your father can't help but grin. Lilith has no choice but to accept your strategy even if she doesn't agree with it. Begrudgingly she admits there is some sense in what you say. \"Fine. So if you haven't been spending these past few days with princess, what have you been doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting to know the castle and especially the staff. If Lida asks any of them they will have nothing negative to say about me. And more importantly, if I get caught anywhere in the castle where I shouldn't be, I'll have fostered enough goodwill to convince them to look the other way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, it looks like you've got everything under control, son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be long now.\"</span></div></div>",

You were raised to be independent, but for someone who has never had to lift a finger but to point where one servant or another must go, he would be completely helpless if he suddenly found himself on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Quentyn is an earnest, if nervous, young man. Near as you can tell, he is about your age. He might even be a year or two older, but with the way he always hunches his shoulders, keeps his head lowered, and often squeaks instead of speaks, you may never know. It's a miracle he gets anything done considering how jumpy and fidgety he is, but, as surprising as it is, Quentyn is very good at his job. And he is a complete push over. You never have to worry about him crowding you. A kind word and a polite but firm suggestion that he take himself elsewhere is usually all it takes to get some alone time for you to get back to business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past few days have been quite productive. You have quickly learned the general layout of the grounds and may have found the weakest point in the castle's perimeter. The northwest corner is poorly lit, but more importantly, is the least well guarded. The kitchens occupy that corner of the building, specifically the ovens, which means there is one particular stretch of the wall with no windows. It also means that the guards who usually patrol this area often take extra special care to make sure the kitchen is secure. They are usually sure to taste test some of the food and drink to check for poison, and have even been known to check under the kitchenmaids' skirts for unwanted intruders. To your knowledge, none have yet been found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent most of the morning walking the grounds, double checking for weakness you may need to exploit when the time comes. By noon your stomach is demanding its midday meal, so you make your way to the kitchens. Quentyn brings breakfast to your quarters, but during the day you prefer to pick up food directly from the kitchens yourself. While it may not be what is expected of most princes, it is important for this prince to develop a rapport with the castle staff. Besides, you wouldn't have risked making it such a frequent habit if you hadn't seen Princess Lida taking a meal in the kitchen not long after your first meeting and subsequently learned that she often stops by the kitchen to pack a few snacks before her daily horse rides. You have not yet crossed paths with her in the kitchen, neither on purpose nor \"on accident\", but it is only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mertle, my flour, my plum,\" you sing as you step through the kitchen doors and see Mertle kneading away at a lump of bread dough. The first time you came to the kitchens, she chased you out. Even when she was told who you were she insisted that no interlopers would be allowed to disrupt her kitchen. That if you wanted anything to eat or drink you were to tell Quentyn, Quentyn would tell her, and she would have it made and sent right up. She spoke with such authority in commanding a prince without actually being impudent. You love her spirit, you have seen it many times in the poorer parts of town. But she had reached a mastery you have never seen before. Even the small glimpse of Mertle you got as you were being kicked out, was enough to tell you everything you needed to know about her. Reading people is your specialty. And you had no trouble reading her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day you marched right back into the kitchen, this time pushing Quentyn ahead of you. In a loud voice for all in the kitchen to hear, you told Quentyn what you wanted and he told Mertle. Mertle smiled, shook her head, prepared your food, and when you told Quentyn to tell Mertle thank you, she told Quentyn to \"quit that echo. I heard him, I'm not deaf you know.\" Then addressing you directly, she told you, \"You're welcome, m'lord. Would you like anything else?\" From then on you were warmly welcomed in Mertle's kitchen, with or without Quentyn. You had won over Mertle and a few of the other kitchen servants, but not all. Some were too wary to risk interaction with a prince; while some clearly resented your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday you enjoy a bowl of delicious, hot stew and a few quick words with Mertle as she works. You leave the kitchen with a stomach full of stew and pockets full of an apple, a few fresh biscuits, and a couple cookies. You saunter down a hallway in the east wing lined with portraits of Lida's ancestors. You walk with purpose to a very special door. There are many areas of the castle barred to you. Most you have managed to identity as the personal chambers of the king and queen and those of the princess. Others appear to be private council chambers where the king conducts business. Since you had arrived, you had seen little of the king or queen. They they seemed to be having several closed door meetings in these rooms with various advisors. Another locked and guarded door leads to dungeon cells. The door in front of you now, however, hides many secrets from you. While you ascertained the purpose of the other locked doors with ease, you can learn very little about what lies beyond this particular door. This can mean only one thing. Somewhere beyond this rectangle of wood, and any number of guards and other more sophisticated locks, hides what you have come to seek: the Dragon's Heart Ruby. You don't know how many guards, or chambers, or corridors, or locks block the path from where you stand to your prize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preston, I come bearing gifts,\" you announce as you approach the guard on duty and empty your pockets of their culinary treats. Preston is one of the very few guards assigned to watch this door in shifts. When you realized the importance of this out of the way door, you immediately set out to cozy up to each of the sentries guarding it. You visit each of them as often as can you can without rousing suspicion, and you make it a point to always bring them some choice snacks. Food has a wonderful way of bonding people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, m'lord,\" Preston mumbles through a mouthful of biscuit. \"These taste fresh out of the oven. Mertle never gives me the fresh stuff. Cold, stale biscuits just aren't the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the best for you Preston. You need your strength to guard this closet. Never know when someone will come barreling down that hallway demanding a broom,\" you quip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can't tell you what is through this door, sir,\" Preston apologized, \"Not for all the fresh biscuits and cookies in the kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now Preston, my curiosity is killing me. Not even a hint?\" Preston shakes his head no. You want to press further, but you are interrupted by the thundering feet of Quentyn running towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'lord,\" Quentyn pants. \"I've been looking... for you... all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a breath Quentyn,\" you advise. Preston, used to Quentyn's ways, munches away on the last cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sir,\" Quentyn apologizes. Doubled over he takes three increasingly less wheezy breaths. Once composed, he pulls a folded piece parchment from his pocket and hands it to you. \"A message for you. From King Merrek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurpised, you take the note, open it, and read it. \"I am formally invited to a meeting with His Majesty this evening,\" you read aloud. <i>What is this about,</i> you wonder.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I told Quentyn thank you for the message and dismissed him. By now I had memorized most of the castle and could maneuver through it as well as almost any servant. As I made my way to the throne room, I began to consider why the King Merek would need to see me so suddenly. The thought that my family's plan had been discovered appeared briefly, but I dismissed that notion. No one outside of my family knew of our mission, so that was unlikely. It was more likely that the King wished to discuss the reasons and details of why the \"King and Queen\" of Kearn wish to unite the two lands.<br>\r\n  I arrive in the throne room to find the King and Queen sitting in their thrones, with the Princess sitting beside her mother. From the look on the Princess's face, it is obvious that she is not pleased to be here.<br>\r\n  I approach their thrones and bow, rising only when King Merek addresses me.<br>\r\n  \"You may rise, Prince Roderick.\"<br>\r\n   \"Thank you your highness.\"<br>\r\n  \"From the letter that I received it would seem that your parents wish for you to wed my daughter. However, it was sparse on the details of why and said the prince would elaborate for us. So please do so.\"<br>\r\n  When the king had finished speaking I began to give the presentation my father and I prepared. \"Yes your Majesty. As I had said when we first met, the Bower mountains separate Kearn and Mideria. However the Miderians have started to make demands and have slowly started pushing into our lands. My father does not believe that the fact that these tribal attacks and the Miderian's push happen at the same time is a coincidence. Our spies also tell us that these tribes have traditionally supported and been supported by Mideria. My family and I know that it won't be long before Mideria tries something big. My father feels that such a solid alliance will be the only way to ensure the safety of my people.\"<br>\r\n  \"Indeed it would, but what would such a union do to help the people of our nation?\" the Queen asked.<br>\r\n  \"Ah, of course your Highness. It has been said that one of the main reasons that Kearn was in almost constant turmoil is that the land itself is rich. The flooding that damaged several villages is part of a seasonal flooding cycle. The odd thing is that this year the waters rose higher than usual. But anyway this seasonal flooding makes the soil quite fertile for crops and my people have over time developed ways to cope with the floods. Also because of the proximity to the Bower Mountains the people of Kearn have become good miners. The mountains are also quite rich in minerals and ores. The region is also covered in forests, which provides much lumber. This is all I discussed with my father though.\"<br>\r\n  \"These are all good reasons, but I have another question for you. This one is about you though. How do you feel about an arranged marriage?\"<br>\r\n  Hearing this question I look towards the Princess, who is now staring at me, waiting to hear my answer.<br>\r\n  Keeping up my act, I sigh just loud enough for all three to hear. I had not expected this question, but it was easy enough to come up on the spot. \"I do not like the idea of such a marriage, but my land and my people could very well be at stake here, and I will do everything I can to help.\"<br>\r\n  The King, Queen, and Princess all look at me for a second then look to the King as he says \"We must speak privately, then we shall return.\"<br>\r\n  With that said all three of them stood and walked into the Kings office, behind the thrones.</span></div></div>",

The three royals emerged from the office behind the thrones and sat back down. The princess had a smirk that only the most observant of people could see. I could only wonder what this meant for our plan.<br>\r\n  Once the king was seated he spoke,\"After some deliberation, it has been decided that we will agree to this proposal if you can pass the traditional Test of Passage. This is the test that every heir and ruler to be of this kingdom has to pass. It will not be easy and it takes place in the ruins to the north. Do you still want to undergo this?\"<br>\r\n  \"Yes sir, when do I depart?\" I said as I bowed.<br>\r\n  \"A carriage will bring you and a member of our court to observe and accompany you in the morning, so you have some time to rest and prepare.\" the Queen spoke for the first time.<br>\r\n  The king then said,\"Unless you have any questions, than that is all I needed to speak to you about.\"<br>\r\n  \"Thank you again your majesties, this means a lot to the people of my country.\" I said bowing.<br>\r\n  I hadn't taken five steps out of the throne room when Quentyn was upon me again. \"I have begun to pack a few things for the journey. The ruins are only a day away, but I will bring some extras as a precaution.\"<br>\r\n  \"Thank you, Quentyn. I think I'll take a walk around town to prepare myself.\"</span></div></div>",

The last thing I needed was for Quentyn or some guard sent to escort me to follow and see me climbing into the basement of a building. The place was empty for the moment, it was just past noon and my parents were likely getting food while Lilith was off doing who knows what. During our travels I started collecting swords of different styles from every land we visited. I also made it a point to try to learn local techniques as well. It was sort of a hobby of mine, and over time my collection has grown.<br>\r\n  I heard a door opening and closing, shortly followed by Lilith announcing her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'm in my room Lilith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"How goes your infiltration Prince Roderick?\" Lilith said as she entered with an overdramatic bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It's going well,\" I replied, although I was somewhat distracted as I searched cases and cabinets for a particular set of swords,\"Lilith, what did you do with my Kearnian set?\" Whenever a member of my family turns sixteen, they must perform a heist by themselves. This is done as a way to prove themselves.These swords were important to me because they were my target. I spent a long time planning that heist, and the execution was flawless. The only problem now is that Lilith takes great enjoyment in breaking into my room and hiding away the swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I took them to Roland to have them fixed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Have you been trying to slay some more walls?\" Lilith had a bad habit of using the blades recklessly when she took them. The most common accident was that she would chip the edges on a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What do you need them for anyway.\" Before I could explain to her of my meeting with the king, queen, and princess, our mother and father returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  My father spoke up first. \"Hello, we're home. Lilith, Lucas are either of you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes sir, we're in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  My mother and father entered the room and mother asked  \"Did Lilith steal your swords again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes ma'am and I need them for the job. The king, queen, and princess met with me in the throne room to discuss the details of this proposed marriage. They have agreed, so long as I pass the Test of Passage. They say it may be dangerous, so I thought I should bring my swords.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Did you give them the spill we went over?\" my dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yes sir and I think they bought it. I'm not sure about the princess though, they talked about it in the kings office privately. Her parents either convinced her and she reluctantly agreed on the condition that I passed the trial, or they are finally forcing her to marry someone and she suggested the trial as a way to try to get me killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I almost wish I could come see this. We have explored and cleaned out ancient tombs with ease. The trial will be nothing for you to clear.\" Lilith exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'm more worried about the person they send to observe me as I go through the trial. If who they send doesn't know how to stay out of the way or at least defend themselves then I'm gonna have to protect them too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Shouldn't be to bad, you've had to hold Lilith's hand through several dangerous situations.\" Mother joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I prefer to use wits to fight.\" Lilith replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Sometimes wits aren't as sharp as steel. Anyway, I need to go get my swords and return to the castle. A carriage will bring a member of the court and I to the ruins where the test is at.\" I told my parents and Lilith as I walked to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  I make my way to the blacksmith shop and ask to see Roland. He emerges from the back, swords already in hand.\"Lilith came to me this morning with them,\" he said as he handed them to me \"I got to work on them right away so they would be ready by the time someone came to get them. Tell your sister to stop trying to slay walls will ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'll tell her to stop stealing them first. Then we won't have this problem.\" I replied as I  inspected the long sword, then the short sword, and finally the dagger. \"Can I also get some throwing knives if you have any?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He took out several sets of small knives and after I hooked the swords and dagger to my belt, I dropped some gold on the counter and placed the knives in a side pouch. I thanked him and made my way to the castle just as the sun was setting. I hadn't been inside for more than a minute when Quentyn was upon me making sure I was tended to. I requested to have dinner brought to my room where I ate and turned in for the night.       </span></div></div>",
