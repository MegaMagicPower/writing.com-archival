They would either do something to the male or send them off into a distant place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when a female is pregnant and gives birth, it was thought that the baby would be a girl. For some reason Miyuki gave birth to a boy named Kiminari. A first they were either going to turn you into a girl, but since Miyuki was a witch you were born into a <i>male witch</i>. And the Transgender machine the school owned didn't work on you, nor did any spells by even the strongest witches work either. Then the next thought was sending you off to a remote place, but the head master thought it would be interesting if they raised you in the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was up to Miyuki if she wanted to keep you. If she didn't then you would have to be sent off (For the fact of being a male <i>witch</i>, you couldn't go to any of the remote place except for one place. A room isolated from anyone else until you died, since Miyuki was a high ranked witch. Killing you immediately wasn't an option) and you couldn't give a baby witch to another family. Miyuki couldn't live with the thought of abandoning her first child by themselves for there whole life, so she decided to keep you. </span></div></div>",

Unless, you mastered it to its final form, which you could cause more dangerous disasters then a tornado. However, no one in the school not even the strongest witches have found had discovered it for themselves, but there was a story about someone who mastered all elemental abilities and more.

The particular spell mis VonClair hastily cast is regrettably not going to be able to be broken before it becomes permanent. It can only be undone by the castor unfortunately her powers were temporarily taken away and even if we were to return them the process couldn't be done in time to undo your spell in short Alex you are now stuck as a girl for the rest of your life and by the looks of it just starting puberty. I suppose the male you was in that process too or the magic is really reflective of what would of been your life as a girl\"  explained the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose the headmistress will help us take care of her name change\" asked his/her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I believe you'd picked the name Alexis right? If so the headmistress should have most things in order for you all. Now we should leave her to rest\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the nurse shooed everyone out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way out Lillica spoke <br>\r\n\"Listen here you little brat I may owe you for the gender change but let's be clear we aren't friends and I'm 5 years your senior plus top of the food chain here so know your place cause when the time comes me and my friends will get even if you cross us further\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she left. The nurse re-entered.<br>\r\n\"Well then you must be curious about the clothes. Well that was a specific factor Lillica left out of her spell so I attempted to have your outfit match your personality. It would seem as tho the magic felt as though deep inside any girl versions of you would be slightly punk goth with a hint of tomboyishness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is really real then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so. I may not seem it but I do feel sorry for you.

A lot of people mistook you for a girl which you had become used to. Your parents were vastly wealthy though they never acted like it and raised you to be humble. They had sent you to some all boys boarding school so to get the best education money could buy. Only due to some clerical error somewhere in the process, you were mislabeled as a female and transferred to Berkly Transformation Academy. You did not realize the error until you had arrived at the school with your paperwork in hand. What made you more uncomfortable was that the school was heavily isolated in a deep forest out in the middle of nowhere. \"Well, this is an interesting development.\" Wrinkling your nose at the paperwork, you said. You sighed. \"I better get this straightened out right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked straight into the administrations office where you were seen by the head of administrations, Miss Carrol. She was a short but slender professionally dressed woman with long black hair and blue eyes. \"I'm afraid there is an error in my transfer papers, ma'am.\" Politely, you said. \"I'm really a boy.\" You offered your identification as proof of your claim. \"Is there a way I can be transferred to an all boy school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Carrol looked at your identification and the transfer papers before turning to you with a bemused look on her face. \"This is certainly an awkward situation you found yourself in... <i>Miss</i> Dore.\" Smiling, she said. You blushed at her little joke but she turned from you to talk to the other members of the administrations staff before you could utter a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"At least they are looking into the matter.\"</i> Sighing, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw some activity on the phones before a number of them shook their heads and Miss Carrol turned back to you. \"I am sorry but there is nothing we can do for you.\" Serious, she said. \"You are the last transfer student so the last ride out of here left after it dropped you off.\" She turned to her staff. \"Also the all boy schools in the area are booked solid so I'm afraid you are stuck here with us girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed deeply at that as you heard a number of giggles from the staff. \"How am I going to fit in an all girls school?\" Taken back, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you certainly look the part.\" Bemused, Miss Carrol said. She then turned serious seeing you beginning to tear up. \"Now, now, this school does welcome boys though it is rare. Just be yourself as everything will work out fine in the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Carrol then handed you a number of papers with the school rules, a hall and classroom map, and a voucher to pick up your school uniforms before sending you to the school store. \"This is not how I expected my new found freedom to feel like.\" Blushing, you muttered. \"This is going to be an awkward year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take you long to find the school store though, upon walking in, you found...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You gave a short shrill scream as your clothing literally pulled themselves off of you and a roll of measuring tape floated into the room. Unable to resist, you were quickly measured and a number of girls clothing flew into the room and forced themselves onto you. This included panties, a bra, and the school uniform consisting of a dark blue pleated skirt, ivory colored blouse, and dark blue sleeveless jacket with a pink ribbon bow tie. White knee high socks were added with mary-jane flats before you were released by the invisible force and the door to the changing room opened for you. By the time you found the courage to step out, you found Grace smiling at you, blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not realize you were a boy.\" Grinning, she said. \"How embarrassing.\" She giggled, making you blush more than you already were. \"You are really cute for a boy. Don't be surprised if your life changes soon after your first class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Wincing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace looked at you surprised. \"You don't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know what?\" Confused, you asked. \"I was sent here due to a clerical error and I have to stay because all of the boy boarding schools are booked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace giggled further, making you worry. \"Well, the girls here tend to try to get cute boys like yourself to 'come out of their shell'.\" Cryptically, she said. \"Don't be too surprised if they try to make you more feminine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes at that as Grace then handed you a few more sets of uniforms and the school swimsuit, made for girls of course. Once you had everything you needed, you followed the map you got from administrations to your dorm. It was rather spacious with room for four students. \"Cozy little place.\" Smiling slightly, you said. \"I hope my dorm mates don't mind sharing a space with a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found the bed with your name on a plaque hanging from the headboard and began to unpack.

Though you did not understand why. \"Do you feel that radiating from him, Adey?\" Curious, the first girl asked. \"How strange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel it, Lena.\" Raising an eyebrow, the second girl said She turned to the third girl. \"What do you make of it, Lila?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned from Adey to Lena, wondering what they were talking about. Both were slender with brown hair and green eyes only Adey was rather tall while Lena was rather short, you guessed they were sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a familiar.\" Serious, the third girl, Lila said. \"Only by his obviously confused expression, he has no clue.\" She shook her head, a bemused look forming upon her face. \"I am guessing he is a first born, Zeva. What are we to do with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I concur.\" Softly, the fourth girl said. \"Other covens in the school are bound to sense this the moment they lay eyes on him.\" She sighed at your increasing uneasy expression. \"Worse, he is an unknown. The laws are very clear on that point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned between Lila and Zeva, feeling anxious. You wanted to run but something was holding you where you sat. Lila was about your height with doll like features, blond hair and blue eyes. Zeva was slightly taller than you, muscular, with long black hair and blue eyes. It was unnerving how they all began to talk to each other about you as if you were not in the room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... What are you guys talking about?\" Nervous, you squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls stopped talking among themselves and returned their focus on you. \"Do you sense anything strange when near us?\" Serious, Zeva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of get the feeling you are all powerful.\" Wincing, you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeva grunted. \"What brings you to this school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A clerical error.\" Frowning, you answered. \"I was supposed to go to an all boys boarding school but i got sent here by mistake and all the boys schools are booked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeva shook her head. \"A clerical error may have brought you here but that's not why administrations kept you here.\" Darkly, she said. \"You are a familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a what?\" Confused, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila sighed. \"A familiar is usually a cat or a crow with unimaginable magical power.\" Serious, she explained. \"These animals, although can never work magic, can grant some or all of it to a magical individual and or her coven to increase their power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a familiar to be human is rare, for that human to be a boy is extremely rare.\" Jumping in, Zeva said. \"You, Cire, are quite literally one in a billion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone in administrations was a magic woman, they may already be plotting to take you under her wing.\" Wincing, Adey said. \"I say we permanently transform him into a girl so no one can steal her magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the rush, we can change him at any time.\" Softly, Lena argued. \"We can all gain from a boost in our powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too risky.\" Serious, Lila said. \"Even now, I fear word of Cire's talent is spreading like wild fire among the other magic girls on campus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls turned to Zeva to be the tie breaker in their discussion, making you even more frightened and nervous. \"Don't I get a say in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not.\" Firmly, Zeva said. \"You have no clue what you are capable of and that can be dangerous. Worse, from what we have gathered, you are a first in your bloodline which means we have no way of knowing how powerful you truly are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls then continued to talk for what seemed like hours before they apparently came to an agreement and turned to you. \"Welcome to our coven, Cire.\" Smiling, Zeva said. \"We are proud to have you among us as...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Berkly Transformation Academy For Girl's is not your typical ALL GIRL's school. This mysterious school has a mysterious secret as well as problem with the male population but that doesn't last long for you see tends have changes occur. Sometimes some of the students experience the occasional minor AP AR BE GTS Growth or Transform into Neko's , Kitsune's , Wolf Girl's or Poke Morphs and in rare cases can become randomly mysteriously pregnant without the help of a partner. In the case of Faculty they sometimes experience AR in addition to what the students can experience.  This can be caused by various supernatural phenomena that seems attracted to the school, science experiments gone wrong or spells gone awry in the magic lessons given to witches and magical girls that attend the school. As amazing as that is though the school has a reputation among  students and faculty for what inevitably happens to ANY AND ALL Males who trespass , come on campus without faculty permission or stay on campus too long/Overstay their welcome. You see 98% Of males who come here are TG'd by one cause or another for whatever reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommon causes can  include but aren't limited to:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Witches or Magical Girl's casting spells on them as a result of embarrassment, anger/revenge, if they are an Intruder or peeping tom, and in some cases some just do it as a prank or to be mischievous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Accidental ( Or Forced ) ingesting of a potion belonging to one of the Witches or Magical Girls or a concoction made for science class. No one is sure why but the males entering the campus grounds seem severely prone to bad luck whilst on campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Science related accidents if visiting the science department such as lasers misfiring or an explosive side effect of mixing stuff.  Again caused by bad luck though in some cases males have been foolish enough to volunteer to assist or help test things most notably in science fairs or similar school activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. A Foolish wish. Yes wishes made on campus grounds actually have a bad habit of coming true depending upon the wish and the wish Maker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Lastly paranormal causes. Yes you see the campus is haunted but oddly the ghosts are friendly to the girls acting out only against males. so far to date incidences include: Female ghosts possessing males then turning them female, Ghosts swapping drinks with TG Potions or formulas , Ghosts making magical girls cast spells on males (Explained in rules below ) , Ghosts using physic powers to cause lasers to misfire and whatnot. Also included under the paranormal is the rare but ignored ocurrance of actual alien visits to the school.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow despite this males foolishly come. Most commonly its kids and teenagers sneaking in on dares or trying to peep or hit on girls though there have been the occasional cases of a Girls boyfriend not heeding their girlfriends warnings when visiting thus ending up female. Not surprisingly this and other factors have led to some students being lesbians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then the campus is a huge expanse that could be considered a small city or town in its own right consisting of 37 large buildings.
