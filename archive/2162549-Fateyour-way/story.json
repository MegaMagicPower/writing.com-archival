They were about to go on climax fight until some interference came along. The man grunted and ordered lancer to pull back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI guess this is even for now. We\u2019ll fight another day.\u201d Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He and lancer then left the scene while the female looked at the interference. It was a teenager and he looked at the caster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWow, why does he have an lion head!?\u201d Teen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHe\u2019s..special.

You two went in, took a seat and looked at the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSame thing as yours master.\u201d Berserker replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and called the waitress.
