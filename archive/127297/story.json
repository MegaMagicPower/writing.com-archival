But as Lari sat in her car in the middle of another normal day, in a normal city, she realized that this day was the end of her normal life.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe turned the rearview mirror towards her face and looked at herself.  \"I have cancer. I have no insurance.  I have no money, and no family,\" she said out loud.  \"Now what?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe had just come from the doctor's office, where the doctor had given her the bad news.  She was supposed to go back to the doctor tomorrow, but she knew she would not.  In her heart, she knew this was something big, lifechanging, and unalterable.  Finally, she fixed the mirror in place and started the car. Without looking in the mirror, she entered traffic.  A car whizzed by her, honking loudly.  Sticking her head out the window, she screamed \"Fuck YOU!!!!\"  An amazing sense of freedom suddenly overtook her, and she drove home without care of who she pissed off.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nHer life was just beginning.  </span></div></div>",

Traffic was hell, but when you change lanes often, give the finger and scream at people, they get scared and generally stay out of your way.  Her best friend, Kat, worked late nights as a bartender in a swanky downtown nightclub. At 2:00 in the afternoon, she was probably sleeping. Lari woke her up with a few carefully thrown pebbles at Kat's window.  She was rewarded when Kat's head appeared and she shouted \"What the hell is it Lari! I'm sleeping!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It's an emergency!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nKat regarded her for a moment, noted the frantic look on Lari's face, and disappeared from the window.  Lari ran around to catch the door buzzer, and met Kat halfway up the stairs. \"What is it?\" asked Kat.  Lari started laughing hysterically, before collapsing in the hallway in tears.  Kat had to physically pick Lari up, and help her to the apartment.  The story came out in teary bursts. \"I've got, brain, in my head, it's cancer, and untreatable, six months at the most, no insurance, and I don't even want to go through chemo anyway!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Ok, you're hysterical, Lari, of course you want treatment, and as for insurance, well, I'll help out, we'll ask friends, family, I'll take up a collection at work, drunk people give money to anything-\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No,\" said Lari, suddenly serious and calm, \"no, this is it, I'm finally free. Don't you get it? No more school loans, no more credit card payments, nothing.  I can do anything I damn well please, the worst that can happen is getting put in jail, but so what? Risking a few months in jail will be worth it.\"</span></div></div>",

She went shopping, stopping at a gun store, a mask store, and the library.  She needed information on the best way to go about robbing a bank. Sure enough, the library was a fountain of information.  With that pesky \"cooling off\" period before buying a gun, she had plenty of time to research her plan.  It would be nice to have co-conspirators, but she didn't know anyone she could trust, and she didn't exactly have ties to criminals.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIn a few weeks, she decked herself out in a small arsenal of weopons. Knives, stun guns, mace, an AK-47 and a few pistols, all strapped to her body.  She clothed herself in loose fitting clothes to hide her figure.  Posing as a man would get her the most respect, and would be a great disguise.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLari was set for her heist.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lari decided to rob the bank on a Tuesday morning.  It was Friday, leaving her a few days to practice her role as a man. She put the ski mask on over her head, and surveyed the world from the narrow slots allowed by the mask. She checked herself out in the bathroom mirror.  Her pale blue eyes gazed back, revealing their femininity.  Quickly, she found her sunglasses, and tried them on beneath the mask.  It took her a few moments for her eyes to adjust to the light.  Walking around the apartment, she decided she had to do something about her eyes.  She could waste precious moments, not seeing clearly enough in the bank.  She had to go to the mall anyway, to buy some baggy black pants and some shirts to bulk up and hide her slim figure.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHer first stop was the eyeglass store.  They insisted on performing an eye exam before ordering colored contact lenses.  The woman seemed confused when Lari told her she wanted dark brown contacts.  \"But you have such beautiful eyes,\" she said, \"People ask us for contacts the color of those baby blues of yours.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"When will they be ready?\" asked Lari.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, your eye exam checked out, so the contacts will be ready for you Monday morning.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHer next stop was an inexpensive hair stylist. She asked for a pixie hair cut, and had her ash blonde hair dyed dark brown.  Finally, she went to a used clothing store, where she found gloves, a few shirts, and the baggy black pants she was looking for. As she got out of the car at her apartment, she heard saw someone running up to her.  It was Kat.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Lari, I've been looking all over for you.  Look, I took up a collection at work last night, and we made you $300 dollars. Please, just go to the doctor,\" she pleaded. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It's too late, Kat, I've made up my mind.  Want to hear my plan?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n--------\r<br>\n\"So you're just going to waltz into a bank Tuesday morning, weilding a gun, posing as a man, in a ski mask, and you really think they're going to just hand over a million dollars?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Sure.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"By yourself.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Sure.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It will never work. You need backup.  Haven't you ever seen Bonnie and Clyde?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah, they went down in a hail of bullets.  Beats dying in a sterile hospital bed.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You really think so, don't you?\" asked Kat.  Lari nodded solemnly.  \"You've thought about this?\"  Again, Lari nodded.  \"I'd never forgive myself if you went down in a hail of bullets, kiddo.  So what bank were you thinking about?\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Most cops don't even bother trying that hard to find bank robbers, especially if you only do it once or twice.  The stolen money is insured anyway, so the bank can afford a few robberies. Here's what we're going to do. I'll go in first, ask for change, ask a few other questions, distract the other teller long enough for you to do the actual robbing. I can also keep an eye out for cops and other suspicious behavior.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLari looked excited. \"Let's do it tomorrow, Kat!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Ok, tomorrow morning, at that same bank you've been scoping out. What times of the day are they slow for business?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, they open at 8:00.  They get a little rush of people stopping in before work, and then between 9:30 and 10:00 they are pretty slow.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"9:30 it is,\" said Kat.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe next morning found them at the bank.  Kat entered the bank wearing a tight red dress and a wide brimmed straw hat.  She kept her head tilted down to minimize the amount of her face the wall mounted cameras could catch. There were two tellers on duty -one young, blonde, stylishly dressed female, and one older male, probably the manager on duty. There was only one customer in the bank, an older woman filling out a deposit slip.  Kat went directly to the male teller, flashing him her brightest smile.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Good morning! Pretty slow in here today, I know how boring that can be, I used to work at a really slow flower shop, the kind of place where you just pray for customers to walk in just to give you something to do!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA moment later, Lari walked in.  After deciding she wouldn't actually be able to pull of looking like a genuine boy, she would at least be able to dress like a bull dyke.  She had found a black wig, and put a baseball cap on over it, and baggy pants with a tight white tank top and no bra. The old woman looked ready to approach the female teller. Lari quickly but casually cut the woman off and put her bag on the counter. She put her hand in the bag and left it there. With her other hand, she slipped a note to the teller. It said:\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHello, this is a robbery. Stay calm. Put all the money in your register into the paper sack you are about to be given.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe girl looked at Lari calmly.  \"Are you serious?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"If I have to take the gun out of this bag, I'm going to shoot your fucking head off, bitch,\" said Lari in her deepest voice. She handed the girl the paper bag.  Looking over at Kat, she could see the male bank teller looked transfixed. The female bank teller was looking that way, too, hesitating about what to do.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Keep your eyes down,\" said Lari, \"you have 30 seconds before I lose my fucking temper.\"  Agitated, she moved her hand in the bag, as though she really wanted to pull the gun out.  Slowly, the teller stared pulling money from the register. A stack of ones first, then the fives, then the tens, then the twenties, fifties, and finally the hundreds. Not too much, maybe a couple thousand, enough to get them out of town. The teller slid the paper sack across the counter. Lari grabbed it and stuffed it in her bag. She turned and walked out.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nKat giggled loudly and said, \"Well, this has been fun, I'll think about that savings plan, in the meantime, I do have to get to work!\" Lari was waiting in the car outside the bank. They sped off.</span></div></div>",

She crept toward the wall and had her back against it, peeping cautiously at the bank to monitor its current situation. After all, that's what the book said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  There was an old security guard pacing back and forth the main entrance of the bank. Lari searched her knapsack and took the wood and set it on fire, then, throwing it away from the bank. There, as easy as pie. The security guard chased the  moving objects, frantically trying to put out the flames. Just as the book had predicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lari knelt and crawled towards the main entrance. As she reached, her handphone rang loudly, grabbing the security guard's attention. The security guard had the flames melted down by then. He swerved around and squinted, trying to spot Lari in her black suit against the poorly lit entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Stop whoever you are!\" the guard warned. His voice sounded weak. His movements were slow as he approached towards the camouflaged figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Well, Lari thought, smiling. I don't think he is a problem to me at all.

She avoided his hands and kicked his leg. The old guard fell over, face first, groaning in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lari stood over the guard in triumph when she suddenly felt a piercing pain in her head. Her body grew weak and she shut her eyes, raising her hands against her temples. She opened her eyes again and saw that her vision was blurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The security guard was standing up by then and he was shouting. However, Lari couldn't hear what he said.

Well, why don't you take me out to that car, and we'll see what's in the car.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nStill holding her around the neck, the man, (she saw that another man was holding Kat in the same manner) marched them out of the house and down the road.  Lari tried to speak to him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We don't have any weapons - you can check! Wouldn't cops have guns and stuff?\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Shut up.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It's not very neighborly of you to not help someone with a broken down car. We just wanted to use your phone, and then we would have left!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Shut up.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It looked like a fun party, I love Metallica as much as the next person! We could have partied with you!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You're a smart ass, you know that?\" he said finally, \"You got a death wish?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey had arrived at the jeep.  The man holding Lari told the other man to \"grab her and don't let go.\"  He held her around the wrist tightly while the other man searched the jeep with a flashlight. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"See? Nothing,\" said Lari. \"Now are you going to help us or what?\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Kat rushed to her side and held her, whispering soothing words. \"It'll be alright, Lari, I'll get some aspirin, hold on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the sink and poured a glass of water, and grabbed the bottle of ibuprofin from the cabinet.  Lari was still crumpled into a little ball on the floor, holding her head in her hands.  When Kat approached, she snatched the ibuprofin out of her hands.  Lari wrenched the top off, dumped the tablets onto the floor, and picked up a handful. She swallowed them, drinking thirstily from the glass of water.  She continued rocking on the floor for awhile, until the migraine eased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still there, like a throbbing thing in my head,\" she explained quietly, \"but I think I can move now.

He worked in a downtown office building to make money, but longed to spend all of his spare time in the woods.  He loved Kat, and thought of Lari as a little sister.  They often spent entire weekends together, hiking, camping, and canoeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got home, he saw Kat sitting quietly at the dining room table, contemplating an empty bottle of beer.  The apartment was silent, no lights were turned on.  \"What's wrong?\" he asked immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed some papers toward him.  \"It's Lari.

I made her some tea with valerian.

A peace fell like a blanket around her as she realized that she was not alone in this, she would have someone to help her in her struggle.  But her struggle would not be spent throwing up in metal tins as her hair fell out in clumps into her own vomit.  No, she had a choice. And her choice was to live on her own terms and to feel like she made a dent in this world with her small existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes again and focused on the pain, pinpointing exactly where it was coming from.  And Lari welcomed it.  The tumor was hers and hers alone; too deep to be cut out, too big to risk killing off her soul with chemo-- but it had enough presence to make her change her life.  And maybe someone else's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see,\" she said, her blue eyes shining with pain and excitement, \"This is how I would sum up my life: my whole life has been like laying in a hospital waiting room.  Waiting for someone else to tell me how to live my life.  Waiting for the inevitable diagnosis that will change everything. And now it has.  And now I have to choose between fixing my brain, or fixing my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat didn't understand the excitement in her friend's eyes.  She saw that her friend was giving up, and, dammit, she didn't want to watch her die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's got to be something you can do!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, George groaned.  \"Oh, Christ, Lari, did you even get a second opinion?\"</span></div></div>",

Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the shocked Lari by the arm, Kat followed George from the apartment out to the Jeep. They sped to a nearby hospital in grim silence, each wrapped up their own thougths. Kat vowed to wring the scrawny neck of the original doctor if this brain tumor diagnosis proved to be false.  George tried to think about what other diseases could be mistaken for a brain tumor, but since he was just a computer technician, he could only think that maybe she was spending too much time in front of the computer, or maybe it was allergies. Lari made a vow with God, or Buddha, or Vishnu, or Allah, or whoever was listening, that if the diagnosis was false, she would change her life.  She would devote her life to helping children, or animals, or the elderly, or the poor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally pulled up at the hospital, they rushed out of the Jeep and fled to the front desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please page Dr. Phillips?\" gasped George to the astonished receptionist, \"It's an emergency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes, a small, round doctor in a white coat, with a jelly doughnut in his hand, calmly turned a corner and walked up to them.

Stuffing the rest of the doughnut in his mouth, he took the file and walked over to the receptionist's counter. He laid out the papers methodically, and began to read each one. He held up the x-rays to the light.  After a few minutes, he grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here,\" he said gravely, \"Let me show you something.\"</span></div></div>",

She worked fervently, knowing that if she stopped for one moment, she would reconsider her options.  Right now, she knew that what she really wanted was to dump the apartment, sell the stuff that was worth anything and store the rest at a mini storage.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe worked all night.  There wasn't that much.  She had three piles: \r<br>\nthe stuff to sell: her bike, her futon, her TV/VCR/CD player, about a hundred CDs she wouldn't take with her, a microwave\r<br>\nStorage: Her books, personal items like worthless jewelry and semi-family heirlooms, a few shelves and small tables.  \r<br>\nStuff to take with: a backpack and a suitcase.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAt 6:00 the next morning, she ran out to rent a U-Haul. She loaded the truck with her stuff to store first.  When this was done, she sent the key with a letter to her mother. Pawning her stuff took a little longer.  She only made about $500.00 on her stuff, but the pawnshop guy paid an additional $3,000.00 cash for her 3-year-old Honda Civic.  If she hadn't been in a hurry, she could have gotten $10,000 for it.  But she took the money gratefully.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nBy 7:00 that evening, she was finally exhausted. She slept on some clothes in her apartment, and woke at dawn the next day.

She eagerly watched the show, and drank her second beer.  The plane to New York wouldn't depart for another two hours, and then she would have to wait six hours at LaGuardia.  Plenty of time to get souced. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAt the table to her right, an old man sat alone eating a pot roast with vegetables. Lari leaned over and said, \"That looks good, how is the food here?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe looked at her slowly. \"The food is good, but the beer is better.\" Then he did something that surprised Lari.  He reached into his bag, and took out a small white envelope. He set it on the table, looked at her meaningfully, and went back to eating his potroast. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nLari eyed it a moment, then motioned to the waiter.  \"I'll have what he's having,\" she said. While she was starting her dinner, the old man finished his.  He looked at her strangely as he gathered his things together, then he picked up the envelope. He started to put it in his bag, but then fumbled with it and dropped it near her chair.  He whispered, \"Look, kid, take the envelope and give it to Jacques. He'll find you on the plane.  Don't forget to wear the red hat.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSuddenly, they were both distracted by a commotion in the kitchen.  There was a loud clattering of dishes, and a young Mexican dishwasher ran out the swinging doors, followed by a fat red-faced chef. \"Out, out!\" yelled the chef, throwing a towel at the young dishwasher.  Lari laughed and looked back at the old man.  He was gone, but the envelope was sticking out of her bag.  Standing, she looked around for him, but the airport was swarming with busy travelers.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe sat down, suddenly self-conscious. \"I feel like I'm in a spy novel.  This is so surreal,\" she thought to herself.  However, she finished her meal, not quite sure what to do with the envelope.  But when she finished her food, she discovered it was almost time to catch her plane.  On the way down the terminal, she spotted a shop selling sports momentos, including a rack of red baseball caps.  For some reason, she found herself in the store, trying one on, and then purchasing it.  Lari walked out of the store wearing the red cap, smiling to herself. \"As if Jacques was going to be on the 2:15 plane to LaGuardia.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs she settled into the window seat, a hansome man sat down in the seat next to her, smiling.

The other side of the bag held hand written scientific journals.  The first journal caught her attention.  It read: \u201cDoctorate thesis in terahertz study of transient excitons for stealth lasers\u201d by Dr. Chase Allions.  She flipped through the pages and saw nothing but a million formulae, technical diagrams, graphs and scientific mumbo jumbo that was way beyond her comprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a voice recorder with a micor-tape in it.

Jeanette stood up and gently took Lari's elbow, guiding her to the front of the plane. \"Well, we have a problem, honey. He's as dead as a doornail, but we don't have any other seats available.

He hadn't been murdered!\r<br>\n\r<br>\nRelieved, she turned back to the window. Then she had an interesting thought. What if she took the envelope?  She would have plenty of opportunity to inspect its contents at LaGuardia. But maybe she should just leave all this behind, and concentrate on relaxing and enjoying her trip.

The man with the striking blue eyes was the youngest, in his early twenties. Another one was older, maybe about 30 and had blond hair, but Lari determined that it was a color job, and that he probably had quite dark hair, as his eyebrows were very dark and he had somewhat of a Mediterranian look about him. The other two were in their 30s, and stood very calmly in the aisle keeping an eye on the passengers and on the cock pit door. They both had dark hair and were quite pale. Lari thought they both looked like computer programmers, with their thin intelligent faces, and lack of exposure to the sun. She also thought they might be brothers. All four men wore black from head to foot; black t-shirts, black pants, and black combat boots. She could only assume that at least two other men had stormed the cockpit already, although she did not feel any changes in the way the plane was flying - no sudden shift in altitude or direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other passengers all looked terrified. It was not a huge plane, the flight was not full, and thus there were only about 30 people on board, and they were spread out, many people had rows of seats to themselves.  It was easy for the high jackers to ensure that nobody spoke to anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a commotion at the back of the plane as the flight crew all emerged from the rear compartment, hands raised, the high jacker with the blue eyes motioning them forward with a very menacing looking gun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how they got those guns on board,\" whispered the woman next to Lari. \"After 9-11...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off by the loudspeaker crackling, and soon the pilot's voice was heard, \"This is your captain speaking. Don't panic. We will be landing in Iceland shortly and you will be getting on with your lives. However, we will not be landing in Rekyavik, we will be landing in another city, one that is more friendly to our ... um ...\" There was a thud, and his voice was cut off. A voice with a German accent said, \"We are not suicide bombers, so you do not have to fear for your lives. There is simply a matter of some cargo on board that rightfully belongs to us.  Now everyone, please cooperate. Put your head down between your legs, don't speak, and we will arrive at our destination in a little less than an hour.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Staring at the floor of the plane as the hijackers instructed, Lari thought about what the German had just said over the intercom. Something about valuable cargo.  Naturally, the only way to get planes on an airplane would be if the airport workers helped somehow. The people who load the plane, or the security workers themselves, would all have an easier time of getting weapons on board.  Maybe they were paid off by the hijackers, or maybe they planted people in the airport months or years ago, just waiting for an assignment like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLari's musings were interrupted by a tap on the shoulder. Looking up, she saw the piercing blue eyes of the good-looking hijacker.  \"Come with me,\" he said, not unkindly, motioning with his head towards the back of the plane. Not seeing any other choice, as he held a very large, very menacing gun, Lari stood up, wobbling slightly out of nervousness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door closed behind them, she smiled bravely at him and said, \"It's good to stand again after sitting for four hours. I wish you'd let the other passengers stretch a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the shit,\" he sneered, leaning in close, \"Who the hell are you? Traveling alone, good looking woman, nice suit, smart attitude... CIA? FBI? I should kill you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLari suddenly realized that her six months to live could very well be quickly reduced to six seconds. \"I'm not, not CIA or FBI or anything. I'm nothing.  Just a smartass.  My wallet is in my purse, under my seat. Go get it, you can look through all my stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what the fuck are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a student, I write for a college newspaper, that's why I have the smart attitude. As for the traveling alone and the nice suit, well, I'd like to get an internship for a travel magazine, but I need to work on my portfolio. Iceland seemed like a unique place to write about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the lies tumbled from her mouth effortlessly and surprisingly sincerely, the blue eyed hijacker searched her face intently.  Suddenly, he punched open the nearby door and one of the other hijackers entered.  Blue Eyes said, \"Go get J. Tell him to bring me whatever is under seat A, Row 13.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burly hijacker left with a grunt.  Blue Eyes moved closed to Lari, shouldering his gun by its strap. \"Fold your hands behind your head,\" he said quietly, \"I'm going to check you for listening or tracking devices. If you move, I'll snap your pretty little neck like a twig.\" Slowly, thoroughly, his hands began moving over her body, starting with her hair, behind her ears, moving down to her neck, shoulders, down her back to her legs, and then up again. All the time, his eyes gazed at her.  Finally, he said, \"Take off your shoes.\"  After scrutinizing her black pumps and squeezing their insides, he handed them back to her. Just then, the burly hi jacker entered, gripping Lari's bag in his big glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your gun pointed at her,\" said Blue Eyes while he dumped the contents of Lari's bag on the floor. Kneeling down, he picked up her spiral bound journal and paged through. \"That's personal,\" said Lari heatedly.  The burly man with the gun grunted menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that,\" said Blue Eyes, \"I'm going to peek at your last entry though.  'The plane is about to take off for Iceland. I hate flying, so I'm going to write about my fellow passengers.  There is a woman sitting next to me with a little boy. I wonder where his father is...' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trailed off and skimmed over the next few pages, then looked at Lari.  \"Well, it doesn't sound like something an agent would write.\"  He carefully sorted through the other things in the bag, the make up bag, water bottle, granola bars, chocolate, headset and music tapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he said something unexpected.</span></div></div>",

During her adventures on the freeway, she cut people off, changed lanes without using her blinker, randomly sped up and then slowed down suddenly, rode people's asses, screamed, and gave the finger to about 25 different individuals.  She felt very tired.  Acting like people she hated took a lot out of her.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhen she woke up, she sat groggily looking out living room window at the dismal view of an alley.  Nothing moved in the early evening light.  \"Everything looks beautiful in this light,\" she thought.  She had hoped for a mystical dream that would tell her what to do and where to go, but that dream had not occurred.  Her sleep had been deep and unsatisfying.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs her thoughts moved from the alley to her stomach, she decided that the experiment in being someone else had not made her feel better.  She was not an asshole.  She would not live the next six months pissing people off and eating nothing but doughnuts.  Just because she would not seek treatment for her condition, did not mean she would change her whole personality.  As she crunched some carrots, and perused her foodstocks, she thought about the things she most cared about.  Music, art, reading, nature.  Halfway through her college career, she had discovered the exquisite pleasure of sitting in a forest and listening to the awesome rush of wind in the leaves, or the equally awesome silence of a dark woods.  Unable to concentrate on her business degree, she had dropped out of school and found work at a temp agency.  That was a year ago.  All her money went towards paying off her school debt, her car loan, rent, and escaping from the city on the weekends, and any other chance she got.  She had few friends, and did not date.  Her only companion was her cat, Demeter.  Her non-nature time was spent reading about nature - birds, flowers, soil, grasses, forests, mountains, field guides, and nature magazines.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nWaiting for her soup to boil, she thumbed through one of these magazines.  There was a blurb near the back that she had somehow missed, and she read it now.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Homes Destroyed by Eco-Terrorists\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nLong Island, NY - Officials suspect a group of eco-terrorists known as Save the World for the destruction of three houses on Long Island.  The uncompleted houses were part of a housing development that the group opposes.  No people were harmed in the attack.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I can't save myself, Demeter,\" she told her cat, scratching Demeter behind the ears.  \"But I'm not dead yet.\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

She chose west, with a vague idea of going to the mid size California town of El Oro, the supposed center of an environmental/anarchist group.  This group had been involved in a number of demonstrations all along the Pacific Coast. Their spokesman, a soft spoken writer, lived in El Oro, and regularly met with anyone who had any interest in talking about the movement.

You have to call my mom, and let her into my apartment. I'll try to send money to get out of my lease, but this is very important, she needs to move my stuff out of my apartment.  Get a pen, here's her number. Oh! And you have to feed Demeter!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA few moments later, Lari looked out of the phone booth and saw Johann looking around the terminal for her.  She quickly got rid of Tori by saying that she had met a rich man who had swept her off her feet and didn't have time to talk.  Tori seemed to understand immediately, she always acted like she knew exactly what people meant when it came to matters of the heart, as if she had done and experienced it all. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhen Johann turned away, Lari ran up to him breathlessly, and explained that she had been in the restroom.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hmm, yeah, well, Orlando says we can get on the runway in 15 minutes.  Do you need anything before we go? Dramamine, valium, whiskey?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSuddenly, Lari realized that she hated flying. She never had claustrophobia on the ground, but as soon as she was locked into that tiny cabin with no chance of escape, she freaked.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What is that green color in your face?\" asked Johann, \"Ohhh, you don't like flying!\" He laughed as if this was the funniest thing he had ever heard. \"Don't worry, you won't even know you are flying on my plane. We have many diversions on it,\" he said conspiratorially, putting his arm reassuringly around her waist, and leading her through the airport.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs she stepped onto the plane, she understood what Johann meant. The plane looked like a low-ceilinged living room, with tasteful leather chairs scattered about, a big screen television nook, a full bar, and even a computer.  Johann went directly to the television nook and threw himself casually onto the low couch.  A woman suddenly brushed around Lari and went to the bar.  \"Your usual, Mr. Brehm?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yes, Kelly, and make the same for my new friend, the very airplane scared Ms.... what is your last name, Lari?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLari settled herself on the couch by Johann and guzzled her whiskey.  She immediately felt better. \"You can call me Ms. Scarlet, Kelly.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohann put his arms around her and whispered, \"No fear, the flight will be over in no time.  Until then, Kelly will you excuse us for the rest of the flight?\"</span></div></div>",

In fact, my wife would probably take me directly to the hospital and check me in, kicking and screaming.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLari shot him a hurt look.  \"I thought you were hitting on me,\" she said defensively.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Did you want someone to hit on you?\" he asked. \"Or maybe you just need to get laid.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Look, I didn't come here to get insulted,\" said Lari, standing up.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No, that came out wrong, please sit,\" said Thor, \"what I meant to say was maybe you need to meet some people, maybe you're just lonely and need some compassion.  Sex is just the easiest, fastest way to get satisfaction.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLari nodded. \"You're right.  I'm just screwed up.

Unfortunately, he had a girlfriend at the time, and so they never went out. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nLari remembered she was supposed to be talking to Thor, and she said, \"I see someone I know. Maybe I'll do the portrait thing some other time.

Too much of a conversation drain.  \"Let's just say I've got a new perspective on life.  Live for the moment, who knows when the ax could drop, right?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Carpe diem,\" said Trent, \"So what are we doing here?

He was just so NICE.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Put your arms up,\" said Louis, \"I'm going to frisk you for bugs, cell phones, whatever.

It was a huge room, probably formerly a production or assembly line in a past life.  Now it was a maze of people bustling around like ants.  A row of four or five computers stood against the wall to her left.  Maps covered the walls everywhere. It seemed like people were working very hard on... something.  There didn't seem to be enough desks for everyone, so they were working standing up, sitting on the floor, and crowded around tables. As they walked to the back of the room, Thor put his arm around Lari's waist.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'll see you around,\" he said, and he kissed her softly and quickly on the mouth,\"you'll be fine.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe watched him walk away, suddenly aware that he was probably her ideal man, perfect in every detail but one - he was married. Forcing herself to be strong, to focus on the matter at hand, she turned to Louis.

My interest in social justice, economic justice and of course, environmental justice. And it's all connected. The thing is, I know that any successful movement must be accepted and embraced by the middle class.  Look at the labor movement and the civil rights movement.  On the other hand, environmentalism is successful and embraced by the middle class. But it's stagnating. It's not going anywhwere because huge corporations are still too powerful. How do we make the corporations understand that we are serious? That we are powerful, too?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I know where you're going. You think that if you blow up a couple of buildings, you'll prove a point.  But the big corporations have access to the media, and the media has access to the middle class - to the people.
