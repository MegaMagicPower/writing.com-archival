            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tIt was late after practice.  Martin was in the locker-room himself changing from his rugby uniform.  He had dark hair, olive smooth skin and a toned muscular body.  He peeled off his tight shirt and pants.  His handsome face had a far-away look etched on it.  His eyes stared at nothing and his skin was smooth as porcelain, as if he never smiled or frowned.  No emotion showed.  <br>\r\n\tAs he was peeling his worn socks off his large smooth foot the door to the locker-room swung open.  A large man entered with black leather boots, tight jeans and a white wife-beater.   He stood there ridged and scanned the room.  A strong looking face with sharp mean eyes stopped at Martin.  An evil smile stretched momentarily across the man\u2019s handsome face.  <br>\r\n\tWithout warning the man smoothly reached up to his face.  He wrapped his thick fingers within his mouth and began to pull.  His mouth stretch unnaturally wide revealing his perfect teeth and some pink gum, then it stretched further to reveal bright steel beyond the gums.  The skin made a rubbery sound as the man continued to stretch his mouth open further.  Finally the skin began to rip as he pulled his mouth and cheeks out and away from his real face.  A gun muzzle began to protrude from the mans throat as he continued to rip apart his face.  The handsome face stretched and ripped down the middle.  The skin snapped off to reveal a robotic face.  Some of the original skin was left on the robots right side around the eye.  <br>\r\n\tHe looked at Martin with red eyes and aimed the gun that was coming out of his robotic throat right at his chest!  Martin jumped up with a worried look plastered on his smooth face.  He began to run away when the android shot the laser at his back.  Martin fell to the floor with a loud thud.<br>\r\n\tThe android approached as the gun retracted back into its throat.  \u201cTarget subdued\u201d it said in a metallic voice.<br>\r\n\tHe reached down and grabbed Martin by the throat.  Without hesitation he reached up to Martins smooth chest and dug his fingers into his skin.  With a sickening rip he pulled the skin down to Martins abs revealing robotics beneath.  Martin struggled, the skin around his neck wrinkled under the android tight inhuman grip.  The evil androids eyes glowed brightly before there was a crunching noise, like metal being bent, in Martins thick muscular neck.  Martin ceased his struggling and stared lifeless at nothing.  There was a whining sound within his body now.  <br>\r\n\t\u201cSymbiotic-suit confirmed, initiating retrieval mechanisms.\u201d The evil android said in a metallic voice.<br>\r\n\tThe robot moved Martins body so that his thick muscular legs were straddling the faceless android.  There was a hissing sound within the robots pants.  Then his bulge tightened within.  The jeans stretched and pushed out until finally it ripped open to reveal a perfectly straight human cock.  Then a second later as it continued to grow the human looking skin on the penis peeled away to reveal metal.  The robot then shoved the robotic shaft into Martins ass, pushing through the briefs and skin of Martin.  The robots human looking hands clutched Martins sides, easing them to the floor.  Martin began to twitch as sparks began to fly from the area that the evil robot was seemingly fucking.  <br>\r\n\tThe evil robot paused for a second with a blank look on his smooth metallic skull-like face.  \u201cInitiating human replication sequence\u201d he said. <br>\r\n\tHe reached up to the right side of his face and peeled the remaining human flesh from his right eye.  With that he reached down into the front of his tight jeans.  He slowly pulled out an empty human mask.  He hung awkwardly from his thick hands.  The eyes and mouth were empty and distorted.  He held the mask up then began to slip it over its metallic head.  The face slowly stretched over his metallic features.  The skin stretched awkwardly down over its face.  He began pulling at the face and pushing against his cheeks.  The handsome face began to take place.  The black hair and smooth young handsome features stretched into place.  When the robot finished messaging the face into place he bent over and kissed Martin passionately.  Their two faces smashed together during the kiss.<br>\r\n\t\u201cHeat register found, illuminating threat.\u201d It mumbled into Martins mouth.  The evil robots began pumping harder; smoke came billowing from Martins ass.  He continued to twitch and spark, Martins green eyes were wide open, lifeless.  Smoke began to rise from Martins mouth, then suddenly his scalp rose.  A small hatch opened on Martins skull.  With smoke pouring out of the new hatch on Martins head a small green alien climbed out coughing.  It stumbled away from Martins body, away from the robot destroying Martin from the inside out.  The robot with bright red eyes looked up.  A confused look stretched across his face.  The alien fled.<br>\r\n\tIt ran, the evil robot crawled towards it.  It began reaching for it.  Just then Martins smoking body reached out and grabbed the evil robots leather boot.  With a powerful hold it pulled the evil robot back.  The evil robot pulled away tearing its leather boot from Martins hands revealing a robotic foot beneath.  With a hard kick to Martins smooth emotionless face he freed himself.  Martins face scrunched up then peeled back revealing a robotic skull beneath.  His jaw bent and broke as the evil robots booted foot scraped across his jaw.  The robot sparked and smoked lifeless as the evil robot continued his pursuit of the alien that once lived in Martins head.  <br>\r\n\tThe little alien snickered as it ran just out of the evil robots grip and into a locker.  The robot looked up, the slightly lighter color of his new mask showed in contrast from the rest of its much tanner body.  The neckline was torn and shredded away, separating the body\u2019s skin from the new mask it wore.  It looked up in confusion.  Of course it was able to peel away the metal locker without a problem.  Had the alien trapped itself?  Calculations began to process as it crawled closer to the locker.<br>\r\n\tJust then the locker popped open, and from within the locker walked out a large muscular man with blue short tights.  Its abs glistened in the light from the old sparking Martin on the floor behind the evil robot.  Its thick body rose to full height in front of the evil robot.  Its blond shaggy hair fell in front of its bright red eyes.  The little green alien stretched out of its handsome mouth and waved with a sadistic smile on its face.  <br>\r\n\t\u201cThis will even the odds a bit,\u201d it screamed in a high pitched shrill voice<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'hmm nice nice this body reflex is commendable' Al said from within the jocks body he made a fist and then smash it on the wall nearby making an escape route as the jock leap with inhuman agility and escaped the scene. he leaped from building to building as it didn't quite make any noise or dents in the ground while landing. finally he reached his hideout a huge mansion which is heavily guarded and secured. he walks and press the intercom button. \"Code Breaking the fuss' he said as the gates open and he enters the mansion. \"welcome master Al' said a strange computer like voice. \"you will address me as Bill Fowler ' the Jock said. the computer made some clicking noise and then \"very well Bill Fowler.. its seems like your in a real tough position now seeing you here with that backup body what happened to Martin?' Bill shake his head he is heavily damaged but my drones could reclaim him though it might take some time to fix him..contact the the commander and tell them that i'm being hunted in this world'</span></div></div>",
