Instead of turning back the way he came, Max trudged through the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mom said she'd meet me in half an hour' he pondered to himself as he put his hand in his pocket. Besides the tissue, candy wrappers, there was a ten and a few bits of loose change; just about enough to buy a snack before he headed back. Knowing the food court so well, Max made a beeline for his favourite Chinese place, and placed his order - the same that he usually made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting five or so minuets for his order, he grabbed the tray and headed towards a table near the glass barrier that overlooked the mall. Before he had even put his tray down and taken a seat he could hear his stomach rumble, and dug into one of the dishes as he placed his tray on the table to sate his hunger. True, he hadn't that long had breakfast, but there was something about shopping that just left the teenage boy drained and starving. Luckily, shopping did mean he could make an excursion to the food court, so it wasn't all bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he bent to place his buttocks on the seat, a muted tear alerted him to the shredding of the thread from the button of his trousers. \"Crap\" he muttered under his breath, putting is hand on his waist band to stop his trousers falling and exposing his underwear. He supposed it was good that his mom was probably going to buy jeans for him anyway. Anyway, as he worried pointlessly, his lunch was getting cold.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he pushed his bedroom door shut, he just let his trousers fall to the floor, before stepping out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunching on a candy bar, Max riffled trough his wardrobe for a change of trousers, quickly settling on a dark pair of jeans not dissimilar to those he had just cast off.

As he struggled, Max subconsciously raised his shirt and breathed in, trying, and failing, to pull the trouser button and it's hole together. After a grunt, and one last heave, he gave up and flopped on to his bed, grabbing a second candy bar from his nightstand to munch on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom had thought she'd noticed that Max had had a bit of a growth spurt, for himself, Max hadn't really noticed, besides in the girth of the odd pair of the trousers. Perhaps the leg too. He had more trousers, and his mom had brought a couple of pairs of new better fitting jeans while they were out shopping. It didn't matter right now, though. He wasn't doing anything special with his afternoon, just a few hours of lounging in his bed room, movie on his TV video game on his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAX DINNER\" came his mother's call, several hours later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afternoon had really gone quickly. He paused the programme he'd moved on to, and set his game controller back on his desk. After brushing the small mountain of candy and crisp wrappers that he'd chomped through in the afternoon, and dashed down to his waiting dinner, not even giving his unbuttoned trousers a second thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Justin sat in his room, blanket covering his body. A dim, faint light glowed under his sheets. Using his wand for light, Justin eagerly stayed up studying new spells. Turning each page his eyes rapidly took in the ink. He had stayed up for countless hours, nerves on high alert. For if his parents walked in they would surly ground him for his late night studies. Justin did not know why they were against his constant search for knowledge, it should be something all parents want for their children. Yet, there he silently laid, carefully turning the thick pages of the spell book in fear of being caught. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   After several more hours, Justin was sure he had learned a vast variety of new spells. He gave a proud smirk at the thought of using these defensive magic tactics against his younger siblings. evil sister Alex, and dim-witted brother Max. He was sure they would not be able to take him down with this new knowledge, and maybe, if he was lucky, his father would be proud of his self-taught skills. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   Closing the thick, heavy, brown leather spell book, a cloud of dust flew out. Justin began to cough as the particles infested his lungs. Justin was always a very clean person and held a deep fear for germs. Jumping up, he ran off his bed and tried to clean himself off. With fear gripping his mind, Justin felt light headed. He began to call out for help in his dying moments. Dramatically, he crashed onto the floor, his last breath leaving his lips. <br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Immediately, Justin's door flew open. His mother came rushing to his aid. Brushing off the dust that covered his body, she helped him up and began to pat his back. Justin yakked up a dark cloud of dust and regained his uneven breathing. <br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \"Justin!\" his mother, Theresa, yelled out.\"What happened to you?\" <br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Still catching his breath, Justin stammered out, \"I-I was just-\" he began a series of rough coughing, not from the dust but to think of a lie to cover up his actions, \"was attacked by Alex!\" he exclaimed. <br>\r\n   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Theresa what happened?\" A deep voice yelled out. Running to the door was Justin's father, Jerry. Looking at Justin' covered in dirt, Jerry stuttered out \"Justin - Dirt - Alex!\" he called out. Justin sat silent and still. His posture perfect like a statue. The fear of his exposed lie was breaking him down. \"Alex!\" Jerry called out. \"Get over here now!\" After a few seconds of silence, Alex wobbled into the room. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   Her hair was dark as night, but was wildly in a craze as she was awakened in the hours of the night. Her eyes drooped down with sleepiness still glazed over them. Looking around she came upon the sight of Justin. Examining him, she could not help but burst out into laughter. \"Don't laugh young lady.\" Theresa commanded. \"How could you do this to your brother?\"<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Taking time to understand the situation, Alex retorted, \"Wait, you think I did this?\"<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \"Well who else could it be?\" Theresa asked. <br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \"I don't know.\" Alex said. \"Anyone with a life and a good sense of humor.\" she giggled. <br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \"Besides, Justin said it was you.\" Theresa said. <br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Alex starred into Justin's brown eyes. She could see right through them. Looking at his bed, Alex caught sight of something large underneath Justin's sheets. Grinning, she walked over to it and unveiled his covers. Lying there, was the ancient, large book of spells covered in dust. \"Ah, I see someone is dabbling into the art of lying.\" she mockingly said. Justin shot his eyes down to the floor, he could not take the glares of his parents upon him. <br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \"Justin, did you lie about this?\" his father asked. Unable to look at him, Justin nodded his head. <br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \"And you blamed it on your sister?\" said Theresa. Again, all Justin could do was nod. <br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \"Well,\" Alex said, \"I'm going back to bed. Good job Justin, next time just hide the evidence.\" <br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  We will talk about this in the morning.\" Justin's mother said walking out of the room along with his father. <br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Sitting, still covered in dirt, Justin grew with anger. He knew it was wrong to have blamed Alex, but how many times had she gotten his into trouble? How many times had she blamed him on things? Clenching his wand, Justin thought of the new magic he had previously learned, and came upon the thought of using one new spell, specifically for Alex. </span></div></div>",

He let out a deep sigh thinking back to the events of last night. He boiled with rage, sitting up, jaw clenched, he grew with quick malice towards Alex, but soon smirked remembering the little spell he had given her. He knew it was wrong, yet he did not mind. She deserved it after all. He was the good child, studying for the wizarding exams, unlike his sister and brother. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Getting up, Justin felt a deep roar from below. Looking down, he placed his hand over his slim, firm stomach. Waiting he heard the rumble once again. \"I must be hungry.\" he mused. Walking to the bathroom, to perform his orderly rituals of cleanliness, Justin felt his belly hollow. It was a strange felling that left his with almost a strike of pain inside. Without realizing it, Justin was in the kitchen. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 His mouth was practically open wide starring into the fridge. He knew that his mother would not wake up for hours, as he was the first to always wake up in his family, so Justin decided to take it upon himself to eat breakfast. Looking at his vast choices, Justin started with some cereal. <br>\r\nHe never felt such a rush. Once it entered into his mouth he was sent into heaven. Justin could not believe the sense of joy he got from eating. He must have been depriving himself of food over the past few days of studying, he thought. Slurping down the last of the milk, Justin still felt the empty feeling in his stomach. Refilling his bowl, Justin ate it faster than before, still enjoying every bit of it, but once again found himself still hungry. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Wow, I guess I need something a bit more filling.\" he whispered to himself. \"Maybe a sandwich from downstairs will be better...\" Heading down to his family's sandwich shop kitchen, Justin mentally prepared his meal.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He would stuff it with assortments of meats, lathered in mustard, tucked in with cheese, and lightly covered with lettuce, all wrapped in-between two warm buns. He practically drooled at the thought. Once in the kitchen Justin took no time in preparing is concoction. He found himself stuffing his mouth with ingredients while preparing his sandwich. With gleeful eyes, Justin gazed at his creation. It was much bigger than he thought of, his mouth barely able to even fit a bit in. With it divine taste entering his mouth, Justin let out a small giggle of joy. He ate with pure satisfaction, even licking his fingers once done. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Justin patted his belly, which slightly bulged out, as the empty feeling diminished away. \"I need to make sure I get proper nutrition when I study.\" he told himself. Walking back upstairs Justin ripped out a loud belch, \"BURP!\" Frozen with embarrassment, Justin heard something....</span></div></div>",

There was at least enough for 3 maybe 4 people. Egg sandwiches, pancakes, waffles, french toast, bacon, and sausage lie across the table. Their scents mingled and teased Justin's nose. His mouth watered, and his stomach growled in anticipation. \"That's a lot, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\", smiled Zeke, proudly. \"I figured if you were hungry enough to eat a sandwich, and not even a breakfast one at that, then you were in need of help.

Especially since the weight gain, Justin was even more hot. Zeke liked the chubby jiggly, slightly hairy belly that now invaded Justin instead of the hard rock abs he had before. Zeke looked up at Justin with innocent eyes, and Justin finished eating. Justin noticed Zeke looking at him and he looked back. Justin had liked Zeke for a while now, and he could tell that him getting fat was making Zeke really love him. Justin would do anything for Zeke, and he was Zeke's protecter. Justin smirked down at Zeke and jiggled his big jiggly hairy belly. Justin let out a big, manly, deep burp. <br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRPPPPP!!!!\" Justin burped and slapped his jello belly. Zeke stared up in awe. <br>\r\n\"Hey Zeke,\" Justin smirked. \"I was wondering if you wanted to be my boyfriend?\" <br>\r\n\"YES!!\" Zeke shouted and got up and jumped into Justin's lap. When Zeke jumped into Justin's lap, he sunk into Justin's fat hairy belly and his belly jiggled and his thighs too. <br>\r\n\"Awesome\" Justin smirked. He was really happy.<br>\r\n\"Hey baby, let's go up to my room and sleep. It's getting late\" Justin said as he and Zeke walked up to his room. Locking the door, Justin stripped into his boxers and a tight wifebeater that raised above his bellybutton, exposing his happy trail. As Justin and Zeke got into bed, Justin put his arm around Zeke, reavealing Justin's hairy armpits. Zeke leaned into Justin and laid on his jelly belly, loving the doughy jiggly feeling. Justin let out a big burp and then he closed his eyes, and went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

And he was carrying all of his Halloween candy he collected through the years and a few cakes in his hands. But he soon stopped once he saw so Justin's small bloated belly. Justin soon noticed that Max cheeks were turning red.Which meant he was blushing. So Max I see you taking a new liking to belly. Justin I'm sorry to disturb you but- Max was soon cut off by Justin grabbing him quickly and closing the door. And said \"Max why did you bring all your Halloween candy and these cakes to my room then\". Max was dumbfounded Justin figure him out. Ok, you figure me out , I wanted you to eat all this so I could rub your belly when it got to full, help feed it with Zeke, or maybe be inside it like an unborn baby. Max said After Max finished talking Justin was soon eating all the candy in the bag like there was no tommorrow. After ten minutes all the candy was gone and Justin began working on the cakes. Soon as Justin reached for the last cake two more of pants buttons popped off, Max watched in awe. Soon the last cake was gone into Justin's belly and what shocked Max more was it more solid,heavy even and retained the shaped of a soccer ball. Quickly Justin felt an immense on his belly. Soon Max rushed over and pushed Justinon top of the bed,after that he climbed on top of Justin directly over his crotch. Max soon began rubbing his Justin belly hoping that it will ease his pain. Soon after a few minutes Max kissed Justin belly which made Justin Burp loudly. \"BBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!\" Thanks Max. said Justin getting up to kiss him and went to sleep. Soon Zeke came into the room with bags of food. Max told Zeke that Justin is sleeping and they could join him if they want. Max and Zeke soon turned off the lights then took each side of Justin belly and craddled it as they went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

He wakes up the next morning feeling weird. He goes downstairs for breakfast and then decides he isn't hungry, so he just drinks some water. He then craves exercise, so goes over to the gym and starts to lift light weights. Then heavier, and heavier, and heavier, until he can lift FIVE times his weight. Then it's 20, 30, 40, 50, until he gets bored at 100. He then heads home and eats some red meat and a salad with water. He later on went to sleep. When he woke the next morning he felt his clothes were WAY too tight. When he was going to take a shower, he saw himself in the mirror and gasped. He was GIGANTIC!!!! He weighed in at 283 pounds of sheer muscle. He has calves the shape of large diamonds, huge thighs that ripped his pijama pants, a large muscled up butt, an 8 pack, large deltoids, very broad shoulders that have pecs he can't even see over (causing him to have no shirt at all anymore), large hands, big forearms, arms 7 inches in width, huge, threatening traps, and a very thick neck.
