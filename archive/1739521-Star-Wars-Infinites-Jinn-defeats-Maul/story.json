He watched helplessly as his master, Qui-Gon Jinn, dueled the tattooed Sith alone. Qui-Gon was visibly tiring, but staying with the Sith step for step. The Sith brought the hilt of his double-bladed lightsaber up against the Jedi Master's face in an attempt to leave Qui-Gon's midsection defenseless. Just as the Sith thrust his blade in for the kill, Qui-Gon regained his focus and side-stepped, spinning his blade and cutting the Sith down. Frozen for a moment in stunned surprise, the Sith fell backward, into the reactor core shaft, his torso splitting in half as he fell. The laser barrier confining Obi-Wan vanished as Qui-Gon collapsed, thoroughly exhausted.   </span></div></div>",

It was Padme, standing next to a man dressed in all black with shoulder-length curly hair and holding a baby in her arms. Anakin almost lost his focus, but managed to push the vision aside and complete the process. He walked back out to where Qui-Gon waited for him. Holding the lightsaber high over his head, Anakin thumbed the power switch and a brilliant green blade shot forth.

The Jedi burst into the Senator's bedchamber and Qui-Gon, sensing the threat even before his padawan, grabbed the kouhuns with the Force and crushed them. Anakin, hearing a noise, looked to the window. As Padme sat up in bed, clearly shocked, Anakin jumped through the window and grabbed hold of the floating probe droid. The droid flew off, attempting to shake Anakin loose. After a short flight, a sniper rifle blast connected with the droid and Anakin dropped through the Coruscant skylanes like a stone. As he dropped he saw the origin of the shot and made a mental note of the culprit's speeder. Seeing another speeder stop below him, he angled his descent and fell into the passenger seat. <br>\r\n\"Just in time, Master.\"<br>\r\n\"That was foolish, Anakin. I can't rescue you every time you do something like this.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master.... So, we're even for the gundarks, then?\" Qui-Gon flew on in silence, following the speeder that Anakin indicated as the shooter. But their speeder was no match for the bounty hunter's. They soon found themselves stopped, trying to decide what to do next.<br>\r\n\"Let's return and make sure the Senator is all right. I have a--\"<br>\r\n\"If you'll excuse me,\"Anakin said as he jumped over the edge of the speeder.<br>\r\n\"ANAKIN!\" But  it was too late, Anakin was falling through the Coruscant sky. Then, he landed right on top of the bounty hunter's speeder. Qui-Gon sighed and took off, following them at a safe distance. The Jedi struggled against the bounty hunter, but it took a shot at Anakin through the hole he'd created in the speeder's roof. The second bolt knocked his lightsaber from his grasp and sent it flying. Qui-Gon caught it and sat it next to him on the seat. As he watched, Anakin forced the bounty hunter's hand down and it accidentally fired the blaster into the speeder's control pipes. It careened toward the street below and Anakin fell off just before it crashed. The bounty hunter got out of the ruined vessel and ran off. Anakin seeing this, followed after it. He came to a nightclub,but Qui-Gon stopped him before he could enter. <br>\r\n\"She went into the club, Master.\"<br>\r\n\"Use your senses, Anakin, he went in there to hide, not to run,\" he handed Anakin back his lightsaber. \"Don't lose it again. This weapon is your life. Guard it as such.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master. And I think 'he' is a 'she'. And I think 'she' is a changeling.\"<br>\r\n\"In that case, we must be extra cautious.\"     </span></div></div>",

As the bartender sat a glass of Corellian whiskey in front of him, an alien seated beside him offered to sell him some deathsticks. Anakin raised his hand casually.<br>\r\n\"You don't want to sell me deathsticks,\" Anakin stated calmly.<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna sell you deathsticks,\" the alien replied, as if in a trance.<br>\r\n\"You want to go home, and rethink your life.\"<br>\r\n\"I wanna go home and... rethink my life...\" The alien walked away and Anakin sipped his drink. Meanwhile, Qui-Gon waited patiently behind his apprentice, out of direct sight of the bar. Just as he'd predicted, the assassin presumed to sneak up behind Anakin and shoot him from behind. The young Jedi's danger sense flared at the last second and even as he whirled around, his brilliant green lightsaber ignited, his Master cut the bounty hunter's arm off at the elbow, his own green blade flaring to life. They closed down their lightsabers and supported the bounty hunter between them.<br>\r\n\"Jedi business, go back to your drinks,\" Anakin said as they led the would-be assassin out into the street. They set her against the wall of the establishment.<br>\r\n\"Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?\" Qui-Gon asked.<br>\r\n\"It was the Senator from Naboo,\" the changeling said weakly.<br>\r\n\"Who were you working for?\"<br>\r\n\"It was just a job.\"<br>\r\n\"Who hired you? Tell us,\" Anakin said. The bounty hunter remained silent. \"Tell us now!\" Anakin exclaimed, irritated by her uncooperative behavior.

The Jedi looked up from the dead shapeshifter to see a man with a jetpack blast away into the Coruscant sky. Qui-Gon turned back and extracted the dart from the hunter's neck.<br>\r\n\"Toxic dart,\" he said examining it closely, \"Not one I recognize, though.\"<br>\r\n\"To the Archives then?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, to the archives.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

See that island? We used to swim there every day.\"<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful,\" Anakin replied, \"Just like everything here.\" Padme realized that Anakin was gazing at her.<br>\r\n\"...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't like sand.

She started to walk away.<br>\r\n\"Don't go.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't want to disturb you.\"<br>\r\n\"Your presence is soothing.\"<br>\r\nPadme paused, weighing her words.<br>\r\n\"You had a nightmare last night.\"<br>\r\n\"Jedi don't have nightmares.\"<br>\r\n\"I heard you.

How nice of you to join us. You're just in time to witness the executions,\" Dooku said, calmly turning to face the Jedi. <br>\r\n\"I don't think so, Dooku. This party's over.\" At a signal, a hundred lightsabers suddenly ignited around the arena.<br>\r\n\"This party is just getting started, my old friend.\" Dooku looked past Windu as a Super Battle Droid came stalking up the hallway. It fired on the Jedi and he leapt over the balcony to avoid the blasts. Fett loosed a jet of flame after him, catching his cloak on fire. Windu landed in the arena, shrugging off his burning mantle. As Jango followed the venerated Master and droids began being cut down, two Jedi tossed lightsabers to Qui-Gon and Anakin. Anakin cut the manacles still shackling Qui-Gon and they joined the fray. The reek barreled on, chasing Windu. Mace ran from it, then pivoted and sliced a tusk from its face. It kept charging past him, running Fett down. It trampled him, and as it turned take another pass, Jango squared up and fired three bolts from his WESTAR-34 blaster pistol, dropping the beast. Threat eliminated, he turned to face Windu. He fired three more bolts at the Jedi but they were easily deflected. As Mace charged into close quarters, Jango ignited his jetpack, flying over his head. As the bounty hunter landed, it began to spark, so he shrugged it off and tossed it aside. Windu turned and re-engaged in the melee. He swung his saber and it looked like it would be the end of Jango Fett. But Fett brought his left arm up into the blade's path. Much to the Jedi's surprise, it glanced off, affirming Fett's suspicion that investing in cortosis forearm plates was a good idea. The moment of shock gave Fett the opening he needed and he fired a bolt into Windu's chest. The Jedi staggered back and Jango charged in, intent on finishing the Master off. But, at the last instant, Windu brought his lightsaber around in a sweeping arc and beheaded the assailant. As Fett's lifeless body crumpled to the arena floor, Windu stumbled away to seek medical treatment. <br>\r\nMeanwhile, the battle droids were getting hammered. Dooku signaled and the arena gates opened once more to admit a whole new horde of Super Battle Droids. Quickly, the Jedi were forced into a compromised position. The remaining warriors were encircled by machines. At another signal from Dooku, the droids stood down. He addressed Qui-Gon. <br>\r\n\"You have fought gallantly, my old padawan. Worthy of recognition in the history archives of the Jedi Order. Now it is finished. Surrender, and your lives will be spared.\"<br>\r\n\"We will not be hostages for you to barter with, Count.\"<br>\r\n\"Then, I'm sorry, old friend.\" Dooku raised his hand and the droids prepared to fire. Padme glanced skyward. <br>\r\n\"Look!\" She said, pointing up. Several gunships were descending on the arena. <br>\r\n\"Circle the Jedi. A perimeter, create, around the survivors,\" Jedi Grand Master Yoda ordered. And from the gunships, clone troopers began to pour out. Suddenly, the odds were evened.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the gunship flew over the sand dunes, Dooku's escorts turned tail and circled around behind the Jedi's transport. They opened and fire, causing the ship to jink into the top of a dune. As the pilot righted the gunship, Padme fell from the open doorway to the sands below. <br>\r\n\"Padme!!!\" He turned to the pilot, \"Put the ship down!\"<br>\r\n\"Anakin! Don't let your personal feelings get in the way. Pilot, follow that speeder.\"<br>\r\n\"Lower the ship!\"<br>\r\n\"Anakin, no. We have a job to do!\"<br>\r\n\"I don't care. Put the ship down.\"<br>\r\n\"You'll be expelled from the Jedi Order!\"<br>\r\n\"I can't leave her!\"<br>\r\n\"Come to your senses. What do you think Padm\u00e9 would do if she were in your position?\"<br>\r\nAnakin hesitated, but resigned himself to reality. <br>\r\n\"She would do her duty.\" The gunship continued hurtling along, chasing the Sith Lord. The Jedi caught up with Dooku at the entrance to a hangar bay. The Count was preparing to take off and abandon Geonosis. <br>\r\n\"You're going to pay for all the Jedi you've killed today, Dooku,\" Anakin snarled. Qui-Gon addressed the young Jedi quietly, <br>\r\n\"We'll take him together - you go in slowly on the--\"<br>\r\n\"No, I'm taking him NOW!\" <br>\r\n\"Anakin, wait!\" It was too late. Anakin was speeding across the hangar, intent on vengeance. Calmly, Dooku raised his hand and loosed a fork of Force lightning, sending Anakin flying back across the hangar and into a wall. <br>\r\n\"As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours,\" Dooku said as Qui-Gon cautiously closed the distance between them. <br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" The duel began and Qui-Gon was hard pressed to keep up with his former Master. <br>\r\n\"Come, come, Master Jinn. Put me out of my misery.\" The fight continued and Dooku pressed his former padawan into a compromised state. With a flourish, Dooku made a dual cut, one blow landing on Qui-Gon's shoulder, the other on his thigh. Qui-Gon fell, losing his saber in the process. Dooku stood over Qui-Gon and prepared to make him one with the Force. His brought his blade down and it sizzled and sparked as it came in contact with another blade.<br>\r\nAnakin's blade.<br>\r\n\"Brave of you, boy - but foolish. I would have thought you'd have learned your lesson.\"<br>\r\n\"I <i>am</i> a slow learner.\" Using the Force, Qui-Gon called his lightsaber to hand, then tossed it to his student. With both sabers, Anakin launched an attack on Dooku. But Dooku was the more experienced duelist. In one smooth motion, Dooku sliced through one saber and then through Anakin's opposite arm, severing it at the elbow. The Jedi apprentice collapsed next to his Master, squirming in agony. Just as Dooku was about to slay them, a new figure approached.<br>\r\n\"Master Yoda.\"<br>\r\n\"Count Dooku.\"<br>\r\n\"You have interfered with our plans for the last time.\" Dooku brought his blade up in a salute, then attacked the ancient Jedi. But he was no match for Yoda. <br>\r\n\"Fought well you have, my old padawan.\"<br>\r\n\"This is just the beginning.\" Dooku disengaged from Yoda and pulled with the Force on one of the cranes in the hangar. It  came crashing down toward Anakin and Qui-Gon. Yoda reached out and used the Force to keep the crane from crushing the helpless Jedi. But the distraction cost him Dooku. The Sith escaped up the ramp to his ship and blasted off. At that moment, Padme arrived and rushed to Anakin's side. Supporting him, the quartet stumbled back to the gunship she'd arrived in. </span></div></div>",

His hands severed, there was nothing the Sith Lord could do as the Jedi Knight positioned both his own lightsaber and Dooku's lightsaber in a decapitating position. <br>\r\n\"I shouldn't.\" Anakin was obviously struggling with the decision.

And this time you won't escape.\" As Obi-Wan spoke the word 'escape,' R2-D2's systems seemingly went haywire, creating an interesting distraction. Obi-Wan, hands restrained with electrobonds, spun around, reached out and, using the Force, yanked his lightsaber out of the General's hand He ignited it and cut his bonds. Continuing the spin, he cut Anakin free.  <br>\r\n\"Crush them! Make them suffer!\" Anakin used the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General's hand.<br>\r\nThe droids that surrounded them began to fire. Obi-Wan and Anakin jumped into the line of fire. The bridge quickly degenerated into chaos. The Jedi were locked in a pitched battle between electrostaves and lightsabers with Grievous' four bodyguards. As the Jedi slowly overcame the bodyguards and their lightsaber-resistant staves, the ship took a massive hit and began to plummet toward Coruscant. Finally, the Jedi defeated the guards and turned to find Grievous. They leapt over the front console to surround him. With a sickly laugh, Grievous picked up one of the fallen electrostaves.<br>\r\n\"You lose, General Kenobi!\" Grievous hurled the staff at the starboard viewport and it shattered, allowing the vacuum to pull him into space. The two Jedi clung on to the console for dear life. As Grievous floated through space, he shot a cable from his wrist and into the ship, bringing him to stand squarely on the deck plates. Finally, the blast shield closed over the broken window and the Jedi could relax... for a moment. Grievous detached his cable and crawled along the exterior hull of the ship, using his magnetized hands and feet. He reached a row of escape pods and entered an airlock. Grievous entered the escape pod bay through the hatch. The Droid General went to a control panel and opened an escape pod.<br>\r\n\"Time to abandon ship,\" he snickered. The General pressed a a succession of buttons, and one by one the escape pods were jettisoned. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan and Anakin, dragging their newly re-rescued Chancellor and the re-captured Dooku with them, went over to the navigator's chair.<br>\r\n\"All the escape pods have been launched,\" Anakin observed.<br>\r\n\"Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?\" Obi-Wan asked.<br>\r\n\"You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?\" There was a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward.<br>\r\n\"Well?\"<br>\r\n\"Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.\" Obi-Wan strapped Dooku into a chair, and as he did the same for himself, Palpatine followed suit. Anakin struggled with the controls of the ship. The ship started to glow, and pieces broke off. Artoo moved in on Palpatine 's controls and assisted in \"flying\" the cruiser.<br>\r\n\"Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.\" Obi-Wan informed. Artoo beeped.<br>\r\n\"Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.\" Anakin surmised.<br>\r\n\"Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .\" Obi-Wan began, but was interrupted as the back end of the ship broke away. <br>\r\n\"We lost something...\" Anakin said.<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, we're still flying half a ship,\" Obi-Wan confirmed. <br>\r\n\"Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.\" Anakin said, a mad grin of delight forming on his lips. This was almost as close to Podracing as one could get in outer space...<br>\r\n\"Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .\"<br>\r\n\"What's our speed?\"<br>\r\n\"Eight plus sixty... We're in the atmosphere . . .\" Anakin pointed to one of the controls. Artoo beeped madly.<br>\r\n\"Grab that . . . Keep us level,\" Anakin instructed.<br>\r\n\"Steady. Steady.\"<br>\r\n\"Easy, Artoo,\" Anakin said, \"Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.\"<br>\r\n\"Five thousand... Fireships on the left and the right,\" Obi-Wan stated.<br>\r\n\"We'll take you in,\" the Fireship captain reported.<br>\r\n\"Copy that,\" Obi-Wan replied. <br>\r\n\"We're coming in too hot,\" Anakin noticed.<br>\r\nThe ship left a contrail as it streaked across the Coruscant skyline. Palpatine and Obi-Wan held on for their lives as the ship shook and rattled toward an industrial landing platform, surrounded by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship approached as five Fireships sprayed it with foam. The ship finally came to a rather jittery stop.<br>\r\n\"Another happy landing,\" Obi-Wan smiled.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A brown haze hangs over the landscape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin arrived to meet Palpatine, Obi Wan's warnings in the back of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalpatine was atop of a building, looking out the window at Coruscants vast yet damaged city states. The two could all too clearly see the damage the war had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalpatine turned to face Anakin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnankin's eyes flicked with surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalpatine's words were reassuring, though Anakin had a feeling in his gut that something might be off. Still, if this might bring an end to the war, surely that would be a good thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way. \" The Jedi council was often supicious of palptine. Anakin wondered if this were paranoia or if they actually had a good reason. Palpatine had always seemed a kindly old man who treated Anakin well, and as a grown up, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Palpatine could tell Anakin was having doubts he didn't show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Anakin espeically uneasy. He also didn't imagine the politicans OR the Jedi going alone with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnankin felt conflicted. He did want the war to end as quickly as possible and with the least amount of blood shed, but was Palpatine going about this the right way? Their was indeed too much bickering and politiciking inside the sennate, but would giving that much control to one man be a good idea? Palpatine spoke gentle word's and had a gentle demeaner, but Anakin wasn't always sure if he was entirely sincere. Qui Gon and Obiwan had instilled a healthy distrust of most polictians inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose we would all like to see the war end...\" He said in a non commital way.<br>\r\nPalpatine looked at him, a serious yet fatherly expression his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnankin shuffled awakrdly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to, but I can't help feel uneasy. I appreicate the fact that you are trying to end the war, and I know the republic is often ineffective and bearcratic, but is it right one man to have so much power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of frustration came on Palpatin'es face, though he soon regained his calmer demenar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir. I have never had a problem with the Jedi, I do not see what they have to hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet they do not allow you to sit on all there meetings, do they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnankin felt conflicted. He did long to be acknowledged as a full Jedi master, but he never felt Qui Gon hid anything of importance from him nor he feel like he was treated as a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust they will tell me everything I need to know in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalpatine ceased this opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you be so certain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" Anankin hesitated. \"I trust my master at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalpatine smiled, seeing an open weak spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I see you also bothered by the Jedi's tendacy to keep secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust they have their  reasons.\" Anankin said uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalaptine reflected on this. The boy is not as close to the dark side as I has hoped. His master has trained and led him well. None the less I might be able to use his uncertainty and naivety to my advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what? I don't understand.\" Anakin asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANAKIN thinks about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalpatine waved his hand reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I will not ask you to act against the other Jedi, merely keep an eye on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin looked at Palpatine supiciosuly. Palpatine did not seem bothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they are not up to anything then you will have nothing to report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin relaxed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway.\" Palpatine said. \"Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin was taken back in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members.

He hoped the other Jedi would accept him, though he believed Qui Gon would be on his side. The door opened and he entered, the other masters looking at him intently. Mace Windu was the first to speak, his voice as solemn and serious as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin felt a wave of joy come over him, though he kept his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not.\" Yoda cautioned. \"Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are on the council.\" Mace said reservedly \"But we do not grant you the rank of master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin was outraged.

How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a seat, young Skywalker.\" Mace Windu said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin knew he had stepped out of line, and prompt raced for a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was embarrassed, Qui Gon looking especially solemn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anakin.\" Qui Gon called in a fatherly  voice. \"Their is more to being a Jedi Master than raw power. You are indeed a very talented Jedi, but you have no perfected control over your emotions, and without that we can be vulnerable to the influences of the dark side.\" Qui Gon looked away guiltily, apparently recalling an unpleasant memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnankin was puzzled and reflected on this. A part of him took offence, and yet his earlier outburst proved his master right.<br>\r\nMaybe the Council had a point, though he hated how the others would sometimes make him feel like a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a hologram of a jedi sprang into life, a small Ceran figure, easily distinguishable by his large pointy forehead appeared before the council.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jedi were disappointed, but not discouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is.\" Yoda said. \"The outlying systems, you must sweep.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may take some time . . .\" Obi Wan said. \"We do not have many ships to spare.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We cannot take ships from the front line.\" Mace Windu replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the droid attack on the Wookiees? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!\" Mace Windu said decisively<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObi Wan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the south western quadrant.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin proppedhimself up, eager to prove himself to the council, and feeling well suited to the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMace Windu shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMace Windu nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnankin scowled in disappointment., though none of the other masters seemed to notice, none except Qui Gon. Resentment burned inside Anakin, they really were treating him like a child! It was especially obvious that Mace Windu didn't trust him, and wasn't sure about his place on the council.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQui Gon had been unusually silent, looking even more contemplative than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is thier anything I could do to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMace Windu shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Right now the best you can do is stay here and help defend us if we are under attack.

Just because I want them to recognise my potential?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That rage, that ambition is natural, it affects us all and it is understandable. I to have felt it. They are not emotions to be feared or hated, but you must understand them or they will control you. In order to be a Jedi Master and protect yourself from the influence of the Dark Side, you must constantly examine and balance your emotions. You do not need to deny them but you cannot ignore them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you deny that you let your anger get the best of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnankin looked at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No master...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQui Gon smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe you will prove yourself to be a worthy Jedi Master, and with that you will come to win the Council's respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?! The other Council members don't trust me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQui Gon grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in a tricky position. You are very close to Palpatine, the others suspect divided loyalties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin looked at his pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You trust me, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQui Gon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. I do believe that when the time comes you will do the right thing. However I think you trust Palpatine too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Chancellor is not a bad man, Qui-Gon!\" Anakn protested \"He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQui-Gon was unmoved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anakin use your feelings. Doesn't something feel amiss? Their is something you missing, something you are refusing to look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open yourself up to your feelings and you will see it in time. Let yourself feel them and acknowledge them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Palaptine has given me no reason to mistrust him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have only looked at his surface actions. On the face of things he has indeed been very kind to you and always told you what you've wanted to here. Yet I to have been here for you, I have been there to reassure you, yet also tell you what you needed to hear, even if it wasn't what you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnankin looked stricken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have against Palpatine?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Look beneath his friendly fa\u00e7ade. Every action he has taken has been to advance his political power and influence. I believe he does not simply want to increase his position with the senate, I believe he wants to supersede it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin was outraged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you say such a thing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQui-Gon was unpreturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look beneath the surface and you will see the same thing. Trust not just your initial feelings but also the misigivings you have buried. Do not simply look at his actions in the moment, but also look towards what he is working towards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Jedi Council have an assignment for you. You are not going to like it, but it is very important. For the Jedi and for the Republic itself, and in your unique position you are the only who can fulfil it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin leaned forward, clearly intrigued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need you to spy on Palpatine and report back to Jedi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnankin's mouth fell open. He bristled with anger at this outrageous request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that! That's treason! You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQui-Gon smiled confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Palpatine is really what he appears to be, then you have nothing to worry about. Their will be nothing sinster to report back to the Jedi will there? And I am not just asking you to do this, the whole council is. I have faith in you Anakin, I believe you will find the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQui-Gon walked away, still smiling. Anakin turned away. Clearly divided. Was Qui-Gon really trying to force him to choose between the Jedi and Palpatine? Or was their more to this? He did at least seem to trust Anakin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQui-Gon went back to the Jedi halls to speak with Mace Windu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm, though I am not too surprised.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMace Windu scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense anger and pride in that boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQui-Gon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but that is quite normal for a talented young Jedi. I believe he can keep it in check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't trust him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMace Windu's expression softened, though he looked uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't always approve of your actions, but I do believe you try to follow the Jedi Code in your own way. Your judgement is usally proven correct, though you have had an apprentice fall before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQui-Gon's head drooped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. A mistake I never intend to repeat again. This time I am aware of the feelings inside him, and I do not deny him.\" Qui Gon smiled. \"And yet, he is not the same as Xanatos. They share some superficial similarities, but Anakin walks in the light and we have a much deeper bond. And I am a wiser man than I was back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..\" Mace Windu assessed Qui Gon's speech. He had to admit Qui-Gon seemed to know what he was doing, or at least thought he did, though Anakin still seemed like a wild card. Windu had seen plenty of Jedi like Anakin fall to the Dark side, and Palaptine had a lot of influence over the boy. Still he had Qui-Gon. \"Whatever you do, keep an eye on the boy. And if necessary-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But I have faith in Anakin, I believe when the time comes he will do the right thing.\" </span></div></div>",

Anakin fought Dooku alone for most of the battle. As I understand it, he made a difficult choice in sparing him...\" A hard look settled into Mace Windu's features. <br>\r\n\"Yes... From what you've told us, the exchange between the Chancellor and Anakin is... disturbing, to put it mildly.\" <br>\r\n\"This does not seem like the Chancellor at all,\" Qui-Gon mused, \"Are you certain Anakin wasn't embellishing?\" Qui-Gon's eyes unfocused momentarily, as if recalling a distant memory.<br>\r\n\"I'm certain, Master.
