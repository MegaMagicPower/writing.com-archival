For future refrences other elite guard divisions include ones with weapon prosthetics, others with steampunk attachments that give different abilities, and those who just carry special and unique weapons. Now let's begin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several weeks now there has been a major conflict going around in the land of lilliput. There has been a discovery of giant beings who some are hostile, others are friendly, and a few are plain neutral. This has everyone on edge, who knows if one of these giants found them and they were hostile, what then? Would their military be able to stand up against them or will they all get annihilated or become slaves? Well to Finneas and the rest of the elite guard, they are prepared for the worst of it and are ready to stand by and will not give up even if the odds of them surviving or slim to none. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, today that decision is made. At the training grounds, Finneas was in his steampunk spider squaring off against a friend of his, Damien, who was wearing arm and leg prosthetics (Metallic of course) with a semi-large group watching them taking bets. <br>\r\n\"Alright Damien, are you ready?\" Finneas questioned and Damien's prosthetics changed to be more weapon like, with his legs becoming blades, his right arm becoming a gun of sorts and left becoming cannon shaped. <br>\r\n\"Ready!\" Damien replied confidently<br>\r\n\"Okay then, engarde!\" Then the spider started to move to attack when a large blaring sound rang throughout the kingdom \"Oh for the love of!\" <br>\r\n\"Well, let's finish this later\" Then everyone scattered, getting their weapons, getting into their steampunk machines, and getting ready to probably die a horrible, horrible death. Then Damien climbed onto Finneas's spider, <br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Finneas questioned <br>\r\n\"I need a ride and you probably need an extra gunner on you\" <br>\r\n\"Get off, you'll get in my way\" <br>\r\n\"I'm not asking and you damn well know I'm not moving\" <br>\r\n\"Agh! Whatever!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Finneas finally got into position outside of the city walls, it seems that the giant is...</span></div></div>",

The type of clothing/armor you are wearing is leather, which the only part not covered is the head, and your weapon is a steel blade at your side and a steel dagger on your leg. The ship you are on is called the Tempest and the Captain is a middle-aged Nord named Avaertus, whose leadership actually kept them alive from all the places you have been. Now enough with the introductions, lets get to the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a port in some low-down village that you never bothered to check what the name is, you were in the Tavern where you were talking to fellow sailors about some of the adventures some of them had. Which the one that was talking was Aloin, a young Redguard who is very Naive for his own good <br>\r\n\"And so this slaver just held me in this jailcell for about several moons before you people finally come to rescue me\" Aloin was saying when Abram interrupted him, Abram was a male Orc mercenary we had for a while, he was good at he what he does, but he can be a bit harsh <br>\r\n\"We didn't come to rescue you, it just so happened that slaver had a giant bounty on him and you were extra\" Then someone else jumped right in, it was Arival, a female Khajiit that does the most ridiculous thieving schemes that you have ever seen and somehow they worked <br>\r\n\"Sometimes Abram, you can at least be a little bit nicer!\" <br>\r\n\"Nice does not exist in me\" Then to just get out before someone starts a brawl you say something<br>\r\n\"Let's just see if the ship is ready to launch to sea\" All of them agreed and we went out onto the morning sun, where there wasn't much people out, just some kids running around and some others talking about things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all arrived at the port where there were still sailors loading in some cargo, though not that much you wished they would hurry things up. While the 3 you were with helped move some of the cargo, you went to the captains quarters to see if he was there. He was there and he was talking to a young-looking male, nord. <br>\r\n\"Captain, all I'm saying is that this place is all, but myths and fairytales!\" The young-nord said <br>\r\n\"That's what they said about the dragons and now look at the skies!\" Avaertus responded \"And unless I'm on Skooma, they are as real as they can be!\" <br>\r\n\"That is a diffrent matter, this place cannot possibly exist\" The nord said \"Even if it did, you'd think someone would have found it by now!\" <br>\r\n\"That is because they are not good enough, now good day to you!\" The nord went out of the quarters and you went in to see the Captain looking at a map <br>\r\n\"yes, what do you want Veeziri?\" Avaertus questioned<br>\r\n\"Captain, what was that man talking about?\" You questioned <br>\r\n\"Ah, it's about this myth about this landmass named Liliput and it is said that they are smaller versions of us humans\" <br>\r\n\"I have never heard of that myth\" <br>\r\n\"That's because many laughed at the possibility\"  Laertus stated \"Like they did with dragons, but now they are alive and breathing fire. If giants can exist so why can't small people?\" <br>\r\n\"Why do you want to see a Lilliputian?\" <br>\r\n\"I am interested at what they are, that is all\" He responded \"Now, put this ship into gear, we are headed out onto Lilliput\"<br>\r\n\"And if you are wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"Well then I have to fight off a mutiny of 20 men\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving for the open sea's, to look for a land that is in myth and fairytale. We have enough supplies to last us several months and only have the patience for only a couple. You think that this is just a fool's errand and a blinded quest to find a place that is yet to be discovered. Several weeks go by and some of the men grew weary of what the destination is since the Captain never mentioned it in front of the crew as such they would have deemed him a crazy and would have either left or change his mind. But then something happened...</span></div></div>",

The entire deck was pounded by rain, visibility was completely impaired, and the waves rocked the boat almost to the point it will capsize. The entire crew was on deck trying to keep the ship afloat by making sure the masts and sails didn't break apart, but as you can see the storm is making it hard to maneuver correctly as some men went overboard. The entire time this happened the captain was at the helm trying to steer the Tempest out of danger, but alas this may be futile as multiple large figures were spotted up ahead, they were jagged rocks and the ship was heading straight for it no matter how hard the captain or crew tried to steer off course. <br>\r\n\"Hold men! HOLD!\" The captain yelled over the roar of the storm itself, but that didn't help in the slightest as the ship made contact with the jagged rocks, making the ship sink quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the que for the men to abandon ship, but due to the jagged rocks there may have been some people who may have died upon landing in the water. You were one of the last to go as you saw the captain standing tall at the helm looking up at the sky <br>\r\n\"A captain goes down with his ship! Take your best shot mistress of the ocean, I have survive worser situations than this!\" Than out of all the odds, lighting from the clouds struck down on Captain Avaertus which he was still standing proud \"Is that all you got?!\" You realize that the captain is not going to be moved from that spot even if an army tried to move him. You then dived into the water to see that navigating in the violent waves and currents weren't going to be an easy task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile trying to stay alive in the violent storm, you saw that the ship had completely submerged underwater and that there were bodies being whipped around the waves like rag dolls, whoever was still alive were either extremly lucky or very good swimmers. Unfortunately when the ship submerged all the supplies that were inside began to pile out quickly and they became another hazard to avoid, which you were knocked unconscious when a barrel hit you behind the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts a good thing you are Argonian, otherwise you would have drowned or have gotten hypothermia after floating in the ocean for quite a bit of time. Your still unconscious body floated with the current in which it made it onto the shore where the lilliputians have yet to see you. What exact time period are these tiny people in? It really matters on account of weapons they would use and their reaction. </span></div></div>",

Near the shore you were tending to a wound on your arm which was by a bandit group that ambushed you on the dirt trail, which they stole your horse, most of your gear, and all you had were the clothes on your back and a old damaged iron dagger. You stared out at sea to look at its beauty in the sunlight, but that was when you notice something floating on the surface, something very, very large. When it got started to float closer to the shore you could see the figure more clearly and describe its features. It was a gigantic reptilian creature in some sort of leather armor with the largest blades you ever seen, it might be female from its figure and you thank the lord that it was unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of fear of what would happen if the creature had awoken from its slumber, you ran back to the village as fast as you can to alert the kings guardsmen and anyone who were able-bodied to wield a blade or bow. When you made it to the village to alert the guards, they didn't believe in the story you told them, they thought you had either been drinking too much or that you were insane out of your mind. After a long argument, several guards on horseback came up to see if your claim was correct, if not then your head was in a basket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiding back to the shore didn't take much time, when the guards saw the giant reptilian creature they were dumbfounded about the possibility of such a creature existing and one of massive proportions with giant blades. They hurried back to the kingdom to get everyone in arms to try to restrain the creature and to prepare for an attack if the creature is hostile. They weren't taking any chances as they had their best soldiers and mage's with many siege weapons for security measures (Siege weapons such as ballista's and catapults) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basic scenario excecution in this was that they basically got heavy chains and ropes, many horses and men, and the mages to help in the moving of the creature. This plan was going swimmingly until the creature started to awake from its slumber. You thought to yourself,<br>\r\n\"Oh we are all going to die\" Oh and the restraints were already on. Also the size of the creature was very big, to be more exact her size estimate is about 130ft.</span></div></div>",

She shook her head and looked around to see the small men attacking her out of fear. Though she seemed to understand why they attacked her, it was still rather rude they would do that and very foolish and so came this \"You dare attack me?!\" She said and everyone stopepd attacking \"If that is all you have to offer as an attack, then it is futile. It is also rude of you to attack someone if you don't know if they're hostile or not. Fear or not, it will have consequences\" She then stood up to her full height which was very intimidating and soldier that were on her just fell to the ground and scrambled up to face what was next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature then lifted up her foot and slammed it down onto the closest soldiers, making sand and blood spray in all directions. <br>\r\n\"Attack!\" All the men went into arms and attacked with blade and arrow, some fled and others stayed. As for you, you didn't want to be a part of this madness of taking on a creature that would easily demolish this band of knights.

Here is something to know: This is not an ordinary Lilliput story where someone shipwrecks and takes over the tiny inhabitants, this time you can do something other than that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. Erotic things are allowed, just don't do it every chapter. I did this because I know someone is going to add a erotic thing in a story in Lilliput. <br>\r\n2. Do not make the *giant* main character indestructable or immortal, that seem's to be a giant trend in many stories...unless you have a plausable reason like some heavy thick armor or some magic shielding <br>\r\n3. You can do something other than erotic things. Such as taking over the Lilliputians, helping them in a war, explore the land or something other than stuffing tiny people down your pants...<br>\r\n4. Be descriptive and do not have extremely short chapters, its a waste of space. Unless its something like a transition or choice or something<br>\r\n*Edit* 5. I forgot to mention that it is a limit of 1 character for the giant characters, that being because there is about 60 diffrent characters you can make out of them. As for the Lilliputians, they can have as much as they want. </td>",
