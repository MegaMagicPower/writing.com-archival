The living quarters at the Planet Express Company were quiet and dozy. Nobody felt like doing much. Right now, Fry was not doing much either. To be precise, he hadn't been doing much EATING. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter Fry? You have a stomach-ache, maybe?\" Dr. Zoidberg came into the living-room, holding a cup of coffee. <br>\r\n\"No I'm fine Dr. Zoidberg...I'm just...well...I dunno.

He broke the top off another bottle of beer and started slugging it down. Leela groaned and got up from the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Fry?\" Bender asked. Fry was sitting at the kitchen table gobbling down food. So far, he'd finished two boxes of Crispy Nut cinnamon cereal, three bottles of milk and two plates of pancakes. <br>\r\n\"Just...\" said Fry, taking another mouthful of eggs and sausages, \"...getting my stomach tuned...\" he took another bite, \"...for today...\"<br>\r\n\"Tuned? Stretched looks like it,\" said Amy, coming into the room, \"I suppose you took some of Dr. Zoidberg's pills, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Fry. <br>\r\n\"Come on, guys,\" said Leela, walking back into the dining-room, \"We'll have to leave in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFry guzzled down another large glass of milk and wiped his mouth with his sleeve. He let out another burp. Leela groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news, everyone! The feast will be starting in about half an hour! We'd better get going if we're going to reach Times Square on time!\" said the professor, walking into the room, \"Egads, Fry! I thought you were fasting?\"<br>\r\n\"He was,\" said Bender, getting up, \"Now he's slowing. And he's beginning to notice all the food that he whizzed past in the process of fasting, so now he's reversing to cram it all in!\" <br>\r\n\"Shuddup, Bender!\" said Fry. He struggled out of his kitchen chair and shuffled out the door. Leela turned off the TV and they headed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well!\" said the professor, \"Here we are! Each part of the square is dedicated to a certain type of food! Over there is Asian, over there is European! Elzar has his own corner over there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBender promptly headed off to Elzar's corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and the universal corner is where we are now,\" said Farnsworth, \"Take your time. The feast lasts all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin five minutes, Fry, Leela and Amy were shuffling from stall to stall, trying out food. Cubert and Dwight shuffled along behind them, grabbing all the snacks that their hands could reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look,\" said Leela, \"They have those miniature fruit-trees! You remember Fry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFry nodded, \"You brought one to my housewarming party.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Hey, seeds!\" said Leela. She opened her purse to buy a bag of fruit-tree seeds. <br>\r\n\"So what do you think, should we start a sort of miniature...FRY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFry had left Leela when she'd turned to pay for the seeds. He had charged on ahead and was now reaching willy-nilly into the stalls, grabbing at all kinds of food. Hotdogs, rice, pies, cakes, cookies, barbequed sneezles and roast chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Leela?\" said Dr. Zoidberg walking up to her. His claws were full of cans of anchovies. <br>\r\n\"Where did you get those?\" Leela asked, suspiciously.<br>\r\n\"They invented a cloning machine! They're making millions of them!\" said the doctor, \"Now what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"Fry! He seems to have gone nuts!\" Leela pointed. Down the street, at least three blocks away by now, Fry was still charging ahead. Grabbing at one thing, stuffing it in his mouth, reaching for another thing, swallowing what was in his mouth and cramming the new sample of food into his gaping hole to replace the sample which had previously been in residence there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see the pills worked!\" said the doctor, happily. <br>\r\n\"But he's...\"<br>\r\n\"Relax, Leela, the pills wear off!...If he followed the instructions,\" said the doctor, \"Now, if you'll excuse me, I see a custard eclaire with my name on it...\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh,\" said Leela, when she heard the doctor's last words.

All around the sidewalk were stalls selling hotdogs, pasta, pizza and roast beef. Making sure that Fry wasn't about to wander off, Amy rushed back to the middle of Times Square and grabbed Leela by the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found him!!\" Amy hissed in Leela's ear as she dragged her friend through the crowd. Leela staggered around so that she could run alongside Amy instead of being dragged along behind her and together, they rushed through the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There he is!\" said Amy. She pointed to a table in the middle of the foodcourt. Fry was sitting in a chair, trays, bowls and plates stacked on the table in front of him, almost hiding his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" said Leela, walking towards the table, \"Amy and I were worried sick about...Oh my God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFry belched and wiped his mouth with a sleeve of his read jacket again. \"Huh?\" he looked up, \"Oh hi Leela!

Here, you're the only one between us who can eat, so you might as well!\" The robot dumped the pies on the table. Fry burped and started on the pies.

Fry reached out blindly with his hands, stuffing his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He certainly looks like he's getting bigger,\" said Leela. Fry's face was all puffy and chubby now, and a second chin was beginning to form. His belly bulged out of the confines of his clothes and his shirt started riding up... </span></div></div>",

After walking a little way into the forest, snatching stuff from the trees as they went, they saw Fry lying against a huge boulder and grabbing at everything he could eat. The boulder was a gigantic chocolate-ball and Fry's back was pressed against it. He reached behind him and ate whatever he could lay his hands on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those pills that Dr. Zoidberg gave him must really have boosted his appetite alright,\" said Leela. <br>\r\n\"Look at him...\" said Amy. And they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFry had climbed on top of the chocolate boulder now, and he was lying on top of it with his back pressed against another boulder. He was reaching blindly behind him and stuffing everything he could find into his mouth, eclaires, tofffee, cakes, pies, tarts and huge chocolate cookies. His jeans were completely opened and his shirt had been stretched over his increasingly huge belly. Fry didn't even notice them. He just kept eating. It wasn't until nearly six hours later that he realised anyone was even looking for him. He struggled to his feet and tried to tug his jeans up. They ripped apart and he kicked them off, removing his red jacket at the same time. Now, he was only wearing his usual white T-shirt and white briefs, and even they were beginning to get too small. He waddled down the path, from the mountains, between the trees and back into town. The people of Culinaria were out en masse tonight. Enormously fat children waddled everywhere, munching on all kinds of food. Fry shuffled around. His laden belly wobbled and sagged, but he only rubbed it and tried to eat more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" said Leela, \"He certainly enjoyed himself.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" said Professor Farnsworth, \"But we must be going! Fry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFry belched and looked up. His face was covered in red sauce from stuffing down an entire pot of spaghetti. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah hold on!\" he said. He scratched his rear end and kept shuffling between the food stalls. Suddenly, there was a loud 'CRUNCH!' that made everyone jump. Fry had bitten into the window-sill of a house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fry what are you doing!?\" the professor shouted, \"Didn't you hear what Lucia said? NO EATING BUILDINGS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late. In more speed than anyone could possibly have given them credit for, the Culinarian police force had surrounded Fry and taken him into custody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are they taking him!?\" Leela asked one of the civilians. <br>\r\n\"Well,\" said the man, licking a huge ice-cream the size of his head, \"If he's so hungry that he's going to eat other people's houses, then the King of Culinaria will give him a test.\"<br>\r\n\"Test?\" Leela asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded, \"He must eat a hundred times his weight in food. If he succeeds, he will be set free. If he does not succeed, then the number will continue to rise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man shook his head, \"He will probably end up immobile.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" said Leela. </span></div></div>",

An open packet of chips lay next to her, Fry's favourite brand- Flarg Puffs. Leela picked up the packet which she noticed to be half-empty already and munched absent mindedly on the puffy treats while she got her bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, these are good!\" she said to herself \"I can see why Fry likes them, i'd have tried these before if he didn't always wolf them down first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeela glanced around the room guiltily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's only a virtual reality simulation I guess.

While he still wore his usual shirt and red jacket, he was a lot more in shape than the Fry Leela knew, he was practically ripped! His usual vacant expression was replaced with one of idiotic bravado. Bender looked pretty much the same, except this one had taken the time to keep his exterior polished and all his parts in perfect working order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Leela\" said Fry \"-lazing around on the couch as usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeela angrily tried to point out that she was the one who did all the work around but it came out as 'Mphphmphm!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeela swallowed her mouthful of puffs and opened her mouth, then remembered again that she was in a simulation, and one where Fry and Bender seemed to actually be competent and assumedly, she just lazed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news everyone!\" came a familar voice, as the Professor entered \"I have another highly dangerous and top-profile delivery mission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" asked Leela<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Leela- this mission is far too important for an incompetent delivery girl such as yourself. That's why i'm asking Captain Fry and Assistant Captain Bender to do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fry? Captain?!\" said Leela<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Leela?\" asked Fry \"You don't seem to be yourself just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, i just um... have a headache, yeah!\" said Leela hurriedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're off on another highly dangerous and exciting mission!\" said Bender \"See ya around, ya lazy meatbag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand with that, Fry and Bender left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is there anything I can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, don't try to help with anything at all!\" the Professor interrupted, \"Just stay here and try not to make a nuisance of youself, there's a good girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Leela found herself alone in the Planet Express Lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May as well make myself comfortable.\" Leela decided<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeela found the kitchen area and grabbed a can of chilled Slurm from the fridge and a deluxe packet of Flarg Puffs and returned to the lounge. Parking her soon-to-be-not-so toned rear on the couch, she broke the seal on the Slurm can and gulped down the cool, refreshing liquid. Her eye widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this stuff is good!\" said Leela. Leela set the can of Slurm on the arm of the couch as she switched on the TV with one hand and helped herself to handfuls of puffs with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could get used to this!\" sighed Leela happily through a mouthful of slurm and puffs.</span></div></div>",

I never needed those things in the real world... why would I be so concerned all of a sudden..? I'm getting too into this simulation, I need to get a grip on myself... maybe I should just end this thing altogether and-\" Leela's train of thought was interrupted by an unusually shiney nickel on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh shiney!\" Leela giggled as she snached it up. Leela's mind was losing focus, she was getting lost in the role this world had made for her.

Leela scowed at Amy for taking the last bag but then saw the crate of Chocolate Fudge Bars on the counter, it had \"Count: 140\" on the side, Leela licked her lips and greedily approched it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Leela!\" Amy greated her happily just now seeing her \"Hey, I think Hermes is looking for you, he seemed like he wanted to tell you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Leela thought \"Yeah he wants me to clean the store room...\" Leela said defeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch, rough.\" Amy said \"It's half full of the jelly bean cargo you spoiled by letting it sit to close to the ships engines and making one big solid chunk of jelly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeela's sweet tooth sent her into a dream of candy treats as soon as Amy said jelly Beans. \"I'd help ya but this magazine isn't going to read itself\" Amy said looking back at her fashion mag and hoping Leela didn't beg for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what...\" Leela said looking at the chocolate fudge crate.</span></div></div>",

They were all over 400lbs and seems happy and beautiful in a way that Amy didnt understand, all she knew is that she felt oddly jelous of them.<br>\r\n\"lucky fat girls, not everyone can gain weight so easily\" she grumbled as the new world order seemed to be effecting her \"its not my fault i'm so slim, but i'll show them. One day i'll be one that padgent and i'll win!\" she said determined not realising what this world was making her say.<br>\r\n\"amy is that you?\" Amy heard Leela's voice call out, she quickly turned around and was shocked to see Leela there over 300lbs with her top barly covering her huge breasts that were begging to break out of their confined space, and a pair of tight shorts that showed off her flabby legs, hips, thighs and rear. Amy once again felt oddly jelous as she began admiring the fat Leela \"what are you doing here little amy?\" she asked in a tone as if she were looking down on her the way Amy normally looked down on Leela \"i thought you were going to prove to us all you wernt ugly and you could be cute, after all you did storm out of the meeting this morning determined\" she smirked \"i guess you just cant hold much of a meal can you skinny?\" Leela taunted as Amy felt shocked and offended<br>\r\n\"come on skinny, i feel bad for you not being anywhere near as cute as anyone else, i'll take you out, try help you to gain\" she smiled somewhat kindly</span></div></div>",

Slpeesh, as if!\"  Leela looked annoyed at that but said nothing.  \"But I dunno... Do you think my Kiffy will like it?\"  \"Who?\" replied Leela.  \"You know, Kiff.  He's my knight in velour armour.\"  \"Ohhh\" said Leela, \"Lt. Kroker, well your parents tried setting you two up back on the Titanic but he didn't seem interested.  But I mean c'mon Lt. Kroker?, he's an effeminate bug eyed monster - way out of your league Honey.\"  Amy then burst into tears. \"Now now\" Leela continued, \"We'll see what we can do.  By the time we're done you'll get any gross alien thingy you want and people won't think you're ugly anymore, just stupid.\" \"Aww, thanks Leela.\" said Amy.  Leela smiled, \"You're welcome, now come on Stupid, we've got work to do.\"  \"Where are we going Leela?\" asked Amy.  \"We're going the gym\" she replied.  \"Oh goody I love the gym! ..buuut how is that going to help me gain weight?\"  \"Look I can tell you've never been to the Jim a day in your life so just follow my routine and we'll have you whipped out of shape in no time.\" Leela said blandly.  Amy beamed, \"Yay!, uh what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeela and Amy entered Slim's gym, it's a building that looks like a gymnasium and all the women are dressed in spandex but all the machinary involed food and all the women range from plump to enourmously fat.  Amy notices a woman to one side inserting coins into a vending machine and pressing a button marked \"diet IM\".  A large capsule poppes out and the woman opens it.  Immediately an Italian mother crawls out and starts chanting eat eat eat!  Leela, wearing a pink and purple pair of tights which show off her ample curves unabashedly walks with Amy over to a set of machinery.  Amy looked at Leela's full breasts pressing against of her one piece, her wide hips swaying with every step, her huge ass showing every dimple of cellulite through her leotard and her round belly bulging outwards in between, it was all so, so womanly.  This was something she had never thought of in that vague time she recalled when she was cute but when that was or why she was considered cute was be slipping away in her memory.  Amy wanted so much to be cute again but it was going to take alot of work.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Amy,\" said Leela \"This is a fedmill.  You stand here and food rolls out to you on a conveyor belt, I'll show you.\"  Leela then stood on the treadmill and said \"Watch the master.\", adjusts the height to fit over her large breasts and sets the speed to medium.  Immediately, small chocolates started rolling out of the machine and landing in her mouth.  \"Oh ya, *munch* no pain, no gain *chomp... \"I wanna try!\" said Amy impatiently\"  \"hey! *smack*, who's the expert here? ..just a few more ...almost done ...just watch me ... you don't want you to strain anything do you?\"  No sooner had Leela said that then the strain on her leotards became too much and they ripped open at her belly, exposing her large pendulous breasts.  \"Whoops I guess I'm done and so is this outfit\" said Leela.  Not bothering to cover herself (because heck this is the future)  she waddled over to the scale and it read 313, \"Oh ya, a new record!\"  \"My turn, my turn!\" said Amy.  She set the fedmill to low since she was just a beginner and the chocolates began coming.  \"These are so good Leela! *gulp* I'll just mmm turn it up to max!\"  But as soon as Amy did she was immediately buried in a barrage of the little chocolates.  \"Yeaow! oh no!\" said Amy  \"I can't eat these fast enough, I'll never be cute I'll never win that beauty pageant and worst of all I'll never get my Kiffy back!\"  Leela looked over from another machine she was doing sets on, \"Hey don't worry, this is the future remember?  There's a montage button made fir wusses like you.  \"Oh ya!\" Amy exclaimed, \"here we go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne montage later both Leela and Amy sit rubbing their bellies.  \"Ooh I feel so stuffed\" said Amy.  \"I feel cuter already *BURRRRP!\"  Leela then looked over and said \"Ya you've done a good job, it's been a hard three weeks but I think you've made some definite progress.\"  And she had, Amy's once slender figure was definately beginning to show signs of softening.  Small love handles were starting to form on her hips, her belly button was deeper, her butt less firm, her breasts looked bigger, her thighs touched ever so slightly and she was getting a hint of a double chin.  \"Well let's get you over to the scale and see how you did.\", Leela continued.  \"Oh boy!\" said Amy, she wanted to jump up and run over but she could barely move.  Her belly was so taught from being stuffed with the chocolates that she had to lean against the wall to even get up.  When she did eventually hop onto the scale she suddenly looked disappointed.  \"Aw poop! I've only gained 7 pounds!  The pageant is in a month, I'll never make it in time!\"  Leela shrugged \"Maybe you're right but I know someone that might be able to help, c'mon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both entered the Professor's lab where he was sleeping in his hover chair.  \"Professor,\" said Leela \"We need to ask you something.\"  The Professor jerked up suddenly, \"hoo ohh ah, I keep telling you people that mass grave was here BEFORE I moved in!\" \"No,\" said Leela \"We're here to get your help with Amy here.  She's been having trouble gaining weight and I figured in between putting lipstick on monkeys you could think of something to help her.\"  The professor scratched his chin \"Well it is a detriment to science to stop working with such beautiful monkeys but I suppose we could give her some cosmetic surgery, a lipoinjection and some chinplants, yes that should work nicely.\"  \"Would it hurt?\" asked Amy.  \"Oh yes I should think so, excrutiating!\" chimed the Professor.  Amy thought it over \"Hmm..  well that could work but isn't there any other option?\"  </span></div></div>",

Amy scanned the ceiling for an idea but found nothing, looked down she glanced at all her co-workers who looked back at her impatiently. Amy bit her lip so unsure what to wish for, she'd take any idea at this point. Amy looked down at her lap where her hand was nervously twisting a diamond bracelet on her other wrist. Amy looked at the bracelet, it was quite expensive.... Amy thought about it when suddenly Bender broke her train of thought. \"Oh enough of this!\" He called out annoyed \"She is clearly to stupid to think of anything! Nuts to this, I'm taking her turn!\" Bender turned to the 'What if Machine' \"What if Machine!\" Bender began \"Show me what it would be like if someone finally bit my as-\" \"No!\" Amy screamed loudly stamping her foot \"I have an idea! A good one!\". Amy relaxed her body and looked at everyone staring at her expecting a what if question. Amy got nervous again, it's not like she was lying, she had an idea, but it didn't seem that great. \"Knew it\" Bender said after a few more second of silence \"She's got nothing, now... Machine! What if someone-\". Amy panicked shoving Bender aside mid question and screamed into the mic \"WhatifIwasneverrich!\". Silence fell on the room Amygot cold chills of embarrassment as every was staring at her again from her ourburst. \"Thats it?!\" Bender said dusting himself off as he stood \"Thats your question?! You want to know what your life would be like if you were never rich?! What do we care? You would waste all our time on that when we could be seeing what would happen if someone took my classic come back seriously?! You have just earned yourself a bending!\" Bender said glaring at her has he rolled his arm plates up like sleeves. \"Shut up everyone it's starting!\" The professor broke in as their helmets blurred their vision and began piecing together this new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAmy opened her eyes, she was laying on her back on the couch in the lounge of the Planet Express building. Sitting up she scanned the room, everything was the same, nothing looked different. \"Aw...\" Amy sighed \"I was hoping the world would be in ruin from me not having money...\" Amy hung her head from the fact the world did not in fact revolve around her and her money when she noticed an odd feeling on her neck. Not just her neck in fact... her entire body! It was as if the fabric of her sweat suit was... different. Amy reached back and pulled the back collar of her top piece around so she could read the label. \"The suit is made from 100%.... Cotton?!\" Amy read in horror. She was wearing Cotton?! No special ultra rare fabrics from endangered species hunted down from all over the universe just for her comfort?! Just plain old cotton?! Not even cotton from Space Sheep! Just plain old non flying, non gamma radiation breathing, earth sheep! Amy's skin crawled from the feel of it's inferior texture touching her, she had striped right off of it there and then, but even she wasn't that slutty. Amy stood, shivers running down her spine, \"Try to relax\" she thought \"I can get through this....\" Amy took a deep breath, \"Now, what does my non rich life have planned she wondered reaching into her pocket for her cell phone to check the daily planer on it. Amy's hand felt around for her paper thin smaller than an eraser sized cell phone but it wasn't there... all she found was something larger, like the size of a credit card but thicker... Pulling it out Amy recoiled in horror at the fact THIS was her cell phone! Worse still it was last years model! Amy took several steps backwards, she was panicking. \"Get a hold of yourself!\" she yelled at herself in her head \"You can do this!! it's not like your wearing cheap shoe or anything...\" Amy's eyes bulges almost flying out of her skull as she looked down and saw her shoes were in fact not expensive at all. They looked like they were from K-mart or something! Amy's vision blurred, her head spinning, Amy stumbled across the room losing her balance. Finding the table in a hurry she grabbed for one of the chairs placed around it and dropped her cute rear into it. Amy lost her nerves at this point and folded her arms on the table dropping her head into them and began to sob uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

Leela quickly moved towards the table and put her arm on Amy's back to comfort her. \"Oh Amy, whats wrong?\" Leela said concerned. \"Oh just great\" Amy thought to herself \"Now Leela's here to rub it in I'm not rich, she probably even thinks shes cuter than me in this universe!\". Amy wailed louder becoming more depressed by her thoughts. Leela however was taken back by the outburst and became very worried over what was making her feel worse. Pulling a chair up next to Amy to sit in herself Leela sat down moving her arm to Amy's far shoulder and placed her other hand on the shoulder closer to her, then leaning down next to Amy giving her a sort of half hug Leela lowered her voice and tried to speak as gently and soothingly as she could. \"Hey, hey....\" Leela began \"It's ok you can tell me... remember I'm always here to help you...\". Amy sniffled again and started to think becoming distracted by Leela's behavior, why was she being so nice? Amy thought about it, Leela was always putting her down, telling her why money couldn't buy her everything, telling her she was being selfish, always dragging logic into everything.... So what made Leela so different now? Amy finally realized the obvious, she wasn't rich. In the real world she was rich beyond imagination, somehow being a poor unspoiled girl made Leela like mer more...? Amy finally stopped crying and looked at like quizzically, how could she like her more... poor? Amy didn't get it, money was supposed to make everyone like her, she was sure being poor would mean everyone would hate her, especially Leela who never seemed to like her in the first place. Leela smiled at Amy feeling her tears coming to a stop. \"There you go let it all out\" Leela said hugging her again \"is there anything I can do for you?\" Leela said sweetly. \"Well...no, not really\" Amy said still siffling occationaly \"I was just a little... overwhelmed is all.... I need a little time to think... maybe get away for a bit and clear my head up...\". Amy then kicked herself mentally, how was she going to get away? she was to poor to take a trip!, she'd probably have to settle for some weekend  away at a common motel! \"Thats perfect!\" Leela said eyes lighting up making Amy shoot her a confused look \"Oh! no I don't mean your problem is perfect! Er, I mean... I have the perfect solution to it!\" Amy lifted her head a little to focus better of Leela \"Oh?\" she said still tearing up. \"Yeah!\" Leela said getting excited \"I have two tickets for a two week vacation!\". Amy couldn't believe her ears, Leela wasn't just nice.... she was acting like a friend! \"You see I was going to go on a vacation with Fry for 2 weeks since he's been so sweet lately and I wanted to give him a chance to show me he could be the man I've been waiting for so I found 2 tickets for a vacation he'd just die for!\" Leela said smiling. Amy was confused again \"So... you want me to... take a trip with Fry?' Amy said tilting her head to one side and raising and eyebrow. \"Oh! no no no ...\" Leela said waving a hand back and forth \"You see this morning the jerk made fun of my ass when I was bent over to check some cargo... so I was on my way to burn the tickets... but hey this is great! we can take a trip just for us! you know a girls getaway thing!\" Leela was almost giggling and getting giddy, she wasn't used to doing fun impulsive stuff like this. \"Wow... \" Amy said truly touched by Leela's generosity \"That actually sounds like fun...!\". Amy was starting to like the Leela here, this would give her a chance to readjust to this poor lifestyle and have fun on a nice vacation. \"Now remember I bought these thinking of what Fry would want but that still won't stop us from enjoying it.

The room had one very large bed, 3 dressers, 2 love seats, 2 chairs that looked like they could hold up to 6 people, 2 night tables with 2 bowls full to the rim with candies for them to snack on, and a fully furnished bathroom fit for 3 fat queens to share all at once. Leela walked into the room and saw its size and saw the bathroom and said she was going to take a short shower and then they could explore the rest of the ship. Amy hadn't noticed until then that Leela's ass had grown bigger then she remembered it being and she had gotten a small muffin top. Leela closed the door to the bathroom as she started to undress. A thought then entered Amy's head \"So does being poor make her and i hang out or something because she has gotten a little hefty, and i have been feeling off ever since i turned on the what if machine and came here.\" She walked over to one of the dressers and got a good distance to look at her full body, and what she saw mad let out a little scream. Her breasts had gotten bigger, she had a small paunch of a stomach that hung out a little, her hips had widened a little, and as she turned around to look at her ass it too had gone up in size and still defied gravity. She jiggled with  every few movements. She sighed and admitted this wasn't all that bad at least she had a fat ass and big tits, so she decided to change into something a little more comfortable from the clothes Leela gave her. She changed into a small blouse which was more like a tank top and a mini skirt which sorda rode up on her but, she didn't care she liked it. It was comfy to her, and as she admired her self in the mirror Leela came out of the bathroom completely nude not even trying to cover herself either. Amy saw her and her mind was completely over whelmed with the thought that Leela looked downright hot with her vulptroues curves completely uncovered her enormous ta-tas did not go unnoticed her small muffin top now hanging forward instead of all around,and Amy just sat there staring.</span></div></div>",

The word free had become so much more important to her than ever. She had grabbed free beads, free shirts, and free drinks whenever she could. Usually she wouldn't have trouble paying for it, but it's a different situation. In this case Amy had taken full advantage of the ships 24/7 buffet. Spending most of her day their stocking up on free food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeela became worried about Amy's overeating and the fact that she looks like she's getting fatter every time she sees her. Leela even recalled the 5th day when Amy had trouble fitting in the her pink sweat pants. The pants were fully stretched ti the limit and even had rips and tears across it. She didn't know what it was, but Leela felt that she had to confront Amy about her eating. Right......</span></span></div></div>",

Her parents then came in with their stereo-typical accents. <br>\r\n\"Hey fwat daughter, your fwat. When you get yourself a nice boyfriend. Your FWAT!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then left leaving Amy broken hearted. She began to dress herself in her pink track-suit her stomach hung slightly out of it. She scanned the room remembering what it looks like. She looked at the calender hanging in the corner of her room, the 11th of March. Today was the day she got her liposuction. She always wondered what her life would've been like if she never got the liposuction. There was a remote in the bed from the \"What-If-Machine\" lying their in her bed. She saw a fast forward button with an input for how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I wonder what I would look like if I stayed fat 'till 16\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed the button inputting it so she was on the same day but 6 years in the future. She pushed the button which she assumed activated the device which was a shiny red button. Once it clicked it gave off a warning message \"BZZT... WARNING PLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS FIRST AS SIDE AFFECTS MAY CON- BZZT\". \"Yea bleugh I know what the machine does, I've used it before\" Amy said smugly and confidently. What she didn't know was that Professor Farnsworth had modified the previous version but had accidentally forgot to fix an earlier bug where the things done by using the time machine will alter their present day selves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge green light blared around the room blinding Amy for a few seconds. When her vision returned to normal she looked down at herself. As a 10 year old she weighed 125 pounds. Now as a Sixteen year old she weighed a colossal.....</span></div></div>",

Her stomach had become the size of a beach-ball. Her breasts the size of basket balls. Her ass had also greatly increased in sized and was probably the biggest change of all as it looked as if she had whole turkeys in her trousers. She began to squeeze and search each curve on her body. She was dressed in a very revealling set of pajammas or at least was a long pajamma top and bottoms set at one point. They were now reduced to a bra with the size of her breasts. Her bottoms, now a skimpy pair of shorts because of her ass and big succulent thunder thighs. Amy looked into her full length mirror (this one however was modified to view Amy's whole body by tripiling the size of a regular one). Amy now saw that her face that once had acne was now clear and soft. She had a very prominent double chin with very plump cheaks. <br>\r\nShe then noted the glasses she was wearing, this was because of the laser eye surgery she had after her liposuction. Her hair was done up with a scrunchie in a sort of upwards ponytail style. In the reflection she caught a glimpse of diplomas and other awards, however instead of her various pony awards. She had various awards for most intelligent student. She also had a large pile of books. <br>\r\nShe soon realised what she was... a nerd. She realised how this had happened with her now superior intelligence. Without the liposuction she never had to worry about peoples opinion of her so she never really cared and buried herself in books now being able to create a future for herself without her parents money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Picture of what I think Amy looks like at this point &gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tubbytoon.deviantart.com/art/Sleepy-Teenage-Amy-116447238\" target=\"_blank\">http://tubbytoon.deviantart.com/art/Slee...</a>  )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interuppted by her parents yet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Willy...

Leela, slumped back in her seat, swung her foot forward hitting the leg of the table causing it to shake and Bender lost his footing crashing down onto the table then the floor. \"Hey you did that on purpose you big jerk!\" bender said getting up. \"Yep\" Leela said smiling. \"Now now calm down and ask a \"what if\" question before your bickering angers the \"what if\" gods!\" The Professer exclaimed while pointing up at a ketchup stain on the ceiling.

Upon entering, however, they were astonished to see a delicious-looking buffet covering the table! \"Something's wrong here,\" Leela said. \"This actually looks like food.\" \"Yeah, what gives, Bender?\" Fry asked. \"Did you rob a soup kitchen again?\" \"Nah, they locked the doors this time,\" Bender replied. \"I made all this myself! You guys enjoy while I get dessert started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the robot headed back into the kitchen, humming to himself. The crew looked at their meals with mouth-watering trepidation. \"So...\" Leela said, \"who takes the first bite?\" \"Well, according to your employee contracts,\" Hermes started, pulling out a thick stack of papers, \"section 42, subsection 7-G, paragraph 1138, line 867.530-9 states that in the event of the staff being served potentially lethal food or drink, the employee who queries about which of the staff members in attendance shall test said food or drink must test it him-or-herself. In other words: Get to chowin', ya one-eyed lab rat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering numerous vulgar and creative remarks about Hermes, his parentage, and his position on the evolutionary ladder under her breath, Leela speared a forkful of buggalo steak, closed her eye tight, and stuck the fork in her mouth. She chewed once...twice... Then her eye shot open so wide that for a brief moment it actually appeared to be larger than her skull. She frantically grabbed as much food as she could, heaping some onto her plate with one hand and shoving the rest into her mouth with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as Leela hadn't dropped dead yet, the rest of the crew carefully tried bites of their own platefuls...and immediately joined Leela in gorging themselves as fast as they could. The food disappeared at speeds to boggle the imagination. When Bender emerged from the kitchen a half-hour later, the table was clean. Everyone was sitting back in their chairs, licking fingers and rubbing stuffed bellies. \"Bender, that was amazing!\" Amy said, burping a little as she spoke. \"Indeed!\" Zoidberg added. \"I now know what it feels like to be full of things other than whatever that 'it' everyone keeps talking about is!\" The Professor mumbled something incoherent about probability and drifted off to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bender, I don't know how the hell you became such a great chef, but you gotta into business!\" Hermes said. \"And with a certain handsome bureaucrat to organize things for you, you could be even bigger than Elzar!\" \"A chance to humiliate my greatest idol <i>and</i> get rich doing so?\" Bender ruminated. \"I'll do it!\"</span></div></div>",
