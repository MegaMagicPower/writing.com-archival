A small growl made her blush. With Spike already leaving pretty early her breakfast was minuscule and she was still hungry, Twilight just hoped that Rarity wouldn't hear it. Said friend returned with an elegant and simple blue dress. Twilight put the dress on and Rarity started to work on it, putting needles here and there and taking some measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blushed as her stomach growled for food again. \"Sorry Rarity, I just had a slice of toast for breakfast.\" Rarity looked a little shocked at the volume of that growl at first, almost mistaking it for a timberwolf but recovered and gave her friend a reassuring smile. \"No problem my dear, maybe we can get something to eat after we're done.\" Twilight happily agreed to this plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Twilight assumed would be a quick session has already drawn out for two hours. Her stomach felt as if it was about to digest itself while Rarity just assured her that they were almost done, like she assured Twilight one hour ago. Everything started to look weirdly delicious by now, the dress, the yarn, even Rarity looked tasty to Twilight by now. Of course she knew that none of these things were edible, especially Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid unicorn mare dropped a ball of yarn which rolled behind her. Rarity, not bothering with magic for now, turned around and bent over to pick it up, giving Twilight a good view of her ass. Twilight blushed at the sight and her stomach demanded food again. Raritys plot looked delicious and she could even see the soft lips of her friends marehood. Twilight started to wonder how her friend tasted.</span></div></div>",

She turned around and looked at her friend. \"Twilight, I had no idea you felt like this for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight still couldn't believe what she just did herself but it was true that one could interpret it as a sexual advance.

She didn't even think of the sheer absurdity of eating another pony, all she cared about right now was to get something into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity started to panic, this couldn't be happening!

Rarity sensed a hint of hope at this, her friend may have gone crazy but she was still open for negotiations. \"I am very popular with the stallions and some of the lesbian mares, if I lured them to you they wouldn't think twice and you could eat all the ponies you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity grinned nervously while Twilight thought about the offer.</span></div></div>",

Come to think of it, that would explain why she would ever even consider cannibalism. Celestia continued her explanation. \"Luna and I are not really sisters, alicorns are a fusion of the element bearers. Luna and I only started to refer to each other as sisters because I taught her. well them how to use the elements of harmony and aided in the defeat of Discord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight never knew about this. Celestia and Luna were originally a group of ponies like herself and her friends? \"When the elements are used the bearers will someday develop a hunger for each other, that is because the elements are initiating the fusion. It starts out as a slight appetite at first but if you refuse to eat your friends you will become insanely hungry every time you just as much as hear their names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a lot for Twilight to take in. She would soon want to eat her friends? Thinking about it she had to admit that she felt a strange urge last time she helped Pinkie Pie bake. Dread started to fill her, Rarity was melting away in her stomach right now. \"Princess, I don't want my friends to die, is there nothing we can do to stop this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia gave her student a reassuring smile. \"Don't worry, they won't really die. Their souls will become one with yours, who eats whom only determines the dominant personality. As soon as Rarity is digested you will understand.\"</span></div></div>",

A few more moments passed, then the alicorn pulled away and looked Twilight in the eye. \"Rarity,\" she said, \"I need you to stay calm. It's not Twilight's fault she did what she did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight thought back to Celestia's explanation of their predicament. This, as it turned out, immediately filled Rarity in on every detail. <i><span class=\"cviolet\">\"Oh, Twilight, had I known I wouldn't have lashed out like that! But, I can't help but wonder...\"</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Princess? Rarity would like to know just why you didn't tell us this before.\" Celestia was visibly glad that the two ponies were eased enough to coordinate like that, but her answer was still morose. \"I'm afraid it didn't happen nearly as quickly when Luna and I became bound to the Elements. I thought it would be many more years before I had to share this ugly truth with you. I'm sorry. I only came here because I sensed one of the bearers was in grave danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed. \"It's okay, Princess, we understand.\" It was just then that Twilight and Rarity gained a new understanding of the traditional royal 'we'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you two will be all right on your own? I wish to stay and advise you, but my duties have me pressed for time.\" Twilight and Rarity silently deliberated for a moment. \"We'll manage.\", Twilight answered. \"Very well. Goodbye, my subjects.\" She paused. \"Or should I say 'sister'?\" And with that, she vanished in a flash of solar light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\"Twilight... I'm still getting used to this. Could you please look into the mirror for me?\"</i></span> Understanding, Twilight turned to the mirror and let Rarity take in the sight of her new body. Purple coat. Plus-sized horn. Pudgy belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\"Oh my. Did I really make that much of an impact on your figure? I can only imagine what we'll be like by the end of this.\"</i></span> Twilight thought on this for a moment, ultimately leading to a mental image of an obese Celestia failing to do a pushup. <span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\"Bwahahaha! Twilight, you are just </i>terrible!<i> You shouldn't think of your princess like that, you know!\"</i></span> Twilight blushed. <i>\"Heh, I'll have to get used to sharing every little thought.

I was working here, I skipped breakfast and was so hungry... then...\" Applejack still seemed to be in shock, staring at her own gut and wings in disbelieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight could understand Applejack too well. Even though eating Rarity seemed to be so easy when it happened, the aftermath hit her hard. <span class=\"cgrape\"><i>Thank you Twilight. </i></span> Twilight stepped in front of the muttering earth pony, turned pegasus and laid a hoof on her shoulder. \"Applejack, calm down. I know what happened, I did it myself... with Rarity.\" Applejack backed away from Twilight, shocked that she know and even more shocked that she has done it herself. Now she could also see that Twilight was somewhat taller and that her horn seemed to be longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the elements of harmony, they drive us to eat each other so we all can turn into an alicorn, the wings you have grown are a proof of it.\" Applejack looked at the wings on her back. Was this really what's going on? Did her element drive her to do this? She hasn't eaten that morning and she was very hungry by the time she came by. Then, after she accidentally spilled the applesauce on her... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gave AJ a sympathetic look. \"Who was it?\"</span></div></div>",

One of them cracked open and covered her in applesauce. Something in my mind clicked, suddenly she started to look so incredibly tasty... I ATE HER!\" She wailed, remembering what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Applejack heard was a loud crack. She turned around and saw Rainbow Dash, completely covered in applesauce and a broken barrel next to her. \"Is everything alright sugarcube?\" She asked and walked over to the soaked pegasus. She spit out a bit of the sauce and spread her dripping wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I just took a shower this morning.\" She complained. While Applejack looked at her friend, weird thoughts were forming in her mind. Rainbow Dash looked so... appetizing when she was covered in sauce. Applejacks stomach growled again, reminding her that she skipped breakfast. As if in a trance, Applejack got closer and closer to the complaining pegasus until she was almost face to face with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash now noticed how close Applejack was and how she was looking at her. AJ's eyes held some strange sort of hunger within them. \"Uh, is something wrong Applejack.\" The pegasus became more and more nervous as the earth pony inched closer to her. Rainbow was now backed into a corner, AJ still looking at her with the same hungry expression. \"What are you doing?\" She asked, her only answer being a lick across the cheek. Rainbow Dash blushed and tried to push Applejack back, but she was stronger than the pegasus. \"Stop it, I'm not into mares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was not interested in THAT though, Rainbow Dash tasted divine, better than anything AJ has ever tasted. Her judgement that this was one of her friends was clouded by hunger, instead she opened her mouth and took the entire head of her friend in with one gulp. Rainbow Dash screamed as she looked down the slimy throat. That scream was muffled as Applejacks lips clasped around her neck and she was sucked down. Rainbow Dash tried to put her hooves against the side of AJ's mouth to push herself out but her shoulders slipped into the mouth, locking her forelegs at her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash now spread her wings, trying to see if she could lift herself out of Applejacks mouth. AJ however just grabbed those wings and forced them down before her lips engulfed them. With her wings swallowed too, Rainbow could only kick with her hind legs, which did not only not help but made her descend even faster. Applejack pushed Rainbows flanks down her throat and slurped up her hind legs while the pegasus began to curl up in her belly. Soon Rainbow Dashs whole body was inside of AJ's stomach. She squirmed and struggled but nothing could help her to get out again. Eventually, she ran out of air and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate her... because of me she's dead.\" Applejack was close to tears. <span class=\"clblue\"><i>What are you talking about AJ, where are you and why can't I move?</i></span> Applejack turned around. \"Rainbow? What?\" Applejack thought that the guilt about eating her friend made her go insane. <i><span class=\"clblue\">Wait a second, you actually ate me? At least you feel bad about doing that.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and Rarity decided to tell them about this part. \"AJ, Rainbow Dash is digested but not dead.\" <i><span class=\"cgrape\">You should have probably worded that different.</span></i> Applejack just stared at Twilight in disbelieve. <i><span class=\"clblue\">Uh, is being digested not normally very lethal. Am I a ghost? How am I going to get into the Wonderbolts?</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smacked her own forehead. <i><span class=\"cgrape\">Careful, that hurts.</span></i> \"Well, Rainbow Dashs body is digested, but to merge us all into one alicorn, the elements of harmony allow us to merge our souls too. That's why you can hear Rainbow Dashs voice in your head.\" She explained to them. \"You only ate Rainbow because the elements made you do it. Soon you will feel the urge again, towards one of us. It is inevitable, one of us will eat the rest and we all become an alicorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash had to sit down. Was this really what awaited the wielders of the elements of harmony? They cannibalized each other and become some sort of hivemind alicorn? <i><span class=\"clblue\">Look AJ, I'm sorry. I didn't know the elements caused something like this. If you hadn't eaten me, I would have probably eaten you. Just, what about Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie? </span></i>Applejack voiced Rainbow Dashs thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were right, only one of them would remain uneaten. \"We could either get them first or...\" Twilights voice became shaky at the last part. \"One of us eats the other right now. It will happen sooner or later and I would rather get it over with as soon as possible. Even though I now know we will be together in the end it's just...\"</span></div></div>",

She felt a little guilty about what she'd done, but took solace in the fact that it was necessary. If she didn't eat AJ, AJ would've eaten her. That was the grim truth of their situation. As she felt the last of AJ's body melt away, becoming one with hers, Twilight attempted to tune out the world and listen to her own mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\">\"Hello? Hello!? Is anyone there?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cAgh! Not so loud!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cRarity? Is that you?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\">\u201cCan you guys stop shouting so much? It feels like the whole world just flipped over on itself.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\u201cThat you, Rainbow.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clteal\">Yeah. Still me. Still just a voice in the void,</span>\u201d she replied despondently. \u201c<span class=\"clteal\">By the way, is it me or do you guys feel, I don\u2019t know, smarter?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Come to think of it, I have noticed a little something.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cborange\">Wait\u2026 Is this cuz we\u2019re in Twilight now?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple mare giggled. \u201cThat would be my guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cborange\">Aww shoot. So Ah lost?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">You don\u2019t remember?</span>\u201d Rarity inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cborange\">Not especially. Ah think gettin\u2019 eaten threw me off a tad. Also the whole not havin\u2019 a body stuff.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clteal\">I can vouch for that.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clteal\">Likewise.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, girls,\u201d Twilight interjected. \u201cI just wanted to check on you. Is everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"corange\">Still not too sure, sugar cube. Think ya\u2019ll could have a look around?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded and looked around the familiar scenery of Sweet Apple Acres. As she did, she felt a sense of ease from one of the newest souls in her head.  That, in turn, seemed to spread to the other three and put them all in a sense of nostalgic relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"corange\">Did Ah jus\u2019 do that?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clteal\">Not sure what it was, but yeah. I think so.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Celestia said that our souls will eventually merge into one,</span>\u201d Rarity reminded. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">I can already hear all of your thoughts, so maybe feeling your feelings is part of it.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clteal\">Really? That\u2019s pretty cool.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cborange\">Hold on a second,</span>\u201d AJ cut in. \u201c<span class=\"corange\">So this is all leadin\u2019 ta us eventually becoming\u2019 an alicorn, right? Well, what happens after?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"corange\">Fer one thing, what are Granny, Big Mac, \u2018n\u2019 li\u2019l Apple Bloom gonna think about their sister bein\u2019 nothing but a voice in somepony\u2019s head?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Goodness, you\u2019re right! What about Sweetie Belle?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clteal\">And I\u2019m still peeved that I\u2019m never gonna be a Wonder Bolt!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy girls, easy.\u201d Twilight attempted to think calming thoughts of herself curling up with a nice book by the fire place. Whether or not the others found the scene as relaxing, it seemed to have an effect. \u201cWhen this is all done with, I guess, we\u2019ll have to make arrangements.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">What kind of arrangements?</span>\u201d inquired Rarity. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">My parents are still touring Equestria and Sweetie Belle has nowhere else to stay.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she can stay with me,\u201d Twilight offered, paying attention to Rarity\u2019s feelings on the matter. \u201cIf we\u2019re all going to be one, then I guess that means our family ties will as well. Sweetie, now that I\u2019m thinking about it, feels a lot like how I see Cadance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"corange\">Come ta think of it, Ah feel the same,</span>\u201d AJ added. \u201c<span class=\"corange\">Sweet li\u2019l filly\u2019s practically kin already.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRadiant warmth spread out from Rarity\u2019s consciousness, washing the others in her gratitude. A picture appeared in their thoughts. It wasn\u2019t clear who was thinking it, though. Maybe all of them? Twilight was hugging Sweetie and sending her off to school. Dresses would be strewn about the library as she sewed for a hobby. This was followed by a trip to Sweet Apple Acres where she would help with chores and chatter with the Apples. With her new wings she\u2019d fly faster than ever before, doing Sonic Rainbooms for fun. Less prominent were the imaginings of her visiting Sugar Cube Corner or looking after Fluttershy\u2019s animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"corange\">Ya\u2019ll feel that?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clteal\">Yeah. From now on, whenever somepony asks \u2018Did you feel that?\u2019 the answer is always gonna be \u2018yes.\u2019</span>\u201d Rainbow replied with far less snark than expected. It sounded like she was just putting on an act, but deep down she was starting to come to terms with things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">So we\u2019ll all be one, then,</span>\u201d Rarity summarized. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">We\u2019ll share the same family, interests, responsibilities, and, of course, our body.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"corange\">So we\u2019ll be poopin\u2019 from the same butt?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Eww!</span>\u201d As Rarity retreated in revulsion, AJ and Rainbow began snickering at her expense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt a bit disgusted, but mostly found the situation funny. Was this how things were going to be from now on? They\u2019d all just keep feeling and thinking alike until it became impossible to tell one from the other?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clteal\">Hold on. Let me try something.</span>\u201d And Rainbow proceeded to remember every dirty magazine she had hidden under her bed. Most of them were of scantily clad mares in alluring poses, but there were a few stallions here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgh! Rainbow!\u201d Twilight cried out in alarm, feeling her new wings suddenly turn rigid as a fire burned in her nether regions. \u201cDon\u2019t, ugh, do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"clteal\">Do what?</span>\u201d Rainbow asked, feigning innocence. \u201c<span class=\"clteal\">Oh wait. Did you mean\u2026 this!?</span>\u201d She threw her weaponized fantasies at the others. Soarin, Spitfire, and the rest of the Wonder Bolts necking with wreckless abandon, carrying out terribly lewd acts in the showers, locker rooms, and everywhere else Rainbow had ever imagined.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Sweet Celestia, that stallion is hung!</span>\u201d Rarity exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"corange\">Don\u2019t look!</span>\u201d AJ begged. \u201c<span class=\"corange\">Yer jus\u2019 makin\u2019 it worse!</span>\u201d Try as she might, even in her non-corporial state, the former farmer felt the familiar tingle of arousal, an itch begging to be scratched. Except the body needing scratching wasn\u2019t hers, but Twilight\u2019s. \u201c<span class=\"corange\">This is so confusin\u2019!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Twilight agreed, feeling flushed and breathless. Her thighs were grinding together in a futile effort to stem the tide of heat, but she knew it wouldn\u2019t last long. Rainbow\u2019s sexual fantasies had caused a kind of feedback loop with her mind\u2019s many occupants, leading to a perpetual cycle of arousal. Something had to be done.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, while height and horn might be important attributes, they were hardly as obvious as an earth pony with wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at Sugarcube corner, they found a rather unusual sight- Pinkie staring contemplatively at a banner, which had the words \"Congratulations on\" written along the left side.

At that Twilight began to consider her unintended, and unwilling, meal. Rarity was being squeezed closely enough in her tight digestive sac that she couldn't focus her magic or even move. Her belly had taken in an entire pony and yet she didn't feel particularly over stuffed like she had that time with the Apples, daresay she might even have room for seconds. \" Sooooo... Twilight,\" Lyra's voice suddenly broke into her thoughts, \"Yeah Lyra?\" Twilight said. \"I'm here for a dress I asked Rarity to make for a date, I see it's right there,\" Lyra explained, then pointed her hoof at a beautiful, soft blue, simple dress that was one of the ones Rarity had made with Twilight earlier, it of course perfect for the green unicorn, \"but, do you know where she is so I can pay her, thank her, and leave?\". Twilight mentally sniggered at the question, but then grew nervous again at what would happen if Lyra got suspicious, her stomach suddenly churned and gurgled, its occupant having passed out earlier, though from shock at the unsavory conditions of her confines rather than lack of air. As her stomach began to rub digestive acids into her fashionista friend, Twilight considered her options, on one hoof, she could eat Lyra too, eliminating any possibility of her suspicion but also raising possible questions on her sudden girth. On the other hoof, she could lie to her, and possibly concoct a story to explain her friend's...\"disappearance\".

Turning, she saw Rarity's little sister rub the sleep out of her eyes, apparently having been sleeping in. \"(Yawn) what are you doing here?\" Sweetie Belle asked, not noticing the bulge of her sister in Twilight's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, I was helping Rarity with modeling some dresses, then Lyra came in to get one Rarity had made for her, and I was just seeing her out, I'm sorry, did I wake you?\" Twilight explained, trying to sound casual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle nodded, her eyes drooping sleepily. As her gaze lowered, Sweetie Belle caught sight of Twilight's engorged belly, causing her to ask tiredly, \"Twilight, why's your tummy so big?, and where is Rarity?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip, Twilight was about to try lying again when her belly suddenly gurgled deeply, signalling that Rarity was starting to digest, acid being rubbed into her, beginning the process of turning her into fat and nutrients. Air left her gurgling gut as a loud belch, causing Sweetie Belle to giggle a bit. Twilight blushed and rubbed her stomach, which now felt a bit roomier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Twilight turned her attention back to Sweetie Belle, she noticed that her Rarity were quite alike, and started wondering if they <i>tasted</i> alike. <i>\"Hmmmm...well, I guess a snack couldn't hurt,\"</i> Twilight thought gluttonously, and smacked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, Twilight, are you okay?\" Sweetie Belle questioned. Nodding, Twilight advanced on the filly, her stomach growling ominously. \"Oh I'm fine Sweetie Belle, and to answer your questions, my stomach's so big because I got <i>really</i> hungry when I was helping Rarity a moment ago, and ate her, and now I think I could use something \"sweet\" as a second course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the filly could respond, Twilight lifted Sweetie Belle into the air and deposited her straight into her mouth. Her mouth bulging with Sweetie's head, forelegs, and stomach, Twilight relished in the delectable flavor, sucking and slurping as she savored. Deciding to be quick in eating her, Twilight began gulping, pulling Sweetie Belle's front into her throat, then her middle. Momentarily licking up a last bit of the filly's flavor, Twilight then gave a final heavy gulp, sending Sweetie Belle's legs and tail into her mouth and then down her throat with the rest of her. Feeling the struggling young unicorn cascade into her belly and join her digesting sister, Twilight burped again and rubbed her paunch, enjoying the feelings of Sweetie Belle inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach groaning louder, Twilight double-checked everything, then teleported to her library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Pop!) Twilight, and her gut's passengers, appeared in the middle of the first floor of the Golden Oaks Library, aka, Twilight's home, the unicorn's engorged gut cushioning her as she flopped to the floor. \"Twilight, please, let us out!\" Sweetie Belle cried from within. Prodding her gut, which was showing a distinctly filly-like imprint, Twilight smirked. \"Sorry Sweetie Belle, you and Rarity are staying, I was just too hungry and you two tasted <i>sooo</i> good. Hmmm, I wonder if other ponies taste as good?\" Twilight wondered and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing Spike was out on a long errand, Twilight decided to read <i><u>Mild to Moderate Mental Spells and Emotional Enchantments</u></i>, a book she had just received a copy of from the Canterlot Library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Twilight read, with the book on the floor and her on her side on a cushion, Twilight's stomach gurgled and grumbled, getting steadily smaller and smaller. By the time Spike returned, Twilight's belly had shrunken down to half the size of a bread loaf, most of Sweetie Belle and Rarity having been converted into fat for the predatory unicorn. Not noticing the change, due to Twilight having changed to reading the book upright in front of her, Spike decided not to disturb her, tiptoeing upstairs to nap. As for Twilight, she was almost done with the long and detailed spell book, barely registering Spike's return. Her reading ended when her stomach growled, having finished digesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling at the hungry rumble, Twilight set down her book and inspected herself. The combination of Sweetie Belle and Rarity had fattened Twilight up considerably, her belly now had a thick layer of pudge on it, which rippled when she stood up and moved her head to look a herself. Her body had gained weight, her face rounder, her legs and thighs thicker, and had the beginnings of a second chin. Most of all though, Twilight's rump had grown, her buttcheeks like two purple balls pressed together, jiggling as Twilight moved her rear up to observe. Blushing, Twilight began to wonder what to do next involving her new predatory inclinations...</span></div></div>",

Pinkie slowly trotted next to Twi, not noticing the purple unicorns' large rarity-filled belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY TWILIGHT!\" The pink pony chirped and Twilight jumped back a few feet, shocked beyond belief. It took her a few seconds to relax before frowning and releasing a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, hello Pinkie Pie. How many times have I told you not to sneak up on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty-seven! Anyway I've been lookin' for you Twi! I have this really really long but great story involving Rainbow Dash, me, and a tub full of whipped cream! I WAS going to tell Rarity but...she wasn't home. Oh well!\" A look of worry overtook Twi when Pinkie mentioned Rarity's name, but that was quickly washed away as Pinkie began her story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Twilight wanted to leave and go get something to eat, she didn't want to disappoint her friend, so there she stood listening to Pinkie and ignoring the hunger pains. How long could her story be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>20 Minutes Later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight couldn't take it any more! Pinkie was still going on her story and she didn't seem to be stopping anytime soon. Not only that, but Twilight's hunger was even worse now! Twi clutched her stomach as it growled loudly for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Uuggghhh...I so hungry I could eat another pon....</i> A devilish smile spread across Twi's face. She cleared her throat to get Pinkie's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Twilight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie, do me a favor and hold still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anypony had been around they would've heard the events of a struggle, slurping noises, and then finally a satisfied belch. Twilight layed on her back moaning in pure pleasure as Pinkie pie struggled and moved inside her stomach.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight was late, how did she hate being late. Her hooves pounded against the pavement as she made a break for Sweet Apple Acres, her friend Applejack having requested she be there almost ten whole minutes ago! Her nervousness was only strengthened by the fact that she forced herself to skip the breakfast she had made just moments earlier to make up for lost time. Her gallop slowly came to a canter as she entered the gates of the apple farm. Looking around she spied her orange friend on the top of a nearby hill, kicking the ripe fruit off of the last tree in the orchard. Twilight quickly ran up the hill, \"Hello Applejack!\" she exclaimed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there sugarcube,\" Her friend exclaimed with a tip of her hat, \"Yer just in time, finished buckin' for today\". Applejack pushed the last bucket full of apples, and the two friends made idle chit chat as Twilight was back to the large barn at the center of the farm. As the pair walked inside Applejack closed the doors and looked around to make sure no one was in here. before speaking once more, \"Twilight, the reason Ah called y'all here is about... Mah appetite\" She said softly. Twilight looked at her with a confused expression, what could she mean? \"I always git made of because of how much I eat, and I'm tired of it! Don't you have any spells to make a pony less hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact Twilight had been working on such spells recently, spells to make a pony less hungry or more hungry, \"Of course Applejack! I haven't tested these spells though, but I would be glad to try them.\" She began to formulate the spell in her mind, horn glowing brightly before Applejack waved her hooves, yelling for her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah appreciate it Twilight, but in case something went horribly wrong Ah wouldn't want to be the one in danger, maybe you could practice a little bit?\" Twilight thought this over in her head, the purple unicorn knew her friend had a point. Twilight figured why wait to do a test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Applejack, I'll just use myself as the guinea pig for the first test.\" Applejack looked at her nervously as her horn began to glow brightly and her body was covered in a bright light. Twilight winced slightly as she felt a small pressure in her abdomen, but was surprised to feel her hunger from this morning fade away completely. \"See AJ? All went perfectly,\" She laid a hoof on her friend's shoulder, \"Now for the hunger enhancing spell.Twilight repeated the process with a few minor changes in how she set the magic up, and as the spell took effect she felt the pressure release and relax. She smiled, and began to speak again \"See, no side eff-\" But cut herself off when she felt her empty stomach let out a loud growl of hunger. She doubled over in pain as her hunger grew as the spell took full effect. In her pain filled state she levitated the bucket of apples closer, and opened her mouth wide to take a bit but was surprised as her mouth stretched farther than it possibly could have. She took the entire apple into her mouth and swallowed, to her surprise she didn't choke, but the apple slid down he throat and landed in her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack stared in surprise as she watch Twilight's throat stretch to accommodate a whole apple, she backed away slightly. \"Twilight... What did y'all do?\" Twilight made a noise that sounded like a purr, she liked that feeling, she liked it a lot! She poked the slight bulge the apple made in her belly before she picked up two more and stuffed them in her face, swallowing again and stroking her throat as the two apples joined the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" She grinned as she levitated apple after apple and swallowed them one by one until she lay on her back, stomach bulging outward with apples. Letting out a loud belch her stomach began to gurgle loudly, acids filling her apple stuffed belly. \"I'm still a little bit hungry...\" She looked around, trying to find something else to eat, her eyes settled on Applejack. At first she was surprised about this line of thought, Applejack was a pony, not food! But then again, she had just eaten an entire bushel of apples and was still hungry, maybe...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight was not just an avid reader of books. Coming to discover that Manehattan had a publisher that networked and distributed scholarly journal magazines from all walks of life, she had taken to their subscriptions--all of them, and was currently reading one about psychology. It was tied with her study of friendship, as it was dealing with a discussion on trust. It was a long read, but the generalized idea of it was that being invited to spend time in another pony's house and then bedroom was a sign of trust, and the elaborate on a theory and several other models of psychology that tied with it. It mentioned that the level of trust it showed was different from pony to pony. Some ponies trust easily, and let new friends into their homes easily. Others are harder. It also acknowledged that a pony can be warm to strangers and friends without necessarily taking this step of trust and inviting friends into their homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt interested Twilight because, as she finished it and considered the material, she realized that she'd been in everypony's homes, including Fluttershy's... but not Rainbow Dash. Out of her friends, Rainbow Dash was the only pony who hadn't invited anypony else into her home that she knew of, aside from Gilda, who had been a friend in school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow also knew that Twilight could walk on clouds now, if she wanted to, so considering that loyalty and trust were very different things fundamentally, she started wondering if Rainbow trusted her a lot or not. Oh sure, Rainbow would trust her with her life, she figured, but Twilight didn't know just how much Rainbow could trust other ponies with her emotions and feelings of insecurity, which she hid well and sometimes dangerously so... Twilight hadn't forgotten Rainbow's panic attack in Cloudsdale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a side note, Twilight's article had referenced some old folktale about a powerful fairy pony who was sick from a germ, and had to trust an Earth pony to shrink down, enter her, and remove the germ. The fairy pony had been mistrusting, but had eventually allowed the Earth pony to enter her, not to save her life, but because she grew to care for the Earth pony. Twilight had of course read this same folktale and found it charming, if a little weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight decided to visit Rainbow Dash. She left a note for Spike to tell him where she'd be while he was out doing errands for her. She stepped out into Ponyville and started trotting to the outskirts, where Rainbow's cloud home hovered near the roadside. She looked up at it and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet she'll be surprised!\" she said and then cast the spell on herself that would enable her to walk on clouds. She then broke off a small chunk of the cloud with her magic and levitated it down to ground level, stepped on it, and then levitated it back up to Rainbow's home and nudged it back into place. She trotted along the soft cloud surface and approached Rainbow's home. She knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened, so Twilight knocked again loudly, and waited. Frowning, she began to wonder if Rainbow wasn't even home before Rainbow peaked her head out of a high window. \"Twi? What on earth are you doing... up here?\" she asked. Her voice sounded funny. Twilight wondered if something was wrong.</span></div></div>",

Twilight heard Rainbow coughing lightly from above--she was obviously trying to cover up the fact. The pegasus returned to the windowsill and smiled down at Twilight. \"Thanks for checking up on me,\" she called down hoarsely. \"I'm just reading. You can go back to the library now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight frowned. \"Rainbow, can I come in and hang out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow looked puzzled, even from the height difference between the two ponies. \"Come in? Um why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just said I wanted to spend time with you silly,\" said Twilight. \"I've never been to your house; I thought it would be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow looked a little nervous. \"Umm now is not really a good time...\" she said and then began to cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow it really sounds like you're sick!\" said Twilight, becoming a little concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeaaah I'm sick,\" said the pegasus and began to make a fake, exaggerated cough that amusingly soon changed into actual coughing that was bad enough that the poor pegasus fell from the window and fell down onto the soft, plush cloud. Twi had gasped and only had enough time to jump out of the way. She got up to her hooves and mentally berated herself for not thinking to just catch her friend with magic and was furious at herself for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh Rainbow are you alright?\" said Twi, worried. \"Oh please be okay, I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine,\" said Rainbow getting up onto her hooves and shaking her wing. \"Wing hurts a little. But it isn't like I haven't fallen before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your wing broken again?\" asked Twilight, holding her hoof up to check the wing, but Rainbow extended it up and out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fell on a cloud knucklehead,\" said Rainbow. \"It\u2019s just a little sore.\" She retracted her wings and opened her front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow, why don't you want to hang out, I mean I know you're sick but I could help take care of you,\" said Twilight, a concerned look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow paused at the door and looked between Twilight and the interior of her home nervously. \"Um yeaaah, see the thing is Twilight that I don't really let other ponies into my home, even if they are pegasi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Twilight. \"I mean, I guess it isn't really any of my business but, don't you think it\u2019s a little strange that I've been to everypony's home but yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow shifted uncomfortably. \"It\u2019s nothing personal, just, something I feel uneasy about. Sometimes. I mean the last person I really let in her was Gilda, and that was a year ago, and she couldn't afford a motel room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said Twilight. \"Well if it makes you that uncomfortable I'll just leave. But if you change your mind, I'm sure you can trust me in your home.\" Twilight gave a little smile and then turned to leave.</span></div></div>",

Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's just, I don't know I feel sort of... I guess vulnerable?\" asked Rainbow Dash. \"You know, with someone who can look at my stuff and make fun of it? Gilda kind of made fun of my home and that didn't really help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight frowned. \"You know I wouldn't judge you over something silly like your home, Rainbow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay, just come in, I'm starting to get shaky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight trotted past Rainbow and into her home, while the pegasus had a fit of coughing. Twilight looked around. It was very spacious and regal, with columns of cloud and water running down the side of one of the walls into a pool, but there wasn't much in the way of decor and the place had a sort of lonely feel to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My home isn't exactly awesome enough,\" grunted Rainbow, recovering from her fit. \"Uhm, I was gonna make some tomato soup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make it for you,\" said Twilight, smiling. \"You just get yourself up to bed. And I think your home is incredible! It\u2019s very... I think it is almost introspective, solemn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow twisted her face up. \"Oh great so now I'm boring...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's how I feel about the Canterlot Palace,\" said Twilight with a slight tinge of annoyance, but this seemed to cheer up Rainbow. \"Oh, well, heh.\" Rainbow looked around her own home a little and smiled, then trotted upstairs to her bedroom. Twilight navigated Rainbow's kitchen, finding that it was well equipped and surprisingly clean for how lazy Rainbow was, but she also noticed it was very empty. Rainbow suddenly realized that Rainbow probably never cooked at home, at least not often, and so there were hardly any messes. She found tomato soup in the pantry, condensed and packaged in the factory yards off Manehattan, and mixed it with a little milk and put it on the stove. It ran on electric using a small thunder-cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poured the soup when it was done and headed upstairs, finding that Rainbow was indeed reading in her bed. She was reading a Daring Do book that Twilight swore the pegasus had read at least 3 times now. For a pony who had gained a new love of... reading... she certainly didn't seem to read any new material. Twilight figured she'd need to try and expand her horizons sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soup time,\" Twilight said and approached. Rainbow was having another coughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eurlg, my body is achey,\" she fussed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sat down next to Rainbow's bed and levitated the soup onto Rainbow's nightstand. \"So where are you in the book?\"</span></div></div>",

Twilight smiled, thinking she knew what part Rainbow was at, where Daring Do meets a blonde pony and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um it's the part where Daring Do gets swallowed by the ten foot tall amazoness unicorn,\" said Rainbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight paused, her mouth a little open as she stared in surprise. \"Oh... It's just, well, you seem embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes me a little uncomfortable,\" said Rainbow, making a sort of pouty duck face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" asked Twilight, eyebrow cocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow had another coughing fit, \"Nevermind... It's stupid, really dumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well, okay,\" said Twilight, a little off-put. She started looking around the room. Rainbow had a lot of Wonderbolt's paraphernalia. Lots of posters, a few figurines, some of them with brushable hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are neat, those were the wonderbolts back when our parents were fillies right?\" asked Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow looked up from her book and her frown deepened. \"Yeah... Mom talked about them a ton when I was a filly... Gilda made fun of them, said they were dolls with hair... I just sort of joked with her, but... I kind of hid them away after that. Didn't put them back up for about a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt a little sad about that. Rainbow seemed to have a lot she was insecure about for one reason or another. It was probably why she was so aggressive when she was outdoors and came across as selfish and uncaring. Twilight was beginning to wonder if half of Rainbow's attempts at trying to be cool was because that was just sort of expected of her by everyone and she wanted to continue to fit her niche for simplicities sakes. But Twilight had just been reading psychology, so of course she was in the mood to overthink her friend's quirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight noticed that as Rainbow was reading this \"uncomfortable section\" that the pegasus was constantly bouncing her legs at the knees. Rainbow was getting antsy and excited. Normally if Twilight read something that made her uneasy it made her hold still and look serious, but Rainbow was fidgeting and blushing. Her wings were also fully extended against the pillow and bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your wing still hurting?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Rainbow asked and then noticed her wings were extended, and her blush became very red as the fur along her cheeks fluffed up and exposed the reddenend skin. \"Oh... oh gosh, jeez.\" She folded them back against her body. This little nuance mystified Twilight. Rainbow looked like she was sweating now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the fever getting worse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to read, can you stop asking me so many questions?\" snapped Rainbow breathily. She started to cough again. Twilight rolled her eyes and headed into the bathroom, taking a washcloth and a glass comveniently left by the sink, filling both with cool water. She brought it out to Rainbow, who took them with a blush and a kind of guilty look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Twi... you're a really good friend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled. \"Thank you. Now, how about that soup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure... but, um, Twilight, can I tell you something?\" </span></div></div>",

A little selfish beast inside of her was jumping for joy as she was seeing this as a sign that the psychology journal had been correct. Being inside Rainbow's home and room was making her friend open up to her in new ways, and that was exciting! She was eager to see what she would learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This part of the book turns me on,\" said Rainbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight almost fell over. \"Uhm... Say that again?\" she said with an incredulous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow shot her a glare. \"Don't... don't laugh at me! I just told you my darkest... oh forget it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis apparently was quite serious. Twilight looked down at the floor, feeling bad and wondering how to handle something like this. \"I'm sorry, Rainbow. Um, you can continue if you want. I promise I won't laugh again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow looked at her with a disbelieving look, but even though she was upset, she had already sprung her secret and needed to finish it or leave an uncomfy part of her unaddressed between her and Twilight, forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow sighed. \"Twilight... this really isn't easy for me to say.

Instead, she just hangs her head, trying to find the words she needs to say. Twilight moves closer and lays a hoof an her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Rainbow Dash, you can tell me. I'm here for you.\" Whatever it was that Dash had to say, Twilight would do her best to be supportive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow took a deep breath. \"Sometimes, I...imagine being swallowed like in the book. Pulled deep within and curled up inside a stomach.\" She gulped once. \"I know what happens to food, and being digested sounds horribly painful. But you know the time before that? Being gently squeezed, swaying as the pony walked. How warm and comfortable it would be. I just-\" She shuddered slightly. \"It really turns me on, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded slowly, her face showing a frown. Not from disapproval, but in thought. A being wanting to be eaten goes against natural selection. So how could such a fetish evolve? Are sexual interests not genetics, but instead based on outside sources? So many questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash took one look at Twilight's face before turning away. \"...That's how it is, then, huh?\" Dash stood up, hoping for a few minutes alone in the bathroom to collect her thoughts about the friendship she probably just screwed up. Her internal musing was interrupted by Twilight's hoof, now on her shoulder, keeping her from leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dash, wait. Its okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Rainbow cocked her head a bit. \"You mean, you don't find me weird? Its not strange at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Rainbow.\" Twilight gave her a small smile as she sat down. Dash followed suit. \"It may not be the most normal urge I've heard of, but its certainly far from the strangest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What could be weirder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight thought back to when she found out about Big Mac's love of dickmares. \"I'd really rather not talk about it.\" She said before giggling. \"But seriously, I don't think any less of you for having a fetish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash smiled a bit. \"Thanks, Twi. That really means a lot.\" A sudden round of coughing reminded both mares that Rainbow is indeed still sick. Twilight helped her to her bed, before floating the glass of water over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really ought to eat something, yourself\" Twilight said. She returned the glass back to the night stand when Dash was done with it, and replaced it with the bowl of tomato soup. Rainbow Dash rolled her eyes, but put up no fight, and began consuming the soup.</span></div></div>",

Rainbow heard the noise, and visibly squirmed slightly, what with her mind still fresh on the precious topic. Truth be told, Twilight hadn't gotten much to eat before heading over, and was getting a bit...hungry...herself. Suddenly, she had an idea, something that she could do to really show Dash how much she cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Twi?\" Rainbow was looking away. Her blush was coming back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a thought on something you might enjoy.\" Twilight hopped up onto the bed and sat lightly on top of Rainbow's chest. \"If you want to, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash turned back and was rewarded with a view of Twilight's stomach and nothing else. \"What do you me-\" She started, but was interrupted by another loud growl from the unicorn's belly. \"You're not suggesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight leaned in and nuzzled Dash's cheek. \"There are a few spells that we can use. One of which will keep you safe during your stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash gulped again as she stared into the purple mare's midsection. As if the stomach itself could react, it voiced its opinion a third time. It was almost like Twilight's belly was begging for her to fill it. Her thought process caused her to squirm in excitement. </span></div></div>",

Rainbow started on a belly rub for the purple unicorn, wanting to feel the outside of the space she longed to fill. \"Alright, let me prepare things first.\" With that, Twilight backed off a bit, and her horn lit up. Another lavender glow surrounded her mouth, before visibly moving down her throat and illuminating her midsection. Finally, after a few short seconds, it faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare looked back up at her meal. \"All set.\" She leaned in and started a singe lick on Rainbow's cheek, moving upwards as she tested the taste, and ending with a small peck on the forehead. Twilight moved back just enough to speak, her hot breath hitting the pegasus's face. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all the emotions playing through Rainbow Dash's head, she kept her tough attitude showing. \"I was born ready!\" she comments. If she was planning on adding anything else, she didn't get the chance. Met with Rainbow's enthusiasm, Twilight moved in a final time, now with her mouth open. Her jaw stretched over Dash's face as if it was rubber, and her first spell cast was proven a success. With her friend's head in her mouth, Twilight held for a few moments. She caressed Rainbow's cheeks with her tongue, and sucked lightly at the neck. Dash moaned lightly, and made a small effort to push forwards, eager to continue the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight pulled back, dragging Rainbow with her up into a sitting position. Then, with her mouth widening, pushed forwards, moving the cyan pegasus's shoulders in and giving Dash her first contact with her throat. Having met and passed the biggest hurdle of the process, Twilight pushed forwards again, taking in a considerable amount more. Dash found her front legs pinned, as well as the base of her wings. The muscles surrounding her squeezed and pulled in a soft, rhythmical massage, and she shuddered at the feeling. A few light swallows had Rainbow sliding slowly as more and more of her body was taken in. Soon, her head reached a ring, stopping momentarily despite her body still on its way. A light push and an opening appeared, taking in the accepted meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite making no attempt at doing so, Twilight's tongue brushed across Rainbow's nethers. For a moment, Twilight was worried her friend would become angry, as that area is typically off-limits even to close friends. Instead, she was rewarded with a moan from inside. Twilight would have giggled at her own thought process if she could; this <i>whole procedure</i> would likely fall outside the bounds of a typical close friendship. All that in mind, Twilight paused her swallowing to give Dash some extra attention. The blue body half inside her shuddered at first, before squirming slightly. Far from wanting to stop, Twilight could feel Rainbow pushing herself closer, grinding on Twilight's tongue as it did the job. Her chest vibrated with whatever Rainbow moaning. Twilight couldn't understand it, but it didn't sound angry or upset. After a few minutes of stimulation, Dash's body struck ridged, before lying limp, with an occasional quiver moving along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in her throat, Twilight could feel Dash's chest expanding and contracting as the tomboyish mare panted heavily. Deeming this step over, Twilight continued the process. A few quick swallows later, and she had Rainbow's back legs resting on her tongue. Rainbow herself had started curling up, preparing to take advantage of every bit of space in the tight stomach. With one final swallow, and a decently audible 'gulp', the rest of Rainbow Dash went down, save for a multicolored tail that was half being slurped down by Twilight, and half pulling itself in after its owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking her jaw a bit, which despite the rubber spell was still a bit sore from the experience, Twilight rolled onto her back and lied on the bed of the mare in her belly and gave a content sigh. \"Rainbow Dash, you are truly delicious,\" she commented as she rubbed the extended stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the confined space, Dash gave a slight chuckle, before a sigh of her own. The walls continued what the throat started, squeezing genitally before loosening up and repeating. \"Thanks, Twi.\" She finally said, as she closed her eyes. The stomach around her was doing everything right to lull her to sleep, and her being sick only added on to that. \"I mean it.\" She clarified, before losing consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight levitated the blanket to cover herself. The full belly was putting strain on her own ability to stay awake, and she decided not to fight it. She could feel her stomach rumble and churn, rubbing not digestive acid onto her friend, but a sort of nutrient liquid. After filling the first part of her digestive track with oxygen, and removing the likely horrible scents that would exist, temporarily re purposing her stomach was the forth and final spell. If she was going to be holding Rainbow internally anyway, she had figured, the least she could do is act as a sort of healing incubator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf all things held correct, Twilight would awake after a long nap with a slight urge to vomit Dash back up, and Dash would come out no worse for wear and actually closer to being over her flu.</span></div></div>",

She groaned and rolled away from them to try and get some more sleep, her bloated stomach flopping onto the bed with an irritated gurgle. Twilight, now that she wasn't being blinded anymore, sighed contentedly and snuggled down into the covers to get some more sleep. Another restful silence settled over the room, broken every so often by a particularly loud groan as Twilight's meal was processed further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the morning, the librarian finally woke up enough to start to realize things. \"Wait... These aren't my covers,\" Twilight mumbled. She opened her eyes and peered around. \"...This isn't my room, either.\" Suddenly the events from last night flooded her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up with a gasp, her swollen gut spreading her hind legs apart, and threw back the blanket with a sense of dawning horror. \"Oh Celestia, Rainbow!\" She tentatively prodded the pregnant looking bulge, feeling several large, hard shapes in her lower intestine and eliciting another unhappy noise from deep in her guts. She gulped and casted a life detection spell on the room, but only found one occupant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, how could this have happened?\" Twilight's eyes filled with tears as she rubbed her swollen stomach. \"I-I guess I didn't cast the wake-up spell right.\" She sniffled before gritting her teeth and smacking her paunch. \"Stupid! I'm so- Ohhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight moaned in a mixture of pain and pleasure as her stomach roiled angrily at being jostled, something moving farther down within her. It all came to a head as the unicorn leaned forward, clutching her belly, before a loud burst of gas blasted out of her anus. Twilight coughed as the scent of digested pony filled the room, forcing out another cloud of toxic gas. \"Eww, that's awful.\" She rubbed her nose. \"I guess I know where all the air went...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's stomach rumbled again, solid waste flowing in to fill the spaces previously occupied by the gas. She winced and started to make her way to Rainbow's bathroom to let her former friend out. </span></div></div>",

Twilight beamed at Rainbow as she covered herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt bubbly inside as she made her intentions clear. Oh this would be so exciting, and such a sign of trust between her and Rainbow Dash, and she could show just how great of a friend she could be! And she didn't have any doubts that Rainbow could do it... ponies often opened their jaws quite wide spontaneously, and she'd seen Pinkie eat large cakes the size of fillies in single bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Twilight asked in a husky voice. \"Do you want a filly to eat or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow stared wide-eyed but excited and eager.</span></div></div>",

Her mouth hung open as she looked up and down her friend, salivating quickly and beginning to bounce her knees again. \"Omigosh omigosh omigosh, you're really turning me on Twilight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight giggled and blushed. \"I'm glad! You know, I bet a little fun like this will really bring us closer together..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you making a bad joke?\" Rainbow asked with a smirk and then scooted forward, giving Twilight an experimental lick. \"Mmm!\" She sighed and rolled her eyes up in her head. She recalled the time that Applejack had become tiny from that weird plant in the forest, and how she had gone home that night and clopped to the thought that, for a split moment, she could have just eaten her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here was the opportunity again. That was, unless Twilight was just trying to turn her on for fun. Rainbow gave Twilight as straight face again and studied that eager expression, then cocked her brow. \"Twilight, I'm pretty serious... I'm not goofin'. I really do want to put your whole body in my stomach... right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In ten seconds flat?\" asked Twilight. \"I could even measure it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" Rainbow sneered and gave Twilight's horn a suckle, which made Twilight squirm and nibble her lips. A pleasant little balloon of excitement and affection welled within the unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow, I would be honored if you would swallow me whole,\" said Twilight, looking fondly at the chin and neck of the pegasus suckling her horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow pulled away, smacking her lips. \"Yeah?\" she said and threw the blanket off of her and lifted her legs out of bed. Her nethers glistened and her scent perfumed the air. Rainbow wiggled her rump.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rainbow's forelegs touched onto the floor, pressing on either side of Twilight. She gave her friend a good lick on the chin, and Twilight pressed into it. She was getting excited herself. She had wanted to improve her relationship with Rainbow Dash, and soon they'd be closer than ever, in multiple senses. Twilight giggled excitedly, resisting the urge to begin prancing around the room, trying to keep herself settled so she could think about this from multiple angles, psychologically, emotionally, scientifically--there was so much she was about to learn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as Rainbow's tongue moved over her cheeks and suckled on her mane, and then Rainbow gave Twilight a loving, sweet look of thanks just before opening her mouth very wide, tongue lolling out invitingly and then pressed forward to cover Twilight's vision. The unicorn gave a little gasp as she felt Rainbow's tongue touch the underside of her chin, guiding her face forward. Twilight closed her eyes as she felt her muzzle press into the back of the pegasus's throat. She murred and turned her face forward, giving Rainbow an easier time with Twilight's horn. Her horn pushed its way into Rainbow's gullet and the pegasus was left to lick and slather Twilight's face in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow began to murmur something around her friend, and Twilight grinned as she soon realized that Rainbow was trying to swear the f-word repeatedly while she tasted her friend and suckled the tomato soup from her mane. With a hefty, noisy gulp, Rainbow took Twilight's head firmly into her throat. She chewed on Twilight's neck casually, not breaking the skin or even really parting the fur. The tight, powerful muscles of Rainbow's esophagus massaged Twilight's face, squeezing her cheeks together and puffing out her lips before pulling her face apart and then doing much of the same in a rhythmic way. There was not enough pony to grip yet, so the esophagus could only play with its occupant until Rainbow deliberately donated more of the unicorn to its folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt Rainbow's wings close around her, the strong, feathered appendages gripping Twilight tight and lifting her slightly. Twilight dangled her hooves off of the floor, a spark of excitement jolting in Twilight as she felt less in control now that she was partly off the ground. Rainbow's mouth moved in on her shoulders, bringing the two ponies closer. Twilight's chest pressed against Rainbow's and from the shaking in Rainbow's right shoulder Twilight figured that the pegasus was using her wings to help devour her meal because her right hoof was busy serving some other purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Rainbow was enjoying herself far too much to ignore the calls of her loins, and lewdly was working the frog of her hoof into her needy snatch. She was still swearing, as the pleasure in her pussy was so much stronger than any other time she masturbated, intensified greatly by her mind's knowing of what fantasy she was finally living, and what wonderful pressure she was feeling inside her esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt Rainbow's wings wrap around her rump and start lifting her up from there, and her rump swung forward and met with Rainbow's left-front leg  that kept the pony stabilized while she clopped. Twilight now sat in the grasp of Rainbow's wings like a hapless child, the wings lifting her slowly into Rainbow's gulping maw. Twilight's legs pressed against her chest as her upper half quickly vanished into Rainbow's hot mouth. Twilight groaned, starting to get wet herself and dribble honey into Rainbow's wings. The hot and wet flesh surrounding her sensually caressed her every curve, and she felt the hungry pegasus's stomach opening before her to let in her horn. Twilight kicked her fore-hooves against Rainbow's throat muscles, trying to hurry herself along so that her sick friend could get better, faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrool coated Twilight's rump now, not a single inch of fur left unsalivated as Rainbow's lips began to inch their way around the plump pony rear. She lifted her head as her teeth met with Twilight's thighs, and she jerked her head with each gulp to add a little bit more momentum to the pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight moaned out as she felt her face press into the wall of Rainbow's stomach, rubbing her cheek into the slightly acidic muscle. The folds in her soft tummy changed shape and position as the stomach recognized a lot of food was beginning to occupy it. Her shoulders and fore-hooves soon followed, and Twilight was finally able to stretch them a little and help pull herself into her new home. She started to experimentally lick at the stomach walls that undulated around her as she felt Rainbow close her lips around the last of her and give a mighty swallow. The leftover saliva rushed down with the rest of Twilight as she quickly curled up into a ball inside Rainbow's extended stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow lapped at her lips, trying to taste her own tongue and weasel out the remainder of Twilight's taste from her mouth so that she could savor it. She felt so fat and heavy, and she was so terribly horny that she didn't think she'd be able to get into her own bed, as she couldn't bear bringing her hoof away from her crotch even for a second. \"Oh fuck Twilight oh gosh!\" She wailed and fell onto her side, her mane sticking to her sweaty neck and forehead and making her look like she had gotten out of the shower recently. Her hoof was completely smeared with her honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight moaned out inside her fleshy prison, Rainbow's excitement contagious. \"Rainbow Dash...!\" she huffed, and lowered her hoof tentatively between her legs, lightly stroking her folds and getting a good deal of pleasure from that subtle touch. The two ponies clopped, listening to each other's sounds through themselves until Rainbow gave a mighty yell as she reached orgasm, semi-opaque white femme-cum squirting out from her pussy and coating her hoof. The intense orgasm sent her into another fit of awful coughing, challenging her afterglow and making her shake with a lot more than just sexual pleasure. Her flesh felt cold and her joints hurt, and reminding herself that she was sick, she quickly hoisted herself back into bed, covered up, and then took a drink of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water splashed Twilight just in time for her own orgasm, giving a fairly amusing dampness to her own mane in the gloomy chamber as the huffing pony felt a much more modest trickle of fluid leak from her body as she came. Blinking and licking the fresh water from her lips, she wiggled and nuzzled against Rainbow's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Rainbow Dash, that was a fascinating experience...!\" she sighed. \"I would love to try it again sometime...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow blinked, shivering under her blanket. \"Yeah... I would like that. Um, hey Twi... part of my fantasy, really, reaaally includes digesting the pony. But, if I digest you, I can't ever eat you again, or even hang out...\" There was a sadness to her voice, and as much as she was loving all this and as much as she craved to digest Twilight, she did love her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight thought this over for a moment, but smiled.</span></div></div>",

Rainbow, as your friend, I completely understand how you feel. I know you really care about me and don't want to really hurt me, but if you really decide to take me out of this life and make me a part of you... I'm willing to make that sacrifice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow held her stomach tightly. \"Thank you...\" she said, concerned, unsure if she was able to make that decision herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But really, you gotta digest me!\" said Twilight. \"You're sick, and you need the energy! But if you don't want this to be the end, well, perhaps there's a spell that I can try and cast that will let you digest me and recover me later...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow felt her spirit lift a little. There was a certain charm and appeal to digesting her prey permanently, she never really considered anything other than that, but knowing there was more control to this situation helped brighten her mood. \"I'm listening egghead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it would be difficult... I mostly learn spells rather than invent them, and I don't have much time, but I can try and invent a brand new spell that will bind my spirit to your body. You'll just have to find the energy to revitalize me some other way. It just might take a few days of eating a regular healthy diet before the spell is ready to reform me. I mean, if it works.

I mean, no offense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was smiling, as she knew Rainbow was just having a lot of fun. \"Alright then! Here we go!\" Her horn ignited with magic and she concentrated. She licked her lips occasionally as she worked. The stomach around her grew hot as blood rushed to Rainbow's tummy, helping the digestive sac to secret thick acids that coated Twilight's entire body. She had cast a quick spell that kept dirt and grime off her body, and it helped to keep the acids from interacting with her, but that would only be temporary. The goal was to be digested after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow turned the lights out in her room with a clop of her hooves and watched the glowing lightshow in her stomach. It was kind of like watching a lava lamp, a soporific and mesmerizing experience. Twilight was spellcasting for an hour in there. The stomach acids really wanted to break her down, because the modest pool she was sitting in kept rising higher as the stomach recognized that there was still an awful lot of food inside of it. The acids were above her shoulders by the time Twilight finished her work, and felt satisfied that, one way or another, she'll have casted something that, well, SHOULD work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was a risk worth taking, in her opinion. She had resigned herself to be digested for better or worse, and with a resignation like that, just being digested was at least an acceptable outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you Rainbow,\" Twilight said, figuring this was the best sort of pre-emptive farewell she could give in case of the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later Twi,\" Rainbow yawned and sighed, laying back her head to feel her stomach digest her friend as the glow in her tummy dissipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden rush of acids annihilated Twilight's physical sensations instantly. She found it remarkable that the pony stomach, not normally suited for the processing of meat, was eagerly stripping her body of her skin and muscle. She was numb, and felt little other than the sensation of losing weight rapidly. It was too gloomy to really see the process, and really, she just felt like she was taking a bath. She grew light headed and figured that the digestive process had reached some of her blood vessels. Her scientific mind sanitized this knowledge quite thoroughly, as the experience of being digested became one of curiosity. She was just as much interested in learning about her body's make up by feeling what happened to her at any one time as a specific layer of tissue fell away from her bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm learning a lot about the circulatory system,\" she muttered to herself as she reclined backwards. It suddenly became very hard to breathe. She felt like she was floating now, and her head was bounding, but it failed to become much of a headache at all before Twilight lost consciousness with a subtle smile on her lips as the acid rose up over the entirety of her form. Rainbow burped loudly in her sleep and sniffled, her body still trying to fight off its viral infection. Her stomach was now filled completely with fluid and nutritious pony paste, and it slowly cycled it into her small intestine to put Twilight into Rainbow's bloodstream. The magical unicorn would go a long way to making Rainbow feel great the next day.</span></div></div>",

There were no signs that the shop was closed so why wouldn't anypony be here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard strange noises from the back room. Was this a robber? Did he tie Pinkie and the Cakes up to rob the store or worse? Carefully she tiptoed towards the kitchen, prepared to face whoever was in there. The noises continued and still Twilight couldn't make out what was going on in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was no time to be scared, thought Twilight. If there really is something wrong she needed to help them! Twilight took a deep breath and braced herself, with a blast of magic she broke the door down. \"GOT YOU EV....\" Twilight was speechless at what she saw, nothing could have possibly prepared her for the strange sight right in front of her eyes.</span></div></div>",

Can't you see that?\" Pinkie Pie said that as if it was an everyday thing to cover herself in sweets as if she was a cake. Twilight on the other hand was just more confused at this. \"What do you mean prepare yourself for the customers? Is this some kind of publicity stunt?\" This was the only explanation Twilight could think of right now. Still, Sugarcube Corner already was the most successful bakery in Ponyville so why would they even bother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that would be a waste of food, I'm for eating of course.\" If it was physically possible Twilight's jaw would have hit the ground. Pinkie couldn't possibly be serious, or was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Pinkie, that is completely impossible!\" She explained, almost unable to believe that she had to explain such a thing in the first place. \"Ponies don't eat other ponies and even if they did, why would you want to turn yourself into a pony cake? You would die!\" Pinkie started to scare Twilight, didn't she even know that? And if she did know why would she willingly become another pony's food?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was close to tears, she spent all morning preparing herself and now it was for nothing. \"But Twi, after I've licked some chocolate of my hoof I noticed how good I tasted so I wanted to share that taste with other ponies.\" The pink party pony couldn't understand why she shouldn't be a pastry served to hungry customers, she would eat herself if she could. \"Here, have a taste and you'll see what I mean.\" Before Twilight could protest her mouth was filled by a chocolate covered hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Twilight couldn't believe that she was even thinking it but judging from this little taste test Pinkie Pie would be an excellent cake. Pinkie took her hoof out of Twilight's mouth again. \"So Twi, still think this is a bad idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, maybe you do taste great but there's still the fact that you would die.\" Twilight didn't want to lose Pinkie Pie, she was one of her best friends and she is always so fun to be around.

No, Pinkie was her friend and so she was the only pony who could rightfully eat her. Five minutes ago Twilight would have never even considered it but Pinkie Pie was right, she was far too delicious not to be eaten. The craving for the chocolate and candy covered pony in front of her clouded the more rational parts of her mind. \"Very well Pinkie, you get your wish but I want to be the one to eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie gasped loudly and smiled, being eaten by one of her best friends was the best thing she could think of right now. \"That's great Twilight, I can't think of a better pony to eat me. Now, get me the whipped cream and I can finish myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly Twilight levitated the can to Pinkie Pie who started to draw elegant lines on her body with the cream. After she was done she took an apple out of a nearby bowl and put it into her mouth. She laid down on the dish and nodded to Twilight, signalling that she was ready to be devoured.</span></div></div>",

The different candys were not only added for decoration but the different kinds of candy complemented each others taste while the whipped cream drew elegant lines on the body that has been evenly covered in chocolate. Pinkie Pie tasted sinfully good and she put up no resistance against the magical pull that was slowly pulling her down the unicorns esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkies head was now a bulge in Twilights throat that travelled down very slowly, Twilight wanted to enjoy this meal. Twilight already went past the shoulder and was swallowing the belly while lapping away at the chocolate that covered Pinkies body. She heard giggling from inside herself and Pinkie spoke up, the apple has apparently fallen out of her mouth. \"That tickles Twilight, didn't your parents tell you not to play with your food?\" She asked playfully. With a mischievous grin Twilight intensified her licking, causing the mare she was swallowing to laugh out loudly in her esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of tickling Twilight decided to finish it and started to suck Pinkies flanks down her throat. The process became much easier after Pinkies cutie mark disappeared past the unicorns lips and soon the legs would also follow. With a few strong gulps Pinkie arrived at her final destination, Twilights stomach. Pinkie happily curled up, glad that it was one of her best friends who ate her, she couldn't think of a pony she'd rather become a part of than her. \"So Twi, was I tasty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight let out a contented burp and sat down. \"You were delicious Pinkie, the best 'cake' I've ever eaten in my life.\" She answered while rubbing her belly. \"Say Pinkie, can I use your bed? I'm kinda heavy now and I'd like to sleep you off now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Twilight and good night, I'm gonna take a nap too, only that I probably won't wake up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt a little sad as she made her way upstairs. Pinkie Pie sure was delicious but this means she would never see her again. Twilight vowed to throw a lot of parties in Pinkie Pies name as she laid down on Pinkies bed and fell asleep while her stomach started to break down the pony inside.</span></div></div>",

Normally Pinkie would bounce around somewhere, enthusiastically greet them or throw another party. That was not the case this time. The counter was unattended and no sound came from anywhere in the house. \"Where is Pinkie? Shouldn't she attend the store.\" Asked Carrot Cake his wife, who was just as nervous about this as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe she just needed the little fillies room.\" She answered, hoping that Pinkie was really just using the bathroom. Then a soft snoring could be heard from somewhere. Did Pinkie Pie fall asleep? The Cakes were curious, normally their assistant would wildly bounce around all day without showing the slightest sign of tiredness, it would be very strange for her to randomly fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the two of them crept into the kitchen where the sound was coming from. Carefully they opened the door and gasped as they saw Twilight, lying there with a large, bloated belly. What happened here? Where is Pinkie and why did Twilight look like she just ate half of their bakery? The loud gasps woke Twilight who blinked sleepily at first and then gasped loudly herself as she saw the two Cakes staring at her. She looked down on herself and saw that her belly looked as if she was storing a ball in there and that her flanks and legs put on another layer of fat. Fat, that was the only thing left of Pinkie Pie now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cakes voice shook her out of her thoughts. \"Deary, what happened here?

In fact, I'll show up!\" Without a moment to lose Twilight jumped Ms. Cake, pinning her on the ground. \"Twilight what's gotten into yo--\" Ms. Cake couldn't finish that statement before Twilight began putting her head in her mouth.

Twilight burped in satisfaction, her bulging belly kicking and moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Cake couldn't handle it anymore and fainted.

A soft cry broke her concentration, and Twilight's face fell slightly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pumpkin and Pound,\" she whispered to herself.  Then a wicked thought occurred to her; it would simply be too cruel to leave these poor defenseless foals as orphans, now, wouldn't it?  Not to mention, keeping them apart from their mother!  Twi rolled forward onto her four hooves, and her belly compressed a bit as it dragged on the floor between her legs, and even behind them a bit.  Very slowly, she dragged herself to the stairs, then with a scowl, she cast a spell to convert the barrier into a slide, so she could get down to the floor where the nursery was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver so slowly, she descended, her belly acting as a brake against the force of gravity, until she reached her objective, and began dragging herself into the nursery.  Pound was awake, fluttering his wings as he tried to see who was coming in, even as Pumpkin slept blissfully.  Twi licked her lips, and approached Pound's crib, and cast a spell to levitate the foal towards her watering mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she placed the foal back down, in confusion.  As good as this felt, and as much as she wanted more, her stomach was warning her very forcefully that it was at its absolute limit.  She sighed as she carefully set the giggling foal back down.  There had to be a way around this problem.  She pondered.  There really wasn't any spell to expand the size of a stomach, although she started wondering if she could improvise one.  Then a stray memory hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had been a smaller filly, she had occasionally had to accompany Celestia to diplomatic meetings.  And one of those, she remembered, was with the Griffon ambassador, who insisted as a matter of protocol of treating the Equestrian monarch to a traditional Griffin meal.  That being, roast pig.  It was the first, and prior to today the only, time animal flesh had touched Twilight's tongue.  And while the flavor was unusual (not bad, just unusual), the stomach cramping afterwards was awful.  Celestia had told her young student that she had done this every year for more than a thousand years, and she too had trouble digesting the meal afterwards, but she had a spell to correct it.  She had also pondered whether her occasional consumption of meat had been responsible for her imposing size, so much larger than anypony else.  In any event, Celestia cast a spell, and Twilight's cramps had subsided almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was a master of spellcraft.  If she had ever seen a spell performed, she could copy it, although not necessarily perfectly as her first attempts at teleportation attested to.  She had simply never again needed the spell to digest meat before.  A part of her wondered how she had digested Pinkie so easily, but it shut down quickly - never question anything Pinkie Pie did, after all, else you would lose your sanity.  Although perhaps that spell cast ten years ago had helped a little this morning; but it was so slow now that she was awake for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere really was nothing else for it.  She closed her eyes as her horn glowed, then bent her head down to zap her own stomach.  Almost immediately, she felt a sense of pressure decreasing, as her stomach began to break down her latest enormous meal.  It wasn't fast, but it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, and levitated the tiny pegasus again with her magic, and this time, her stomach gave no protest as she wrapped her lips around Pumpkin's neck, and sucked him down in a single delicious gulp.  She turned, and did the same with the sleeping baby unicorn, delighting in the flavor, as a muffled scream hit her ears; Mrs Cake realizing her son had been consumed.  Sobs continued as Twilight felt Pound Cake's tiny horn against the edge of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to be safe, Twilight cast the digestion spell on herself a second time, then dragged herself to the storefront of Sugarcube Corner.  Noting with satisfaction that the \"Closed\" sign was properly set to closed, and the door locked, she rested a moment (dragging her belly was slow work!), before teleporting herself back to the library to plan her next meal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Surprised that the foals were still awake, when both elder Cakes had passed out by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Twilight then rubbed her occupied tummy, slowly circling her hoof on the two wriggling bulges in a soothing manner, the warmth and massaging soon lulling the foals to sleep, never realizing what had befallen them, their parents, and housemate, only knowing that Twilight had sent them on a wet and warm trip into somewhere warm and cozy, with their parents beside them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nighty-night Pumpkin, sleep tight Pound\" Twilight said with another giggle, then yawned \"maybe I should sleep too, I do have a lot too digest\".

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight tried to make herself comfortable as she went over some research, looking for any information she could on the meat digestion spell and any other cases of ponies eating ponies.  Unfortunately, the research was very, very scant.  It was mildly frustrating to hit on so little information, but she took some solace in the idea that this meant she was doing original research.  And even if she was intending to eat the entire town, that was no excuse for not properly documenting her findings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe idly rubbed her belly as she took down notes of what had happened so far that morning, feeling the sloshing remnants of five ponies in her engorged intestines.  A quick scan revealed that her stomach was still overstretched, and some quick math suggested it would be at least another hour before it shrank down enough to accommodate another meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed to herself, as a small cramp hit.  Although the feeling of being so full was wonderfully intoxicating, even with the meat digestion spell her anatomy simply wasn't designed to take in this much food, much less this much flesh, at one time.  She took a detour in her research, and quickly found that adding some fiber to her diet would help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there was nothing for it.  She dragged her way into the kitchen, and gulped down a loaf of bread before her stomach could protest the addition.  This action got her thinking, however.  How DID she manage to open her mouth so wide, it should be far beyond any pony's physiological abilities.  In fact the only pony who could swallow so much so fast that she knew of was... Pinkie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas there a connection?  She decided to test a theory, and began whipping up a batch of cake batter.  As long as she didn't think about what she was doing, it seemed to be working.  Yet, Twilight knew from long experience that she was a very poor chef; it's why Spike was responsible for meals around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she absorbed more than just the flesh of the ponies she ate?  This would require further testing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her cake baked, her digestion of Pinkie and the Cakes continued.  The smell was delicious; even if she had become a carnivore, Twi had no intention of not having sweets as well, after all.  She magically scanned her insides again, and frowned... Pinkie was starting to make her way into her large intestine, and there was still an awful lot of her first meal not absorbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she watched, her intestines seemed to resist the idea of a single drop of a pony meal going to waste.  Her intestines lengthened, and new loops formed before her metaphorical eye.  She felt a twinge in her back, and was surprised to find her spine also lengthening, to accommodate the extra intestines.  She didn't have a theory yet as to why this was happening, but she wasn't about to complain.  All the extra room meant she had room for another pony.  And she knew just who she wanted first.  Rarity.  If she was indeed absorbing traits from her meals, Rarity's ability to make anything fashionable would give Twi the ability to continue hunting for meals without being as obvious.  And even if not, well, Rarity was simply bound to be delicious anyway.  Plus, even as weak as a spellcaster as she was, she was still the next best to Twilight herself in Ponyville, and therefore the only possible pony to stop her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's horn glowed brightly, as she teleported Rarity to her side.  Before the confused unicorn could even ask what happened, Twilight stuffed Rarity's head into her mouth.  She felt a warm glow inside her mouth as Rarity attempted to cast a spell, and on instinct, she twisted her head around, and snapped Rarity's horn off against her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the flavor of raw magic mixed with hot blood flooded her tongue, as Rarity began to struggle fiercely.  The feeling was electric.  All too quickly, however, the flavor began to lose some of its potency, and Twi felt regret - that the flavor had not lasted longer.  She moved so that Rarity's hind quarters were forced up against a wall, then bent forward, gulping Rarity down to her shoulders.  She felt Rarity's nose get forced into the pool of fluid already in her stomach, and Rarity's struggles briefly become more frantic, before ceasing suddenly altogether.  Twilight felt regret again - Rarity must have choked on Twilight's stomach acids, and that meant the wonderful feeling of the struggle had come to an end.  With almost a sigh of resignation, Twilight gave another long gulp and bent forward, taking in Rarity's shoulders.  Then she slowly fell forward, letting her own gravity force most of Rarity down as Twilight's mouth slipped forward, until Rarity's tail and hind legs were all that remained outside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwi rested just a moment, then rolled over slowly, allowing her stomach to spill to the floor on both sides of her back, as she slurped up what remained of Rarity contently.  The wonderful feeling of being overly full yet again spread throughout Twi's body, and lulled her into a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke, to the smell of a perfectly cooked chocolate cake, perhaps an hour later.  Lazily checking herself, she found Pinkie had been totally absorbed while she napped, the Cakes were mostly gone, and Rarity was just beginning her final journey, with only a small part remaining in the stomach itself.  She licked her lips, and floated her cake to her mouth, swallowing it in a single gulp.  It was, indeed, very tasty.  But ponies were far tastier, and there was now plenty of room in her stomach for lunch.  She giggled at the thought - six ponies were her breakfast; at this pace, all of Ponyville would be inside her stomach within a week!   Still, there was the troubling matter of deciding where to go for lunch, exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, she felt a very dark presence. She shivered, for it was a presence that she had felt before but it had been a long time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cviolet\">*It can't be...*</span></i>, she whispred to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh, but it is, my little unicorn.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark blue mist that was clearer blue and had countless stars on the center suddenly appeared on the center of the living room, a few meters away from Twilight. It swelled and twisted until it took the shape of a being that Twilight thought she would never see ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Nightmare Moon!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*chuckle*I'm so glad that you still remember me. I haven't forgoten you either, Twilight Sparkle.\"</span>, said the black Alicorn with a bit of scorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"But... How is it-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"-possible that I'm still here? Why the Elements of Harmony didn't destroyed me? I believe those are your questions, correct?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight could only nod. Nightmare Moon chuckled with malice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I remember you being a bit more brave on our first meeting. Still, I know it's been a couple years, but I had the impression that you were an adult pony.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I am an adult pony.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Yet you are taller that before. You are also a bit larger and your flanks are a bit rounder than I remember.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwlight blushed from the fact that Nightmare Moon was checking her out, in a sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well. I... kind of... changed my diet, so to speak.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Mmh? How so?\"</span>, asked Nightmare with genuinous curiosity, which came as a surprise to Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"W-well... Remember those stories that say that you eat fols who don\u00bat give you enough candies on Nightmare Night?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare both, scofed and laughed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I do remember them. But what does it has to do with-\"</span>, then, realization hit her. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Wait, you said that you changed your diet, you mentioned storied that spoke about my canibalistic acts, your taller and larger...! Your kidding. Your kidding, right?\"</span>, Nightmare looked at Twilight with incredulity and shock. She scaned Twilight's eyes and searched for any trace or indice that she was lying, but couldn't find any. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Well, well, well. Things have gotten interesting while I've been gone. Tell me, who did you eat? Does Celestia and Luna knows about this?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"You haven't answered my questions. So, how about this. I answer one and then you, and so on.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hmm... Fair enough.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"The princesses know nothing. And neither did I prior to today.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"So you only began consuming flesh today, huh? Hmm. Interesting. Now, let me answer your two questions with one answer. The Elements of Harmony didn't destroyed me the second time. They try to make balance. If something or someone has too much darkness or too much light, they try to get rid of the excess in any way they can. The first time, because Celestia was using them, they considered Equestria as a hole and considered that I was too much darkness for this world, so they sent me to the moon to rid Equestria from me, taking Luna along for the ride. The second time, since it was you and your friends using them, and since you were nowhere near bing as powerful as an Alicorn, the Elements focused on this body, and thus, to make balance, they separated Luna and myself, giving me a body of my own in the process.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight understood everything, but still couldn't belive it! What was worse, now that Pinkie and Rarity were gone, there were no holders for the elements of Laughter and Generosity, thus, making the other Elements less powerful, if not usless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Now then, I belive I had asked who you had eaten, had I not? And how many where they? You don't get like how you are now with just one or two meals.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"How-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Ah, ah, ah!\"</span>, she said waving her hoof left and right. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"It's your turn to answer.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Six. Four adult ponies and two little foals. I was actually about to go hunt before you showed up. My plan was to, eventually, eat everypony in town.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Nightmare's turn to be surprised. She had already eaten six ponies on her first day?! And she planned to eat the hole town?! If NNightmare was honest with herself, she was impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"For your first day, I admit it's quite a good number. Celestia and I only manged three-!\"</span>, she closed her lips. Unintendedly, she had said more that she wanted to. But, when she looked at Twilight, she didn't looked shocked. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"You're not surprised?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Not really. I already had figured that out. I mean, you, Luna and Celestia are quite tall and large. The only ones bigger than you are the dragons. And I got taller and larger after eating a few ponies. It's not hard to link the dot's.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cnavy\">*I remember clearly that this unicorn's raw magic was quite powerful on our last meeting. And she's quite smart too. Also, she has an avid hunger, for lack of a better word, for knowledge. Maybe I can use that to my advantage. Perhaps I can bring her to my side.*</span></i> <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Tell me, Twilight. Ho much do you know about the night and the darkness? Also, what is it that began this new diet of yours and waht is the best part for you about rhis experience?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, regarding the night, I only know what I read in books and what I studied from the astronomy classes and the studies I ,ade on the constellations. Princess Luna and I haven\u00b4t had much contact lately. Regarding the darkness, honestly, I know nothing except that it contains three other kinds of magic. If I remember correctly, they are Dark magic, Blood magic and Chaos magic. As for examples of each one, I have none regarding the Blood magic, but I faced a very powerful unicorn named King Sombra and as for the Chaos magic, well, the only being able to uses it that is known was Discord.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for the first time this on that morning, Nightmare was surprised and impressed by this unicorn`s knowledge and experiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Frankly, I didn't expected for you to have gone trough so much. If you faced Sombra, then I assume that the Crystal Empire is back as well?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes. But, ever since, Celestia has not only refused to teach me even the theory about Dark magic, but has also forbbiden me to even talk about it with anyone, including my friends and Luna.\"</span>, said Twilight, somewhat disapointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I see. Then, what if I could teach you what Celestia will not?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Eh?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"The reason Celestia does not teach you, is because she\u00bas afraid. Afraid ot that power and of you and your own power.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"That's-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Ridiculous? No, it's not. You have <b>MUCH</b> more power than what you realise, Twilight Sparkle. You have the potential to become an Alicorn! The most powerful Alicorn to ever exsist! If you were to be properly trained and thaught, you could easily match and even surpass Celestia <b>AND</b> Luna combined!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"T-thank you.\"</span> Said Twilight, blushing a little. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"But-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Please dont give me that <i>\"I would be betraying my friends\"</i> thing. You were planning to eat the whole town! And tour friends live here, do they not?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes. I actually have eaten two of them. And the pony I was going to hunt was another one of them.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat surprised Nightmare but she didn't showed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"See? Also, those that you eat become parts of you, as I'm sure you already noticed.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"So, if you were to eat your friends, family, Celestia and Luna-\"</span>, Nightmare laft the sentence suspended on purpose for Twilight to complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"-they would always be with me because they woud always be parts of me! They would live on throug me!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Exactly, Twilight! I will try to make eternal night. However, my plan is better thought than before. I realised that life would wither if I were to leave the Moon always in place. So, I thought of a way to avoid that. And I reached a conclusion. Care to tell me what that conclusion is?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, there is a theory that says that the Sun's properties could be transfered to the Moon. But it would require an imense amount of power. Because of that, and because the princesses never tried it, that therory could never be tested. I assume that you want to implement that theory?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Very good, Twilight! So, what do you say? Will you join me? Will you be <b>MY</b> faithful student?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I...</span></span></div></div>",

For this chapter only)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked up to Nightmare Moon's eyes and, with all the honesty she had, she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Nightmare Moon. I'm honored by your offer.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare's face was emotionless. But her ears were a bit laid back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"But?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"There is no but.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement made Nightmare's ears perk up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cnavy\">*I- is she really going to...?!*</span></i>, thought the black mare anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight walked up to where Nightmare Moon was and, to the utter shock and surprise of Nightmare Moon, she bowed deeply! She bowed until her chin almost touched the wooden floor. She then raised and took Nightmare's left hoof with her right one and lifted them up in the air. Twilight's horn began to glow <span class=\"cmagenta\">magenta</span> and she launched two spells. One that Nightmare recognized as a silencer spell. And the second one was an Obscuring spell. The first one forbid any sound in this room to escape. And the second one covered the windows, making it so that ponies outside couldn't see what was happening on th inside. Whatever Twilight had planned, she didn't want others to know about it. Then, Twilight's horn glowed again. But, instead of the <span class=\"cmagenta\">magenta</span> from before, her horn, as well as her eyes, were glowing white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b><span class=\"cviolet\">\"I, Twilight Andromeda Sparkle, take thou, Nightmare Moon, to be my tutor and guide. And I shall aid thou in thee quest to cover the world of Equs in eternal lullabies! Will thou take me as thee faithful student?\"</span></b></i>, she said in a powerful voice that ecoed throught out the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cnavy\">*A binding ritual?! So that's why she launched those spells. How does she has knowlenge of this?! Still, I can find about this later. Right now, there are things more important than that.*</span></i> <i><b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"I, Nightmare Moon, accept thee, Twilight Andromeda Sparkle...\"</span></b></i> <i><span class=\"cnavy\">*She has a beautiful name*</span></i> <i><b><span class=\"cnavy\">\"...to be my faithfull student. And thou shall be so for eternity, until thou has completed thee apprenticeship! Thou also shall aid me in my plans to bring forth eternal night. And, once our objective has been reached, thou shall rule the land of Equestria by my side for eternity!\"</span></b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was surprised and shocked by that last part. But she continued all the same. Twilight then created a small knife with her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cnavy\">*She even knows this...*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare then created a knife on her own. Each passed their knives to the other and made small cuts on their raised hooves. Next, the knives vanished and each rose their own hooves to the other's lips and drank a bit of each other's <span class=\"cred\">blood</span>. Sealing the pact. Then, a <b><span class=\"cnavy\">dark blue</span></b> aura surrounded Twilight and a <span class=\"cmagenta\">magenta</span> one surrounded Nightmare Moon until both auras disapeared inside of the passed out black mare and of the the nearly passed out purple mare. Indicating that, now, a part of them belonged to each other. Then, Twilight used what energy she had left to teleport both of them to her bed. Her spare bed having being destroyed that night when Rarity, Applejack and herself had had a sleepover. She first made sure that her new teacher was safely accomodated in her bed and that she wouldn't fall out of it. She then got on her bed and laid down. Noticing while doing so that the forehoof she had used for the ritual now had a crescent black moon with a dark blue aura around it, until the mark dissapeared. She also noticed that Nightmare Moon's forehoof had a copy of her cutiemark. That too vanished. Then, as soon as her head touched the pillow, she followed her new master to dreamland.</span></div></div>",

She knew that she felt like that because of the pact she had formed with her new teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Speaking of her, this is Dreamland so, where is she?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then felt two forehooves wraping themselves around her head and covering her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Guess who?\"</span>, asked a playful yet known voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"<i>*chuckle*</i> Hi, Moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Moon?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, I thought that Nightmare Moon was a bit of a mouthful. And calling you Nightmare just dosen't seem right. So, I thought it would be better to call you \"Moon\". Why? Is it a bad thing?\"</span>, asked Twilight, a bit unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare, on the other hoof, smiled warmly at Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"No, Twilight. Rather, it's good to see that you are warming up to me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled. Happy that her teacher had praized her. Oddly, it felt better thann when Celestia had sone it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Now, shall we continue our conversation?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Um...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Something wrong, Twilight?\"</span>, asked Nightmare with a bit of worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"No. Nothing's wrong. It's just that... Are you sure we should be so carefree? I mean, Isn't Dreamland Luna's as well as your territory?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"You are somewhat correct. Luna has control over most of Dreamland. But she thinks she controls all of it. However, I control a small part. And used some spells to make it so that this particular zone always changes place.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"And because of that Luna can't pinpoint our location.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Correct. Now that has been taken care of, how about we resume our conversation from this morning?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Sure thing, Moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"In that case, I had asked you what part of your canibalistic experiance was the best for you, am I right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes. And, frankly speaking, I love ALL of it! My meal's taste, the feeling of their strugles as they go down my throat, their struggles and the feeling of fullness when they are in my stomach! The knowledge of the fact that they are becoming parts of me and the power this experience makes me feel over my preys!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"<i>*chuckle*</i> Well, Twilight. I'd say that you are a natural predator! As a matter of fact, what you described, is exactly how I feel as well whenever I have a living meal inside me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"It appears we have more in common than what we thought, don't we? And I don't mean just our diets. I always was fond of the night.\"</span>, confessed Twilight, while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat peeked Nightmare's interest quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Is that so?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Why, yes! I LOVE the night! The Night is calm and quiet, yet dangerous and excitement. It's secrecy, yet revelations that the day hides wiht it's brightness! I always enjoyed walking on the night. I did so a couple of times with Princess Luna. Also, I always like to study the constellations and read under the moolight's beams! Even when I was a litte filly, I would sped hours past my bedtime reading or looking at the stars and at the moon! Though I got scolded more thtan once for that.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"<i>*chuckle*</i> I see. In that case, I believe that you are correct. We do have more in common than we first assumed. That was a lovely yet quite accurate description of the night, by the way.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"T-thank you, Moon.\"</span>, Twilight was quite visibly blushing now. Which Moon found adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"<i>*giggles*</i> Still, while I'm enjoying our talk, I would like to...\"</span>, said the black Alicorn, a bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"What is it, Moon?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"C-can you come closer, please?\"</span>, saind Moon, blushing brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight did so. She was surprised, of course, that Moon was being shy, of all things. Of course, nothing could have preppared her for what happened next. For, as soon as she was within grabbing range, Moon pulled Twilight towards herself and planted a big, wet kiss on Twilight's lips!!! And not just any kiss. A french one. Moon used her tounge to explore every corner of Twilight's lips and teeth. The, she poked Twilight's teeth, requsting entrance. Twilight, being too shocked to do much, could only comply. Once she did, Moon's tounge invaded her mouth and didn't left a single spot uncovered or unexploired! At one point, she Moon held Twilight even closer and Moon's tounge went deep down her throat, she was careful though, so as too not harm Twilight. She was rough, yet gentle at the same time. Soon enought, Moon pulled out and both, her and Twilight were panting hard. Tough, when Moon looked at Twilight, searching for, hopefully, approval, Twilight's face was unreadable. In her mind, Twilight had...</span></div></div>",

It had already been a couple minutes and due to that, Moon was loosing hope. She began to get up, in order to leave, thinking that either, she wasn't going to get a response or that Twilight was going to reject her. She was beggining to leave, when she felt a forehoof grabbing her left one. She looked back at her student, only to fing her a few centimeters close to her. Then, to her surprise, Twilight began to caress her muzzle tenderly. Both of them were blushing brightly. Twilight looked at Nightmare in her eyes. And, to her inmense joy, Moon could see lust and, more importantly, love and care in Twilight's eyes. Then, Twilight pulled Moon closer to herself and wrapped her in a tight and caring hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"And just where do you think you're going, hmm?\"</span>, said Twilight with lust in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I-it's juat that-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I know I took long to react. But that dosen't mean that I didn't enjoyed it, silly.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"<i>*chuckle*</i> You sure have some nerve to call an immortal and powerful being such as myself silly.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yeah. I guess I do.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"L-look, I'm sorry if I was a bit too forward.\"</span>, Moon, began to tear up a bit. At that, Twilight tightened her hug, in order to comfort her teacher, and now lover.<span class=\"cnavy\"> \"It's just that... <i>*sigh*</i> I never felt like this before. I never tried to approach anyone like this. And I never felt so close to someone before! Even when Luna was my host, I never felt close to her. We were just bodymates, so to speak, but just that. *sob* *sob* Y-you're the first one that has made me feel like this. Like I'm alive, that I'm wanted, needed and, more than anything, loved. And I'm certain that it's not because a part of you resides in me, due to the ritual. It's you. You and only you, that makes me feel like this.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy her second phrase, she was freely crying. And Twilight was running her left forehoof through the black Alicorn's ethereal mane and through the fur of her back, comforting her mate as best as she coluld, due to the size diference. And Moon was hugging Twilight back, with all of her might. As if she could never let her precious purple mare go. After a few minutes, Moon had calmed down. They parted the hug, to their mutual disapointment, and looked at each other. Finding wamrness, comfort and love in each other's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><i>\"*chuckle*.\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, my beloved?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blushed quite brightly at that name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Hm, hm. I was just thinking. Looking at the two of us now, like this, it's hard to believe we were enemies once. Wouldn't you agree?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon smiled at that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Indeed. But I wouldn't have it any other way.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Neither would I, my love.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Moon's turn to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"So, now that the emotional, yet lovely, part has passed, do you want to continue from that kiss? Hmm?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"<i>*growl*</i> You bet, you beautiful and sexy mare.\"</span>, said Twilight with a lust filled voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"My, oh my. I didn't expect that reaction. Though I admit I like it.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Glad you do. Now then, I think that, right now, we could do better things mith our mouths. Don't you agree?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Why, yes I do...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare then conjured a queen sized bed, fit for royalty, where her beloved Twilight and herself would spend the next couple hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, reader, before we go on, do you want an explicit and described sex scene between these two?

For one, Twilight had just recieved her first kiss. Her sexual experiences went that far and no more! Even when she was in heat she barely touched herself! Always prefering to read or distract her mind from such things. Nightmare wasn't far behind. She hadn't had any kind of sexual experience in far more than a thousand yna had the same bodyears. In fact, the kiss she had shared with Twilight had bee her first one. Even when she and Luna had the same body, they had been sealed in the Moon, and thus, couldn't even touch herself. And even if she could, she had nothing to masturbate to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Moon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking that we should do this in the real world after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for one, because my books are there and coud be used as a guide.

I want to feel each and every part of you as clearly as possible! A-and I think it would be better to do that being awake and lucid. Also, while I'm sure that this experience would be great here, I don't want to feel like we're hiding something or doing something forbbiden or shameful. I'm proud of my choices, Moon. And I don't regret becoming your student and lover. I have no shame in admitting it. And I wouldn't be ashamed if I had to admit it to Celestia and Luna themselves!\", declared Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twiligth... Very well, my beloved.

Or, more accurately, on the bed.\"</span>, said Twilight, seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Mmmmh. Sounds lovely, dear.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blushed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------After hours of reading and studying------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was night time now. 21:00pm, to be exact. Moon and Twilight had finished the reading and were in Twilight's basement, where they had conjured the same bed from when they were on Dreamland. Nightmare was in front of it, with Twilight a few steps behind. Some of the studying, they had done together. But, secretly, Twilight had read some books that she had found on the more reserved part of the library. And she was sure that the knowledge she had adquired from them was going to surprise and please har lover. The bed itself was gorgeous. Fitting for royalty; It was queen-sized. The mattress was <span class=\"ctan\">tan</span> colored. The bed-sheats were from different colors. The mattress' cover was purple, like Twilight and the sheets were <span class=\"cmagenta\">magenta</span>, like Twilight's magic. The wood where the mattress was above of, was <b>black</b>, like Moon's fur. And the covers linking the wood pilar of the bed's corners were <span class=\"cblue\">blue</span> and teal, like Moon's mane and <span class=\"cteal\">eyes</span>. Truly, it was a bed that fitted them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"It's beautiful, Moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Indeed. But you are far more beautiful, my dear.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"<i>*blush*</i> Thanks, love.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Well then, I think we should begin, don't you agree, my little mare?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes. Indeed. So, would you like to be on top or below?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Why don't we get started and alternate from time to time?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Sounds good to me.\"</span>, said Twilight, who, unknown to Moon, was getting ready to pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Well, in that case, <i>*ooff*</i>!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Moon was going to say was lost. For while she was distracted, Twilight jumped and hugh-tackled her onto the bed! Moon ended up face down on the mattress, with Twilight on top. Grining, Moon turned belly up, so that she could face Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"<i>*giggles*</i> Well, well, well. It seems somepony's eager to begin.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"You bet, Moony.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh? Giving me a new nickname, eh? Well then, I shall call you Twily then.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Er... That's how my family and Cadence reffer to me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Cadence? Who's that?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Oh, right. Luna didn't knew her so you wouldn't know her either. She was my foalsitter when I was a filly and lived in the palce. She's also the Princess of Love and current ruler of the Crystal Empire.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Ah. I see. Well, how about we leave this conversation for later, my little Twi Twi?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering with words, Twilight smiled and kissed Moony fully on the lips. She then bit softly on Moony's lips and sucked gently on them. She also was rubbing Moony's chest and forehooves with her own. To top it, she put her knees on the mattress and used her backhooves to rub, altough a bit clumsily, Moon's flanks, the spot where her Cutie Mark was, to be precise. All of that was making Moon gasp and moan like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cnavy\">*How can she have learned so much in just a few of hours? She is truly brilliant. And, while a bit clumsy, she compensates that with eagerness and using her intelligence to make good combinations. And this is her first time. If she's like this now, I can barely wait until she's more experienced.*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was thinking that, Twilight's thought's were:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cviolet\">*I hope I'm doing good. She's moaning and gasping. Those are good signs, right? Still, if I keep this for long, she may think I'm boring and that I haven't learned much. I need to show her what I've learned! But, it's not time yet to bring the big guns. No. I'm going to geve her a big surprise!*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon then took initiative, having decided to be on top for a while. So, she used her size and weight advantages to throw a startled Twilightt against the mattress and decided to repay the favor from before and more. She gave Twilight's body the same treatement she had recived. But her kiss was different, she was more rough, her tounge entered Twilight's mouth and knocked on her teeth, demainding entrance. Which Twilight happily gave. Then, Moon did the same she had done on their first kiss. But she wen't even further down Twilight's throath this time. Making sure to rub every corner and lump. Twlight for her part was in ecstasy. But she didn't stood still. She used her forehooves to hug Moon's midsection and to lift herself. She then caressed Moon's back as best as she could and, using her magic, she used her tail to rub Moon's flanks and to squeeze the Moon's moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cnavy\">**gasp!!!* A daring moove, Twlilight*</span></i>, thought the dark goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they spent a couple of hours like that, carressing, kissing, snugling and giving each other love bites every now and then. At one point, Twilight looked at the clock on the wall. It read 23:00pm. And so, Twilight decided that it was time to show her lover her hidden Ace. She disentangled herself from Moon, much to the Alicorn's disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"What's wrong? Was I too rough?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"No, no, love. You were perfect. i just wanted to show you a hidden trick I reserved for this time. There is one hour left to Midnight, and I think it's the right time. You see. We studied most of the time toghether. But there were times that we stduied separatelt. And I used that time to study a few things to will make you scream my name to the heavens.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh?\"</span>, said Moony. Intrigued and curious as to what her student had planned <span class=\"cnavy\">\"And what would that be?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"<i>*chuckle*</i> Well, I have a secret. One that not even Celestia, my beloved former mentor, knows. You see, when I was born, I came with an \"extra\" part. Something that mares usually don't have. And, until now, only my parents and the doctor that helped my mother give birth to me knew of this. Not even my brother knows of it.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hmmm. We must talk about your family later. But, something that not even someone as close to you as your brother and Celestia know? Now I'm quite curious.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Then I shan't keep you waiting.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwlight then rose. Because of that, Moon assumed that whatever Twilight wanted to show her, was below her, so she bent to look down and, to her utter shock and surprise, Twilight had a cock between her legs! And it was big and thick! A foot long and 5 inches thick! Nightmare couldn't help but lick her lips. And Twilight felt proud that her teacher/lover apporved her \"colt parts\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Twilight, is that a...?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes. And it's natural. As I said, I was born with it.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare didn't knew what to say! She was surprised to say the least! A living and breathing born dickmare?! Those hadn't been seen on Equestria since long before her banishment! If her memory served her well, the last one known about was Great Canopy, about six hundred years before she and Luna were banished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"W-well, this is certainly a surprise...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Oh, it's just the beggining, my love.\"</span>, said Twilight, with a grin full of lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"W-what do you mean?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's horn ignited and then, she created not one or two, but seven copies of herself! Each had their own dick! Only, unlike thw real Twilight, the copie's eyes were a clearer shade than those of their creator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cnavy\">*J-just how powerful is she currently?! According to the memories I have from when Luna and I had the same body, when she was about Twilight's age, she could create only 3 copies and Celestia could create 5, and even then, they had many differences when compared to the originals. Twilight's copies are almost perfect, except for the deference in the color of their eyes! Oh boy, I'm going to enjoy this. There is no doubt about that.*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, girls. Shall we give Moony here the best night of her life?\"</span>, she said, looking at her copies. Which all nodded and looked at Moon woth lust and predatory eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the copies took a spot and choose a part on Moon to focus on. three went under Moon, thw of those took their place on Moon's nipples, while the third went to Moon's pussy, with her tounge ready. The fourth copy rose on her forelegs and grabbed Moon's buttcheeks and had her dick ready and waiting to pierce Moon's asshole. Two other copies went to Moon's wings and each picked one. The sixth comy climbed Moon's neck and got ready to work on her long and majestic horn. Then, the original Twilight posted herself on Moon's face, with her tempting cock carressing Moon's cheeck. Twilight crouched and whispered on Moon's ears:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Ready, my love?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Yes, beloved. Give it to me! Give me your everything!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"With pleasure.\"</span>, purred Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarning: Heavy sex description on the next character (the first option)</span></div></div>",

And they took it as they should. As a green signal to show Moony all of the carnal love that their creator had for Moon. The ones at Moon's nipples began to suck and lick at them. As did the one at Moon's pussy. That one licked Moon's pussy lips fervishly. Getting it wet and slick, as was doing the one at Moon's butt. She was licking Moon's asshole. They were lubing and preparing them for their's, and ultimately, for their creator's cock. The ones at Moon's wings began to massage and carress them. The one at Moon's horn began to massage said horn with her hooves. And the real Twilight rubbed her cock on Moon's lips. Requesting an audience with Moon's tounge and throat. An audience that Moon gladly granted. Moon couldn't help but moan at the cock's taste. It was simply delicious! It had a slight taste of blackberries with a bit of strawberry and slight pisc of salt. Moon, for her part, was lost in the world of exstasy that her student/lover was providing for her. She felt as if she was in a sexed version of a heaven that only her and Twilight knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cnavy\">*She may lack in skill and technique, but her knoledge is amazing! I have never felt pleasure like this before! And this is only her first time! Where has she aquired such knoledge?!*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"In case <i>*pant*</i>, your <i>*moan*</i> wondering...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon stood at full attention. Curious as to the source of her lover's knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I know all of this for the following reason. When I studied pony anatomy at Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, we read about each pony's anatomy. But we only covered the basics. Me, curious and wanting to learn more, as always, I searched on the school's library for more and, when I had the books I thought I needed, I found that they only contained what I already knew. Not satisfied, I began to search for more and, as luck would have it, when I was resting my hooves, I leaned against a closed door. One that I didn't knew anything, other that it said <u>\"Authorized Personel Only\"</u>. I thought that, being Celestia's student, I was among the Authorized Personal. So, I used my magic to open the door and found lots and lots of books, scrolls, documents, etc... I realized, of course, that I was in the restricted area of the library. But I wen't on. Inside, I found the books I had been looking for and I studied on the suject. And I <i>*blush*</i> might have... teleported to my room... a book from there.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon removed Twilight's cock from her mouth, to the later's disapointment, only long enough for her to say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Twi Twi, you naughty little mare. I'm surprised Celestia didn't noticed.\"</span>, then she began to deepthroat Twilight's dick, much to Twilight's enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"She didn't noticed I teleported a book out of the school, but she did knew of my location.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon gave her a curious look. Which Twilight took as a sign to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I studied a lot. And studing late into the night, as I often did. However, I overdid it that time and ended up falling asleep. When I woke up, I was in my bed. Forunately, it was Sunday, so there weren't any classes that day. Unfortunately, Celestia was besides my bed, with a serious and stern look. SShe also looked a bit disapointed. She told me that she had found me on the library's restricted area sleeping. She also told me that she was disappointed in my lack of responsability, caution and restrain. She said that curiosity was good, to an extent. But that too much could be dangerous. And so, she forbbid me from entering there again, unless she herself allowed me too.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon mmed in acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Still, the book I had snucked out turned out to be <b>QUITE</b> interesting and it was a big help in preparation for this moment.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than taking the cock out of her mouth again, for she didn't wanted to stop relishing in it's taste, she estabilished a phsychic conection with Twilight and spoke to her using thelephaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cnavy\">*Hmmm. May I inquire as to what book that is?*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight used her magic to teleport the book in front of Moon's face. And the title surprised Moon. The book's title read <u>\"A Thousand Ways to Please All Kinds of Females by Garuda, Royal Schoolar of Griffonia.\"</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cnavy\">*I see. So that's where you got your intel, huh? Hmm. Sneaky and cleaver. Good move, Twi Twi.*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt warm when Moon praized her. She always loved when Celestia had done so. But, when it came from Moon, it felt countless times better. Maybe it was beacue Moon was both, her teacher and her lover. Then, Twilight felt a pressure building and knew what was coming. She increased the speed and, to Moon's surprise, she cummed all over, litterally painting Moon's mouth and throat white. Moon swallowed all of Twilight's seed. Not wanting to waste a single drop of her students delicious colt milk. Then, Twilight glanced at the copies that were on Moon's pussy and ass. Both copies dissapeared, much to Moon's disapointment. But that didn't last long. For the original Twilight positioned herself on Moon's butt. She grabbed Moon's flanks. Then, , without Moon noticing, she lit up her horn and she casted a spell. Suddenly, Moon felt not one, but TWO meatpoles rubbing her fur! One aimed at her pussy and the other aimed at her asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh my goodness! Twilight are you planning to...?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Eeyup! <i>*giggles*</i>.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight then pushed! And her cocks entered Moon's upper and lower privates. Causing the black mare to moan loudly in delight! Loving every second. She tried to keep up, moving her hips forth and back, trying to feel her love's cocks as much as she could! But she wanted to do more. And so, she used her ethereal mane and used her magic to tunr part of it into a pair of cocks, much to Twilight's surprise and delight. Moon then used her mouth and tounge to lub the cocks a bit and then shoved them in Twilight's pussy and asshole! Making Twilight announce her pleasure to the heavens. She bleed a little, but that was unnoticed by Moon. After a while Twlight glanced at the clock clock. It read 23:45pm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"It's almost midnight. Ready for the best part, my love?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"<i>*purrrrrrr*</i> Bring it, my beloved.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Mhhhhhh. Gladly.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gave a signal to the copies to incrase the pleasure they were giving to Moon and to begin to wrap this up. The copies at Moon's nipples began to lightly bite and sucked harder. The ones at Moon's wings increased their peace and began to lightly bite and to lick at the feathers of said wings. The one at Moon's horn shifted herself, until her pussy was aligned with said horn. Then, the copy let herself fall and she began to ride Moon's horn, like a cowpony (like Applejack) rides a bull in a rodeo. Moon couldn't describe the pleasure she was feeling. Her horn felt like it was going to melt inside of Twilight's copy's tight, warm, recently claimed and boiling hot pussy! Not to mention that, because of the copy's position, she was able to drink the love juices the were dripping from the copy's pussy. They kept this for a while. And, as Twilight had planned, when the clock announced midnight, Twilight, her copies and Moon came all together. Moon's orgasm consisted on milk coming out from her abused and exsausted nipples, her horn released a magical outburst that caused the copy above it to vanish, altough not before said copy's orgasm hitted Moon's head and face, much to the later's delight. She also came hard from her pussy and ass. Her love juices mixing with the hot seed that the original Twilight was relasing in her ass and in her womb. The other copies vanished after their orgasms. Leaving Twilight and Moon alone. They were just beggining to regain their full senses and were barely aware of their surroundings. The only thing they were fully aware, was of each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Geez. If I had known how great sex was, I would have done this before. But, I'm glad I didn't. Because that would mean that you wouldn't have been my first.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Same here. You were my first too. And I'm happy that it was you, my beloved Twilight Andromeda Sparkle.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I'm happy that my first time was with the love of my life.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh? And who would that be? Hmm?\"</span>, teased Moon. Knowing the answer but wanting to hear it coming from he love's sweet lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Why, that would be the only mare that could be so special to me. She's an incredible mare that was once an enemy, but now she's the most precious being in my existence. She represents the wourld that I love most. The night. And she is the the keeper of the dreams. A guardian angel for her allies, and lover, dreams. Yet, she's a demon and Tartarus bringer to her enemies. And her name in no other, than the one who infuses fear in her foes hearts, yet safety in her allies ones. She is my only one, the love and light of my exsistence, Nightmare Moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Twilight finished her speech, Moon untangled herself from her lover and went to her side. So looked straight at Twilight's eyes. Her own being teared. She then planted a loving and firm kiss and Twilight's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"That was lovely, my beloved Twi Twi. Thank you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"No. Thank <b>YOU</b>, Nightmare Moon. For coming into my life.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey embraced each other, and then sleep took them both.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, everything in Poniville was pretty much the same. The bakerpony baked, the ffarmponies tended to the fields and cattle, the birds sung happily, almost everything was the same as always. Almost. There was one difference that morning. One that only two ponies knew. Those two ponies were currently sleeping in a certain tree library on the basement. In the basement were a purple Unicorn and a black Alicorn. Both were holding each other close. And if somone were to see them, they would see that, by the way they were holding each other, there was a lot of love between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight Sparkle woke up, feeling a bit groggy. Her hair was a mess, not one strand of hair in place. Her fur was messed to, from all the activity of last night.<br>\r\nShe looked at the object in front of her but didn't recognized it yet, for her vision was still a bit hazy. Once her eyes decided to work properly, she recognized the mare sleeping next to her. Then, all  of the events from last night returned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cviolet\">*So it wasn't a dream.*</span></i>, she thought happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at the wall clock and was slightly surprised to see that it was 11:00 am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><i>*The sex must have  worn us out more than what we tought. Still, enough is enough.*</i> \"Moon. Moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to wake up her teacher/marefriend by calling to her and nuddging her. But to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cviolet\">*Hmm. What to do? What to- Oh! I know!*</span></i>, she mentaly shouted, her face bearing a naughty smile. She carefully disentangled herself from Moon's hooves, who let out an unconcious disapointed whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Twilight moved to Moon's lower body. To her marehood, more specificly. One there, she got in position and began to, slowly at first, lick Moon's pussy. The black mare was letting out moan after moan from Twilight's ministrations. Each time, Twilight increased her peace a little bit more, increasing the pleasure her lover recived. Soon enough, Twilight cold tell that Moon was close. So, for the coup de grace, she turned herself belly up and injected her horn up to the base in Moon's pussy and bit and sucked her clit at the same time. Moon's orgasm was quite explosive. Her juices, as well as Moon's scream of ecstasy were delightful for Twilight. Her goal had bee acomplished tough, Moon now was wide awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Goodness, if it's going to be like that every morning, then I can't wait for towmorrow!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*giggle* Good morning, my love.\"</span>, said Twilight, while collecting all of Moon's seed from her horn, mane and muzzle with her magic and making sure to drink it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Mmmmm. A good morning, indeed.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"How did you slept?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Frankly, I hadn't had such a good night of sleep in a long, long time.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a gurgling noice was heard. It came from Moon's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I guess we're both hungry. So? What do you want for lunch? Regular menu or the meat menu? Hmm?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*chuckle* I was thinking we could find ourselves some preys on town.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Good idea. But first, I think it would be wise to count our prioritary targets and decide who gets who.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hmm. Yes, that would be wise. But, I thought that you wanted to eat them all?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I did, before. But now, I want to share them with you. Otherwise I would be selfish. Besides, I'm sure you want to get back at Celestia and/or Luna, don't you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Yes I do. So, how do we do this?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight then used her magic to summon a black board and she hanged it from the wall. She then conjured two chalk pieces. magenta for herself and teal foe Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Now, if I'm correct, the bearers of harmony left are Rainbow Dash, Applejack and Fluttershy, who are Loyalty, Honesty and Kindness respectively.  Then, there's my assistant, Spike. He's a baby dragon. Next is my family, which consists in my brother, Shining Armor, my mother, Twilight Velvet, my father Night Light and Princess Cadence, my sister-in-law. Lastly, there's Celestia and Luna.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"So that makes a total of 10 targets. Five-five?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes. Now then, we have one Dragon, three Alicorns, three Unicorns, two Pegasi and one Earth Pony. If it's okay with you, I think that you should take the Applejack, Rainbow Dash, my father, Luna and Cadence. And I will take Spike, Fluttershy, my brother, my mother and Celestia. How does that sound?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Sounds like a prefect recipe!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Oh, stop it, you naughty Alicorn, you!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"So, your brother married your foalsitter, huh?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"He, he. Yes he did. Which was a blessing for me. Cadence has always been like a sister for me I tresure her a lot. Though the marriage wasn't what we expected, that's for sure. It was pretty eventful.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hm? How so?\"</span>, asked Moon with intrigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, are you familiar with the Changeling race?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Ugh. Pesky little creatures who feed on love and can take others appearence. Not really my favorite creatures. But what do they have to do with the marriage?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Hmph. They attempted to invade Canterlot during the marriage. Their queen, Chrysalis had foalnapped Cadence and had taken her appearence. She did so because my brother's specia talent resolves around magic shield and protective magic. He was also the main supporter of the barrier that surrounded Canterlot. By controlling him and feeding on his love for Cadence, myself and our family, when the time came, she would be able to lower the barrier and her army of changelings would be able to invade. I suspected her, since she acted differently that the Cadence I knew. But, when I tried to talk with my friends, no pony belived me. Not even Celestia. So, while I was alone and vulnerable, the fake Cadence approached me and sent me to the Crystal Caves beneath Canterlot. However, that was a mistake. Because I managed to find the real Cadance in there. We escaped and went straight to the throne room, where the ceremony was taking place. Once there, we revealed to everypone who Chrysalis was, then, after Shining Armor snapped out of Chrysalis's spell, he and Cadence united their magic and created a powerful barrier made of pure love. It was more that what the changelings could take. So, all of them were expeled of Canterlot and sent to the Bad Lands, where it's believed they remain until this date.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon's jaw was almost touching the ground. To think that her Twilight had gone through things like that. Right now, she had half a mind to go to the Bad Lands and kill all the changelings there herself for making Twilight suffer like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"What about Celestia? Surely she tried to fight the changeling queen?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*sigh* She tries but, the queen still had Shining's love under her power. So, she managed to overpower Celestia. It was quite a blow to everypony. After all, it was belived that Celestia was invincible and all mighty. Then we saw her fallen on the ground with the upper half of her horn scorched.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling events that had had a great impact on her life and herself, Twilight was sobbing and trying not to cry. Moon was saddened by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\"><i>*That's it! The changelings will perish!!!*</i></span>, Moon thought, enraged. But she calmed herself before addressing Twilight again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I can imagine that it would be the case. Still...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon went to Twilight's side and hugged her close to her body and cover her with  both of her black and majestic wings, offering comfort. An offer that Twilight took gladly. She turned around to face Moon's body, trew her hooves around it and cryed openly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I'm so sorry that you had to go through so much, my love.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"It's o-okay. After all, I-I grew stronger in magic and in s-spirit from that experience. A-among others. I'm sorry Moon, I making your beautiful coat all wet...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Nonsense, Twilight. Cry all you need. That was a terrifiyng experience. And I'm guessing that the others were so as well. You can tell the other to me, in your own time.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked up at Moon's eyes and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Thank you, Moon. For coming into my lfe. For taking me as your apprentice and as your lover and for comforting me. I had no idea how much I needed somepony special like you in my life. Ever since the events to the invasion, things were never the same between Celestia and me. Sure, we were still friends and teacher-student. But I couldn't talk to her about my true feellings anymore. Not like I can talk to you. With you, I feel that notheing can harm me. I feel safe and secure. Thank you, my love. For everything.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"You are quite welcome, my dear. Say, I think I know where to find out meals for the weeks to come.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Oh? What do you have in mind, hun?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*blush* How would you like to get back at the changeling queen? Hmm?\"</span>, said Moon with a malicious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Seriously?! F-for real?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Of course! I won't let anyone that harms you go unpunished!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*BLUSH* M-Moon...\"</span>, Twilight smiles at the idea of getting her vegeance against Chrysalis and her people. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"I find that idea QUITE appealing, my love! Still, while we both will feed-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Don't worry, beloved. I'll leave the queen for you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Thank you, Moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"You're welcome. Now, it's time to feast!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Moon became took Twilight with her mane and they both became a mist that was a mix of blue and lavander and took them both to the Bad Lands.</span></div></div>",

Surprisingly for Twilight, the trip took little more than an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Say, Moon. You were faster this time. Does it have to do with the ritual we performed?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Yes. Due to the ritual, we have a part of each other within us. Thus, we share some of each other's talents and techniques. That's also why you were able to become a mist with me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I see. Interesting. If you don't mind, I would like to begin lessons once we finish digesting our feast.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"That sounds lovely. Besides, the sooner we begin, the sooner we'll be ready to begin our hunt.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey currently found themselves on the frontier of the Bad Land, planning the best way to approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"May I suggest that we go as a mist, like we did before?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"No. It would be too risky. The changelings could detect our emotions. Besides, the love we feel for each other is very powerful so it's bound to draw their attention. We'll have a better chance if we use a \"vision\" spell to scan the area, so that we have an idea of the place we have to get to and then we teleport straight to the throne room.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hm, hm. Quite cunning, aren't you, my pupil?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Thanks\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Now then, want to do the honors?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"It will be my pleasure.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Twilight closed her eyes and her horn glowed with a faint magenta color. However, this time it was a darker shade. And that too, was because of Moon's magic inside of her. When she opened her eyes again, they were white, indidcating that the spell was working. It too only a minute or two, and Twilight ceased the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I got it. I know exactly where we have to go.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Excelent. But before we go.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon lowered her head util she was almost touching Twlight's. Having cought on, Twilight leaned the rest of the way and the two kissed briefly but fiercely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"That my lucky charm fo you, my love.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*chuckle* Oh, Moon. You incorrigible mare!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight ignited her horn once more and in an instant, they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Throne Room, Changeling Hive-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis was siting in her throne, feeding. They had been luck to capture a squad of 6 royal guards, which consisted in two solar guards and four lunar guards, that were patroling the area, to ensure that the changelings didn't tried anything against Equestria again. However, they had been careless and thus got caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Hm, hm. How kind of you to come around by lunch time. We've been starving for days now, feeding in the ocasional animals that appear once in a while.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! You got what you deserved, damn bug!\", yelled the leader of the squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Oh? It seems that somepony is feeling talkative, huh? But!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis rose her left hoof and slapped it across the guards right cheek. Breaking a coule of theets and making him spit a bit of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"I didn't brought yuo here to talk! You are food. And food dosen't talk. You see, we have found a more effective way to feed on love. By consuming a creature, we absorb all of that creature's love for any and everyone that that love is directed to.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards' pupils shrunk to pin pricks and that elicited a chuckle from the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"It seems you realised what's going to happen.\"</span>, she said, while posting herself in front of the squad's leader. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Oh. And be sure to struggle a lot. I love it when my prey fights.\"</span>, she said, licking her lips sloppily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her jaw to a, supposedly, impossible lenght and was bout to engulf the leader's head when she heard a buzzing sound, followed by a bright flash. One that Chrysalis recognized it was from a teleportation. Closing her mouth and turned around to find out who had disturbed her meal and, to her surprise, he saw a pitch black Alicorn. She was wearing light blue armor on her hoofs, chest and head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Who are you? What do you want?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hmph. An insect like you has no right to know my name. However, it would be rude of me not to tell you who will be the two ponies responsible for your and your hive's demise. Queen Chrysalis.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"You insolent foo! Still, I only see you. Where is the second one?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Why. She's right under my right wing. And I think you already know each other.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to Chrysalis utter shock, a very familiar purple mare. One that Crysalis not just despised, she outright hated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Twilight Sparkle.\"</span>, hissed the the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"It has been a while, hasn't it, Chrysalis?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Not long enough.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I see that you hate me. And the feeling is mutual.\"</span>, said Twilight with a cold voice. One that Chrysalis didn't recognized on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"What have you come here for?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"It seems that your memory is short isn't it? Moon-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Moon? As in Nightmare Moon?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight used her magic to zip the queen's mouth shut. The queen tried to get rid of it with her own magic, but it wouldn't come out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"You seriously lack of manners, you know that? Now, as I was saying, Moon already told you what we are here for. We are here to get revenge on you and to rid the world of Equis from your despisable kind.\"</span>, Twilight had said each of those words with pure venom in her voice. She then unziped the queen's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Ha! You think you can defeat me AND my hive with just the two of you?! Good luck with that. I defeated Celstias herself! What can you two, a fallen Alicorn and a pitiful Unicorn, hope to do against us?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*chuckle* You forget a few things, Chrysalis.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Oh? And what would those be? Hm?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"First, you beated Celestia because you had my brother's love to feed on. You yourself admitted it on that day.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"I did not!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes you did. You're exact word were <i>\"Consuming it had made me more powerful than Celestia!\"</i>.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cgreen\">*Darn it!*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"The other things you forgot, are that Nightmare Moon is just as powerful, if not more, than Princess Celestia. And lastly, I'm Celestia's former proteg\u00e9 and ber best student. As well as Nightmare Moon's student and marefriend.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last bit of information caught Chrysalis' attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"<i>*She's Nightmare Moon's student and lover now?! Uh, oh. This might not be so easy after all.*</i> How do you remember all of that?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Hmph! You think I would be able to forget that day?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's voice was changing in tone. Her voice had adquired an unmistakable tone of anger and bitterness. Ian it increased with each passing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"That day.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBegan Twilight, and as she spoke, an aura of magic surraounded her. It began faintly. But it increased by the second. Accoringly to the instensity of Twilight's feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"The day when you hurted my beloved sister-in-law. When you turned my friends against me! <b>When you turned my mentor against me!!</b> <b>WHEN YOU HARMED MY BELOVED ONES!!!\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's voice was vey loud and it carried a great deal of power, as well as her emotions. And, altough she didn't noticed, she was using the Canterlot Royal Voice that Luna had thaought her. By now, the aura had became very intense and fierce. It's size was almos trice of Twilight's height. Twilight's eyes were watering. Letting fresh tears run down freely. And she looked at the changeling queen with a pure and deeply burning hatred. Truthfully, it was the first time Twilight felt hatred for anyone. Sure, she had gotten angry, but never hated. Until now. Moon could feel Twilight's emptions perfectly. The ritual they had performed, had also created an emphatic bond between them. Allowing Moon  and Twilight to be able to sense and understand each other's every emotion. Right now, Moon couls tell that Twilight was feeling hatred and rage towards the changeling queen, sadness and sorrow from the memories of that day, guilt for not being able to help enough and a deep desire to tear the changeling queen to pieces. Moon stood in her place. Not interfearing. She knew that it was best that Twilight released those emotions, rather than keeping them bottled inside, like she had done until now. Chrysalis by now, was trembling in fear at the power that this Unicorn was showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cgreen\">*T-this isn't the same little Unicorn from that day! She more powerful now! What do I do? Not only there's her, but also Nightmare Moon who, according to Sparkle, is equally or more powerful than Celestia herself! I- I have no choice. I- I can't win. But, maybe I can make a deal to save my children.*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Chrysalis stood in front of Twilight. Giving her an apologetic look and, surprising Twilight and Moon, she bowed to Twilight. She was laying in her belly with her front and back hoofs crossed and her head lowered. She was surrendering. She then looked up to Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"I know I did horrible things. And I won't excuse them. I'll take any punishment you seem fitting. But please, spare my children. They were just following my orders. Nothing more. And we were desperate! Please! Take me and spare my children!\"</span>, said Chrysalis, crying. Tears that Twilight recognized as genuine ones. Twilight lowered her head, her aure diminishing a bit, and seemed to think about what Chrysalis had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, reader, what do you think? Will there be forgiveness or not?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight stood there for a moment, thinking of what to do. She wanted to devour Chrysalis. That was going to happen without a single doubt. But, could she condemn a whole race for the mistakes of one? Can a child, or children in this case, be blamed for the mother's sins? Then, a asolution ocurred to her. Even tough Twilight was furious, she made a neutral, emotionless face. Her aura didn't diminished, however. Then, she adressed the changeling queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Raise, Chrysalis.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's tone indicated that that she wasn't to be argued or questioned. So, Chrysalis obeyed without delay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I think I know how to decide if just you or your whole race will perish.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. She was going to die. But at least her childern had a chance of being saved, hopefully. Twilight used her magic to summon a ring that Chrysalis recognized as a no-magic one. She sliped it around Chrysalis' horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Now, since you're a hive, I assume you share one mind and thus one collective memory, yes?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Yes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Good. Then I will use a spell to see that memory. You said that they were only following your orders and had no will, correct? I will check that. If what you are saying is truth, they'll be spared. If not, you will all die.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"I- I understand.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight ignited her horn with a magenta glow and with it, she touched the queen's forhead. At once, she saw all of thr changelings memories. Once she was done, she let go of the queen and stood there, panting from the efort. Chrysalis was pating too. Not used to feeling other magic besides her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"S-so, what did you found?\"</span>, asked Chrysalis, with hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that hope was gone when she saw Twilight making a face of anger and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"What's wrong, my love?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong! The other changelings indeed were following Chrysalis' orders. However they were doing so on their own free will! What's more, I could see what they did to their victims. They didn't just attacked Equestria. They attacked the Dragons, the Gryphons, the Zebras and even a few places in Saddle Arabia! Do you know what they do with their victims, Moon? They drain their emotions from straight from their horn! And they do so until either, the victim dies or until their just empty shells! Until their shanows of who they used to be! And they don't just attack when they need to feed. They do it for fun and for pleasure!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon was shocked, disgusted and horrified!. Sure, she wanted to bring Eternal Night and have a living meal now and then. But she wanted her soon to be subjects to live happily under her's and Twilight's reign! That's why she was developing a spell that could reform the ponies that they ate. So that they would have their meals but nopony would die or suffer from loss. She would never be so cruel or kill without need!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"W-wait! I can explain-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cviolet\">\"SILENCE,BUG!!!\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's ire was now bigger than ever, and so was her aura. Now, the aura was four times Twilight's height and it expanded a bit around her. Moon too was furious at the queen and her children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cviolet\">\"You, Changelings, have sealed your fate! We will get rid of you, cursed parasites, and rid the world of Equis from your plague!\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><i>*NO! This may be the last thing I do but!!!*</i> <b>\"ATTACK!!!\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, multiple changelings appeared from many tunnels in the throne room and surrounded Twilight and Moon. They all stood firm. Ready to fire at their queen's command. By Twilight's counting, there was a total of 150 changelings. Not counting Chrysalis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"So you want to do this the hard way? Fine! Moon, love, care lend a hoof?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*chuckle* It'll be my pleasure, honey.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Moon! Not now. Wait until we're done here.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Aw. You're no fun, darling.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Don't worry, I'll make it up to you. <i>I promise</i>. *wink*\"</span>, said Twilight, with a naughty tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Enough! What is this, a battle or a couple moment?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*chuckle* You're the only one here who thinks this is a battle.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"What?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"You heard her. Now, Moon. Let's beat this bunch of weaklings already!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Gladly.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and Moon joined their horn and ignited them, mixing their magic and creating an imens thunderstorm inside of the throne room. They also conjured a barrier to protect themselves and the captured guards. The thunderstorm took care of Chrysalis' children quickly. In mere seconds, all of them laiid unconcious. Leaving only Chrysalis to be dealt with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Thanks for your help, love.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"It was no problem at all, dear.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards were stunned. With only one attack, they had beaten the entire changeling army! Chrysalis too was shocked. Now they were all condemned! They would all die! Chrysalis simply laid there, weeping for herself, for her children, and for the fate that awaited them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Chrysalis.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis looked up and saw the two ones that were responsible fo this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"You have no one to blame but yourself, you know that? If you hadn't invaded Canterlot, none of this would have happened.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cgreen\">\"WE WERE DESPERATE-\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Horseshit!!! If you were so desperate, why didn't you tried to find a way to comunicate with Celestia or Luna? Why didn't you asked for help or for an audience with them? They would have recived you with no problems at all!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Liar!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I'm not lying, Chrysalis. The pony kind are good by nature. Some turn evil, true. But most are good natured and would have accepted you in due time!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"More lies! How could anyone accept us? You said it yourself. We are parasites.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Crysalis-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Stop! Just deliver our fate to us get it done already!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*sigh* Fine then. If that's how you want it, so be it. Your fate and the fate of all of your children is to be devoured by Moon and by myself. Call it poetic justice.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this sentence, Chrysalis could only weep harder. Ironicly, her children and herself wolud suffer the same fate they had inflicted on others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Want some help, my love?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"No, thank you. I can do this. Still, until the changelings awake, I would llove to have sompony to give me belly rubs after I finish my meal.\"</span>, sid Twilight in a sultry tone. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Then again. We have to deal with the guards too.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you mean with, deal with us?\", asked the leader fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Well, we can't let you escape. After all, if you did, you would tell Celestia and Luna about us. Either, because it's your duty or because you would think it's the right thing to do. And we can't let that happen.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please! We won't tell anypony!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I'm really sorry. But we can't risk it. We have plans. And we can't let anypony find out.\"</span>, said Twilight while standing in front of the guard.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Still, Moon will use a spell. So that you sleep through it all and don't feel any pain. I'm truly sorry, but that's the best we can do.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards looked down with sad expresions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand.\", said the leader. \"But, can we ask something, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Sure. What is it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since we're going to be eaten, we would like to choose whowill eat us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was surprised by this. She looked at Moon, who too was surprised. Moon smiled, and so did Twilight. She looked at the guards and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Of course you can. It's only fair. Now then, who do you choose?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards talked among themselves for a minute or two before they decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We, Solar guards would like to be devoured by you, Twilight Sparkle. And the Nocturnal Guards want to be eaten by you, Nightmare Moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight and Moon nodded. Once that was done, Twilight went to the fallen queen and readied herself. Chrysalis saw her, and decided to close her eyes. She didn't wanted witness her demise. Twilight opened her mouth a bit and began to suck Chrysalis' horn into her mouth. Once she reached the base, she opened her mouth wide. Wider than before. Before, she had to eat normal sized ponies. But Chrysalis was more or less Alicorn sized. She would make good practice for when she ate Celestia. Then, Twilight engulfed Chrysalis' head, followed by her neck. Chrysalis' imprint could already be seen clearly in Twilight's neck. Even tough they were witnessing such an act, none of the guards could loo away. Moon didn't looked away either. Rather, she looked with pride at hre student/lover for doing so well so far. But she was worried for the next part. Bewcause Twilight was now past the queen's neck and at her shoulders. She grinned. Normally, they would pose an obstacle. However, it seemed that she didn't inherited only the baking talent from Pinkie Pie. Now that Pinkie had bee absorbed completely by her body, she could stretch further. And so she did. She opened her mouth a bit more to allow the queen's shoulders into her gullet. Next was Chrysalis' belly and wings. Twilight did enjoyed the taste of the changeling queen. But this was a matter of vengeance and justice. So she couldn't take her time. Thus, she pressed on. She gulped down Chrysalis' belly. Then, she raised her head to the ceiling to get some aid from gravity. Twilight then gulped the queen's buttocks next, then her hooves and lastly, her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*buuuurp* Oops. Sorry\"</span>, she said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinued...</span></div></div>",

Excuse me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*giggles* Congratulations, Twilight.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Thank you, my beloved.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Seriously tough. I honestly thought you would get stuck on the shoulders.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Me too, at first. But, remember Pinkie Pie a.k.a Laughter?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">Oh? The pink earth pony? Yes. What about her?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, whenever there was a cake, she would stretch her jaw impossibly wide. So, since I had eaten her, I thought \"maybe I can do it too now\" and, to my relief, I was proved right.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I see. Quite an uncommon ability she had tough. Not many can stretch their jaws to the point of eating a whole cake. Celestia and Luna are the only ponies I know who can do that.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"He, he. Yeah. I'm aware of Celestia's sweet tooth. Heck! She herself created a room in the castle made 100% of chocolate! The room is of the same size of the throne room! Before, I never knew how she managed to eat so much cake and not gain a single pound. But now I know. Guess it's another advantage of this \"diet\", huh?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Precisely. And an entire room made of chocolate? I didn't knew about that one.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Not many know. If memory serves right, the ones who know about it are me, Luna, Celestia's advisor, Celestia herself and now you. Still, while I do appreciate a good chocolate or cake now and then. I would have Moon Pies anyday over those. And no, I don't mean it in the naughty sense. Rather, tonight, I will turn you into a littleral Moon Pie, hun.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*blush* Oh, Twilight! Who's the uncorrigible mare now, hm?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them began laughing out loud. Whn they heard two voices that made them shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Awwwwww! Isn't this a lovely sight, Aunty Luna?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Why, indeed it is, my dear niece. Although it's quite unexpected, I must say.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"L-Luna! Cadence! W-what are you doing here?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Shh. Calm down, Twily. First thing first. Hello, you must be Nightmare Moon, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Y-yes, I'am.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"I see. My name is Cadence, pleased to meet you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Cadence? Twilight's foalsitter and sister-in-law?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Ah, I see Twily has told you about me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Yes, she did. And the pleasure is mine. She also told me about the wedding incident.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Yes. It was quite harsh. And that brings us to this moment. We came because Celestia sensed that Twilight was in distress and a huge surge of magical power. But she couldn't make it here, since she was in ameeting with the Gryphon and the Zebra ambasadors. So she called us. And when I heard that Twilight was here, I had to come and ensure that my favorite and precious little sister was okay.\"</span>, said Cadence, approaching Twilight and hugging her as best as she could. <span class=\"cpink\">\"Still, I would never had imagined that the events form that day had scarred you like that, Twiliy. Nor that you had so much power inside of you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I didn't knew it myself. I guess I had my feelings buried so deeply that I had forgoten about them. As for the power, Moon had already told me that I had a lot of potential.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Oh? Moon, is it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Ah! Er... Well, you see...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"*giggles* You're so cute when your nervous like that, Twily! And don't worry. I already knew that you two were a couple. I'm the Princess of Love, remember?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"And, judging by thee enourmous belly, I don't think we need to ask where the queen of the bugs is.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"He, he. Yeah. At first, this new diet of mine took me by surprise. But, soon enough I linked the dots. You, Cadence and Celestia do this as well, don't you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"We did, in the past. But our subjects feared us and some even hated us for doing so. So we stopped.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"You won't have to worry about that for long. I'm developing a new spell and, with Twilight's help, it will be a success. It's a spell that can reform anypony that has been digested. You just have to apply it to the meal and, once it comes out of the *ahem* backdoor, the pony will be instantly reformed.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Oh, goodie! We'll have our living meals back!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes. And I think none of you would mind having bugs for lunch, would you? I mean, there are 150 changelings here. And I already ate Chrysalis so, I think we can rationalize. 40 for Luna, 40 for Cadence, 40 and 30 for myself. How does that sounds?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Fair enough.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"I concurr.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Me too.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Good! Now, about the guards...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Oh! Don't worry about them. I'll use a memory spell and erase what they saw today, is that okay with you, boys?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards looked at each other and nodded fervishly at Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Okay, good. I didn't really wanted to start eating innocents. So... What do we do now?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Why, we feast, of course!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three alicorns used thair magic to divide the changelings into the agreed amounts. And once that was done, they dug in. Some of Chrysalis had already been digested. Thus, Twilight could walk now and had some space left for dessert. By the end of the buffet, Moon had eaten 30 changelings, Luna 25, Cadence 26 and Twilight 15, due to what was left of Chrysalis in her belly. After that, they put a paralisis spell on the remaining changelings, so that even if they woke up, they wouldn't be able to move and a sleep spell of the guards. Then, thay tehmselfves drifted of to sleep. With Twilight and Moon sleeping in each others hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"*Yawn* We still have a lot to talk about, you know? So, we'll meet at Dreamland to have our chat, okay?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Alright. *yawn* See you soon girls.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they all drifted of to sleep physically, while their mindsweant to meet oeach other to try and exlapin what was happening.</span></div></div>",

However, this part felt, rather than seemed (since all around was darkness), unfamiliar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I must be in a different part than where I was with Moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Precisely, Twilight.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight turned and found herself looking at Luna and Cadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Hi, girls! Hey, where's Moon?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something tackled her and she and the mysterious object rolled in the ground a bit. Twilight turned and found that the mysterious objec was a known, and very welcomed, one. Moon smiled at her and sighed hapily when Twilight began to stroke her right cheeck with her left hoof. Moon then spoke with a playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Missed me?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*chuckle* Hi, love.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hi, beloved.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth stared at each other with care and passion. But, just as Moon and Twilight were about to kiss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"<b>*AHEM*</b> I hope we're not interrupting?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"*giggles*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon and Twilight turned and saw Luna giving them a look that said 'Seriously?' and Cadence giggling at them like a school filly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Eh, he, he...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Sorry. We got a bit carried away.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"No. Really?\"</span> ,said Luna with sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Okay, okay. We get it. Bussiness now, intimacy later.\"</span>, said Moon, as she and Twilight got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Right. Now then-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Save it, Luna. We know what you want to know. And, to make a long story short, there was a great difference in power on the time that Celestia used the elements on Moon and the time when my friends and I did so. And, since the elements try to make balance, they separated you from Moon and gave her a body. That happened because when the six of us faced Moon, we weren't nearly as powerful as an Alicorn. As for our relationship, I was in my library, planning on my next meal when Moon entered through my window as a mist and took form in front of me. Rather than fighting, we began chatting, cautiously at first. From then, we found we had a lot of things in common. Also, Moon helped me to overcome some of my insecurity and comforted me after telling her about the wedding. All of that together, along with how caring and loving she was with me, made me fall for her. Plus, her looks are QUITE a bonus!\"</span>, she added a wink to that last comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon was blushing like a tomato. She had been wanting to ask Twilight what she tought of her and why she had fallen for her. Now, she knew. And she was happy for it. She embraced Twilight and gave her the kind of hug only a lover can give. Making them both blush profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Thank you, my beloved star.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"You're welcome, my precious moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight then leaned in and rested her head on Moon's side. Both looking at each other's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"BEFORE you go all lovey dovey again, that answers most of our questions. However, we still wonder about your purposes, <i>Moon</i>.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat earned Luna a glare from Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"HEY! Only I get to call her Moon and Moony!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Then what do we all her? And, <i>\"Moony\"</i>?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">Call me, Diana. And <i>\"Moony\"</i> is the pet name Twilight used for me when we had sex. I call her <i>\"Twi Twi\"</i>.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"You ALREADY had sex?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Yes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"What? It's not like we did something wrong.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"W-well, no but... Normally one waits and dated a bit before getting to second base.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Maybe so, but we want and will do thing in our own way and at our own peace. Right, hun?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Absolutely, honey! Just because others do it like that, dosen't mean we have to do it as well. This is OUR relationship. And we'll manage it as we see fit.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"*sigh* Okay. You win. But you haven't answered my question.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Look. I'm not the same as before, okay? I don't want eternal night anymore. All I want is to be by my Twilight's side for the rest of my days.\"</span>, said Moon, looking lovingly at her precious marefriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Very well then. In that case, we won't interfer, Still, Tia will want to know-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Please, don't tell Celestia. Not yet.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Why not?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Because we don't think she has forgiven me yet. And if she found out not only that I'm alive, but that Twilight and I are having a relationship...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Yeah. I don't think she would be happy. Okay, we won't tell. But you'll have to tell her eventually.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Don't worry. I'm sure we'll figure something out.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Well then. We shall leave you alone then. Let's go, aunty.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"What? Already?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Yes. I think that Moon and Twilight have a <b>LOT</b> to <i>\"talk\"</i> about.\"</span>, she looked at Twilight and winked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"A-alright then.\"</span>, said Luna. Not really understanding what her niece was implying. <span class=\"cindigo\">\"Good night you two.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Good night, Twily. Good night, Diana. Take <i>GOOD</i> care of Twilight, will you?\"</span>, she said, winking at Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh, don't worry. I will.\"</span>, countered Moon, winking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Good night, Luna. Good night, Cadence.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"See you later.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Luna and Cadence woke up, took the sleeping guards, not before erasing their memories of today though, their remaining share's of changelings and went back to Canterlot to give Celestia their report. Meanwhile, back in dreamland:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Moon, you weren't serious when you said that you didn't wanted eternal night anymore, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Of course not, Twilight. But I couldn't tell them the truth now, could I?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Certainly not. Now then, let's wake up, pick our left overs and go back home, shall we?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I'm right behind you, hun.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*giggles*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did just that. They collected their meals for tomorrow and went to Twilight's home in Ponyville.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight and Moon woke up on the changeling's former hive, just recently returning from dreamland and from their chat with Luna and Cadence. Both were still wraped in each other's hooves with their faces facing the ceilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Hi, Moon.\"</span>, said Twilight, turning to see her beloved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hi, dear- *GASP!*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"What's wrong, love?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"W-well...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon then conjured a full-body mirror for Twilight to see herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*jaws drop* Oh, my, gosh!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imager that Twilight saw in the mirror resembled her. But she was way taller now, being only half a head shorter than Moon. Her body also was longer, as were her mane, tail and her horn. Her horn was the most noticeable change, aside from her stature. Now, it was roughly 3/4 the size of an Alicorn's horn and it was perfectly spiralled (think of a drill).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"And I thought you were pretty before. Now I think your plain beautiful!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Oh, Moon, stop it!\"</span>, said Twilight, quite embarassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"So, do you like the changes?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Oh! Do I! I also feel more powerful than before, both, in magic and physical strenght.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hmmm. I can't wait to try that new strenght of your's in more, intimate, ways.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*growl* Neither can I, honey.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I thought you said this should stop?\"</span>, said Moon, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"As if you would listen. Still, I did promised you to turn you into a literal \"Moon Pie\", did I not?\"</span>, Twilight bore a seductive smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*chuckle* You're progressing quite a bit in the art of seduction, aren't you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yeah, I guess I am. Still, I think it'll be useful for our purposes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh? How so?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I'll tell you back at home. No one will bother us there.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Okay then.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Twilight and Moon rounded up their left meals, which totalized 25 changelings, and teleported to Twilight's home. Once they had arrived:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Say, Moon. I don't feel hungry. What about you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Now that you mention it, no. So what do we do with these pests?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Hmm... How about we shrink them and place them in a jar by our bed?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh! That sound great! And speaking of bed and accomodations, I think we should do a bit of a reform here. I mean, I don't want to sleep in the basement. And I don't think you want to either.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Hmm, you're right about that. Enev if last night's company was, exquisite.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*blushes* Oh? Was I that good?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"That good and much better, my love.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Huh, you sure know how to treat a mare, hmm?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I'm learning from the very best.\"</span>, said Twilight, bating her eyelashes to Moon.<span class=\"cviolet\"> \"Now, first things first. When I said that seduction would be useful, I meant that it would help us catch our preys. I'm not that naive. I've seen my friends and even Celestia staring at my flanks when they thought I wasn't aware of them doing so.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"So, you mean to seduce them and, give them one last good time, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon sounded a bit hurt with that. And that fact didn't go unnoticed by Twilight. So, she went to her marefriend's side and hugged her tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Hey. I know you're not very keen on this idea. But it's necessary for our ultimate goal. Besides, what I'll share with them, will be lust only. But my everything will <b>ALWAYS</b> belong to you and only you. Moon, I love you. And I belong to you. In body, mind, sould and, more than anything, in heart.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight then felt something wet hit herright shoulder. She looked up and saw that Moon was crying. But she was also smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Thank you, Twilight. I needed that. I needed to hear it. I needed to be sure that this relationnship that we have is real! That it's not just a dream or my mind playing a trick on me. I- I'm scared, Twilight. Scared that I'll wake up and that everything, and especially you will disapear! I'm scared that-!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon couldn't finish that phrase. Because Twilight had sealed her lips shut with her own. She kissed her precious Alicorn with all the passion she could muster and began to french kiss her. She kept doing so until both couldn't take it anymore and she broke the kiss to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Tell me, my love. Did that felt like a dream? Or like an ilusion?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Twilight...I-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Shh. Don't worry Moon.\"</span>, said Twilight, holding her mate closer and tighter. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"I promise that I won't leave you. Not now, not ever. I swear it, with the Moon itself as my witness, that I'll be forever by your side. Besides, if I had intended to leave you, I wouldn't have done that binding ritual with you now, would I?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*sob**sob* Thank you, my love! Thank you so much! I'll never leave you either! I promise that I'll do everything in my power to make you happy!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"And I'll be happy as long as you are. And if you still think that this is a dream...\"</span>, said Twilight, drying up the last remaining tears from Moon's beautiful teal eyes. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Then wait here.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Where are you going?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"It's a surprise.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she teleported away. So, to pass time until her marefriend came back, she began searching for a book to entertain herself. Soon enough, she ended up at the farthest part of the library. There, she found a door that said, \"Restricted Area: Only to enter with the librarian's permission\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hmm. Well, I'm her marefriend so, that should give me permission, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she used her magic ot open the door and went inside. Inside, she found many books and scrolls that looked very old, yet well mantined. She browsed for a while until a book drew her attention. It did so because, diferently from the other books, it looked a bit dusty. Like it hadn't been read in quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hmm? What's this?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the book and read the title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*GASP!* O-oh my goodness!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book she had just found had the title <i>\"Positions and Kisses from  the Pony Sutra\"</i>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\"><i>*I doubt Twilight knows of this. I'm sure that if she knew about this book, she would have had it in a squeaky clean condition, like all the others. Well, Twi Twi, you wantd to make me a surprise. But now, you're not the nly one with a surprise in store.*</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, while Twilight was somewhere, doing something, Moon took the time to read and study all and every detail of the book and to absorb every piece of information it had. After a couple of hours, she had finished the entire book. Another thing they had in common. Both were avid readers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\"><i>*Oh boy, Twilight is in for a surprise. I'll let her lead tonight. But, tomorrow, I'll have her screaming my name to the heavens over and over again!*</i></span>, thought Moon with glee and joy. Of course, she wouldn't harm Twilight, she'd never EVER dream of doing so. But what she had planned for Twilight would most likely impede her from walking straight for a couple of days! Suddenly, she heard somepony calling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Moon? Moon, where are you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Coming dear!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon exited the restricted area and found Twilight standing there, giving her a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Um... Sorry. I thought that since I was your marefriend, that I had permission to go in.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*sigh* It's okay.\"</span>, said Twilight with a reassuring smile.<span class=\"cviolet\"> \"Just warn me next time. Some tomes need to be handled carefully or the spells inside maight become unstable. And I don't want you to get hurt, okay?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Okay. Thanks for caring.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"No problem, love. Now, can you come with me to the bedroom? I have something to show you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Okay. Lead the way.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon couldn't help but be excited. Sure, they had already had sex. But, until now, she hasn't entered Twilight's bedroom. So they went up the stairs and stoped right at the door.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nContinue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Warning: Sex chapter ahead on option one.)</span></div></div>",

Now, wait a minute here, and I'll call you when you can come in, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blushed slightly when Moon called her like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight teleported inside of her room. She could have opened the door, but she didn't wanted to spoil the surprise she had made for her beloved moon. Truly, their relationship may have began quickly. But she was absolutely sure that Moon was her destined one. She could feel it in her very soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the room, she took a good look at the modifications she had done to it. Her bed had been replaced with the one that they had used last night. The sheets had been washed clean. The room was altered to fit the bed. The ceiling now portrayed the starry sky that they loved so much and was enchanted to make it so that the constellations it showed changed frequently. The walls had been painted dark purple. A middle point between the colors of Moon's coat and her own. The furniture, aside from the bookshelves, was now a slightly darker tone of Aqua. The bookshelves were pink colored. Everything looked perfect. She then took a look at the attire she was going to use for her dream-mare. A dark-red dress with light-red highlights that hugged her curves not too loosely and not too tightly and that showed and highlighted har now more slender legs. It also was cut in a way to give the watcher a slight peek under the dress. As if inviting to take a better look. Also, just as they had arranged, on top of the night stand, was the jar with the leftover changelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight didn't wasted more time and doned the dress. She also went to her mirror to brush her mane and to apply a bit of make-up. She applied a bit of shadow on her thin eyebrows. Just enough to slightly darken them. She also put some blush on her cheecks. Lastly, she put on an ametist colored lipstick. She looked at herself in the mirror and hardly recognized herself. She then grabbed a blood-red rose she had bought that day andlaid on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Better not make her wait any second longer* \"Okay love, come in.\", she said in a seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time dear. Now what was it-!\", Moon would have finished her sentence, if she wasn't busy admiring the room of her lover. She looed at everything in the room. She, of course, knew the meaning of the colors. So, she instantly got the message Twilight wanted to transmit to her. She then looked to the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*gasp!* W-woah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggles* Speechless, are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes. You did all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. But you haven't looked at everything in the room now, have you~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon then lowered her gaze until her dragonic eyes rested on the love of her eternal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*GASP!!! T-Twilight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smirked. \"Yes dear~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon looked Twilight over and over. Her eyes graping every detail of the most beautiful thing they had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so beautiful my love...But, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought I could do something special or you. Besides, I want you to be completely sure and reassured that this is no dream, my beloved moon. This is real. And so am I. And I'll never going to leave you. Never.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon was crying again. but this time, they were tears, not of sadness or fear. But of joy and love. She was deeply touched at what her marefiend had done for her. That she would go to such lengts just to reassure her and cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so? What do you think?\", asked Twilight, nervous and fearful that Moon hadn't liked what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead on answering with words, Moon pounced on Twilight and hugged her tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sniff, sniff* Oh dearest Twilight. I love it! Thank you so much for doing this for me! You have no idea how happy you make me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckles* If it's anywhere close as how happy you make me, then I have a pretty good idea. And I'm glad that you feel that way. Here, this is for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwiight gave Moon the rose was had been holding. Moon sniffed it an emitted a pleased sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lovely, both in appearance and in scent. Just like you love. Only you are far, far better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*blushes!* Oh Moon, you flatterer! Now, close your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon did so. And, as she expected, she felt a soft and familiar pair of lips connecting with her own. She then broke the kiss and began to use her front hooves to undress her marefriend slowly while showering Twilight's jaw line and neck with kisses and light love bites all the time. Of course, that elicited moan after moan fromt Twilight. Which was a the most beautiful symphony ever created for Moon. Once the dress was out of the way, Twilight pushed her love onto the bed and began to lick Moon's neck and chest, while Moon dedicated herself to lick her lover's horn. Twilight then used her magic to curl her tail into a more or less cock shaped thing. She took aim and let her tail dive in, straight into Moon's love tunel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept thrusting in and out, lubbing up Moon's pussy. Once it was all nice and wet, Twilight removed her tail. That caused Moon to let a disapointed whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why ever did you stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight didn't answered. Instead, she rose a bit and readied her fully erect cock to enter Moon. She then thrusted her tail in Moon's asshole and her cock on Moon's vagina at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooohhhhhhhhhh, Twilight!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight kept thrusting. Changing speed and roughness according to Moon's reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my love! Do me nice and hard! Fuck me silly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*puuurrrrrrrrr* With pleasure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they went at it for hours. Not once out of pure lust. While lust was certainly an essential element on this case, the main element was love. And, for who knows how many hours, Twilight and Moon mixed their love for each other over and over again. By the time they had finished, it was almost 3:00 am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Whew! I'm exausted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. That new magic, phisical strenght and stamina of your's is certainly something to behold and admire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*blushes* Thank you love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then. We should sleep. We'll need all the energy we can get. For today, is the last day of laizure. Tomorrow we begin you're training on black magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Alright then. Oh,  by the way, I still have one more surprise later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Another one? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. It wouldn't be surprise if I told you now, woud it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww... Not even a hint? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnope! *giggles*. Be a little patient love. It will be worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Okay, okay.\", said Moon with a slight and adorable pout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckles* You're so adorable love! Now, just a little something before we go to sleep. Close your eyes again please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon did as told. Expecting another kiss. Twilight, in the meanwhile, used her magic to grab the jar of changelings, who were wide awake now, despite the fact that they couldn't move. Twilight looked at them with a malicious smirk. Then changelings, who had been glaring at her, now gazed fearfully at one of their captors. Fearing what she had in mind for them. She then opened the jar and took 3 changelings. Leaving 22 inside of it. After closing the jar, she tosssed one into her mouth and swallowed. Licking her lips, she popped the two changelings left into her mouth, turned around, and french-kissed Moon deeply. Moon noticed there was something in their mouths. She used her tongue to touch the intruders and found, to her delight, that this kiss had some snacks to go with it. She looked at Twilight, who winked at her. Then they closed their eyes and just enjoyed for a while. When they could no longer hold the kiss, for they needed to breath, Moon used her snake-like tongue to flick one of the changelings into her marfriend's throat and the onther into her own. Both swallowed. Moaning while doing so. They separated and looke lovingly at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That lovely, my sneaky star.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggles* I thought you would like that. And we still twentytwo changelings left. So, we can do whatever we want with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Just not now. Now then ,shall we rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We shall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoon laid down on her side of the bed. Twilight laid on hers. And when they were both comfortable, they hugged each other. And like that, in no time at all, they were fast asleep. Content to be in each other's hooves.</span></div></div>",

It also feels super for me, like after eating two really big cakes.\" Twilight placed an ear against the squirming belly. The two ponies did not sound like they were in distress, indeed it almost sounded like they were enjoying themselves. A lot actually. Twilight blushed and drew back her head. She tapped against the full belly and asked, \"Cup Cake, Carrot Cake, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden twitch went through the belly of the pink pony and Pinkie burped slightly, as some of the air was displaced and pushed up. The Cakes had completely ignored that Pinkie Pie was talking to somepony, as they were too occupied with each other and their current location. \"T-Twilight, w-what are you doing here?\" Asked Mr. Cake, clearly embarrassed and nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was glad that the two ponies were allright but she still wondered why the two of them would like to be eaten by Pinkie. \"That's not important, why are you two inside of Pinkie's belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's umm.... we.... it's out fetish okay?\" He explained, while only a small twitch indicated, that Mrs. Cake was covering her face in embarrassment. \"It's called vorarephilia, it's something like this, where ponies are aroused by the idea of eating other living beings or being eaten. I know it sounds weird but when Cup Cake and I saw what Pinkie could eat, we decided to ask her if she could help us fullfill this fantasy.\" If he was outside, Twilight would have been able to see his face, as red as Big Macintosh's. It was embarrassing enough having to explain this to Pinkie Pie, having to tell somepony else about their little fetish, while currently inside a stomach was even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's mind was racing with the new information. She was not naive, she knew what a fetish was. A blush spread across her cheeks, as she recalled how Pinkie's belly was squirming a few moments ago. This vore fetish was completely new to her and images flashed across her imagination, as she thought of different scenario's.</span></div></div>",

If I never met you, I would still have been the isolated bookworm I was before coming to pony-ville, and all of Equestria would have been destroyed or taken over by those villains we faced. The adventures we experienced together will never be forgotten. I shall always love you. My dear comrades, Friendship is truly magical, and without you, i never would have learned that. We may never see each other again, but we will always remember each other.  Pinkie, your ridiculous jokes and bad timing for randomness were a pain, but inside, it really lifted up my spirits high. Thank you for the laughter. Applejack, with your honest heart, you were able to pull me out of so many situations I could never have got through without you, and you needed us too. But you always told the truth, and that keeps me smiling. Thank your for your Honesty! Fluttershy, your kindness was something unrivaled by anypony. You were the best pony I ever met. Without your compassionate heart, I would have lost my kindness when i was upset. I love you Fluttershy. Rarity, your generosity gave us all things that you worked hard for. When you made those dresses, my heart flew to the highest point. Your generosity shall not be forgotten. And finally, Rainbow Dash, the most loyal and dependable ponies in all of Equestria. You never fled at times when we needed you most, you always stood by our side and never gave up! With your loyal heart, you even ate me when i requested it, even though you knew what would happen, you did it anyway. I was glad to become a part of you forever. Thank you all for teaching me the true value of friendship and love! Your dearest friend, Twilight Sparkle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony mourned at the loss of their good friend, but they were all happy to know that even in death, she was glad to have known them.

With this we will make a monumental mark in biology.\" Then Twilight floated both plates with the cake to her friend. \"Here, you can take both. This is the least I can do for you and also I have to prepare something, enjoy them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a joyfull squeal the pink earth pony took a bite out of the first slice while Twilight trotted back to the table and quickly wrote something down. As she was told Pinkie took her time with the cake this time. She may be willingly jumping into this but she was still aware of what would happen but she didn't care as long as she could make her friend happy. As she finished Twilight came back with the scroll and a much more serious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Pinkie Pie, I've written a disclaimer that states that you were aware of the consequences of being eaten and that you let me devour you on your own free will. This is for legal reasons because otherwhise I could be in huge trouble. Also this is your last chance to back out of this remember, you will be digested alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie looked at the improvised contract complete with a dotted line for her signature. Still smiling the signed it, even with her full name Pinkamena Diane Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty Twi, you can start now. I just hope this helps you out.\" With that Pinkie laid the signed disclaimer aside and poistioned herself directly in front of Twilight. \"Open up Twi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much.\" Then Twilight opened her mouth wide. Pinkie immediately pushed her front hooves into her maw. Twilight was a little surprised at this but quickly recovered, taking her friends head in. It was almost a peaceful scene as the purple unicorn gradually swallowed her willing meal. Twilight noted that Pinkie had a very sweet taste, almost like the cake whose leftovers she fed to her. As the reached the flanks her tongue slipped and briefly entered Pinkie Pies slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Twilight behave yourself.\" Pinkie Pie giggled naughtily while Twilight blushed hard. She had to admit it tasted pretty good. She decided that Pinkie Pie deserved a little fun before entering her stomach and put her tongue back inside. \"What are you doing ther.. oooh.\" Twilights tongue explored her friends vagina, occasionally lapping at her clit. The pink hooves sticking out of Twilights mouth were wildly shaking and bucking as Pinkie was engulfed into a feeling of pure bliss. Eventually the taste of her friends juices exploded in Twilights mouth and the hooves that were so wild just seconds ago hung limp. Deciding not to waste anymore time Twilight quickly gulped down the rest of her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a contended sigh as her belly hung almost to the floor. With the help of her magic she held up her bloated stomach and made her way to the bed. Dropping herself on top the laid on her back grabbing a quill, ink and another sheet of paper. \"Alright Pinkie, how do you feel?\"</span></div></div>",

Twi began to chew on her lip nervously as the uncomfortable silence seemed to drag on forever, then suddenly Rainbow Dash burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahaha, you almost got me!\"  She took flight and zipped to Twi's side, attempting to form a sentence as she gasped between fits of laughter.  \"I bet next, you're going to tell me Fluttershy brawls with bears!\"  Dash then swung her hoof and whapped the side of Twi's belly pretty hard, knocking a huge pocket of gas loose that resulted in the most unladylike thunderous belch trumpeting from Twilight's mouth.  The product wasn't all air, though -- a couple large balls of messy pink hair, soaked in saliva and other gastrointestinal juices, were ejected from her mouth and landed on the floor.  Dash almost immediately quit laughing and she landed back on her hooves, walking over to one of the balls of Pinkie hair to pick it up and examine it.  She blinked a few times before a deep crimson blush was easily noticeable beneath the blue fur on her face, looking back to Twi who was also blushing quite furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You actually... whole?\"  Twilight simply nodded in response, Dashie shifting back and forth at the flank and rubbing her thighs together.  She allowed the ball of hair to fall to the floor again, fixing her gaze on it as she kicked it around a bit.  \"Can I... listen?\"  Dash waits several moments before looking up to Twi again to receive a response, her usual fiery demeanor seeming to have become interchangeable with Fluttershy's.  Twilight smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Twi responded with unusual enthusiasm, carefully rolling to her side to allow her gut to surge out in front of her.  She patted her belly lightly with a hoof, Dashie aproaching slowly and lying next to the spherical mass, leaning in to press her ear against the soft and warm fur.  Her stiffness quickly melts as she cuddles around Twi's middle, her eyes closed as she pressed the side of her head firmly into it.  The sounds of Pinkie digesting were frequent and exciting, her blue hooves beginning to massage the swollen middle and being met with contented sighs from Twilight.</span></div></div>",

Before Twilight knew it, her face was imprinted on the outside of Rainbow Dashs neck and she could only scream for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow meanwhile loved this sensation, the taste, the struggle and how Twilight was struggling helplessly as she was being made a meal.

So, if you would please cough me up again.\" She stated rather smugly, sure that she would be let out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I just make sure nopony will know that I was it. I think I will also take this letter with me and destroy it, so nopony will be too quick to jump to 'got eaten' as a solution.\" The small smile on Twilights face faded in disbelieve and fear as she heard the plan of the other mare. \"W-wait, you can't just do that to me, this is not even for research purposes, I only ate Pinkie Pie because it was necessary.\" Her breath got more shaky as she said this and she could hear loud, wet groans around her as the stomach started to move. \"Oh no.\" To her horror, Twilight could feel how some sort of liquid slowly filled the chamber, she knew exactly what this was, stomach acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash looked out of the window, making sure nopony was watching before she stepped out again and took off to the sky. It would be far safer to digest Twilight in her own home instead of staying at the library. The pegasus mare could feel how the frightened unicorn inside of her started to struggle, kicking and stretching her gut, hoping to get Rainbow Dash to spit her out again. However, those struggles only tickled her predator, as Twilight quickly noticed from the laughs she got. \"Give it up Twi, I'm way too strong. But hey, at least your filling served a scientific purpose, I discovered how great it is to eat somepony, you will definitely not be the last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was completely dismayed as she heard this. (What have I done? Because of me eating Pinkie, I created a pony-eating monster. And I will be its first victim.) She still tried to get out, while they flew to Rainbow Dashs house. With her large load, the pegasus flew much slower than she was used to but she decided that eating ponies was good enough to accept this downside. Once inside, Rainbow Dash plopped down on her bed, causing Twilight to roll around in the gastric juices. \"Alright Twilight, it was nice with you but I'm gonna sleep you off now, goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven under Twilights struggles, it did not take long for Rainbow Dash to fall asleep. In fact, Twilights desperate attempts to escape were more like a massage to her. Inside her gut, Twilight stopped fighting for a moment, she needed to think about an escape plan.</span></div></div>",

Twilight gasped as she looked down at her own pudgy belly, remembering the last moments of Pinkie Pie. \"It's over.\" She gasped as her body slowly started to drip down, dissolving into a purple goo. The purple unicorn started to sob as she felt herself getting softer, knowing that she was doomed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she came up with something right now, it was useless. By the time she escaped and found a shower to wash the stomach acids off, she would be nothing but a blob of slime, so she should just give up and accept her fate. Twilight cancelled the light spell, she did not want to see it, and laid down. It was a strange sensation as she laid there, feeling her body becoming lighter as it slowly changed from a solid mass to a thick goo. Already Twilight felt light headed, barely clinging to consciousness. The purple unicorn did not fight to stay awake, rather just getting it over with as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Rainbow Dashs belly still gurgled loudly as it digested the mare inside and slowly started to shrink again.

She probably wouldn't struggle and it would make her job much easier. With that thought of Fluttershy's submissiveness, she flew off to drop by her cottage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescending down, she landed with some difficulty due to the extra weight. Landing with a loud stomp in front of Fluttershy's door, her chubbier midsection jiggled and swayed with the added fat. \"Phew, I've got to get used to this, seeing as I'm only going to get bigger,\" Dash said to herself. Dash knocked on the wooden door. A quiet yellow pony appeared in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash, it's so nice to see you. Umm.. do you need something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I just want to hang out with a cool Pegasus like you, Fluttershy. And maybe get some breakfast, too...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay... Well, you're welcome to stay if you want..\" Fluttershy whispered, eying Dash's unusually large stomach. \"Oh my, Rainbow Dash, have you been eating a lot more often?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I've been really hungry recently,\" Dash replied, shaking her girth for the yellow pony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... well, what would you like to eat? I have some nice apples or some hay... I'm sorry but I don't have too much to offer right now. I usually go out to get food for all my animal friends, but they're all still in bed right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, I found something really tasty in front of me right now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash peered at Fluttershy with hunger in her eyes, licking her lips with her salivating tongue. Fluttershy nervously cowered backwards and backed up from the advancing Rainbow Dash, knocking over a lamp on a counter. \"Um Dash... you're acting really scary right now... Eeep!\" Fluttershy squeaked when her plush rear hit the wall behind her as she backed herself into a corner. The menacing blue pony hovered over the small shy pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Fluttershy, I'll make this quick.\"</span></div></div>",

But by the time Rainbow began to open her large, Cyan mouth; Fluttershy was horrified. She tried to break free from her predator's grip, but Rainbow was too strong. Rainbow stuffed Fluttershy's head into her mouth and began to gulp her down. Fluttershy was screaming and crying, begging Rainbow Dash to stop. Fluttershy's efforts were futile as she soon had her head dropped into Rainbow's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash, however, was having a much better time devouring her prey. She smiled and sighed with pleasure as she continued to swallow Fluttershy whole. Fluttershy once again pleaded,\"Rainbow Dash, Please stop this! I'm your friend, you can't just eat me like this!\" And she cried. Rainbow Dash gave the poor pegasus no sympathy as she continued to swallow her down. Now up to Fluttershy's hind legs, Rainbow gulped them down and slurped up Fluttershy's tail like a noodle of spaghetti. Then with one final Gulp, Fluttershy was dropped into Rainbow Dash's stomach. Finally Rainbow spoke, \"Sorry Fluttershy, but you were the most obvioius choice for breakfast, you know, with you being so easy to take down. I had more trouble taking down Twilight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was shocked when she heard this, \"Y-you ate Twilight!?\" Rainbow smirked and replied, \"yeah, and now you will suffer the same fate!\" Rainbow Dash seemed to let out an evil laugh as Fluttershy sobbed within her belly as the acids began to do their work. Rainbow Dash was smiling deviously as she felt her belly begin to shrink as the solid contents within were being melted into mush. With one last scream of agony, Fluttershy was digested alive and Rainbow grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an amazing Breakfast... but nopony said I couldn't have seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Rainbow decided to...</span></div></div>",

I <i>was</i> going to eat you Fluttershy...\" Dash said to Fluttershy who cheered up a little from hearing that,\"but, I have a better idea.\" Dash turns her now heavier form around, and shows her rump to the sitting pony. Fluttershy blushed as Dash lifted her colorful tail exposing her cute blue pucker and small pink womanhood. \"I'm going to eat you with my butt instead!\" Fluttershy's eyes widened at what she just heard. Dash was going to what? Before she could think of anything else, Dash's behind was planted on her face. The blue pegasus's face lit up with arousal as she covered her friend's face with her behind. She couldn't help but think that what she was about to do wasn't only hot, but it's going to feel amazing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph!\" muffled the yellow pony, with two cheeks obscuring her vision and mouth against Dash's pussy. The vibrations from her muffled yell sent shivers up Dash's spine. \"Oh Fluttershy, do that again!\" Dash wiggled her ass down so that she had Fluttershy's nose up against her eager anus, pointed so that she would make a smooth entry. \"Alright Fluttershy, I said I'd make this quick, so here we go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash sat down and pushed backwards, pushing at her friends head. Fluttershy's nose slide in easily before Dash's asshole had to stretch further around the whole head. \"Oh yeah, you're going up in all the way Flutters...Ngaaah!\" Suddenly a loud pop was heard. She felt a sudden surge of something inside her, just not in the usual place. Dash looked backwards to see Fluttershy up to her head in her ass. Fluttershy yelled and squeaked from in her friend's muscular butt, causing pleasure for Dash. \"Aaah,\" Dash sighed, tongue hanging out\", hold on, I'll speed things up.\" Dash sat harder, pushing the shy pegasus's shoulders and folded wings inside, slowing sitting down as more of her friend entered her in a place nopony should ever be. Already at her elbows, Fluttershy could barely struggle, only being able to kick her front hooves at Dash's flanks, not doing so good of a job, though eventually both her front legs were slurped up by the hungry blue pucker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fluttershy! You're not supposed to be in there like that! You have to visit my stomach before you get to go through there. Just like Twilight and Pinkie did. Say hi to them for me if you see them!\" Fluttershy couldn't help but yell a muffled \"Huh?!\" Has Dash really eaten two of her other friends too? She had no time to think before Dash reached her own flanks. Dash stood up with a yellow butt popping out of her own. Her lower belly is bulging with the upper half of her friend, and still growing. Looking behind her again, she exclaimed,\" Wow Fluttershy, you still have a bigger butt than me. Heh, I'll definitely be the bigger mare after this. Hnnnnngh.\" Dash started sitting even more than before, trying to shove the superior bubble butt into her own, eager to add it to her own assets. After some slightly load effortful grunts, and careful not to alert Fluttershy's sleeping animals, her pucker expanded over the entirety of the shy pony's rear end as it slurped over the largest portion. All at once, the large flanks went entirely into the past-athletic rump. \"Gah... there we go, it's all mine now. Now for the rest of you...\" Rainbow Dash resumed consumption as she slurped up her friend's back legs as if they were two big yellow noodles. Fluttershy's slightly wiggling hooves poked out of Dash's anus for a brief moment before they were slurped up and disappeared for good. \"Ahhh.... Good-bye Fluttershy, and thank you for the breakfast.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy sobbed and whimpered as she was caressed and pushed onward by the slimy walls of Dash's intestine. Soon she'd trek through her friend's intestinal tract before dropping in the stomach and eventually turned to goo just like her other friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash recovered her composure and waddled out of the cottage with her newly inhabited belly. \"I figure I should let myself out now. I don't want your little furry friends to know this pony just ate their momma. They'd sure be angry at me!\" Squeezing out the front door, she lifts off and heads home, eager to digest her latest pony meal. \"Ha, I knew that would be quick and easy!\" </span></div></div>",

Soon after returning home, she found herself craving more pony. She thought for a few minutes, before deciding that she should pay her dear friend Applejack a visit. She flew over to Sweet Apple Acres, and banged on the door with her hoof. After a few seconds, the door was opened to reveal a small, yellow filly.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Apple Bloom!\" Said Rainbow Dash, full of enthusiasm. \"Is your sister in?\"<br>\r\n\"No. Everypony's at the market in town. They won't be back for quite a while, ah'm afraid.\" Apple Bloom replied.<br>\r\n\"Uh... May I come inside?\" Dash asked. She'd have to settle for a smaller meal, for now.<br>\r\n\"Why, of course you can come inside! The small pony opened the door enough for Dash to come inside. She hadn't noticed her bulging stomach yet, all the better for the cyan pegasus. Apple Bloom turned around, away from Dash, and began to head over into the main room. She trotted along, but stopped when she suddenly felt a hoof clamp down hard on her shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Hey, what're you doin'? She cried out. Dash forced the filly onto the ground, sitting on top to keep her still.<br>\r\n\"Oh Fluttershy!\" She called out sweetly. \"You've got a little friend coming in to join you!\" With that, she began forcing the filly's head into her gaping maw. Apple Bloom screamed, the sound muffled by Dash's throat. She could feel Fluttershy still squirming around inside her. Apple Bloom's torso was almost completely in Rainbow Dash's mouth, and was beginning to slide down her throat. Dash began salivating rapidly, saliva dripping onto the floorboards. Soon, Apple Bloom's hooves slid into Dash's stomach, joining a half-digested Fluttershy. Apple Bloom hit the walls of Dash's stomach in a vain attempt to escape, only causing more pleasure for the cyan pegasus. She relaxed, rubbing her huge belly, enjoying every minute of it. She lay down, sighing. She was so, so, so relaxed...</span></div></div>",

I thought there would be no harm in telling her a bit about the process.\" Now Rainbow Dash too became red in her face. \"I guess my description was a little too detailed.\" Applejack sighed and pulled Rainbow Dash into a hug before kissing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was even more puzzled now. They were together? Well, it would make sense for them to be girlfriends if they shared their fetish like that. \"Wait a second, since when are you two together?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for a while now but we didn't want to tell you yet.\" Answered Rainbow Dash. \"There is the danger of one of you wanting to see us on a date and then you would have seen us walking into the club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of the club, shall we go now?\" Asked Applejack, Rainbow Dash gave her a sly glance and said. \"Can't wait for it huh? Alright Twilight, let's not waste any more time and go.\" Applejack became even redder as the three of them made their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends led her into one of the few dark alleys in Ponyville. A hatch could be seen in that alley and a pony, covered with a heavy cloak seemed to guard it. Twilight became nervous as she saw him. Rainbow Dash and Applejack though just walked towards him without even slowing down, as they stood in front of him Rainbow Dash smiled and greeted him. \"Heya Bruce, we're bringing a guest tonight.\" She pointed at Twilight at the last part, said unicorn waved at Bruce nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the coat Bruce was also smiling. \"Rainbow Dash, Applejack, nice to see you, come in.\" Then he mustered Twilight carefully and licked his lips. \"Wow, your friend here looks delicious.\" Twilight backed away a little as she heard this, did he just call her delicious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there partner, she's pretty new at this so don't scare her.\" Scolded Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sorry Ms. but when I saw you I couldn't help it.\" He apologized and then opened the hatch. As the trio went down the stairs Twilight shivered, feeling the hungry gaze on her flanks. It was a strange feeling, knowing that this pony upstairs considered her a fine meal, Twilight found it scary, but also a little exciting. Thankfully the darkness hid her blush. Rainbow Dash opened a door, leading to a long hallway. As they walked through the hallway Twilight could hear music that got louder the farther they went. Finally there was another door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLights and loud music erupted as Rainbow Dash opened the door. Twilight couldn't believe her eyes as she walked through the doorway and saw the club. The lightshow and music were expected from a club, what she didn't expect were the guests at the tables. She could see some ponies laying on the tables while their partners licked their lips, some of them even looked like they were covered in sauce and garnishes. Then she saw some ponies that had another pony halfway down their gullet while others were already full and patted their distended gut. \"Welcome to 'The Restaurant'.\" Said Rainbow Dash while patting Twilight on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight turned her head in all directions as they went to a free table, she already heard of vore from Rainbow Dash but seeing it in action was a whole different thing. On the way her friends explained how the club works. A spell is cast on everypony who steps through the door that not only causes them to become more flexible for swallowing another pony, there was also a spell that would guarantee that every pony that is digested will reappear a short time later next to her predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they found an empty table and sat down. Applejack was still nervous and fidgeted in her seat while Rainbow Dash talked to Twilight. \"Alright Twi, if you want you can participate and see firsthoof what it's like to be pred or prey or you can just watch me and Applejack first.\" She offered.</span></div></div>",

The pegasus mare saw the look on Twilights face and gave her a reassuring smile. \"Don't worry, neither of us really minds to be prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to confirm Rainbow Dashs words, Applejack took of her hat and climbed onto the table in front of Rainbow Dash. \"Alright Dashie, your prey awaits.\" She said seductively. Rainbow Dash pulled her girlfriend into a fierce kiss, which transitioned into her taking Applejacks entire head in. Twilight just stared at the display, mouth open as Applejack pushed herself deeper into Rainbow Dashs throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Applejacks body disappeared inside of the pegasus esophagus and soon her flanks and hind hooves were the only part of her, still sticking out of Rainbows mouth. Rainbow Dash tilted her head back to make the rest easier. An Applejack shaped bulge could be seen wandering down Rainbow Dashs throat as the pegasus continued to swallow. Twilight didn't notice that she drooled a little as Rainbow Dash slurped up the rest of the blonde tail and send the rest of Applejack into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash burped and patted her now distended gut. Applejack was moving inside, providing an internal massage. Now Rainbow Dash looked at Twilight. \"So, what do you say about this?\"</span></div></div>",

Strangely this thought made Twilights mouth water. \"Say Rarity... who is on the menu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity, like all waitresses in this club, had a list with ponies that were on the menu. She quickly checked the list to see which ponies were waiting to be eaten. \"Well, I have quite a selection.

I'm just going to stick with one pony for now.\" She ran her eyes up and down the list a few more times before deciding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I know who I want,\" she said. Twilight raised a hoof and pointed to the DJ's name on the menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take her. She seems like a good choice.\" Rarity nodded and walked off towards the DJ booth on the other side of the room. In the meantime, Twilight began to sweat, getting nervous about what she was about to do. Rainbow Dash looked over to see her friend almost shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's wrong?\" she asked, resting a hoof on her shoulder. Twilight let out a sigh and looked up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just nervous. I mean, I'm going to EAT somepony! Like they were food!\" Twilight was wondering if she should go through with this. Why did she even come here tonight? This was all a bad idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, there's nothing wrong with having a little fun. Nopony gets hurt and it's not like you're making them do it against their will. Everything's fine, Twi,\" her friend reassured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but still. Maybe I should just\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014should just get a mouthfull of this mare standing before her!\" a loud, energetic voice in front of her called. Twilight's gaze jumped up to see a white unicorn standing before her with a neon cobalt and electric blue spiked mane and purple shades laid over her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh... hello. Are you DJ Pon-3?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and only! But please, that's just my stage name. The name's Scratch. Vinyl Scratch,\" she responded in a cool tone, taking off her glasses to reveal bright magenta eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you going to stuff me in your mouth and gulp me down or am I going to have to climb in there myself?\" she asked, eagerly. \"I've had a long night and I wouldn't mind bubbling away into some goo.\" Rarity now appeared behind her, walking up along side of the DJ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Ms. Scratch, this is Twilight's first time ever eating somepony. If you could please restrain yourself. You're making her nervous,\" she said, her voice firm like a mother's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a newbie, huh? Well don't you worry! I'm probably one of the best starter ponies there is!\" she said, proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not so sure about this whole, 'eating somepony' thing, anymore,\" Twilight said, uneasily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you really aren't sure about it, I can always just eat you, too. That is, if you want,\" the DJ offered. The idea didn't sound that bad and it surely wasn't as demanding as eating somepony would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Twilight said, debating the choices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, I promise you that you won't regret it. Scratch here was my first, too, and she did an amazing job. You've got nothing to worry about,\" Rainbow added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight thought, weighing the pros and the cons against each other until coming to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I think I'm going to...\"</span></div></div>",

You won't regret it, or else my name isn't Rainbow Dash,\" she said with a wide grin. Twilight looked back to the DJ and slowly let a breath out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Vinyl. I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! Now don't worry, I'll let you go at your own pace and you can stop whenever you want (but I don't think you'll want to,)\" she said with a wink. Vinyl took off her sunglasses and playfully set them on the bridge of Twilight's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you look pretty good with those on,\" she teased. Twilight blushed, but didn't take them off. They almost helped hide the embarrassment she was experiencing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl lifted up a hoof to Twilight's mouth. Taking small steps, Twilight brought it closer to her and gave it a taste, getting a load of the description on the menu: salty, but sugary sweet with hints of mint. Her licking slowly became faster as she began covering Vinyl's foreleg with slobber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me, or does she seem to like how I taste?\" Vinyl joked. \"You know, you can actually put it in your mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blushed at being teased, but it made her feel good inside. It was something she had never felt before. Opening wide, she brought her hoof in. She felt it travel to the back of her throat before she stopped. Vinyl had a questioning look before Twilight grabbed her other hoof and stuffed that in as well. This taste was incredible! Twilight couldn't believe she had missed the amazing taste of ponies for this long! She began to gulp as the forelegs traveled down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that, she's a pro!\" Rainbow remarked, becoming excited as she watched the DJ's hooves bulging in Twilight's throat. Twilight, however, could hardly hear Rainbow. She was in a world of pure pleasure and enjoyment. Her instincts took over and she steadily worked Vinyl Scratch into her gullet. Soon enough, the DJ's head was in her mouth, which was then followed by her belly and hips. As Vinyl's delectable buns disappeared, only her back hooves and tail were left. Twilight's belly was already looking bloated, about half as big as Rainbow's.  Within seconds, the mare's hooves were gone and Twilight was left slurping up her tail. With one final gulp, she placed a hoof to her throat to feel her dinner travel to its final resting place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" was all Rainbow Dash could say, her wings popped out to the sides after the whole experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she do it?\" could be faintly heard from inside Rainbow's distended belly. Twilight then let out a huge burp that seemed to shake the surrounding area. \"She did do it! I knew she could!\" Twilight finally came to and looked down at her swollen, pony-sized belly that was now jutting out in front of her. She reached forward with her forelegs and rubbed it, feeling Vinyl's mass moving around inside. Twilight leaned her head back and relished in the sensation of being this incredibly full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how does it feel?\" Rainbow asked. Twilight opened her mouth to answer and a burp followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Urp</i>! Oh, excuse me! I guess she really does make you a bit gassy, <i>burp</i>!\" She looked back down to her gut and smiled. \"It feels amazing! I never could've imagined it would be, <i>this</i> good!\" Rainbow Dash watched in awe and lust as her friend's belly moved and groaned loudly, thanks to Vinyl's spell. She reached a hoof towards Twilight's belly, but stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can. It's okay,\" Twilight smiled, followed by another burp. Rainbow placed her hooves on the swollen mass of flesh and began rubbing. Twilight moaned in pleasure as she fully enjoyed this new experience. She had never been so full before, let alone with another pony in her belly. The two friends' bellies rested against each other as Rainbow kept massaging Twilight's gut. The stomach noises coming from within only made it hotter. Rainbow looked to Twilight with a hot blush on her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really hot.\" Twilight developed her own rosy cheeks and opened her mouth, but only a sustained belch followed. Rainbow's mane was blown slightly and she got a bit of spit on her face, the smell of Twilight's prey caressing her nose. Twilight couldn't help but chuckle at the instance. This put Rainbow over the edge and she couldn't hold herself back, lunging forwards and locking her lips with Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm!\" was all the librarian could manage before her eyes went half-lidded and she began kissing back. The two passionately made out on the bench while their giant guts we smooshed into each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hay is going on out there?\" Applejack hollered, hearing the faint sounds of lips smacking. \"Rainbow, are you getting hot 'n' heavy with Twilight?\" Only more sounds of kissing followed and the farmer laughed. \"Okay, but only if I get to make out with her too once I'm out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the outside, the two were still kissing and rubbing each other's belly. They could taste the respective pony's meal off their own breath as they made out. Twilight began slipping away again as they continued. She most definitely felt full and turned on, but something inside of her declared, \"<i>More</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, I should stop. I couldn't eat more than one,</i> she thought, but the craving didn't subside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould she really swallow down Rainbow with her big belly full of Applejack or should she stop and call it quits? </span></div></div>",

She finally felt her hind legs join her as the vagina began to grow more humid. \"I'll be able to come back from this, right, Vinyl?\" She said, her voice echoing off the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course, trust me, you'll love it!\" Came the muffled reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt Vinyl's belly began to undulate in and out as it began to \"chewing\" it meal as the pred put her hooves on the now beach ball sized womb and began to knead it, working her juices into Twilight's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nuzzled against the walls, getting herself comfortable. She knew it was only a matter of time before it would begin. Soon enough, Vinyl's chamber\u2019s walls started to secret gooey, sticky fem-cum, and soon she was covered in the gooey white stuff. It tingled against her skin, and she couldn\u2019t help but wiggle and squirm as the soft tingling grew into a pleasurable throbbing all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer coat was slowly changing into a white hue, becoming a goopy, slime, and her lovely purple mane oozed down her muzzle, into the pool of cum that was growing around her. She pressed her hooves against the bottom of the chamber, trying to readjust herself and was amazed when they literally were squashed against the womb, causing her hooves to become nothing more than big gloppy balls of cum. She blushed and delved the globs of cum between her back legs, to try and stop her pussy from tickling as the fluid squeezed between her hindlegs. She giggled as she squished it between her tingling thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puddle of cum was growing more and more, and Twilight realized that she was slowly losing feeling in most of her body. Her hind limbs were almost entirely gone, swelling and churning within that pool of goo, and about a minute later, she moaned as her head finally sank below the surface of the cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl continued her churning and massaging, until the wriggling stopped and her womb seemed to \"relax\" and sag down a little to represent the unicorn was fully digested. A bit of Twilight leaked out of her marehood and her suck down a fore hoof for a taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave her hoof a lick and giggled. Twilight tasted like sweet grape juice. Now, what should she do with Twilight?</span></div></div>",

To most, dinning together would be something ordinary. But this was one of the few moments that the Royal Sisters could enjoy together without being bothered by some snooby noble. They were dinning together and in peace. However, that piece was cut short when they heard a buzzing sound followed by a bright flash of light. Luna got up, ready to attack any intruder. Celestia was seatted still, waiting for what would come out of the dust. When the dut cleared, they were surprised to see Rarity and Rainbow Dash there. What was more, Rarity looked exausted and both of them looked terrified! One would think they saw a ghost!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Miss Rarity, miss Rainbow, what is the meaning of this scandal?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Luna, please. I'm sure they have a good reason for this. I didn't new you could teleport, miss Rarity.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Twilight taught me a couple of weeks ago and it takes a lot of me still.

Luna sneered at the name and Celestia narrowed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"What about her?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Somewhow, she's back.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sisters: <span class=\"crose\"><b>\"WHAT?!\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"What's worse, she has a friend of ours, Vinyl Scratch in her possesion. And to top it, she has Twilight in her possession too!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia abruptly go up. Her expression a mix of extreme worry and extreme hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"P-princess?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\"><b>\"That bitch got my sister once. I will not let her take my student too!!!</b> Let's go at once, Luna!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia got up and took off. She always could feel Twilight's magical essence, no matter how thin the trail was. It always helped her when they played hide and seek when Twilight was a little filly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I'm right behind you, big sis!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna paced Rarity and Rainbow on her back and took of after Celestia.

However, tonight that peace had ended, when a dark-blue mist flew in from a window and landed on the floor of what once had been Princess Luna's bedroom. Once it landed, it threw out a white Unicorn with neon blue mane and it materialized into a mare that Vinyl had never seen before, sut that she recognized from the stories and from the talks she had had with Rairy, Pinkie, AJ and Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"N-Nightmare Moon!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Oh? So you know me, huh?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"T-the girls told me about you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Ah, you mean Twilight Sparkle's friends, yes?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"W-what do you want with me?\"</span>, Vinyl tried to sound brave, but the true was that she was as scared as she could be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"It's not so much with you. But with the mare in your womb.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl's pupils shrunk to the size of pin pricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Oh, yes. I saw you unbirthing Twilight. I saw every detail.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"S-so?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"*chuckle* Why, I want you to share her with me. I want you to deposit her in <b>my</b> womb.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Eh? W-why would you want that? I thought you hated Twilight anc co.?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"I did. But Twilight has so much undiscovered power and so much potential! *hmph* To think that Celestia wanted to restrain her and to keep her on a leash.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"W-what are you talking about?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Simplifying, I want you to deposit Twilight in my womb, so that I can reform her and then turn her into my foal. Once that's done, she'll be my daughter and I will train her and help her achive the true power she holds. One that could <i>EASILY</i> surpass <b>ALL</b> of the Alicorns that currently exsist combined!! Including myself!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl's jaw was litterally on the ground. Twilight could be THAT powerful?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"But, I tought nothing could surpass an Alicorn?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"*evil chuckle* You are alomost correct. <i>ALMOST</i> nothing can surpass an Alicorn. You see, the current exsisting Alicorns, myself included, are demi-goddesses. But, if taught and trained properly, Twilight could become a full fledged Goddess!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"But, if you hated her, why would you want her to be more powerful than you? And why are you telling me all of this?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Why? Aren't the children suppoesed to be better than the parents. Besides, you're forgeting that Twilight would be my daughter. She wouldn't betray me. As for me telling you these, it's because you won't survive to tell anypony what I told you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Eh?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"What? Did you thought I would let you go after telling you my plans? Besides, I will need some food to turn into breast milk, sot hat my little Twilight can feed, once the process is complete and she comes out.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl was about to get up and run, but Nightmare was faster. She tied Vinyl up using her wthereal mane an tendrils and placed her belly up on the stone floor. She then used her magic to extract every single drop of the female cum that was Twilight from Vinyl's womb and injected all of it into her own. She tought of getting a taste, but decided against it. One missing drop could be disastrous for her soon to be little one. She then used her magic to reform Twilight and attached an umbilical chord to her navel, thus begining the porcess of age reggression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Now then, it's dinner time.\"</span>, she said, licking her lips and looking at Vinyl while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay folks. Choice time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn choice one: The scene of Nightmare Moon eating Vinyl.<br>\r\nOn choice two: What are the Princesses and the remaining Mane 6 up to?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Princesses and the girls were on the entance to the Everfree forest.. The first ones to arrive had been Pinkie, who had gone to pick Fluttershy uo, and Fluttershy herself, who lived nearby. Next was Princess Celestia, who flew there at top speed after what Rarity and Rainbow Dash had told her and Luna. The next to arrive were Princess Cadence and Shining Armor, who had been informed of the events by letter, which was sent by Luna. Lastly, Luna herself arrived, with Rarity and Rainbow on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna took a bit longer to show up, because Rainbow had to go the the little fillies room, so that she could let AJ out. Fortunately, since she had been eaten on the Vore Club, the reform spell was still effective. Just not as fast. That, of course, led to them explaining the whole thing to Luna, including the parts with Twilight. Luna, in turn, told everything to Celestia, who was not only stranged by the strange fetishes they took part in, but also, and perhaps more so, becasue her student was begining to explore that world. Secretly, she thought of it as a blessing, for what no one knew, was that she also took part in that vore fetish. The reason no one knew, was because after digesting and reforming her meals, she erased her subjects memories of the whole experience. The only pony she did digest and didn't reformed, was her former \"royal pain in the plot\" nephew, Blueblood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were currently discussing what to do. After all, charging in at full speed was out of option. Not just because it would be reckless, but because they didn't knew what Nightmare Moon had planned to distract them, or worse. Not to mention that Nightmare had hostages this time, so they had to be very cautious. So, they decided to go in groups throught different parts. The groups were:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1- Celestia and Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n2- Luna, Rairty and Fluttershy.<br>\r\n3- Cadence and Shining Armor.<br>\r\nand<br>\r\n4-Rainbow Dash and AJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroup 1 would go through the main entrance, while groups 2, 3 and 4 would go through East, West and South respectively. That way, they hoped to either, corner the black mare or that, at least one or two groups made it in time to save Twilight and the other hostage from Nightmare's clutches. Little did they knew that they were too late already and that they were being watched. For, from the top of the trees, bats under Nightmare Moon's control were showing her everything that happened on the forest. She had seen everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Meanwhile-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare had already eaten and began digesting Vinyl. And her womb would finishe turning Twilight into her foal in a matter of minutes. Thus, she began to preppare everything for the arrival of her \"guests\". She knew, of course, they would come. She hadn't predicted the third Alicorn and the Unicorn colt tought. Thus, she used her magic to create and place traps specific for each kind. However, none were supposed to kill, only to delay them and injure them. This was part of her vengeance. She wasted them come here and be powerless to stop her. But, more than that, she wanted them to witness the birth of her daughter. The birth on the one who would one day be a Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter placing the traps, she used her magic to fix the room and to decorate it to her tastes. She didn't put much effort, tough. Because, if everything went to her favor, this would be only a temporary room. She turned the room into a mix of beedroom and nursery. Granted, she had never had a foal before so, while her matternal instincts, which were already kicking in, told her the fist steps, like breast feeding and such, she wasn't sure where to go from then. Hopefully, she books on the Canterlot palace would help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt a small kick on her underbelly. She smiled, not evilly, but warmly. Her little one would soon be ready to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh. Not yet. Not yet, my precious. Just be a little more patient.\", she whispered to her unborn child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Twilight seemed to understand. For she stoped kicking and calmed down. Which made Nightmare smile. Another thing that this process granted to Nightmare, was the ability to see all of Twilight's memories from her previous life. She was currently inside ot Twilight's mind. The inside of Twilight's mind looked like a library. With chairs, desks and everything else. She began reading throught the book that were Twilight's memories. She could see that she had been a lonesome and studious child. She was surprised when she found how fond Twilight was of the Night, of the Stars and of the Moon itself. She had judged Twilight wrongly. She liked her more and more each passing memory. She also saw the events and hardships she had gone through. Like the releasing of Discord, the Wedding/Invasion of Canterlot, one of the most painful memories, according to her memories, and the fight against King Sombra. However, the memory that catched Nightmare's attention the most, was onw where Twilight found out that her parents had died when she was a little child. Apparently, it had been a couple of days after Twilight had entered Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns. She had been told that Twilight Velvet and Night Shield, both members of the Royal Guard, had been killed in combat. A couple of weeks later, she found out that the fight that had taken her parents from her, had been against a rouge group of Griffons that were trying to cause chaos and an uproar, so that another was could be trigered and that the Griffons could be victorious this time. Nightmare read that they had almost succedded. Because, at the sight of her precious student suffering like that, Celestia had been, for the first time since her fight against Nightmare Moon, a thousand years ago, absolutely enraged. She could read this, because Twilight witnessed the whole thing. Celstia's mane and tail had turned into a fire so hot and intense that they could only be solar flames. Her eyes glowed white and her magical aura was so powerful that it shaked not just the castle, but all of Canterlot. The only reason a war didn't breaked out, was Twilight herself. She was absolutely scared of her mentor at the time, but she also loved her very much. So she ran in and grabbed Celestia's left back hoof, crying and begging her mentor to return to her normal self. Nightmare was impressed when she read that, at the touch and sound of Twilight's hoof and voice, she had calmed down almost instantly. She had embraced Twilight's with her wings and the two just stood like theat fo hours, comforting each other, until Twilight passed out from exsaustion. From what Nightmare could feel, this was one of Twilight's fondest memories. She tought of altering the memories so that, instead of Celestia, she appeared in the rmemories. But she dicedec against it for two reasons. One, because it could be a risk to her plan. And two, because she wanted Twilight to make new memories with her. Not to have fake ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare then laid down on the bed she had made when reforming the room and ept reading while waiting for, at least, some of her \"guests\" to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, folks. Choice time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich team arives first?</span></div></div>",

How much that was, it was impossible to tell. For the trees were too thick and tall for them to see at which position the Moon was at. Normally, Celestia could fly them up above the trees but, when Celestia frist tried that at the beggining of their journey, there was a spell around the forest that prevented flight. Meaning that Luna, Cadence, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash and herself had to go on foot. She couldn't teleport either. Another spell prevented that. And even if there was no spell, this forest was too unpredictable to risk it. They could end up right where they wanted to go or they could end up on the other side of the forest. They had also been caought in several traps. None lethal, tough, which confused the Princess and bothered her to no end. Really, this forest was the best hideout for those who knew how to take advantage of it's natural defenses. Something that Nightmare seemed to have learned. Currently, Celestia was galoping at top speed with Pinkie on her back. Fortunately, not only did she knew the way to the old castle, since it had been once her and Luna's home, but she could also still sense Twilight's magical essence. However, she noticed that the trail was thin and that it had changed, somehow. Thaat made Celestia hurry even more, fearful of what Nightmare might be doing or has already done to her precious student. She hoped to get there in time. She loved Twilight very much. For Celestia, Twilight had always been the daughter she never had but that she would have wanted. Even if she, secretly, wanted them to be more that family. The problems with starting a family with an Aliconr, were that those who were interested most likely just wanted the power and access to the crown. And even those whose feeling were sincere, which was rare, they had to decline. Because they were mortals and Alicorns were Demi-Goddesses and thus lived eternally. When Cadence married Shining, she knew that, someday, they would part ways. Celestia had thought that the marriage was a mistake and had tried to convince Cadence to change her mind. Obviously, it hadn't worked. However, by seeing the union between those two and seeing how happy they were together, she had began to have hope that perhaps, some day, Twilight and her could be together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Princess? How long do you think it will take us to get there?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"It shouldn't be long now. We should be there in about five minutes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Okay. I hope we make it.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Don't worry. I'm sure we will. <i>*I hope.*</i> Just, please, be <i>very</i> careful when we get there. We don't know what we'll fing or what Nightmare will be capable off. She probably was counting that we would come. Otherwise, she wouldn't had let you, Rarity and Rainbow Dash there. She left you because she knew you were going to tell us, so she's most likely waiting for us.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Yeah. I noticed that the traps weren't meant to kill us. Do you think she's buying time?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Most likely. Obviously, she expects us to get there. Otherwise you probably would have been dead already and I wouldn't bee too far behind.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"We only blasted her with the elements, rather than battling on the last time we met her so, I didn't knew she was <i>THAT</i> dangerous.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"She wouldn't have risked facing Luna, Cadence, the Elements, Shining Armor and myself without some kind of plan or counter-measure. She also must have spies all across the forest. My points are proved right by the fact that the traps we faced were specifically designed for Alicorns and Earth Ponies. I just hope that we make it and that the others are well.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Don't worry, Princess. Luna's group has an Alicorn, a Unicorn and a Pegasus. Cadence's group has magic and shields and AJ and Rainbow are the thoughest mares I know. They'll make it just fine. You'll see.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smiled at Pinkie's optimism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"You're right. Now, hold on! The bridge to the castle is just ahead! I'll burst trough the door and then I'll teleport us to the tower that used to be my room.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbestknown to Celestia, Nightmare was watching them even now. She already knew what they were goinf to do and had already prepared their \"welcoming comitee\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Manwhile-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare had just finished placing the spells she would need to delay them for the final minutes she needed. It was almost time for the birth of her foal. She placed a spell around the castle that prevented enemy flight and teleport and had hidden on her mane an anti-magic ring rady to be used. However, this was no regualr anti-magic ring. She had designed it specifically for Alicorn magic. She also remembered that the Element of Lughter was the most energetic and random of the bearers. And thus, she used a very old trick that would ensure she stayed out of her way. She had turned the stone into water, frozen it and then made it and the cage, which she had used magic to make and that served to imprisson them, invisibles. That way, the pink earth pony would be out of commission and Celestia would be distracted long enough for Nightmare to place the ring. Of coure, she had also placed other preventive spell, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she heard the sound of hoofs aproaching quickly. Thus, she hid on the shadows, waiting for her first preys. Just as she had predicted, Celestia threw the doors open with her front hooves and ran in, instantly sliping on the invisible ice. As planned, Pinkie ended up on the cage, which closed as soon as it's ocupant was completely inside of it. Doue to it being closed, Celestia's head was slamed right on the cold iron. Stunning her. Nightmare didn't wasted a second. As soon as Celestia's head impacted on the iron, she ran to her and quickly slipped the ring around Celestia's horn, renddering her magic useles. The action, however, caused Celestia to shake her head, to clear it, and she looked straight at Nightmare. Anger clear an the day in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Nightmare Moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Hi, Celestia. It's been long, hasn't it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Not long enough.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"*hmph* I'm not surprised to see your not happy to see me. However, it seems you're at a disadvantage, aren't you? You have no magic. And thus, I can do this!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare lit her horn and created onyx colored chains, ready to trap Celestia with them. Celestia tried to fly but, due to Nightmare's spell, she couldn't. Thus, the chains got her easily. Throwing her on the cold stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Y-you! What have you done with my Twilight!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"<i>YOUR</i> Twilight? *hmph!* Why don't you look down and take a guess?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cindigo\">\"*GASP!!!*\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't noticed it before but, from this angle, she could see that Nightmare's underbelly was round and inflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Y-you ate her?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"*chuckles evily* Not quite. I unbirthed her. And turned her into my daughter!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"N-no. I-it can't be!\"</font></span>, said Celestia, horryfied. She was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Oh, but it is, Celestia! You're precious student is now my beloved daughter.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare then, suddenly felt a series on kick in her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Ohhh... And speaking of her, it's time for her to come out!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare then used her magic to tie up Celestia to the wall with the chains. She then layed down on the ground and began pushing and pushing. Breathing deeply and exaling, like her instincts told her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"<b>AA</b>ahhhh. <b>AAAAAA</b>hhhh! Ugh! <b>GYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAA!!!</b>\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare Moon's screams echoed through all of the castle. Usually, that would make Celestia feel good, knowing that her most hated enemy was in pain. Hoever, this time, it wasn't like that. Because on the meaning of that scream;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next sound that was heard, was a baby's first cry. Nightmare got up at once, severed the umbilical chord and picked up Twilight in her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Shhhh. Shhhhh. It's okay, Twilight. I'm here.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stoped criying and opened her tiny purple beady eyes. She looked at Nightmare and uttered the one word that filled Celestia's fave and heart with dread;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Mama?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia's natural white face went even whiter, as did the rest of her body. This  meant that she had utterly failed. She had failed Twilight completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Yes, my dear Twilight. I'm your mother. I'm your mama.\"</span>, said Nightmare, rocking Twilight from one side to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight chirped happily and hugged and nuzzled what she could on her mother's face with her tiny hooves. Nightmare nuzzled her little one as well. Happy that she now had a daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Welcome back to the world, Twilight Andromeda Moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, readers. Choice time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes another one of the teams arrives?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo we have a scene with Nightmare Mom, Twily and Celestia?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If this was a nightmare, Celestia wanted to wake up right now. She wanted to dismiss all of this horrible situation as a bad dream. She wanted it to be fake, a lie. But, no matter how much she wanted it, she wasn't Discord. She couldn't change reality. She couldn't deny what her eyes were seeing. There, right in front of her, was her most hated enemy, Nightmare Moon, holding and rocking a little baby who once was her beloved student and secret love, Twilight Sparkle. Twilight was now different than before. She was a bit bigger than the regular foals. Her horn was a bit more slender, straight and perfectly spiraled. Her coat was a darker shade of purple. Her mane was now the same color that Luna's mane was with a hot-pink streak on the middle. To top it, she had now two little wings on her back. She was now a pure-blooded Alicorn. It was a t this point that Celestia fully realized that she had failed her. And, even if she got out of this alive, which she doubted, she would never be able to undo what Nightmare had done. The only thing she could do now was, with her head hanging low, watch how that monster was having fun with Twilight and, for the first time since Twilight's original parents passed away, she wept. She wept for herself, for Twilight, for the lost love that would never return and for the fear of what Nightmare planned to do with Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare noticed Celestia's condition and smiled cruelly. Her plan was working perfectly, so far. Twilight was her daughter, one of the elements was imprisoned and Celestia was in a pitiful state. Now she had to deal with the other foals left, and then she could focus on reigning Equestria with her little star by her side and on raising Twilight to be the Goddess that Nightmare knew she could become. First tough, she had to ensure that the rest of the plan flowed perfectly. First, she had to hide her prisoners. That way, when the rest of the fools showed up, they would think that they were the firsts and would try to stall her, foolishly waiting for the reinforcements that would never come. Then, she would use illusions of herself to confuse and tire her preys. Once that was done, she would use the second magic-nullifier ring she had designed for Alicorns on Luna and take knock out the third Alicorn. The rest would be simple enough to defeat. After all, with Twilight being her daughter and the element of laughter imprisoned, the Elements of Harmony couldn't be used. And even if the pink mare was free, without Twilight's element of magic, the others were useless. She remembered that the bearers of loyalty and honesty's specialities were speed and strength respectively. The bearer of kindness had that stare that could terrify/pacify many wild animals and ponies alike. Unfortunately for her, that trick wouldn't work on an Alicorn. Generosity would be the easiest. Her magic was, at best, poor and could be easily distracted by insulting/dirtying her looks. While she complained, Nightmare could take her out with a frontal magical blast and another one on the back, just to be sure. Then there was the last unicorn who, according to Twilight's memories, was Shining Armor, Twilight's older brother. She called one of the bats that were spying on the other \"guests\", she was waiting and saw that she still had some time before she had to prepare everything. So, she decided to have \"fun\" with Celestia. Thus, she teleported the crib she had built for Twilight with her magic to the room they were now and placed Twilight inside of it. She then placed a special sleep spell on Twilight. One that would ensure she slept through the whole night. That way, she wouldn't have any memory of Celestia, Luna or of any of the others that were on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"So, Celestia. How do you feel? Knowing that Twilight is now mine?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia didn't answered. She couldn't fight, but she wouldn't give Nightmare the satisfaction of letting her humiliate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Still a bit defiant, I see. Good, good. Otherwise this would be boring. Oh, by the way, I know about your attraction towards Twilight.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia's eyes widened like dinner plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"H-how did you...?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"When Twilight entered my womb and regressed to a foal, I gained access to her memories from her previous life.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"So?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"C'mon, Celestia. You had raised her to be a bright Unicorn, had you not? She wasn't that naive. She had seen you steal a few looks at her flanks, when you thought she wasn't looking.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"How do I know you're not just lying to see me suffer?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"*chuckles evilly* Seeing you suffer is delightful to me. But I'm telling the truth. Let me show you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare ignited her horn and a mirror with obsidian markings appeared in front of Celestia. The mirror began to show to Celestia some of Twilight's memories. On them, she saw that Nightmare was telling the truth. Twilight blushed on some scenes after Celestia had stole a glance. Meaning that she truly knew or that she suspected, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"B-but... S-she never...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"That was because she didn't knew what to do, Celestia. She was thorn. One one hoof, you had always been a second mother to her. More so after her parents passed away. On the other hoof, she too had romantic feelings for you. Not strong enough to become a full fledged love. But she liked you in a romantic way. But, I don't think you really loved her.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"What?! And exactly <b>what</b> do you know about love, huh?! And exactly <b>why</b> would you think that, hm?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Because you were trying to restrain her! You treated her more like a prized pet than anything! Twilight knew it to on her subconscious. She didn't wanted to admit it. But she always felt the magic on the letters you sent her! Magic that you used to keep her own at, according to you, acceptable levels. Despite trying to deny it, she knew right from the first letter.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia was stunned. Twilight had known about it all along! Yet, she had never said anything. She trusted Celestia that much, and she had let Twilight down. At this realization, Celestia could only weep harder. Which made Nightmare smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"As for what I know about love, well, let's just say that being a mother can be pretty enlightening. And, unlike you, I will never harm or restrain her. I plan on training her. So that she could achieve her true potential! The potential that you were afraid off! I'll train her to be the full-fledged Goddess she was meant to be all along!\"</span>, said Nightmare, while nuzzling Twilight, who cooed happily at her mother's touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare then called the bat again and saw that the next group was going to arrive soon. So, she dismissed the bat, teleported Twilight back to the nursery and used a spell to knock Celestia out, so that she couldn't want the others. She wasn't sure if she would even be able to. But she wouldn't take that risk. Everything had to be exactly according to her plans. And she was going to make sure it was that way. She then teleported Celestia and the knocked out pink mare to the underground dungeons, where they would stay until Nightmare finished with the rest of her \"guests\". She the created the illusions, like she had planned and hid into the shadows, awaiting to see which group on fools would get here first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, reader. Which group arrives first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(<span class=\"corange\">Applejack</span>, <span class=\"chotpink\">Cadence</span>, <span class=\"cblue\">Shining Armor</span>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Everfree Forest was a place of curious and, more often than not, undecipherable attitudes and actions. For instance, although the forest had a tendency to cover up and consume everything it wanted, for some reason, it left Zecora's cottage alone. The same happened here, with the ruins of the Royal Pony Sisters castle. The forest made an almost perfect circular shape around the ruins. It was as if the ruins themselves were tracing their territory, and the forest obeyed. Cadence, Shining, AJ and Rainbow were currently on the border of that circular shape. The groups had met each other by chance. Cadence and Shining had arrived a few minutes prior to AJ and Rainbow and were discussing what to do when the pair arrived after surpassing the latest of the many obstacles created by Nightmare Moon. Granted, the earth pony and the pegasus were in a pretty bad shape, with bruises and cuts all over. Applejack's hat was practically in shreds, as was her mane. Her tail seemed like it had a fight with a bunch of scissors and lost. Rainbow wasn't much better. Her body was pretty much like Applejack. Most of the feathers of her wings were either, mangled, bent or simply weren't there. Her usually messed mane was even more so. If Rarity saw it, she would most likely faint and accuse her of committing a grave crime against fashion and style. Cadence and Shining were pretty bad too. Although Cadence was an Alicorn, between Celestia, Luna and herself, she was the youngest and weakest. She knew how to deliver a good punch and could defend herself, of course. But, being the Princess of Love, she had difficulty in harming others. Whether they were ponies or from other species. Even regular animals. Despite Shining Armor's shields and protective spells, she had had a pretty hard time with Nightmare's traps. Her mane and tail had been partially scorched. Her wings were like Rainbow's and she had her horn bruised, which made it difficult for her to cast spells without feeling pain. Among them all, Shining was the one with the less amount on injuries, thanks to his spells and military training. He hadn't become the Captain of the Royal Guard for nothing, after all. Most of his armor had been either, discarded or destroyed during the journey. His white coat was now more gray that anything, his horn was a bit hot from all the spells he had to use and, like Cadence's, his mane and tail were scorched. Even more so than Cadence's, due to him trying, and failing, to protect her from that trap. They were currently trying to decide the best methods to enter the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Well, what are we going to do?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Hmm... Maybe we could split up and-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"No. We're stronger if we stay together. If we split, Nightmare could takes us out one by one. Remember, like the Princesses, Nightmare is an Alicorn. Meaning that she's, at least, trice as strong as an Earth Pony, trice as fast a flyer than a pegasus and has more magic than the most powerful Unicorn, which is Twilight.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they heard a voice that made their blood run cold and sent shivers down their spines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Oh, my little Unicorn. That's were you are wrong. YOU are currently the most powerful Unicorn in all of Equestria.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"W-what?! <b>WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY SISTER, YOU MONSTER!!!</b>\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Watch your tongue, fool! As for Twilight, if you really want to find out, then come inside.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the frontal gate to the ruins opened and the bridge was restored enough for them to walk safely to the other side. Shining began to move, when Cadence placed her right hoof on his left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Be careful. This most likely is a trap.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I know, Caddy. I know. But my little sister is in there. I can't just stand here and do nothing.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, all four of them began walking towards the bridge. Once they had crossed it, the bridge collapsed completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Great. We're trapped!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack looked ahead. Everything beyond the doors were darkness. Even tough she had been here before, she didn't felt anymore safe or secure for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Ah guess there's only one way to go, partners.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Then let's move! I wanna save our egghead friend and beat that monster of a mare's ass!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Ah know, Rainbow. Ah want ta save Thwalight as much as you do, but we'll be no good if we get caught. We need ta be careful.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them continued to advance and were almost at the doors. Unaware that Nightmare could see and hear everything they were doing and speaking. She had already prepared everything she would need. She had created a total or six illusions of herself and had prepared a third magic-nullifying ring. It wasn't as powerful as the other two, since it was made in a hurry. But it, would give her enough time to take this third Alicorn out of the picture. As for Twilight's brother, who she knew specialized in shield and protective magic, she would catch him by surprise and knock him out before he could use his magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the group crossed the doors. Once they did, the doors were closed shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Darn it! I knew it was a trap!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"*chuckle* And you walked straight into it!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare then teleported behind Shining Armor and blasted him with a minor magic blast on the back of his neck, effectively leaving him out of commission for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Shining!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"You should care less about him and care more about yourself!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare then tackled Cadence to the ground and rolled with her for a few seconds. She then got up and jumped back, creating a good distance of 10 meters between them. Cadence then tried to use her magic to create chains to hold Nightmare in place but, when she attempted to summon them, her horn wouldn't light up. She looked up, to see what was causing this and, to her dismay, a magic-nullifying ring was tightly fixed atround her horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"When did she-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Princess, look out!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Huh?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence looked in the direction where Nightmare was a few seconds ago but found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"She's right above you!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence looked up but, when she did, she received a lightning pulse from Nightmare, which shocked her until she fell to the ground, almost unconscious. Nightmare stood above her, smiling cruelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"W-what... have you... done to... Twilight and to... the other Unicorn?\"</span>, she asked, her voice pleading for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Don't worry about Twilight. She's safe and sound. And I will take care of her. As for the other Unicorn, well, let's just say that she was delicious.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence teared up a bi, as did AJ and Rainbow. They had realized that Vinyl had already been eaten and digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Ya said ya would take care of Twalight. What do ya mean with that?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"*evil chuckle* Why? Isn't a mother's duty to protect and to take care of their children?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence's eyes, as well as AJ's and Rainbow's went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"W-wait. Y-you mean that you-?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Unbirthed her and turned her into my daughter? Yes. I have.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Liar! Your belly is normal!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"That is because she has already been rebirthed. Why did you think that those taps only injured you? I was only stalling and gaining time until I could give birth to my daughter, Twilight Andromeda Moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"W-we're too late. W-we failed.\"</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"That's right, my <i>dear</i> nice.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"But why?! Didn't you hated Twilight and us?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Oh, believe me, I do hate you. But, a mother can never hate her child. Besides, she has a lot of potential. A potential that Celestia feared and tried to restrain.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"You think we're going to-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"To believe me or not is your choice. But Twilight's memories don't lie. She knew what Celestia was doing, even tough she tried hard to deny it. No that it matters now. After all, I will train her to reach that hidden and untapped potential. And then she will become the most powerful being in all of Equis!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"What?! Egghead can be <b>THAT</b> powerful?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Oh, yes. You see, I don't know if you've been told this but, we, Alicorns, are demi-goddesses.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Yeah, we know. Celestia is the demi-goddess of the Sun, Luna of tha Moon, Cadence of the Love and you...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"And I'm the demi-goddess of Dreams, Nightmares and the original demi-goddess of the Night. However, Twilight had the potential to become a full goddess! And I plan to help her reach that power! Once she does, we'll rule Equis, side by side, forever! *Evil Maniacal Laugh!!!*(like the one from the ending of the first episode of the show).\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"No you won't!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Rainbow wait!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow charged head on at full speed, trying to hit Nightmare. But Nightmare simply stepped aside. As if Rainbow had passed in slow motion. She then teleported the cage where Pinkie Pie, who was still knocked out, was and opened it right in front of Rainbow Dash, causing for her to slam into the bars on the cage. Nightmare then used her magic to throw Shining into the cage along with Applejack and slammed it shut. Effectively trapping the elements of loyalty and honesty. She then knocked Cadence out and sent them to the underground dungeons with Celestia, In different cells, of course. She then, once again, hid in the shadows and a waited for the final group to show up.</span></div></div>",

Rarity had suggested they went after them but, just as they were about to follow, they saw the bridge fall, and since flight and teleportation were useless, they would have to find another way in. It pained Luna to be here, for this place brought back many painful memories. Many times she had asked Celestia to salvage what ancient books and texts where there and completely destroy what was left of the castle. But Celestia had refused every time. She said that, just like there were many, as she put, unpleasant memories, there were others that were very happy. And although Luna agreed that there were indeed many memories she treasured of this place, saying that the others were \"unpleasant\" was the understatement of the millennium. Celestia had also said that destroying the place wouldn't erase the memories of the events that had transpired here. And although Luna hated it, Celestia was right. She couldn't change the past just by destroying a place where bad things had happened. Unfortunately, the fact that they didn't destroyed this place was both, a good thing and a bad thing. The good thing, was that Luna knew the territory, since she had grown up here. The bad thing was that, if they had destroyed this place, maybe this wouldn't have happened. Maybe they wouldn't be here, risking their lives fighting a ghost of the princesses' past and trying to rescue a beloved friend. However, one thing that no one knew, was that Luna wished to be more with Twilight Sparkle than just a friend. In her past, she had a few lovers. But none were the one. The one she wanted to truly be with. The one she wanted to have a family with and to spend her life with. But, Twilight was different. Luna knew that Twilight was a night lover. But to her, it wouldn't matter if Twilight liked the night or not. She knew that she would love Twilight no matter what. But, she was torn. Because on one hoof, she was an Alicorn, thus immortal. She could overcome that if it was for Twilight. After all, she knew that Celestia planned to ascend Twilight to an Alicorn, like they had done with Cadence. On the other hoof, she knew that her sister wished to have Twilight as her mate too. They did shared a few lovers in the past. But this time, it was different. For she wanted Twilight to be her mate and, eventually, to marry her and live happily by her side. Of course, she hadn't discussed this with Celestia. How would she approach this subject? It's not like she could go to Celestia and say \"Hey, Tia! I'm in love with Twilight just like you and I want her for myself!\", no. This was a very delicate subject. Besides, she knew Celestia well enough to know that she would pretend that her love for Twilight didn't existed and would give Twilight up. She knew that Celestia still blamed herself for what had happened a thousand years ago. And thus, would give anything up if Luna was happy. Even the love of her immortal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Um, your highness?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna snapped to attention and noticed that her companions were looking at her with worry. She realized she had been spacing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Are you alright?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Yes. It's just that I don't like being here. Too many bad things happened here.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity and Fluttershy nodded. The princesses had told the six of them what had happened before Luna became Nightmare Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Anyway, what are we going to do? You and I can't fly and Rarity and you can't teleport. How do we get in?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hmm... I think I have an idea.\"</span>, she said, looking at the wall of what was left of what once was the tower where her room was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"What are you thinking, your highness?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"First, please stop calling me that. We're friends. So, please just call me Luna, okay?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"A-alright. It's just that, well, you're a princess so...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I understand that, but I prefer to keep those formalities for our regular subjects.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Okay.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Alright.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Thank you. Now, I was thinking of conjuring a rope and tie something heavy on one side, then we could use magic to secure the heavy side on the window from that tower. Then we could easily climb the rope and get in with out being noticed.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"I think that's a good idea, your- I mean, Luna.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Indeed. Although I wouldn't risk dirtying my coat so much, it's for Twilight. Besides, my coat can't get worse that it currently is.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*chuckle* We were, how do you say it nowadays? Ah yes, pretty roughed up, weren't we?\"</span>, said Luna, with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was true! Luna's usually midnight blue coat and now a mix of blue and brown. He cutie-mark was barely visible and her regalia, except for her crown, were lost in the forest. Rarity's coat was white  with a few brown spots. She also was soaked from head to hooves and from muzzle to tail, due to one of the traps. And, like the first time she came here, her tail was missing all the way to the base. Only for different reasons. Fluttershy was the one in the worst shape of all three on them. She was almost bald, from a trap that used fire, all that was left of her tail were a few very short threads and her wings had cuts in many places and had many missing feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna then used her magic to conjure the rope they needed. Fluttershy grabbed three stones and Rarity grabbed a fallen branch.  Luna then used her magic to close some of the branches ramifications around the stones, tie the rope on the branch tightly (think of it like a grapple hook), and to carefully and silently move it to the window they had to climb to. They got to the rope and began to climb. First, Luna, since she was the faster of them. Next was Fluttershy and lastly Rarity. What they didn't knew, was that Nightmare was watching them, with the help of one of her many bats. She went to the location and created an invisible shield to hide Twilight's crib from their sight. She then made herself invisible too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour, the trio made it to the top. Once Luna had reached the window, she had entered the tower and pulled the rope until Fluttershy and Rarity could get in as well. What they saw shocked them. What had been once Luna's room, was now a beautifully made, if a bit rushed, mix of bedroom and nursery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Why would she make a nursery? Do you think had a foal?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I don't think anyone would be insane enough to mate with that monster.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Oh, Luna. You hurt me with such comments! And here I thought we were intimate.\"</span>, said Nightmare with sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I will do more than that if you don't show up right now and release Twilight at once!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"I can't give Twilight back. Not now, not ever. Besides, Luna, I'm right behind you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna turned, only to receive a buck right on her muzzle from Nightmare's powerful back legs. The impact sent her flying and she hit hard against the opposite wall. The impact was so hard that it broke a few ribs and her right wing. Nightmare didn't relent. She quickly fired a magical blast at the roof, making a couple of large stones fall. Both stones slammed into Luna. One broke her left back leg and the other one broke her left front leg. All the time, Luna could only scream and cry from the amount of pain she was suffering. It was so much pain that she ended up passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Luna!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Your highness!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Instead of worrying about her, you should pay attention to your surroundings!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare then used her magic to make the stone floor become intangible. Making Fluttershy and Rarity sink a bit until their hooves were knee deep into it. She then turned the floor solid again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Darn it! I-I'm stuck!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"M-me too!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"*evil chuckle* Good, good. That way you won't interfere. Still, just for precaution...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare then used her magic to envelop Rarity's horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"W-what are you going to do?!\"</span>, squeaked Rarity, terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"You're magic levels are poor, at best. But I still can't risk you making a stunt to hinder my plans!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a strong pull of her magic, Nightmare snapped Rarity's horn straight from the base of her skull, making Rarity howl and cry in an immensurable amount of pain. Rarity's head went down, facing the ground, making blood fall freely to the floor beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Rarity!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare then threw Rarity's horn to the ground and smashed it with a strong slam from her right front hoof. And that made Rarity cry even harder. For, when a Unicorn's horn is torn or somehow separated from the Unicorn's head, with strong magical and medical capabilities, it is possible to re attach it back. However, it's a long process and the Unicorn's magic is never as strong as it was before. But, when the horn is smashed, the magic in it is lost forever. Not to mention that it's the worst thing that could happen to a Unicorn. Because, just like the physical strength and the wings were the Earth Ponies' and Pegasi's identities, the same happened with a Unicorn's horn. They represent who and what they are. Without them, they're not even Earth Pony, since they didn't had their strength. After smashing Rarity's horn, Nightmare conjured the cage, once again, and used her magic to throw Rarity and Fluttershy in it. Then she teleported the cage, Luna, Twilight's crib and herself to the dungeons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinue...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Celestia awoke in a cold and dark place. Her head was spinning and, like the rest of her, aching. She could also feel a disturbance on her horn. She opened her eyes and saw that she was currently on a dark and cold room. To her left stood a wall of grey stone. To her right and to her front, were bars made of steel. She tried moving her legs but found that it wasn't possible. She looked up and saw that she was currently standing on her back hooves and that all of her legs were chained to the wall behind her. Then, all of the events from earlier returned to her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"*sob* *sob* How did it came to this? How could I have failed so miserably? Why could I not save her?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"T-tia? Is that you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"*gasp* L-Luna?! Are you there?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Yeah. I'm here. Along with everypony else.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"I see... So we all failed, huh?\"</span>, she said, sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Unfortunately, yes.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"How are you all?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I have a broken front and back left legs. My wings are broken too, as well as some of my ribs. I'm healing fast, tough. Thank goodness I'm an Alicorn. Shining Armor along with Applejack, Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie are knocked out cold. Cadence and Flutteshy are trying to comfort Rarity.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Because we failed?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"That, and...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"What is it, Lulu? What happened?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Nightmare, she... tore Rarity's horn from the base and... smashed it.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"*GASP!!!* B-but that means...!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Yes. Rarity can no longer use magic. And she won't be able to do so ever again.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity heard that. And it only made her cry harder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"What are we going to do now, aunties?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"What <i>CAN</i> we do, Cadence? Nightmare won. We are imprisoned, our magic is useless, the elements can't be used anymore and, worst of all, we have lost Twilight.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"What do you mean with that? I-is Twilight d-d-dead?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"No. But what happened is even worse that death.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"*chuckles* Oh, Celestia. I don't think that. I don't think that Twilight would believe that either.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia, Cadence, Luna, Rarity and Fluttershy turned and saw the being that they despised the most. Nightmare Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"What do you want now? Haven't you done enough already?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Oh, my dear Luna, I haven't even begun. Besides, I simply came to make it so that you all understand what happened and how we all got to where we are right now.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare grabbed each of them and slapped with her magic until they were wide awake. Once she was sure that everypony was awake, she dropped them on the ground and opened the cage, releasing them inside of the cell that was to Lunas' left side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Now then. First of all, I'll explain how I'm still alive. As I'm sure that's one of the main questions on your minds. The first thing you need to know, is that the elements try to make balance on their target. Whether it is a single being or something bigger. As you know, the first time the elements were used on Luna and myself, it was Celestia using them. However, because she was an Alicorn and had a lot of power, the Elements took Equis as a whole and considered that I was too much darkness for this world. Thus, they banished me, taking Luna along for the ride.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony nodded. And Luna felt a bit relieved from he fact that her banishment wasn't intentional. That it had been an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Now, the second time, the elements were used by Twilight Sparkle and her friends.\", she said, pointing to the group of five mares. \"However, even with Twilight by their side, they were nowhere near as powerful as an Alicorn. Thus, they took mine and Luna's body as a target, instead of Equis. Thus, to make balance, they separated us, Giving me a body in the process. In short, I have to thank you all, for giving me the freedom I needed and wanted from the beginning!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony was speechless and wide eyed. Their own weapons and, ultimately themselves, had generated the predicament they were in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Now, there is something, or rather, somepony, that I want you to meet. Celestia, Laughter, Cadence, Loyalty and Honesty already know this and Celestia had already seen her. But I find it proper to introduce her formally to you all.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia and the afore mentioned others lowered their heads, knowing what was coming next. The others were confused, having no idea of what had happened to Twilight. Nightmare used her  magic to remove the invisibility spell and revealed a beautifully, yet rushedly, built crib. She then went to it and grabbed something from inside of it with her wings, smiling. Then, she sat in front of her prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Ladies and gentlecolt. Allow me to introduce my daughter, Twilight Andromeda Moon!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare opened her wings to reveal, to everypony's shock and dismay, a baby Alicorn Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*GASP!*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I-is that...!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"No!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"It can't be!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others, save for Celestia, had similar responses. Except for Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Aw! She's such a cutie!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony looked at her like she had grown a second head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"What? She is!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Why, thank you. Pinkie Pie, was it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Yeppers!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Enough! What do you want? What are you going to do with Twilight and with us?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare scowled and used her magic to zip Lunas mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hmm! Hmhp!\"</span>, said Luna's trying to get the zip out of her. With no success, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"All in due time, Luna. First, I think you and Celestia have something to talk about, no?\"</span>, said Nightmare, unzipping Luna's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"W-what are you talking about?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Oh? Why, I'm talking about Celestia's attraction towards her former student.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"What?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Eh?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"No way!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"*chuckle* And that's not all, is it, Luna? After all, you too had romantic feelings towards Twilight.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"How do you know-!\"</span>, Luna covered her mouth. But it was too late. She had already said more that she would have wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia looked at her with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"I-is that true, Luna?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna merely lowered her head and looked at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Why didn't you told me?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Because I knew of your feeling towards Twilight. And I know that you still feel guilty about my banishment. So , I thought that if I talked with you about it, you would give up on your happiness for me and Twilight to be happy. And I didn't wanted that.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Admirable, little Luna. However, you wouldn't protect your dear sister so much if you knew what she was doing to poor Twilight.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"What are you talking about now?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Tell me, did you knew that Celestia and Twilight sent letters to each other regularly?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Yes. Those were Twilight's friendship reports.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Correct. Now, did you knew that Celestia imbued strong magic on them?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"The magic was required to send them without the risk of being delayed.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Partially correct.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Eh?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Celestia didn't just used magic to send the letters. She also imbued them with sealing magic!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"What?! That's absurd!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"No. It's not. She used that sealing magic to keep Twilight's magic at, according to her, acceptable levels! And since you don't believe me, why don't you ask her? Hm?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, Luna and everypony else looked at Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I-is it true, Tia? Please, tell us it isn't!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia remained quiet. Which provided the answer to everypony else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"H-how could you? How could you, Celestia?! Why would you be scared of Twily?! </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"She was afraid of Twilight's potential! Of what Twilight could and <b>will</b> become!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"What is it? What is it that Twilight can become that scared you so much to the point of treating her like that, Celestia?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Twilight can and will become a full fledged Goddess! She will become what neither of us could be! She will become the most powerful being in Equis!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNopony could speak. They couldn't believe anything of what was happening! Everypony was furious at Celestia for doing such a thing to their friend. But, at the same time, they couldn't help but being afraid. To think, that their beloved Twilight had so much power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Oh, yes! You had asked about my plans for Twilight and for all of you hadn't you, Luna? Well, let's see. I plan on training Twilight and help her reach her true power and potential. And, once she becomes a teenager, I'm sure she'll be a fine co-ruler. We'll rule over Equestria, as mother and child, side by side, forever! And as for you all, well, you should thank me, really. Because, as you all know, foal need their mother's milk to feed on their first couple of years. And I plan to turn you all into that milk! I'm going to devour all of you and turn you into the milk that will nourish the future goddess of Equis. You should feel honored! Now then, who should be the first ones?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"<i>Ones?</i>\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Well, I do have two holes that lead to my stomach, don't I?*chuckles evilly*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, reader? Who are the first victims?</span></div></div>",

Which ones of you will be the firsts?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony looked at each other. They knew that escaping at this point was not  an option. And even if it was, they would just be caught in another trap. Besides, no matter what they did, their Twilight was gone. Thus, it was pointless to struggle. But, despite that, none seemed to want to go first. They were going to die. Plain and simple. But, who would be the first? It seemed they would have to choose fast. Because Nightmare was seeming to lose her patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Decide quickly. Or I'll decide for you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia looked at Luna and Luna looked back at her. Despite Luna still being furious at her sister for what she had done to Twilight, she knew this was no place or time. That the important thing now was the safety of the others. Maybe they could come up with something that they could not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">*There is no point delaying this any further.*</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Royal Sisters were about to get up. But before they could, somepony beat them to the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Okay. We'll go first.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everypony's surprise, the ones who had gotten up were Rainbow Dash and Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Oh? Loyalty and Honesty? Hmm. Odd and interesting. I had thought that Celestia and Luna would have been the firsts to become food. Not that it matters. After all, you will all become nourishment for my little one. Still, I admit that I'm curious. Why did you chose to go first?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"C'ause we've been thinking and...we realized something.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Oh? And what is that?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"We realized that we owe no loyalty to Princess Celestia and to Princess Luna.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn uncomfortable silence fell on the room, as the words sunk in. As soon as they did, the reaction was instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Eh?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"What?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Excuse me?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Come again?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie made a spit take. Although where she got the liquid to do so, is anypony's guess, or the glass for that matter. And Celestia and Luna said nothing. They looked as though they were made of stone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Could you... repeat that?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"We said we owe no loyalty to the princesses. I mean, think about it, girls!\"</span>, said Rainbow, turning to Rarity, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie.<span class=\"cpblue\"> \"I'm sure we all remember our first encounter with Twilight and the night when we faced Nightmare Moon for the first time.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls nodded, wondering where their prismatic friend was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"AJ was honest when she had to make Twilight trust her. Rarity was generous when she gave up her tail to that sea dragon to save Twilight. Shy stood in the way of danger against a manticore, also to save Twilight, who was the manticore's next target. Pinks here calmed Twilight and, sort of, comforted her when we met those spooky trees and I was loyal to my friends, especially to Twilight!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other bearers looked at each other and, after thinking for a few seconds, they understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Ah guess you get it, right girls? Those fancy necklaces and Twilight's tiara are linked with each other. Just like us! We managed to beat Nightmare once, Discord and the Bug Queen and her little bugs because we stood together and supported each other! Not because of the princesses. Who, by the way, did nothing on any of those occasions, including the battle against King Sombra.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"I fought Chrysalis, remember?\"</span>, said Celestia, a little bit anoyed by that last comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"And she beat you with <i>ONE</i> shot of magic.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"*Pffff!* Ha, ha, ha, ha! Seriously, Celestia? One magic blast from the Changeling Queen and you're down? I knew you were weak, but not that much! Ha, ha, ha!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Yeah, yeah, get it out of your system.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*giggles* I-I'm sorry, Tia. But it really is amusing! I mean, the great and powerful Celestia, ruler of the Sun and co-ruler of Equestria, defeated by one magic blast from the Bug's Queen!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Okay! Okay! I get it! Enough already! And we're getting out of topic, anyway.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Right. You see, girls? We won because we stood with Twilight!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"But, Twilight is now Nightmare Moon's baby!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"We know. That's why we decided to be the firsts. We don't know about you, but our loyalty and our lives belong to Twilight. We, no, each one of us owes her our lives. If it wasn't for her, we would have been friends, no doubt, we not as good friends as now. And we would have died many times! That's why we decided that, if being food and helping helping Twilight become a goddess is the only way we can be of use for her, then we will gladly do this sacrifice and become her food.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony was speechless. Celestia and Luna were still like statues. As were Shining Armor and Cadence. Nightmare was impressed. By this mares' selflessness and by their loyalty towards her daughter. They were willing to be Twilight's nourishment if it meant that they would help her! Even tough they knew that they would die. Rarity, Fluttershy and Pinkie looked at each other, and smiled. They got up and looked to their friends and to Nightmare and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"You're right. We all owe Twilight big time. And a lady always pays her debts! Especially to her friends!\"</span>, said Rarity, with conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Right! And we won't be gone! I mean, yeah, we wont have bodies anymore but, we'll always go on through Twilight, even if she doesn't remembers us.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"It's the right and the fair thing to do. I'm willing to help Twilight. Even if it will cost my very self! I only want one favor, miss Nightmare.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Yes? What is it, Fluttershy, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Yes, your highness. You see, I live in a cottage near the entry of the Everfree Forest. There, I have many animal friends that I take care of and, well...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare smiled, knowing where the yellow pegasus was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Don't worry. I promise I will take care of them. And Twilight will to, once she's old enough.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy couldn't help it. She ran and hugged Nightmare tightly. Which, of course, surprised Nightmare big time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"Oh, thank you very much, miss Nightmare.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Don't worry about it. And the same goes to all of you. Honestly, I simply can not thank you enough for doing this for my daughter. Thus, I promise you all, that your pets and families will be well taken care off. They shall be placed under to protection of the crown and no harm shall come to them. Whether they live in Canterlot or Ponyville or in any other place in Equestria. I swear it upon my life.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the girls: <span class=\"crose\">\"Thank you, Miss Nightmare!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"No need to thank me. Also, Pinkie Pie. You're wrong. Twilight will remember you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"But, if she's a baby-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"I know you. And I know what you've done, since I saw Twilight's memories from her previous life. And, although I can't tell her everything, obviously, I will tell her about the five of you and about her dragon, Spike.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the girls gathered around Nightmare Moon and hugged her. Showing their appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Well then, shall we begin?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Okay. But, could the two of us that will go and you go to another room to do it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"I thought of that. I imagine that it would be terribly uncomfortable and awkward to do this in front of the others. Anyway, let's go to the room I redesigned.

But first.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare then lightened her horn and the cell where the other element bearers were glowed brightly. Once the glow vanished, the girls found themselves on what looked to be a luxurious room! They looked around and saw that they still were on the dungeons. They also noticed several kinds of foods, sweets and drinks (both, alcoholic and non-alcoholic), as well as a bow full of *ahem* naughty toys. Confused, they turned to Nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"I just wanted to make sure that, at least, you'll enjoy your last moments.\"</span>, she said, smiling kindly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made the girls realize that she wasn't mocking them. She was giving a sort of parting gift. Nightmare then enveloped Rainbow, AJ and herself with her mane and departed to her room, teleporting Twilight and the crib in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho are we going to stay with?</span></div></div>",

Rainbow Dash grinned and licked her lips. \"Your wish will be granted, I always wondered what you taste like.\" Rainbow Dash then patted her hoof on the table, gesturing for Twilight to climb on it. As the unicorn obeyed, Rainbow twirled her hoof, gesturing for Twilight to turn around. Twilight blushed but still did as the pegasus instructed and laid down while giving her cyan colored friend a good view of her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips one more time, Rainbow Dash used her hooves to grab Twilights flanks and slowly pulled the unicorn towards her. Twilight looked behind her and her heart pounded as she saw her friends maw wide open. Twilight started to blush as she felt her friends tongue, licking across her dock, covering it in saliva. She started to moan as Rainbow got bolder and started to give her pussy a few good licks, all while pulling her deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon her dock entered the esophagus and Twilight could feel her hind legs against her sides, Rainbow Dash decided to lick her prey across the teats. Twilight moaned in pleasure again as half of her body was now inside of Rainbow Dash. Suddenly she could feel something else pulling her in. It took both of them a moment to realize but they noticed that Applejack was pulling Twilight in from inside the stomach. Both mares giggled as Twilights descent was now accelerated with the help of the swallowed earth pony and it took only about a minute until Twilights horn disappeared and Rainbow Dash closed her mouth for a mighty gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt herself being dropped into a warm, slimy chamber, she also felt the hooves of another pony on her flanks. \"Nice of ya'll ta join me Twi.\" Greeted Applejack. The stomach churned and gurgled, soon digestion would begin. \"Ah knew ya'll would love this, it's just so much fun.\" Now that Twilight joined their voreplay, Applejack felt a lot less nervous about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwiilght simply relished in the feeling of being inside a stomach. Normally she would be grossed out, but this was simply amazing, the warm stomach combined with the closeness to Applejack and the massage-like churning was heavenly. \"Oh Applejack, Rainbow, thank you for showing this to me, I absolutely LOVE it!\" She pulled Applejack into a fierce hug, said earth pony was already getting a little soft after the gastric juices already had some time to soften her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer welcome Twi, say... didn't you want to observe the digestion process? Cause ah'm gonna turn into goo soon.\" Asked Applejack, then she gave Twilight a sly, if unseen smile. \"Or we could have some fun in here, I've never done it with another pony in here before.\" True, Applejack often masturbated while she was inside of Rainbow Dashs stomach, but this would be something new to her.</span></div></div>",

The welcoming (and hopeful) smile on Applejack's face briefly made her reconsider her plan to be a neutral observer.  Ultimately, though, her scientific curiosity prevailed.  \"Thank you for the offer, Applejack, but I did come here in part to do research for my assignment.  But maybe we could try something like that...next time?\" <i>Next time I'm eaten alive?  Is it weirder that that sentence makes sense to me, or that I'm looking forward to it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was worried that Applejack might feel disappointed, but she was relieved to hear Applejack let out a hearty chuckle.  \"Shucks, sugarcube, ah can't fault ya for takin' things slow yer first time round.  'Sides, ah know how you like to study up on somethin' 'fore ya try it yerself.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack lifted her left foreleg out of the murky goop to give Twilight a pat on the shoulder, but her hoof and ankle stayed behind, leaving only a dripping orange stump.  \"Whoops!\" she laughed as she admired her missing limb, clearly not perturbed about her predicament.  Twilight recoiled reflexively as best she could in the small space, but fascination quickly replaced shock as she took in the sight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe expected to see blood and bone oozing from where the hoof had detached, but instead she found that Applejack's insides appeared to have the same look and texture as the outside, as though she was made of the same mushy substance all the way through.  Orange beads of liquid pony slid slowly down the side of the former leg until finally plopping into the acid below.  The scene reminded Twilight of an ice cream cone melting in the summer heat, and she resisted a sudden urge to lunge forward and lap the droplets off Applejack's leg before they could fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack laughed at Twilight's rapt expression and wiggled her stump playfully, flicking a few drops of herself onto Twilight's chest.  \"We better get a move on if ya wanna see the show while yer still in one piece.\"  Twilight gulped as she suddenly became aware that the tingling feeling in her hindquarters was caused by more than just her arousal.  \"Tell ya what, Twi.  How about you climb up on top of me while ah shimmy down into this here goo.  That way you can get a good view of the action without havin' to worry about fallin' apart yerself.  Not yet, anyway,\" she finished with a smirk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gave a shudder of excitement at the reminder that she would soon share Applejack's fate, then nodded and began to climb onto her gooey friend.  It was easier said than done, as the tight confines and crushing pressure of Rainbow's walls made it difficult to maneuver.  With every shift and slide Twilight could feel her horn gouging and scraping the stomach lining.  Each poke earned her an appreciative groan from Rainbow Dash above her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Twilight found herself perched atop the dissolving earth pony.  She could feel the weight of her barrel displacing the softness of Applejack's belly as she snuggled into position.  The heat of Applejack's pudge enveloping her combined with the stifling humidity made Twilight feel like she was going to melt.  <i>Then again, I probably will,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack looked up at Twilight through glazed eyes.  Even half-lost in the bliss of being dissolved and massaged into nothing, she tried to play a good host.  \"Comfy, sugarcube?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!  Oh, this is going to be so informative!  Now then,\" she licked her lips in anticipation and added in a husky voice, \"let's collect some data.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How's the view?\" Applejack asked coyly, her breathing a bit heavier now than when they'd started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fascinating!\" Twilight replied.  \"I can see the little bits of you falling off as you get broken down.  And Rainbow's acid has taken on an orange color now that it's mixing together with, uh, you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack let out a throaty moan.  \"Ah love it when ya talk dirty, Twi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight would have blushed if her muzzle weren't already flush with excitement.  \"Err, yes, well!  I predict that as more of your sludge fills this chamber it will dilute the strength of the acid.  Have you noticed your rate of decay slowing down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't really know, sugar.  I kinda have my mind on other things right--whoa nelly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack cried out as the entire stomach suddenly lurched forward, dousing both ponies with liquid and slamming them toward the rear of the stomach.  Twilight lost her balance and fell muzzle first into Applejack's creamy neck.  She sank in an inch or two and felt a bit of Applejack seep into her mouth.  The taste was thick and sweet, like hot apple pie filling, with a hint of bitterness from the acid glaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dadgummit Rainbow!\"  Applejack shouted.  \"Quit movin' around up there!  Twilight can't do her thing if she's fallin' all over like a pig on stilts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not happening,\" Rainbow called back.  \"I didn't come here to do homework.  Besides, she'll figure out how it works firsthoof in a few minutes anyway.\"  Every few seconds she dragged her gigantic belly another hoof across the floor. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nTwilight sat back up, licking the orange goo off her lips.  She wondered if Applejack had noticed.  \"Just where is she taking us, anyway?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah reckon she's off to one of the bedroom suites down the hall.  Rainbow don't mind cloppin' in front of everypony in the club, but she gets a mite embarrassed to be seen once she starts to plump up a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shut up, AJ...\" Dash muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bedrooms?  You stay here overnight?\"  That made sense, now that Twilight thought about it.  She almost never saw ponies dragging a pony-sized gut around town; she'd learned to never say never around Pinkie Pie.  \"How often can you two afford to have a night out like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack shrugged her sagging shoulders.  \"Funny thing, Twi, they never charge us a bit!  One of the staff told me once that the love between the two of us was so sweet they couldn't bear to make us pay.  An' speakin' of sweet things, ah felt you take a bite outta me just now.\"  She gave Twilight a smile that was equal parts playful and grateful.  \"Ah'm mighty glad to see yer gettin' in the spirit of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack reached up with what remained of her leg stump and booped Twilight on the nose.  Before she could lower it, Twilight finally gave in and dove forward to take the lump into her mouth.  She gulped down the soft ponyflesh greedily as the sloshing waves created by Rainbow Dash's movements splashed up into her fur.  Soon she was completely coated with liquid earth pony, inside and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweet Celestia, keep doin' that,\" moaned Applejack, her eyes rolling up deliriously.  Twilight finished off the left leg and reached over to start the right one, but before she could wrap her lips around it she felt something give underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack felt it too, and she fought to come back down and make her eyes face forward.  \"Dash!\" she cried out in alarm, \"Slow down!  Yer churnin' me up too fast!  Gimme another minute of this before ah--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"  Dash called out, \"I can't hear you over the sound of this huge, sloshy gut!\"  She flapped her wings to lift herself a hoof off the floor, then crashed back down with a loud slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dangit, Dash!  ah'm 'bout ta...ah'm gonna...oh Dash, ah--hnnnng!\"  With a tremendous wet splortch, Twilight fell through Applejack's belly, splitting the mare into two chunks.  Applejack threw her head back and screamed through gritted teeth as the feeling sent her over the edge.  Her upper body tossed on the waves of acid as her remaining hoof reached down absently to grab at a pussy that was no longer there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her friend orgasm upon being split apart drove Twilight into a frenzy.  She lowered a hoof below the surface to probe her own marehood.  She could tell that she was already getting soft down there herself.  As she tried to work her hoof in between her folds, she pushed too hard, causing her entire rump to collapse inwards.  Her vaginal walls smooshed together and blended into the same indistinct substance that Applejack had been.  The sensation of crushing her own vagina into paste made her mind explode, and everything went blank as a pleasure she never could have conceived overwhelmed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight awoke some minutes later, still sitting in Dash's stomach and leaning against the lining for support.  The orange soup had taken on a slightly darker color as her literally demolished pussy slowly broke apart and mixed with the earth pony's goo.  With a start, Twilight realized that she could not see any sign of Applejack.  She felt around under the surface for any solid bits of her friend left over, but came up empty-hooved.  \"Applejack?  Applejack, are you there?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm about to be eaten!</i>  A small voice in her mind reminded her that this was all part of the plan, but a much larger voice told her to panic.  Oddly, the thought that she might die in Rainbow Dash's stomach didn't bother her as much as the unfinished checklists she would leave behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dash?  Hey, Dash?\" she called out.  \"Is Applejack out there with you?  You're absolutely sure that she'll come back after being digested, right?  I mean, tonight has been just <i>amazing</i> and I'm really excited to be your meal but I just realized that I never said goodbye to Spike and I never wrote a will and I didn't sign a consent form which means if I don't come back the Princess will come for you and I don't want you to get sent to the moon just because--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"  Rainbow's soothing tone interrupted Twilight's ramble.  \"Twilight.  Hey.  Relax, Twi.  Applejack's fine.  You're fine.\"  Twilight felt something hard pressing against her through Rainbow's stomach lining; Dash must have pressed a hoof into her belly to try to comfort her.  Twilight nuzzled the spot affectionately and took a few deep breaths of the heavy, humid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" Twilight said sheepishly.  \"I guess I got a little overwhelmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, don't be,\" Rainbow replied.  \"It's not every day that you find yourself eaten alive.  Actually, maybe some ponies do get eaten every day, I dunno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess being eaten can't be too dangerous if ponies keep going back for seconds!\"  Twilight giggled, her soft body jostling more than she expected it to.  \"But Rainbow, I am still curious about Applejack.  Where did she go now that you've digested her completely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt Rainbow Dash begin to gently rock from side to side and rub her front hooves into her belly.  \"Mmm, oh my gosh, I did churn her all up!  I can't tell you what it's like to be so warm and heavy, with her juices sloshing around in there...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt the rocking stop briefly.  \"Uh, yeah, as for Applejack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or, more like she's going to <i>be</i> me a while, I guess?  Something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, you want to run that by me one more time?\" asked Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash was silent as she pondered how to answer, still absently running her hooves up and down her distended gut.  \"It's like...hmm.  You know how when the acid and the pressure is breaking you down and the parts of you that are getting churned up feel <i>really</i> good, but afterward you don't feel anything there because now that part of you is gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...suppose I do.\"  Twilight blushed again as she thought back to the indescribable shock of pleasure she'd gotten when her pussy melted away.  She reached down under the muck to see what she could still feel down there and discovered that her hind legs were completely gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so anyway,\" Dash continued, \"That keeps going until finally there's just one little piece of you left.  Then that last bit dissolves and then there's just...nothing.  You can't see or feel anything, and you're just like, <i>'Wow, this is it.  I'm really gone.  I'm nothing now, just nutrients for somepony else's body.' </i> Oh mare, I bet I cum like five times at that point!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight quirked an unseen eyebrow at the thought of how \"nothing\" could orgasm even once, let alone five times, but she set that question aside for now.  \"So then what?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" Rainbow continued. \"So eventually the stomach that digested you starts to work away your goo, and you start feeling again, only you're not in your body yet.  It's like you're spread out all through your <i>pred's</i> body.  You can feel everything she feels, but you're also giving every inch of her a big hug from the inside out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow let out a contented hum and shivered, the liquids in her body sloshing back and forth in waves.  \"It's kinda like you're helping her out by being part of her body, y'know?  Just knowing that she's stronger now because she turned your body into muscle and fat for her to burn?  Mmm, that part's almost as good as being digested!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight tried not to giggle at Rainbow's sentiment.  She never expected to hear Dash act so romantic, especially in such a bizarre context.  \"I guess I'll know soon enough,\" Twilight replied.  \"Just one last question: how do you get back to your real body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow perked back up.  \"That's easy!  Once the club's spell is done rebuilding your body, you and your pred feel it, uh, calling for you, I guess.  Then you and she just sort of agree to...let go.  That part's tough, just 'cause you wish you could just hug her like that forever.  But you do it and then, poof!  You're back in your body and standing next to your pred, good as new.  Pretty cool, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash slowly rolled onto her back, spurring her acid into its final push to finish off Twilight.  Everything below Twilight's forelegs had dissolved by now. She briefly worried how she was going to keep her head above the juices before she realized that she didn't even have lungs anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow wrapped her hooves as best she could around her belly and grinned.  \"So egghead, you ready to become part of my body or do you wanna ask questions all night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm gonna be Applejack's meal tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's mind reeled at how eager Dash sounded about being devoured.  \"Are you really that excited to be a...\" a tingle ran up her spine as she said the word, \"...a meal?  To be reduced to nothing but food for another pony?\"  <i>More importantly,</i> she asked herself, <i>why am</i> I <i>getting excited about it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you fret none, sugarcube,\" said Applejack.  \"We've done this a few times already and we ain't any worse for wear.  Bein' eaten can be pretty fun when you know you're gonna be alright in the end.\"  She gave Rainbow Dash a playful nudge.  \"In fact, sometimes I 'spect RD loses our contests on purpose just so she can be the one on the menu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash leaned away from Applejack and gave her marefriend a hurtful look.  \"No way, AJ!  When we go hoof to hoof, I always give it my all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know ya do, hun, I'm just joshin'.\"  She leaned in and kissed Rainbow tenderly on the lips.  \"It's knowin' that you never hold back around me that makes the victory taste so sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" Dash rolled her eyes.  \"That was terrible, AJ.  I'm gonna make sure you get indigestion for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the strange situation, Twilight couldn't help but smile at the affection between her two friends.  Even after looking around at the outrageously bloated ponies in the room, she still had trouble believing what she was about to watch, and hearing her friends make romantic jokes about Rainbow Dash's impending doom only added to the absurdity.  \"This all still seems so bizarre to me,\" she said.  \"There's just no way you can really eat Rainbow Dash whole like that.  She's almost as big as you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash gave Applejack a conspiratorial nudge.  \"I guess we'll just have to prove it to her then, right AJ?  She did come to see a show after all.\"  Twilight blushed as Rainbow Dash crouched down, preparing to pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hang on just a minute, RD,\" Applejack warned, \"I wanted to--mmgph!\"  Her words were cut short as Dash launched herself at Applejack, locking their lips in a powerful kiss.  Applejack recovered quickly and returned the kiss with gusto, but making out with a hot farm pony was only step one of Dash's daring plan.  She advanced on the earth pony, pushing her back hard enough that she fell onto her rump.  Applejack's mouth opened slightly as the force of Dash's kiss spread her muzzle apart.  Pressing her advantage, Dash wedged her snout into Applejack's mouth and began digging her way towards the orange pony's gullet.  Twilight stared in amazement as Applejack's jaw stretched impossibly wide to allow Dash to fit her entire head inside.  Applejack's eyes rolled back in ecstasy as her throat distended to allow a pony-head-shaped mass to inch its way downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow worked one of her hooves into Applejack's mouth, making it easier for her to climb her way down her marefriend.  At this, Applejack's eyes snapped back forward as she frantically began pushing at Dash's shoulders with her forehooves.  Entranced by the display, Twilight idly wondered if Applejack couldn't breathe with so much Rainbow Dash in the way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow appeared to take Applejack's resistance as a challenge.  She shouted something unintelligible from inside the earth pony, and the rest of her body tensed as she unfurled her wings and began to flap.  Her hindquarters lifted into the air as she used her powerful wingthrusts to ram the rest of herself down Applejack.  Applejack retaliated with some moves of her own, delivering a few punches to Dash's barrel in between attempts to pull her down to the ground.  It was clear, however, that the overeager prey was winning this fight, as each flap of her wings pushed her down another inch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching over her head, Applejack wrapped her forelegs around Dash's midsection and dug her hooves down hard into the base of her wings.  The pegasus's body immediately seized up and plummeted to the floor.  Taking advantage of Dash's stunned state, Applejack raised her hind legs up to her marefriend's chest and kicked off.  With a muffled grunt, she forced Dash up and out, dumping her unceremoniously onto the floor.  Dash fell on her back and glowered up at Applejack, looking a bit like a wet cat with her mane matted down by Applejack's saliva.  Twilight couldn't help but be a little turned on by the sight; even when drenched in spit, a wet mane is still a wet mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hay, what gives?!\" cried Rainbow Dash.  \"You better not tell me I taste bad.  I definitely remembered to shower this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily from her exertion, Applejack managed a weak chuckle.  \"You taste just as sweet as ever, sugarlump.  But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have a whole <i>barrel</i> left over from cider season?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup!  Weren't easy hidin' it away from the family neither.  I reckon my brother knows I had one or two stashed somewhere, though.  He's the one what keeps the ledgers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash was drooling copiously now.  \"Oh mare, I'd trade my primaries for that much cider!  Hey Twilight!  We're going to the kitchen, you wanna come with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight responded dazedly to the sound of her name.  \"Huh?  Oh, sure, a cider sounds lovely.\"  She couldn't stop mentally replaying the scene she'd just witnessed.  In her mind's eye, Rainbow Dash still had a wet mane, but now she was wearing orange apple-print socks and sipping from a juicebox as she slid into Applejack's widened maw like it was a cardboard box.  She imagined Dash going in further, wiggling her way through until Applejack lifted her off the ground, her sock-covered legs kicking helplessly in the air as she tried to shimmy all the way into Applejack's stomach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle nudge from Applejack broke Twilight out of her reverie.  \"You okay there, Twi?  You look like ya ain't all there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shook her head vigorously to clear the haze.  What was it about watching Dash <i>literally</i> jump down Applejack's throat that had gotten her juices flowing like that?  \"Yeah, I'm fine, sorry.  What was that about cider?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack grinned.  \"Dashie's been beggin' me for months to bring a batch of cider to one of these shindigs.  If I'm honest, I'm glad to do it if she'll take the time to let me cook her up right like a true country supper instead of just jumpin' in there raw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to cook her?  Assuming that means what I think it does, why would you prefer that over having her, uh, raw?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack tapped a hoof against her chin as she pondered an answer.  \"Hmm... Think of it this way, sugarcube:  Eatin' a pony is like...like apple pie.\"  Behind her, Rainbow Dash rolled her eyes.  \"The main ingredient can be tasty and satisfyin' all on its own, but when you take the time to prepare it right, you can bring out a whole different flavor and texture that'll make ya fall in love with that taste all over again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash casually draped a foreleg around her marefriend's neck.  \"In other words, AJ wants me to taste like apples after I drink so much cider that it starts to come out of my pores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...think I understand that, actually,\" Twilight mused.  \"So, giving Rainbow Dash cider is sort of like adding the cinnamon and sugar to a pie.  They mix with the base ingredient to enhance the flavor and create a totally new experience!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're gettin' it!\" cheered Applejack.  She seemed much more comfortable with Twilight's presence at the club now that they were speaking her language.  \"Alright then, sugarcube, we're off to the kitchen.  You can tag along if ya want, or you can stay here and see what kinda trouble you can get yourself into on your lonesome.

Pinkie was so happy to learn that the schoolteacher had found a special somepony who shared her unique jelly-related interests, and she was certain that there would be a smile on Cheerilee's face if she still had one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Pinkie finished licking her stirring spoon clean she felt a series of twitches hit her.  Right ear fold, rump wiggle, teeth chatter.  She set down the spoon and cried out, \"Camel Yawn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA diminutive tan unicorn poked her head out of the stockroom.  \"Pinkie, for the twentieth time, my name is pronounced Chamel--oh, never mind.  What'cha need, boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie screwed a lid onto the comically oversized jar of preserved pony.  \"Could you take this jar out to Hugh Jelly when he arrives?  It's his and Cheerilee's three-and-a-third month anniversary, so make sure they get extra special treatment tonight!  Oh!  And can you check on the Gumdrops Gumbo and make sure Goody Gumdrops isn't trying to climb out of the pot?  My Pinkie Sense just told me that somepony is about to spill the beans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, the unicorn wheeled the fuchsia jam that used to be Cheerilee away on a trolley.  Pinkie waved goodbye to the two until they had passed through the kitchen doors.  She let out a sigh of satisfaction before turning to face the dreaded cleanup job waiting for her.  Cooking ponies was rewarding and fun work, but it left a very not-fun mess afterward.  Still, Pinkie knew better than to slack off on tidying up, since keeping a clean kitchen was double-super important when the foods being prepared were also ponies.  She was very careful not to get behind in her work, especially after that one incident.  <i>Seriously though,</i> she wondered, <i>why would we keep our deli slicer in a place where somepony can just back into it like that?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo absorbed was she in remembering bad puns and mopping up leftover bits of Cheerilee that she didn't hear the kitchen doors swing open a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Pinkie?</i>  What are you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie spun on her hooves to see Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight standing in the doorway.  To her horror, she saw that Twilight was looking uncomfortable and confused.  And not the good \"I got lost on my way to the bathroom\" kind of uncomfortable and confused.  No, this was the bad kind of uncomfortable and confused, like \"I just found out my bestest-best friend is sort of a cannibal but not technically?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey Twilight, funny seeing you here!  I mean, listen, I can explain.  You see--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, that won't be necessary,\" Twilight interrupted.  She raised a hoof to her chest as she took a deep breath, then slowly exhaled and extended her foreleg outward.  \"I should have seen this coming, honestly.  I just came across a club where ponies cook and eat each other for fun.  <i>Of course</i> Pinkie Pie would be the head chef in the weirdest place in Ponyville.  It's...kind of comforting, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie let out the breath she'd been holding.  She decided not to tell her that the vore club was, at best, the third weirdest place in Ponyville.  Maybe later.  \"Oh, I'm not the head chef, silly!  I just like to help out in the kitchen sometimes.  So, what can I do for you girls tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno about Twilight,\" Rainbow Dash said, floating casually into the room, \"but I'm here to stuff my gullet with cider so AJ can pretend I'm an apple pie, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie giggled.  \"Wow, that sounds downright delish, Applejack!  I knew Rainbow Dash came here sometimes, but now that I know AJ likes to eat ponies too, maybe we can share recipes!\"  Pinkie suddenly gasped.  \"But wait!  If AJ is here to eat a pony...\"  She turned to face Twilight again, this time with a hopeful gleam in her eye.  \"Twilight, are you also here to cook somepony?  Or maybe be cooked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eventually Zecora gulped down Twilight's hind legs and tail, sending the young mare into her tight gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight took in her surroundings, and was caught off guard by Zecora releasing a tremendous belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRAAAAAAAAAAAP!

Her spell had worked after all! Zecora hadn't expected the spell to work as well as it had, and assumed Twilight would be struggling by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora looked at her bulging midsection and inquired, \"Twilight, tell me, are you well? It has been some time since you made my belly swell...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight responded, confident she was safe in her prison, \"Yes, yes, I'm fine.

Oh, Zecora, please don't tell me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora replied with a whimsy tone, \"I'm afraid the only choice is down so bear in mind, that I promise it won't be too begrimed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Twilight felt her hooves poke through a hole in the floor and felt herself brought down to the intestines of her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the stomach turned dark. Twilight was coming out the back way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zecoraaaa!\" Twilight screamed as she passed through the Zebra's bowels, she would much rather not be brought out THAT way.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By sunset, or what little of it that could be seen through the dense canopy of the Everfree forest, Zecora was feeling satisfied with her days work. She'd successfully brewed a good deal of concoctions, some commissioned and others for practice. Her hut had been tidied up and the ingredients for tomorrows brews were all gathered, as well as a few freshly picked vegetables for snacks. A few concerned villagers from ponyville had stopped by searching for their missing librarian. Their search had turned up nothing, as Zecora had utilized her robes to her best advantage, and no one was the wiser. Looking down at her slightly less swollen stomach, she chuckled and rubbed the fleshy jail of her little tag-along. The noises her tummy had made when Twilight first entered had calmed, and now were little less than mumbles. Pondering the resilience of her meal, Zecora swung her belly from side to side to test if Twilight was still alive.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight had long since lost her fight against Zecora's stomach and indeed was barely recognizable as a pony with her melted features. Her fur had turned Zecora's acid's a brighter purple and small clumps still resiliently clung to the walls, though they were slowly dripping to meet the acid. Her horn was floating on the top of the pool, having fallen off yet not yet succumbing to the acids.  As Zecora swung her prey from side to side, the motion further ground Twilight's lifeless corpse, molding her already deformed body into a real mess. The sudden stimulation revitalized Zecora's stomach, and the acid levels began to rise from just over a quarter full to nearly halfway. The acids hissed as they were united with Zecora's prey and worked double strength on the hapless unicorn. From the outside, the quiet murmur of the stomach suddenly transformed into fierce growling, something Zecora took note of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her belly kick into overdrive, Zecora felt it her duty to lend a hand where she could. Moving with a noticeable hip-shake, Zecora  sauntered over to her bedroom and nestled herself into her leopard skin covers. Snugly tucked away, Zecora patted her distended stomach one last time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh little unicorn,<br>\r\n Though you were a smart little lass,<br>\r\n I expect you will look rather cute,<br>\r\n On my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled, and kissed her moaning tummy good night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora awoke at 6:30 A.M. on the dot as she always did, stretched herself out and yawned. she swung her hind legs over the edge of her cot, and leaped to the floor. A tiny hiccup crept out from between her lips, and she was reminded of her little passenger. Looking towards her abdomen, sure enough it was as flat and muscular as before she had devoured Twilight. Their was only her rump to remember her by, now more voluptuous than before, a real piece of eye candy if Zecora was being honest with herself. Her morning continued normally however, but even among her daily routines she was on occasion reminded of her actions. She would on occasion scrape by a shelf with her slightly larger behind, or be greeted by more wary visitors to Everfree searching for what was indeed now just her ass. Even as she ate her breakfast she could still taste a tiny bit of the purple unicorn whenever she belched, and the tribal zebra couldn't help but giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young Twilight Sparkle,<br>\r\n you tasted quite fine.<br>\r\n And now my delicious little pony<br>\r\n you are all mine~.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora sighed happily, she hadn't felt this good since she was welcomed into ponyville by ironically the same mare. And now she pondered whether she should indeed make even more of the citizens of ponyville a part of her voluptuous ass. Zecora felt confident as a huntress that she could devour all of ponyville should she desire without ever being seen, but deep down the thought of such treacherous behavior was slightly unnerving.  After all Twilight had asked to be eaten, simply munching on everypony seemed more villainous than she was used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

The Apple family trusted her, getting one of them in her stomach wouldn't be that hard. But on the other hand she liked them quite a bit too.

She was already going to be a suspect, since she was the last pony to see Twilight. If everypony saw her visiting the disappearing ponies, it would not take long for the guard to make the connection. Right now she had to admit, that she might have not thought this out as well as she should. Twilight Sparkle was the personal student of the princess, before she became a pile of waste and a layer of fat, this case would get a lot of attention. Zecora had to make up for this hasty decision now, she had to plan the next step carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her thoughts, it took little to no time until the Zebra arrived at Sweet Apple Acres. Her eyes scanned the farm and the surrounding orchard for any sign of the Apple Family. In her mind, she was calculating who to expect. Today was market day, so one of the older siblings should be at the stand. There was a good chance that Applebloom was off with her friends. So, if Applebloom was out the it should only be Granny Smith and either Big Macintosh or Applejack. Right now nopony should suspect her yet, so she just had to stay calm. While cantering up to the main building, she scanned for one of her potential targets. Finally she saw...</span></div></div>",

Today Big Macintosh was on market duty, leaving his sister Applejack behind to buck the trees. The predatory zebra was kinda hoping for this, since she doubted she could eat the large stallion so easily. Looking around, she found that nopony else was nearby. Applejack saw her approaching and smiled, waving to her. Zecora waved back, good, Applejack had no idea about her intentions. \"Howdy there Zecora, what can ah do for ya'll?\" She asked. Zecora had to keep herself from drooling as she looked at the well defined muscles but she had to keep it discreet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day my farming friend, I would like to ask if there is a helping hoof that you could lend. I would like a bag of apples but, I also need help to carry them back to my hut.\" She explained. It should be easy enough to lure Applejack to her home with that. AJ was always very helpful and she would surely not pass up such a sale. Applejack grinned and agreed to help, going to the cellar to retrieve a bag. Satisfied, that AJ was successfully fooled, Zecora hummed a merry tune, as the two of them went back to her hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the hut, Zecora told Applejack to put the bag right at the farthest wall from the door. Following closely behind, the Zebra grabbed the ladle from her cauldron and prepared to strike. Just as Applejack laid down the bag, a loud clang and a sharp pain on the back of her head were the last things she heard and felt before blacking out. Zecora was glad that this hit was enough to knock her prey out, otherwise the strong pony could have been a problem. Quickly she ran outside and gathered some of the vines that grew around the area. Those were strong enough to hold Applejack but they would not cause any indigestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing AJ onto her belly, Zecora pulled the rear hooves up against her sides and tied them up, while Applejacks front hooves were tied together on the back. In this position, Applejack couldn't escape through struggling.</span></div></div>",

It would be a waste to just let them rot and they could also be used as evidence against her. An idea hit her, as she looked at the empty cauldron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Applejack woke up again with a splitting headache and her hooves felt sore. \"What the hay happened? And why does mah ass feel so full?\" She wondered as she felt a strange pressure in her intestine. Applejack tried to stand up only to find, that all her hooves were locked into an uncomfortable position. AJ tried to break free and saw Zecora standing at the cauldron. A smell of warm apples hit her nose. \"Zecora! What are you doing there?\" She demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zebra chuckled and turned around to face her meal. \"I am making applesauce to add to your mass, that strange feeling are the apples I shoved up your ass. Apples are what is in my mood, so you are going to be my food.\" Applejack stared at her in horror. It looks like those rumors from the past were true after all, Zecora was a cannibal and she was on the menu. Cold sweat ran down AJ's face. \"Now Zecora, ah know those rumors were not pretty but this prank is taking it too fa.. ack!\" Applejack was swiftly silenced as Zecora put a funnel into her mouth and tied it shut with more veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might think this is a joke but you're out of luck, I am going to fatten you up.\" She pushed the pony over to the cauldron after the applesauce cooled down a little, before tilting it. Applejack's gag reflex was triggered and she started to swallow all of the sauce, flowing into her mouth. After a while, she teared up at the full feeling. It felt almost as if she was going to burst any second as the flow finally stopped and the funnel was removed. Applejack coughed and hacked, before something blocked her mouth. Zecora saved the last apple, the biggest one in the entire bag, to keep AJ's mouth shut. The farmer couldn't do anything now but look up at Zecora and wait for her next move.</span></div></div>",

Applejack looked so deliciously full, her belly bloated and jiggling with all the sauce inside. \"It looks like you have met your match, now you will go down the hatch.\" AJ's eyes widened and Zecora could hear muffled yelling as she opened her mouth widely and bent her head down. The earth pony tried to pull away but due to her being bound it was no use. She tasted the zebra's tongue on her own lips as her head was slowly engulfed. A strangely familiar smell hit her nose as her face was being covered in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zebra grabbed AJ by her sides, where the earth pony's rear legs were tied up and she started to shove Applejack in even faster. With a little effort, she squeezed the farmers shoulders past her lips and sent them down her throat. The bound legs squirmed as AJ desperately tried to free herself. The thick vines were too strong though and Zecora could easily hold her in place, as the rear legs and belly slid past her lips next. Zecora let her rear drop onto the ground and sat up while heaving the orange rump up in the air, where it started to slide down on it's own. Soon the apple cutie mark disappeared from sight, past the zebra's lips. The rest of AJ's ass followed behind and her tail was slurped up last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora sighed happily as she laid down on her side, looking down at her stomach. Applejack was trashing around as well as she could, trying to free herself somehow but even without the vine rope, the space was just too cramped to move. \"Thank you Applejack, now I will take a nap, when I wake up you will already be my fat.\" The wild struggles of her prey were more like a massage to hear and the groaning and gurgling a lullaby as Zecora closed her eyes and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zecora paused before eating her dinner and wondered what she could do to improve her meal. An idea flashed into her head about a particular story she heard from a friend, about a zebra who ate her victim in an odd way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've decided against using my mouth, orange lass,\" said Zecora, smiling at the relief her words had brought on the stuffed pony in front of her,\" and instead, to eat you I will use my ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Applejack's eyes widened in shock. She wasn't just going to be eaten, but she's going up Zecora's behind! The zebra turned herself around and presented her ample gray rump to her meal, showing off the goods. \"Eating you this way is such a strange feat, but I can tell you're such a delicious treat! Say goodbye to the world, my good friend, as you will forever be trapped inside my back end!\" With that Zecora sat back onto AJ's face, plastering her two plush buns on either side of her meal's head. As the stripped butt fell down, Applejack's nose slipped straight into Zecora's pucker, widening it considerably. Zecora placed more weight on her meal, widening her anus to an extraordinary amount, blocking AJ's vision as her forehead started to slip in. All the bound and  gagged pony could do is scream internally as her head slipped quickly inside the backside with a loud slurp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora's anus stopped at Applejack's neck, constricting with pleasure as the voracious zebra said, \"Ahhh, my insides feel so enlarged, but I won't stop until I am fully in charge.\" So with that she add more weight to the bound pony's body, adding enough pressure to slip in her shoulders with a pop. From there on, the zebra slowly dragged AJ inside, descending down on her as if she would an anal dildo. \"What a naughty filly you are to be exploring my insides,\" retorted Zecora excitedly,\" but you may repay for it by becoming the fat on my sides.\" Eventually, Zecora paused at Applejack's engorged belly, which blocked the rest of her from entering. \"I do believe you might want to escape, but know your place and contain your shape!\" Zecora said as she sat harder than before, forcing the entirety of Applejack's big belly inside as a loud vacancy of air had been displaced within the zebra. The pressure inside of AJ's guts got too high and caused a few apples to shoot from her own stuffed rump, dropping on the ground between her hooves. At this point, Zecora was at AJ's waist and from there on, the process was quickest as she sped up the consumption of the farmer pony as more apples fell from AJ's ass. The zebra's behind spread around Applejack's as it overcame it and took it in. \"Your lovely haunches are now mine, and I must say it feels divine...\" said Zecora in pure bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost done, Zecora pushed down on the hooves sticking out of her, sitting down until she sat on the ground. All that was left were two orange hooves visible at the very edge of the zebra's sphincter, eager to be pulled in all the way. \"It is apparent who's rump is more superior, and it is yours who belongs in my interior.\" Right then, Zecora flexed her internal muscles, pulling in the very last bit of the struggling pony as the spread anus closed into a neat star shape over the orange frogs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora leaned back with her full insides, feeling the struggling mare travel through her intestines. Exhausted, Zecora takes a nap. Later when she awakens...</span></div></div>",

That dilemma being that she didn't have anyone to test her new spells on, because spike was out helping Rarity.  She knew he's be back that night, but he'd be too tired to help her then, and she'd have to wait until the morning.  And so the Dilemma.  Who to ask for help with her spells?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she came to what she assumed was the only reasonable answer- she would ask one of her friends for help!  But the second she thought of it, she immediately had to check most of them off the list.  Rarity was digging for gems with spike, Rainbow was on weather duty, Pinkie was Pinkie and any results from a test involving her would be invariably skewed, and Applejack was always busy.  Not to say she wouldn't be willing to help a friend, but Twilight always tried to plan ahead with Applejack so she could make plans for how to make up for the work, instead of panicking to catch up the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, this left only a single option- Fluttershy.  Sure, the timid mare had a habit of panicking when confronted with something frightening, but Twilight was sure that she's be able to keep her calm.  Probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind made up, Twilight walked to Fluttershy's cottage, taking with her several books(including, of course, the spellbook she was planning to test), a pad of paper, a quill, three bookmarks(you never know), and an ample supply of ink.</span></div></div>",

The spell has passed all of Roaring's Tests of Secure Biological Transfiguration, and I've done the spell several times on both inanimate and animate objects. Besides, we're simply doing some tests to find any way the spell can be refined. You'll be perfectly fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Okay... What do you need me to do?\" Twilight gave a quick look about the room saying, \"Well right now, just stand... right where you are now. I'll be shrinking you a little bit at a time so you can adjust to the change easier. Are you ready?\" Fluttershy hesitantly nodded. Despite trusting Twilight, Fluttershy's heart skipped a beat as the unicorn pointed her horn straight at her and shot out a violet beam. When she could bring herself to open her eyes again, Fluttershy found that she was at shoulder height compared to Twilight. \"How are you feeling? Any dizziness or vertigo?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a little vertigo, but that's it...\" Twilight nodded, and jotted down some notes. \"Very good. Tell me when you feel ready for another cast.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\nBefore long, Fluttershy was small enough to be mistaken for a young filly. \"Before we continue any further,\" Twilight noted, \"We should move you up onto the table. How's that sound?\" Fluttershy turned her head away from the floor long enough to take in her 'new' surroundings. It didn't take very long for her to decide that she didn't like being that close to the ground at all. \"...Okay. I'll-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could say anything else, Fluttershy found herself swept up in Twilight's forelegs, and was gently seated on the edge of the table with a quick nuzzle. \"There~\u2661. Isn't that much better?\" There was a brief yet horribly long silence as Twilight slowly realized what she just did. \"...Ohmygosh, Fluttershy, I'm so sorry! You were just so small, and I just- I don't know what came over me! You're a grown mare, I should treat you like one!\" Fluttershy merely stared at the floor saying, \"It's okay. Let's... just forget that ever happened.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded and jotted down another note. '<i>Psychological effects on caster not encountered in previous tests.

And in any case, what was the point of an experiment like this if not to see what happens when you cast the spell?  The effect was unexpected, yes, but she would simply have to determine if it was psychological or an un-recorded result of the spell when she had completed these tests.  For now, however, she had her supplies, and Fluttershy was only a few more spells from being ready for the actual tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Fluttershy from her notes, she saw her friend nod, if not confidently then resolutely, that she was ready to continue.  Over the next several minutes Twilight continued the established cycle of casting and resting, recording any symptoms Fluttershy felt along the way, with no recurrences of the odd emotional reaction.  Finally, the last spell was finished and Fluttershy stood at her final height of a little over an inch tall.  Finally ready, Twilight drew out a number of precisely scaled instruments, and hooked them up all around Fluttershy, ready for testing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Fluttershy, lets get started.

In her dazed state, she tried to snuggle up into the coarse fuzz below her, before she found herself lifted from her cushion by a strange, tingling energy.  The energy held her still, making it impossible for her to open her wings, the panic of which cleared the cobwebs and woke her back up.  She opened her eyes to see Twilight furiously scribbling away.  The massive letters Twilight scratched onto the parchment were somewhat hard to read, due to the unicorn's distinct lack of practice, but Fluttershy could make out several key words- most prominantly, something about the 'square cube law' and 'disproportionate strength'.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Twilight looked up from her writing to see that Fluttershy had returned to the land of the living, and smiled sweetly before setting her back on the table.  \"Sorry about that Fluttershy, I thought that might happen, but I forgot to set up the netting to prevent painful impacts.  Luckily, the other parts of the theory held out too, so you don't seem to have suffered any injuries.  Are you still up for the rest of the tests, or should I reverse the spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy stretched her wings as she thought, considering the risks of continuing.  She hadn't been hurt, and the scariest part was over- plus, she knew she probably wouldn't be hurt if she did fall to the ground.  On the other hand, though, it was incredibly terrifying being this small, and her body wasn't behaving like she expected it to, which made the chance of an accident much, much higher.  Eventually, she decided...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(for anyone wondering(this is the second reference I've made to it, after all) the square cube law refers to the fact that in order to halve something's height, you must first divide it's volume by four.  This is referred to as the square cube law for obvious reasons.  Practically, this means that a statue will use exponentially less supplies for every inch of height you remove, and a persons bones, muscles, etc. will become disproportionately scaled as they shrink.  I'm not going to go into everything, but the bones become super-strong, the muscles super dense, etc.  If they were to grow instead, at somewhere around double the size(not height) they would no longer be able to support themselves.  Much higher, and their legs would shatter under the pressure.  Also, they would both be essentially blind- the shrunken one wouldn't have enough light entering his pupils, and the tall one would have too much.  This will not be addressed though, because artistic license biotch!)</span></div></div>",

I've considered starting a family at some point in the future, but nothing absolute...\"</i> She took out a book about pegasus physiology after measuring Fluttershy's wings. <i>\"It's not like I really know anyone I'd want to persue a serious relationship with.

There's so much I wanted to ask you about being an alicorn too.\" She said, trying to break the tension and getting a conversation going.

She was clearly shocked but now there was no backing out anymore. \"It basically became an instinct, the instinct you are feeling, to devour non alicorns and absorb their lifeforce and lifespan as they digested.\" Now that she finished the explanation, Celestia waited for Twilights reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mind of the new alicorn was racing. The hunger was telling her to eat other ponies? What would happen if she couldn't hold back anymore? Then something else hit her. \"P-princessess... you have lived for more than a thousand years, does that mean you?\" She didn't want to finish that sentence.

No matter what the criminal does, being alive and awake for digestion is too horrible of a punishment.\" In her thoughts, Luna had to admit though, with King Sombra it was tempting to eat him and then listen to his screams as the stomach acids dissolved him while he watched. But for now, they hoped that this explanation laid Twilights fears to rest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, same old, same old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, come on in!\" She replied as she let her friend trot inside and shutting the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you needed my help with something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually\u2026it's a project I'm working on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pretty important one, actually. One I can't do without a lot of ponies' help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Sounds cool! What'ya want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just follow me to the basement.\" Twilight trotted to the door leading to the basement steps, which circled down the tubular shape of the tree. Rainbow instead flew down to the floor while Twilight delicately trotted down the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she reached the bottom, she stared at her friend in anticipation. She could feel an unfounded strength in her muscles to pull it off. This was it, the moment of truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2026Twi? Why're you looking at me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well\u2026\" She brought her tongue back, unaware she was licking her own lips. \"Before we begin, Rainbow, I've actually been having a toothache for a while recently\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need to see a dentist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might soon, but I was wondering if you could look at it and see how it looks\u2026\" She opened her maw as wide as she could, which seemed to hinge open a few more inches than normal. Rainbow flapped up to her and peered at her teeth with a confused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muh Molarsh\u2026da righ on\u2026\" Rainbow pointed her head closer into Twilight's mouth. They seemed just fine, if not better than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see anything, Twi\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chn ya lk closher?\" Raising an eyebrow, Rainbow moved closer so she was an inch from Twilight's mouth. \"Closher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Rainbow moved forward so she was mere inches from Twilight's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Closher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what-\" But before she could finish, Twilight shot her hooves up and around Rainbow's head, cramming her into her mouth. The pegasus didn't even have time to react as she was pulled into her friend's maw, her entire head miraculously fitting into her mouth and starting to travel down her throat. Once Rainbow began to fight back, Twilight wrapped her arms around her legs and wings and pushed her in further, traveling down her neck in a grotesquely large bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight encountered difficulty as she reached the elbows of Rainbow's arms, but with hesitation managed to worm them down her mouth, a huge, round bulge forming in her midsection. Once her friend's forelegs were in, Rainbow's hind legs easily slid down her throat, allowing her to slurp up the rest of her colorful tail as if it were spaghetti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on her haunches, Twilight gasped for breath after the workout she'd endured. Lumps formed in her pony-sized stomach as Rainbow fought to get out, but a faint magic glow in her belly caused the kicks to slowly die off. With a loud rumbling, the hard bulge began to grow softer and smaller as her meal was converted to fat. Each of her legs began to fatten up, gently rising as her rump puffed up to a rather heavy degree. She even began to gently grow in height, gaining about six inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was all settled, Twilight giggled at her victory and heaved herself up, her fat belly hanging only several inches from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, that was actually kinda fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nonetheless, her wings began flapping and she zoomed through the door and outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow alone, Twilight's stomach let out another rumble, hungry despite the cannibalism she'd just partaken in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\u2026I could go for a snack!\" She waddled for the kitchen and opened the refrigerator door, her mouth watering at all the food inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than delicately choose a bite to eat, she levitated a pie to her face and dove her snout straight in, wolfing down the pastry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2026..</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later outside, what seemed to be Applejack ran up to the library's front door and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Rainbow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*mmph*\u2026come on *urp* in, Rainbow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow pulled the door open and trotted in. She almost couldn't find Twilight until she looked at the kitchen, the unicorn anything but unnoticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was even fatter than before, assorted dishes and food containers haphazardly thrown about as she stuffed herself like a giant mauve pig. The chair she was once seated on had since flattened under her enormous butt. She was greedily licking away a messy pie dish before throwing it away, heaving herself forward to see Rainbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to be a foot taller since she'd eaten Rainbow, and her belly was now so large that it generously rubbed against the ground as she walked, sticking out two feet from her sides. Despite her bulk, she was indeed mobile, the muscles in her legs bulging beneath the immense layers of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, Twilight\u2026have you eaten everything in the library?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the food. But not <i>everything.</i>\" She insisted, licking her lips. Realizing her friend's appetite, Rainbow leaped out of Applejack's body, who doubled over in exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*huff*\u2026what just\u2026*pant*\" She barely even realized what was happening as Twilight levitated her weak off of the ground, opening her maw wide to swallow her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usually active earth pony didn't put up much of a site as she was pushed into Twilight's mouth, who was happily gulping her further and further in. What little visible neck she had was stretched tight as Applejack traveled down her throat in a grotesque, huge bulge traveling into her stomach. As Applejack's rear hooves were slurped into Twilight's mouth and down her gullet, she closed her mouth and gave a final gulp, releasing a contented sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026I had no idea ponies tasted this great!\" But sure enough, her stomach rumbled as she continued to grow, gaining another foot in height and putting in at around six feet. Her entire body inflated with fat, her rear end becoming wide enough to get wedged in the front door and her whale of a belly sticking out four feet from each side. Another gurgle traveled up her throat and come out as a belch, releasing an orange wisp similar in appearance to Rainbow's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"corange\">\"Ugh\u2026what just\u2026\"</span></i> Applejack weakly tried to get up, but passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"clteal\">\"She gonna be okay?\"</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little winded, is all.

Go right ahead!\" Twilight excitedly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rainbow flew through the wall outside, leaving Applejack and Twilight alone. The latter managed to walk on her golf-bag sized legs towards the kitchen, a somewhat predatory smile on her face as she eyed the remaining food in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith incredibly gusto, Twilight leaned herself onto the table and dove her snout in, continuing to wolf everything edible in sight down. As she ate, her body continued to fatten up, and the table bowed under her extraordinary weight and crumpled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight didn't even notice as she laid on the ground and devoured whatever was within reach, growing bigger and fatter with each bite...</span></div></div>",

However, she was only so for a few seconds before the doors to the library opened, and in walked a small purple dragon carrying a suitcase and parchment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Twilight, I'm back from Canter-\" But Spike couldn't finish as a beam of magic, and he instantly fell to the ground, snoring. A pink aura surrounded him as he floated up to Twilights head, which was bigger than he was. He easily fit inside her mouth as she levitated him side and swallowed him whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body expanded outwards by a few inches from the small meal, immediately followed with a gurgle and belch as a purple wisp shot out of Twilight's mouth and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was still snoring and curled up on the floor as Twilight floated him onto her back. Glancing at the door, she noticed the parchment he had brought back and floated it up to her eyes, unfurling it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dearest Twilight,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI congratulate you on your magical studies, and cannot further state how proud I am of all you have accomplished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI write to you now to present what could be your most monumental assignment; to study Starswirls's unfinished spell, which could bring about-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Twilight was quickly bored by the letter and crumpled it up before tossing it into her mouth, swallowing it easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paper tasted amazing, thanks to Twilight's compromised judgement. Glancing over her blobby shoulder, she looked at the rows of books, licking her lips in anticipation as she levitated one to her muzzle and chopped straight into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, it was not enough for the speed addicted pegasus. No matter how hard she trained, she could not improve her wingpower anymore. Some of her peers told her that she merely reached her limit but Rainbow Dash would have none of it. Right now she was in the library, not for a new Daring Do book but instead she and Twilight looked for any information on raising a pegasus wingpower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany books were already on the floor, containing nothing but the training regiments that no longer work for Rainbow Dash. Finally Twilight found something, \"Here is an article about ponies raising their natural abilities beyond their natural capacity.\" Rainbow Dash cheered at first, thinking that now she could finally become faster but then Twilight's face fell. \"Oh no, you definitely can't do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash couldn't believe what she heard, why not? Then Twilight showed her the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>While the use of this method of performance enhancing has long been forbidden, cannibalism has often been the dark secret behind a particularly powerful pony's strenght.

That was the only way for her to become stronger? Eating other ponies and have them slowly and painfully dissolved in her stomach juices? This method was horrifying to her, and yet it seemed like it was the only way. Twilight Sparkle was now looking at her friend in disbelieve. Rainbow Dash wasn't seriously considering it did she? Unbeknown to her Rainbow Dash has thought of it and came to a conclusion.</span></div></div>",

If anypony disappeared and Rainbow got even faster than she already is, Twilight Would be sure to find out. So, Regrettably, Rainbow decided, she had to eat Twilight Sparkle. But how could she? Twilight was her friend! Her Element of Loyalty wouldn't allow it! Or would it? No, Absolutely not! But as Rainbow Thought more, she could be even faster than ever before, she's already the fastest, but intends to go faster and be Totally Unstoppable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rainbow looked at the book and looked at her wings, she let out a sigh and looked around to see if anypony was watching. Nopony was, and in this moment, Rainbow Dash teared up and said \"Sorry in advance, Twilight.\" Twilight looked at Rainbow Dash and said, \"Rainbow... no...\" But before Twilight Could do anything, Rainbow Dash Pinned her to the ground. Twilight Began shaking and trying to break free, but to no avail. She tried using magic, but it wasn't working. That's when Rainbow opened her mouth Wide and shut it over Twilight's head. \"Rainbow Dash, Stop this, Please! I'm your friend! You can't do this!\" Twilight said as she cried, knowing what pain lied ahead in the stomach of her former \"Friend\" Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Continued to Gulp down Twilight's Head and Forelegs, soon reaching the waist. she continued Swallowing until All that was left of Twilight Sparkle was her tail which Rainbow Dash quickly slurped up and let her muscles do the rest. But as Rainbow Continues, knowing this would kill her friend, she felt a change... he wings actually did begin to feel stronger and she felt more energy then ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight meanwhile, was having a much worse time. The saliva and drool getting all over her fur coat and into her mane and tail as the muscles Squeezed her further Down Rainbow's esophagus. She was begging, and pleading, and crying for mercy, but none came. Soon Twilight's head and forelegs dropped into Rainbow's Stomach acids and instantly began to burn like hellfire. Twilight was sobbing as the pain was far too much for the poor Alicorn to bear. The rest of her body joined her as her flesh was burning off of her bones and melting into Rainbow's acids, now Red from Twilight's blood. Twilight continued to struggle and kick and fight, but nothing could be done to save her. Twilight grew woozy and began to lose consciousness, but the pain prevented her from falling asleep. Twilight was forced to live through every second of this Burning hot pain in her flesh. She let out a final cry, and said, \"Rainbow Dash... How could you do this to your friends...\" She mourned further until finally, she was Digested alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow felt an amazing burst of energy going through her body and her wings especially felt great, but Rainbow Dash's heart felt sad, then Rainbow herself felt.</span></div></div>",

She peeked over from behind a tree, watching Applejack do her job. She couldn't help but smile, thinking about what she'd do to her. She stepped out, looking around to see if anypony else was home. Applejack saw her and decided to greet her friend, \"Howdy Rainbow! What brings ya here?\" Rainbow smiled and replied, \"Just here for a snack. Not much else.\" Applejack chuckled, \"Well, we've got plenty of apples, so help yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow smirked and said, \"Well there is ONE apple that I've got my eyes on.\" Applejack tilted her head and said, \"Really?

Rainbow moaned as she pulled Applejack in further, down her pulsating esophagus. Applejack kicked around and screamed, struggling with all her might, but she was only pulled in deeper and deeper down the dark fleshy tube. \"R-Rainbow! W-what are you doing!? Y-Your EATING Me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow ignored her and continued to gulp down her \"Friend-now-prey\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Applejack soon found herself inside a big, dark, fleshy chamber, filled to the brim with green liquid which she assumed was the acids. As soon as she fell in, the acids burned past the third-degree. Applejack was crying as her skin was burned off and her coat melted into a squishy, bloody mess of gore. With one last breath, applejack said, \"Rainbow Dash, Why!?\" And she cried until her demise. Nothing was left, not even her bones, but Rainbow was only moaning in pleasure, feeling so much energy rush through her body and into her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, See you later, AJ.\" And she rubbed her belly as it worked on her delightful meal.

Rainbow moaned, rubbing it in Twilight's screaming face, before giggling and letting out a deep fart. Rainbow laughed as Twilight groaned from the smell before she pushed down harder, Twilight's head fully slipping into her rectum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight tried to push Rainbow's buttcheeks off  prying to escape the smelly cave. Rainbow simply pulled her cheeks apart, making Twilight's hooves slip into her butthole. Rainbow moaned once again before she began to clench and flex her muscles to bring more of Twilight inside her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Twilight's shoulders slipped bast the sphincter, Rainbow was quick to make work of Twilight. She pushed herself onto her hooves, Twilight's struggling body hanging out of her backside. Rainbow laughed before she flew up into the air, the added wing strength of the volunteer pony helping her lift another pony into the air. Rainbow slammed down onto the ground, pushing Twilight up her in record speed while releasing a smelly fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you became the butt of the joke Twilight.\" Rainbow said, standing up, two wriggling hooves and a purple tail were sticking out of the blue butt before Rainbow sucked them up with a 'slurp' sealing Twilight's smelly fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow moaned as her body sagged with the new weight, Outlines of a struggling Twilight moving through her intestines could be seen. Rainbow rubbed the bulge before she released one last blast of gas, purple fur flying out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the butt meal Twilight, try not to go to my ass. Your gonna help along with my wing power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow let out a yawn before she flew over to her cloud bed before flopping down onto the bed, immediatly going into a food coma while Twilight moved closer to the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rainbow woke up the next morning...</span></div></div>",

Rainbow was barely paying any attention; Feeding the animals was incredibly boring, but it wouldn't be long before it ended and she could have some proper 'hanging out' time with her oldest friend. Idly glancing at the sight at her hooves, she noticed something odd. \"Hey, how come that one's not eating anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy turned to the lone mouse fidgeting by the wall. \"Oh, that's Miss Flufflekins. She, um... Knows that today is... <i>her</i> day.\" Dash raised an eyebrow. \"Like, her birthday or something?\" The meek yellow pegasus muttered something softly, lowering herself to the ground. Reluctantly, Lady Periwinkle von Flufflekins VI climbed up onto Fluttershy's back, the rodent's eyes seemingly transfixed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see,\" Fluttershy hesitantly began as she trotted across the room, \"I love all my animals very much. But I can't ignore the natural order of things. And, well...\" Her voice trailed off as she reached a glass cage placed in the corner of the room. Popping open the top, she leaned against it and encouraged the mouse to climb inside. Rainbow crouched down by the cage for a better look inside. With a tiny little <i>thud</i>, Miss Flufflekins landed inside, and began to patiently await her fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy's soft voice spoke out, \"It's time for your breakfast, Anabelle.\" A few moments passed in silence before a shape leapt out of the foliage within the cage. \"Woah!\" Before Rainbow knew it, the little mouse was shoved halfway down a large green snake's gullet. \"I know,\" Fluttershy said with a look of perfect calm, \"Isn't nature fascinating sometimes?\" Rainbow half-heartedly nodded, unable to take her eyes off the scaly bulge moving down the reptile. Smiling softly, Fluttershy turned back to Dash. \"So, where are we going for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\nThe noon sun beat down upon the line of ponies patiently waiting in line at Applejack's stand. Fast as she may be, Rainbow always <br>\r\nsomehow ended up at the back of a freakishly long line. With an irritated flick of her tail, she found herself stuck listening to the mares in front of her chat. \"Sheesh, I'm so hungry I could eat a horse!\", exclaimed the mint green unicorn in front of her. \"...Where'd that saying come from, anyway?\", she continued, \"It's not like we're serious meat eaters. I mean, some ponies eat it extremely sparingly, but why a horse? Scientifically speaking, they're our closest relatives in the animal kingdom. So why a horse and not something less creepy, like an elephant or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cream-colored mare beside the unicorn answered with a shrug, \"I think it might be a gryphon thing. They eat meat all the time, and I'm pretty sure horses live in the gryphon lands.\" The unicorn seemed satisfied with that answer for a moment before speaking again, \"But it's a little creepy when <i>we</i> say it, isn't it? It's borderline cannibalism! I might as well have said, <i>'I'm so hungry, I'll just eat someone in this line!'</i> Right?\" Sensing an opportunity, the creamy earth pony whispered something into the unicorn's ear. The unicorn turned to her companion with a blush, \"Th-that's not what I meant and you know it! Really, sometimes I think that's the only thing on your mind...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed as it may have been, the unicorn's blush was nothing next to Rainbow's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\nThat evening, Rainbow found herself at Sugarcube Corner, waiting for closing time so she and the girls could meet up with Pinkie. She sat at a table off to the side, sitting across from Rarity, who was in the middle of a story. \"So I panicked and said that you were the Wonderbolts' <i>trainer!</i> After all, they didn't seem to know much about the ponies racing, and I'm sure that if they ever saw you fly, they'd believe it!\" Rainbow let herself chuckle. \"You crazy mare... It'll be the truth someday, though!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anything more could be said, their attention was drawn to something happening at the front counter. \"Oh dear, Pinkie,\" Mrs. Cake exclaimed, \"This evening sun got to the chocolate sculpture, it's starting to melt.\" The sculpture in question was that of a lifesize pony dramatically rearing up on its hind legs. Yet under the intense sunlight, it seemed a lot less stable than before. Pinkie Pie gasped in horror at the blasphemous sight before her. \"Oh no! I can't let all that delicious, gooey chocolate go to waste! I'LL SAVE YOU, TASTY PONY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, Pinkie's snakelike tongue stretched out of her mouth and slipped under the sculpture. Before anypony could realize what was happening, it dragged the defenseless chocolate into the mare's hungry maw. Pinkie eagerly 'mmm'ed as she licked up the half-melted chocolate in her mouth. The top half stuck out of Pinkie's mouth, the new context to its pose making it look like it was struggling to get out. Moments passed, and as much as Pinkie wanted to savor her dessert further, she couldn't resist the compulsion to gulp down the remainder of the once proud stallion. A large pink lump visibly travelled down her throat and vanished into her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look at her,\" Rarity commented, \"I bet she'll wake up tomorrow and not have another ounce on her. Meanwhile my portion control has been a...  Rainbow?\" Looking over, Rarity found that her companion had vanished. Before she had a chance to be offended, an obscenely loud belch rattled her brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\n<i>'This has gotten ridiculous!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow groaned in frustration within her freezingly cold shower. <i>'I hoped it wouldn't be a problem! But noooo, today it just wouldn't leave me alone! I really need to do something about this fetish thing before I lose my mind...'</i></span></div></div>",

Not Rarity, she'd overreact. Not Pinkie Pie, she'd tell everyone in Ponyville before the sun finished setting. Fluttershy could be counted on to stay quiet, but she might not understand, and take it the wrong way. For a while, Rainbow considered telling Applejack, But once again, there was a reason she couldn't. That was that she secretly loved applejack... more than usual, and she was afraid that if she told Applejack about this fettish, there'd be no chance on her ever being able to confide in her on her feelings. So, that leaves just Twilight. She could be counted on to be discreet, and might even know something to help. \"Rainbow? Anybody home?\" Applejack was looking at her, as though expecting a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. What was that, Applejack? I was lost in thought\" said Rainbow Dash. \"Iah was just sayin' that me and the other girls were gonna go to the farm, and hang out, and Iah was wonderin' if ya'd like teh come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Applejack. I can't. But I would like to speak with you, Twilight. In private\" Said Rainbow. \"Sure, Rainbow. Uh, girls, I'll catch up with you later.\" Said Twilight. \"C'mon. Let's go to the Library. Spike has gone to do some errends for me in Canterlot, and I'm not expecting him back for another couple days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Twilight and Rainbow Dash head to the Library, On the way there, Rainbow was starting to get really nervous about the looming conversation that was to be had. So nervous, that Twilight noticed. \"Rainbow, are you feeling alright? You look worried.\" Twilight said. \"Who? Me? Nah. I'm not worried. You know me. I'm always cool.\" Rainbow replies. But Twilight shoots her a look. \"You're not a very good liar, Rainbow.\" She said. \"Is it to do with your feelings for Applejack?\" Twilight was the only pony that Rainbow Dash had confided in her about feelings. \"No. It's not that.... Let's wait until it's inside. This conversation is best had behind closed doors.\" Rainbow said. \"Uhh, okay.\" replied Twilight. And they continued to the library in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they get there, does Rainbow chicken out, or tell Twilight?</span></div></div>",

As Twilight promised, there was no Spike to be seen anywhere.<br>\r\n\"So, what did you want to tell me, Rainbow?\" Twilight said. \"Well... It's kinda hard. This is a big secret, so you have to promise not to tell anypony.\" Said Rainbow.<br>\r\n\"Cross my heart, and hope to fly. Stick a cupcake in my eye.\" Replied Twilight. \"Well, for a while now... I've had this fetish.\" Started Rainbow. \"About eating other ponies... whole... and... well.. alive.\" At this, twilight's eyes went wide... so wide, that Rainbow Dash thought they were going to pop out of her head. After a long stunned silence, Twilight came back to her senses. \"Umm. Okay, Rainbow.\" Said Twilight, slowly. \"I'm not sure why you've told me this... but... okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason why I'm telling you,\" Said Rainbow Dash. \"Is that today, that fetish is everywhere. This morning in Fluttershy's cottage, where she fed a mouse to a snake, in the line for luch, somepony was talking about eating horses, and in Sugarcube corner with Pinkie Pie and that chocolate stallion... It's driving me crazy! I was wondering... hoping more like it, that you had a book that could help me keep this under control. Because I'm afraid that if I don't get control of my emotions soon, I might hurt somepony. I don't want to do that. Please, Twilight. You have to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Rainbow. I'll help you.\" Said Twilight. \"On one condition.\" \"What's that?\" Asked Rainbow Dash. \"If you ever do feel like you're about to lose control...\" Started Twilight. She couldn't retain eye contact, and blushed deeply. \"I want you to eat me. ONLY if you feel like you could loose control.\" Continued Twilight. \"The only reason is, that I've had a similar fetish... only instead of eating somepony; I want somepony to eat me. I do have a book for you. Please take care of it. It's one of my favourites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight goes up to her room, and various crashing noises can be heard as Twilight searched for the book. When she came back down, she placed in on a table infront of Rainbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gude to being a Voreaphile.\" Rainbow Dash reads the cover out loud. \"Yep!\" Said Twilight. \"It's helped me so much. If I hadn't found this book, I might have been begging for you to eat me right about now. But it's taught me to wait, until there is another completley willing party to partake in this exicise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Said Rainbow Dash. \"Wait... you mean this is actually possible!?\" \"Yes, of course it is!\" Said Twilight. \"Didn't you see Pinkie Pie with that chocolate pony? Had it not have been possible, she would never have been able to swallow it. But oral vore isn't the only way... there are more... sexual ways to do it as well, but I'll leave you to discover them for yourself. It's all in the book.\"</span></div></div>",

Before anypony was even considered they would have to show their best tricks to a talent seeker, then they would receive an invitation if they are good enough. Just last week Rainbow Dash got her invitation and now she was in the Cloudsdale headquarters of the Wonderbolts, waiting for the audition. Next to her were two more pegasi that made the cut, a brown stallion with a black mane and a sky-blue mare with a white mane, all three of them were excited and nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the Wonderbolts came in, Spitfire and Soarin were walking ahead of two other members. The three pegasi became even more nervous as they saw the serious expression on their faces. \"Alright everypony listen up, you three proved that your flying abilities are good enough for the team but flying skills are not everything.\" Spitfire explained and started pacing between the three candidates. \"You need to prove that you can keep a clear head in dangerous situations and push forward in the face of possible death.\" Stopping in front of Rainbow Dash, who stood in the middle, she gave them a stern look. \"This is the hardest test in Equestria, the only possible outcomes are success and acceptance into the Wonderbolts or death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash and the other pegasi gasped as they heard this. It was no secret that the final test to become a Wonderbolt was hard but they didn't know that it was this bad. Spitfire saw the nervousness in them. \"This is your last chance to back out, if the test starts there's no turning back.\" All of them remained silent, even if there was a chance of dying, they have come too far to give up their dream now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitfire waited one more minute before declaring, \"Very well then, now you are either Wonderbolts or dead. The test is a very unconventional one and it involves a special potion.\" On this cue another Wonderbolt came in, carrying a tablet with three glasses on them. \"Drink up and then we can start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObediently the three of them took the glasses and downed the content. Rainbow Dash tried to find any sort of taste in this potion, strangely it tasted a little like her feathers when she preened herself. After they finished the drinks, Spitfire addressed them again. \"You will feel the effect of the potion any moment now, as for the test you'll be....\"</span></div></div>",

It dawned on her, the potion must have paralyzed her. With effort she managed to turn to the other two, who were also shaking as if they just ran a marathon. Finally, her legs couldn't hold her up anymore and she fell to the ground. Slowly, Soarin approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The paralyzing potion will only last for a short time, you'll probably be able to move again shortly after arriving in the stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash tried to hold Soarin back but she didn't even manage to raise her hoof. Soarin effortlessly picked her up and stuffed her head into his mouth. Rainbow barely managed to twitch as she was pulled down his throat. It was wet, disgusting but she hated the fact that she couldn't do anything the most. Like a lifeless doll she could only hang in his mouth as Soarin used his hooves to pull her further in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my gosh, she thought, they were serious! Soarin sat down on his haunches as he raised his head and held Rainbow Dashs legs above so she slid down even without him swallowing. There was a small opening in the warm, dark tunnel of flesh. With a few swallows, Soarin managed to push the paralyzed pegasus head into his stomach, allowing easier access for the rest of her body. Her legs only managed to twitch weakly as they were being swallowed and eventually she completely lost contact with the air outside of Soarins mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash felt her strenght returning but she was gripped by fear. She was currently curled up inside a stomach and if the Wonderbolts were serious she'll be digested if she doesn't escape soon. Slowly she regained control of her limbs and felt around in her fleshy prison. \"Come on Rainbow Dash, you can get out of this.\" She tried to kick against the walls but the narrow space didn't really give her enough room to deliver some real kicks.</span></div></div>",

The stomach acids started to coat her from all sides and build up a pool below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash could feel a stinging, burning sensation in her eyes, nose and mouth, as well as her anus and pussy as the acids started to break her apart. \"I give up, I GIVE UP, just let me outta here!\" She wailed as the burning sensation got worse and even her skin started to itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scared pegasus screamed in pain as the stomach started to churn and rub the stinging liquid deep into her skin. Her eyes were tightly shut as her fur started to fall out. All her sensitive areas were in pain as she felt that she was being dissolved. Rainbow Dash sobbed quietly, having already given up on escaping. Her dream of becoming famous has turned into a painful nightmare as she was now digested alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way it was a weak comfort, but at least she would become part of a Wonderbolt. The pain has passed and her body went numb before her body was too damaged and she passed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Soarin was sighing in disappointment. \"It's too bad, she had such potential.\" He lamented. Spitfire gave him a pat on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but if they can't pass the test they can't handle themselves in stressful situations and probably die during one of the shows.\" Until the last moment, Spitfire hoped that Rainbow Dash could pull herself together and make it. After all, when she passed the test her fur and feathers had already fallen out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitfire looked at the others, who shook their heads as their bellies became still once more.

Now her mind was clouded with hunger and the shy pony's delectable flavor, a long \"mmmmmmm...\" being her only thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rainbow Dash actually began to suck on Fluttershy's nose, she reached up to push Rainbow away.

Fluttershy's eyes widened as she felt a sudden tightening tug on her hooves, the full meaning of Dash's actions crashing home, and she began to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was useless though, the shy pegasus no match for the rippling throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash stop it, you're <i>eating</i> me!!!\" Fluttershy cried, tears of fear and confusion dripping down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words meant nothing to the ravenous speedster, her mind filled with the desire to consume, as she swallowed Fluttershy's forelegs, the hooves they ended in bulging out her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking fully now, Fluttershy screamed and tugged at her disappearing limbs uselessly on the empty plain, her wails unheard by anyone and her struggles as ineffective as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow hungry maw and throat stretched to accommodate her pink-haired friend, her cries for her to stop and her terrified and hurt expression being met with only a hungry vacancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash please don't eat me, I'm your friend remember?, not food, I don't-\" the rest of her plea was drowned out by Dash's tummy, growling in happiness at the arrival of Fluttershy's hooves, her face now an inch from Rainbow's. Rainbow's mouth opened to take in Fluttershy's head, her nostrils flaring as she breathed around her fearful meal, her tongue lapping up her salty tears, \"mmmm\"-ing at the seasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow swallowing more quickly, Rainbow Dash pulled Fluttershy's head into her throat, her chest soon to follow, her belly and backside sticking out, back legs kicking the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInching speedily towards the shy pony's flanks, lapping at her belly as she did, Rainbow continued gobbling up her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy whimpered as her head entered her friend's belly, giggling against her will as Dash's tongue tickled her own tummy. As Rainbow gulped again, Fluttershy noticed the pleasant massage Rainbow's undulating throat was giving her, too afraid to notice earlier. \"I guess this isn't so-(squeak!)\" Fluttershy tried to say as Rainbow's busy tongue had reached her butt and pussy, lapping heedlessly at the tasty flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirming at the unexpected oral, her cheeks now reddening again, she was quickly overwhelmed by the massaging of the throat and tonguing of her previously untouched naughty parts. \"Mmmm...mmmm...mmmmmfff....aaaggghhh!!!\", Fluttershy orgasmed, juices bursting on to Dash's tongue, biting her lip cutely as she huffed through her nose, Rainbow now having her bottom fully in her mouth, ready to be gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucking down the sweet and tangy juices, her tongue lapping and throat straining at Fluttershy's meaty and ample plot, teeth continuing to nom it until it was out of reach, Rainbow gulped repeatedly to get the fat butt down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmm...\", she exclaimed as she licked at Fluttershy's tasty legs and soft tail, sucking them down like noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught between her pleasant feelings and her instinctual fear of being eaten, Fluttershy was pushed to the back of her friend's belly as more of her was consumed, the gulping sound and Dash's heartbeat background noise to her turmoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finishing her meal, Rainbow Dash slurped down Fluttershy's legs and tail, her mind began to clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first her face held a satisfied and serene expression but as the reality of her actions crashed down on her, her eyes widened in shock and she exclaimed \" Oh man, I ate Fluttershy, my belly will turn her to mush if I don't do something, I-errrpppp!\" She burped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the taste of her friend filled her mouth, she blushed and tried to explain to Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man Fluttershy, sorry for scaring you, but you were really delicious.\" She said while rubbing her bloated tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm...thanks?, can you please let me out, I don't want to become goo\" Fluttershy responded to timidly to Rainbow's muffled voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoking her tongue out and running it across her lips, she decided...</span></div></div>",

Now with gravity to assist her, and making sure nopony was coming down the hall, Rainbow Dash sat down and continued to swallow, forcing her lips over the blue baker's shoulders, beginning to get to her forelegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rainbow Dash's lips reached a quarter and a half up her forelegs, Cup Cake whimpered, outright crying when her head was pulled through the entrance to Rainbow Dash's insatiable stomach. Unable to struggle, pinned between the wall and the athletic pegasus, Cup Cake simply lamented her fate, eaten along with her children (who by now had fallen asleep in there warm enclosure) by a pony she thought of as a friend, who she had even considered as a possible foalsitter! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer throat bulging with Mrs. Cake's front legs and thick neck, and her mouth dribbling onto the floor, Rainbow Dash took a momentary break to work herself up to swallow the most problematic part of her meal: Mrs. Cake's plump belly. Though more pudgy than fat, Mrs. Cake was definitely a challenge to eat. \"<i>I live for a good challenge, Mrs. Cake is gettin' in my belly no matter what\"</i> Rainbow Dash thought, her daring attitude pushing her on further. With renewed vigor, Rainbow Dash gulped repeatedly, inching towards and over Mrs. Cake's middle inch by inch, delighting in her rich and sugary flavor all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally having stretched her jaw and throat enough, Rainbow was now able to swallow more smoothly, soon reaching Cup Cake's plump butt. Tongue slathering over every inch it could, taking in as much flavor as possible, Rainbow Dash slurped her way over Mrs. Cake's cutiemarks. Now with only the baker's back legs and swirly tail left, Rainbow Dash savored her taste, and then sucked down the last of the earth pony, sending her down to join her son and daughter in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly now huge, Rainbow Dash rubbed her gut in satisfaction and burped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

It looked as if she had swallowed a watermelon, rather than a boulder as it had before. Having fully digested the twins, and most of their mother, Rainbow Dash had gained a substantial amount of weight, though her athletic metabolism kept her from becoming truly overweight. Her fattened ass had grown truly plump now, now able to jiggle somewhat, while her stomach had a noticeable layer of pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low rumble from her intestines interrupted her evaluation of her new girth. \"Huh, guess I can finally let you out Fluttershy,\" Rainbow Dash commented as she rolled off the bed and walked into the Cakes' personal bathroom. Just before sitting down on the toilet, Rainbow Dash shook her rump and teased her friend-turned-waste, \"Alright Fluttershy, let's see if you're as fun coming out as my last meal\". Resting her plot on the toilet, Rainbow Dash felt her anus loosen with a *poot*, and the head of a long turd quickly emerged. \"Ahhh...\" Rainbow Dash moaned as the log of Fluttershy smoothly came out, inch by inch. Dipping into the water, the turd touched the bottom of the bowl and began to bend. \"Mmm, wow Fluttershy, even as my crap, you're still so soft,\" Rainbow Dash commented, the former pegasus coming out so lightly that she could barely feel it, like passing gas rather than solid waste. Reaching it's end at about 5 inches, the log slipped smoothly from Rainbow's butt-hole and into the water. Sighing at the feeling of release, Rainbow Dash felt more of Fluttershy's remains move towards her anus. The next log was much shorter, sliding out quickly into the toilet, soon followed by something much longer. This length of poop was dotted with flecks of yellow fur and pink hair, snaking out of Dash's ass and coiling into the bottom of the bowl, burying the two logs before it. Ending at over 11 inches in length, the poop curled and settled into itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash's cyan anus twitched, empty and stained with brown, with a single strand of Fluttershy's mane stuck to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash could still feel more of Fluttershy in her guts though, she wasn't done taking her dump just yet. After a couple minutes of waiting, and feeling her anus slowly tighten back up, Rainbow suddenly felt a shift of the considerable weight in her bladder, moments before her urethra opened and let out a flood of urine. Her golden stream gushed out, lasting quite a while, what with her drinking a lot of fluids for her exercise, not to mention her love of cider. The torrent of piss flowed onto the pile of shit in the toilet, steadily boring a hole in it. Just before getting halfway through the coil of waste, Rainbow's peeing slowed to a trickle for a couple moments before ending completely. \"Ahhhh,\" Rainbow sighed with relief, then gave a rub to her lower intestinal area, trying to encourage the pocket of pressure she felt there to come out. Letting out an \"Nnnngghh!\" as she pushed, Rainbow attempted to force out the last of what had once been the Bearer of Kindness. Instead of solid shit though, what came out was a short and sharp fart, like the sound of a pencil snapping, pushing out of her plot-hole and echoing faintly in the toilet bowl. After that, what followed was a maelstrom of farts, some soft, some hard, filling the bathroom with sounds of *pfffttt*, *pppwwwrrrtt*, *ppppppphhhhhh* and *ppppttttuuuuhhhffff!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Whew, I don't know if it's all ponies, other pegasi, or just Fluttershy, but what I ate gave me more gas than I've ever had!</i>\" Rainbow Dash thought during the hurricane of farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barrage of gas ended with a final *pppppfffffeeeeehhhh* hissing out of Rainbow's ass. \"Ahhhhh,\" Rainbow Dash sighed with relief as most of the pressure in her colon was released. The remaining contents of Rainbow's bowels was a solid chunk of feces, which was now filling the space the gas had just vacated. Unlike the other remains of Fluttershy, this was much harder and wider (likely being what remained of her bones), and thus did not come out, instead just poking slightly out of Dash's stretched asshole. Taking a deep breath as she felt the hard pressure at her anus, Rainbow Dash began to push. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnnnnggggg!!! *huff* hnnnnnnn!!!!\" Rainbow Dash groaned and scrunched her face up as she worked her anal muscles, putting more and more pressure on the hard piece of poop, steadily pushing it out. Her tail-hole stretching around the 7 centimeter wide and 12 centimeter long shit, Rainbow Dash clenched her teeth and began to sweat as the stretching turned painful at the halfway point of the jagged, oval-shaped turd, which stuck for a moment before popping free and splashing into the toilet. Rainbow hissed with relief as the shit left her. Rainbow Dash chuckled and commented, \"'Butt' (snicker) then again Flutters, I suppose you can be tough sometimes too...\" and farted a final time, *ppfffrrrttt*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up off the toilet seat, Rainbow Dash ripped off a few sheets of toilet paper and wiped her ass, taking care of her now sensitive pucker, rubbing the toilet paper against her protruding asshole and wet vagina, smearing it with brown waste, light yellow piss, and leaving the strand of Fluttershy's hair stuck in it. Dropping the soiled paper into the toilet with the rest of what had just that morning been one of Rainbow Dash's closest friends, Rainbow smiled at the pile of waste and stretched out a wing, putting a wingtip on the flusher. \"Well Fluttershy, looks like this is pretty much it, since the fat you and the Cakes' added won't stay for too long, I got to stay fit after all\" Rainbow Dash said as she prodded her expanded belly and butt, \"but at least you won't be alone for too long in the sewers, since thanks to you, I've found something to do that <i>might</i> be even more awesome than joining the Wonderbolts, <i>eating other ponies</i>!\" Snickering, Rainbow Dash then flushed the shit that had once been Fluttershy into the Cakes' plumbing. Still snickering, Rainbow Dash left as the sound of swirling water filled the bathroom, and was greeted as she opened the bathroom door by...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shutting the door with a bump of her rump, Pinkie Pie sat herself down in front of Rainbow Dash like a foal about to be told a story.

Somehow, I landed on Fluttershy with her hoof in my mouth, and she tasted <i>sooooooooo</i> good,\" Rainbow Dash sloppily licked her lips and began to smirk, \"that I just <i>had</i> to eat her.

(<span class=\"cpink\">But not in <i>that</i> way Misters and Misses readers! This isn't that kind of vore story!... well, at least not right now!</span>) Pinkie couldn't wait to get a chance to do it herself. Though not needing to do as much pushing now that some of Mr. Cake was in Dash's throat, Pinkie still would occasionally re-adjust or give a light nudge to him to help Rainbow Dash get him into her belly, which was starting to bulge already, outlines of her food's forelegs, chest, and head visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing Carrot Cake's belly, and after taking a long moment to lick over it's expanse to get as much of his taste before she finished this, Rainbow stuck her tongue out to extend over Carrot Cake groin and lift up his rear a little, intending to let the last of his lanky form simply tilt down her throat and into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie watched in wonder as Rainbow Dash threw her head back and gulped heavily, taking in Carrot Cake's waist, then his crotch (which she gave a few mischievous licks), then his compact rump, leaving just his soft yellow hind legs sticking out of her mouth like licorice sticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a sudden impulse, Pinkie leapt forward and popped one of Mr. Cake's legs in her mouth, sucking on it to take in his sweet and unusual flavor. Noticing Rainbow Dash shifting and mumbling \"Piinnkkkkuuh?\" in surprise, Pinkie Pie just put a hoof up to placate her and bummed at the flavor while sucking more loudly to show her meaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of tasting, Pinkie popped the leg back out and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Dashie, you can keep going!\" Pinkie said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding with an amused look, Rainbow Dash then slurped up Mr. Cake's long legs and carrot orange tail, feeling his body curl up in her gut, making it swell up once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching loudly, Rainbow Dash sat up, her belly wobbling slightly as she patted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaagggghhhh, that was great, how can ponies taste so good,\" Rainbow Dash mused with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Dashie, but Mr. Cake <i>was tasty</i>, I hope other ponies are as good!\" Pinkie said, bouncing lightly on the bed in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't you worry Pinks, they are,\" Rainbow Dash affirmed knowingly, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a voice called from downstairs, followed by the ringing of a bell. \"Hello, is anypony here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap,\" Rainbow Dash swore, shifting nervously as she received a concerning reminder they were in an active store and eating place as well as a house, \"Pinkie, can you take care of whoever it is? Eat them or get 'em to leave or whatever, and then we should probably do something so we don't get found out here, we need time to come up with a plan if we're gonna eat more ponies\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving another salute, and an, \"I'm still on it!\", Pinkie bounded down the stairs with no apparent worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her head though, Pinkie was not quite so at ease. \"<i>I hope I can think of something, I can probably  just say the Cakes are out for the rest of the day, but what am I gonna say that could make ponies stay away long enough? Maybe I should just eat whoever it is and then get Dashie and me out of here and head somewhere else, we can figure it out from there... but, if we disappear at the same time as Fluttershy and the Cakes and somepony else and only we come back later, it'll look suspicious.

Nopony has seen them since late this morning and me, AJ, and Rarity, are starting to worry.\" Twilight explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, haven't seen them, beats me!\" Pinkie lied, a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright,\" Twilight said with slight dejection, understandably believing her friend, before sighing and brightening slightly, \"well, I suppose Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash could both be off somewhere, and since I'm here I might as well have a snack\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Twilight, what do you want?\" Pinkie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Twilight started, scanning the orders above the counter, \"I'll have a few scones, 5 strawberry muffins, and 4 chocolate chip cookies... oh and a glass of lemonade\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Twilight, coming right up!\" Pinkie said before racing to put the order together, taking the muffins, scones, and cookies from their shelves and pouring out a glass of lemonade from the fridge. Setting it all down on the counter on a metal platter with plates, Pinkie nudged it towards Twilight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are!\" Pinkie sang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Pinkie Pie,\" Twilight said as she produced the bits required and payed her order, smiled as she got an idea. \"Pinkie, if you aren't going to be busy, why don't we have this together\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie thought for a moment, weighing her options on what this might mean for her and Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I suppose if I say no to her and make something up about the Cakes for her to tell everypony me and Dashie will have some more time,</i>\" Pinkie then found herself looking over Twilight's body, which was slightly chubby from her doing more reading than physical exertion, her mouth watering at her padded belly and plump flanks, \"<i>... but, then again, I could take this as an opportunity to have a snack of my own, I can show Rainbow Dash I was serious about eating ponies...</i>\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a soft sucking sound, Pinkie Pie's head was shoved into Twilight's anus, which spread and consumed it smoothly thanks to Twilight's spell, leaving it poised over her neck with only a tuft of her poofy mane sticking out. The purple pucker immediately pulled in Pinkie's neck as well, reaching her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh-hehehe-hooo....\" Twilight exclaimed, a combination of moaning and cooing at the surprisingly amazing feel of Pinkie's entrance into her sensitive butt-hole, as well as giggling at the ticklish feel of Pinkie's mane. She could also feel Pinkie attempting to struggle against her magic, which was now holding her in a slight curve up towards her anus, with all four of her legs pressed tight to her body. It was a futile effort as her magic was like steel chains, easily keeping her locked in her position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like being Pinkie isn't enough to save you this time,\" Twilight teased and giggled, hearing Pinkie's muffled attempts at a rebuttal as she sucked in her shoulders as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight then let Pinkie's immobilized body rest against the bed before gently pushing back against her, pushing Pinkie in up to her forelegs in one smooth slide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight let out a surprised moan, the feeling of fullness increasing with more of Pinkie inside her. In response to the building feelings within its neighboring cavity, Twilight's pussy began to heat up and moisten, her clitoris peaking out slightly beneath its hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I-I guess if it f-feels like t-t-this, I can understand why Rainbow D-d-dash and P-p-p-pinkie P-pie want to eat ponies... though I sh-sh-should probably see if it feelsss this goo-ooooo-d done through the mouth and eso-ohh-phaah-gus to be suuure,\" Twilight wondered aloud shakily, her words intermingled with moans and hums of pleasure, her arousal increasing as Pinkie's stomach entered her colon, with her shortened intestine having just pushed Pinkie Pie's head up through her intestinal sphincter and into her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vagina now dripping steadily on to Pinkie's bed, Twilight decided to give direct attention to it, her magic forming into soft masses, which she then started rubbing against her sex-lips, fanning the heat inside her core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf somepony were to be looking at Twilght's stomach, they would be able to see the bulge of Pinkie's head, even see an imprint of Pinkie's terrified expression pressing out of her flesh. Looking lower, somepony could see the outlines of Pinkie Pie's forelegs bulging out of her intestines as they were shuffled along to enter the stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the outside, only Pinkie's lower body and downward remained unconsumed, Twilight's tail having come to rest slightly on it, while mostly being raised up to allow easy consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another tug, Twilight's butt pulled in Pinkie's lower body, leaving her much chubbier booty sticking out of Twilight's, with her forelegs and tail lying back against the bed, her tail dipping slightly into the puddle of Twilight's fluids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Twilight had moved from using her magic on her outer lips to directly running it over her clit and inner lips, building even more towards her climax. Biting her lip, Twilight now could barely resist screaming in pleasure, the thought of alerting Rainbow Dash (who she suspected was close by) or anypony who might still be downstairs the only thing keeping her from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Twilight encased her and Pinkie in a soundproof bubble of magic, then let out the scream that had been rapidly building in her throat. As a consequence of focusing her magic in so many different ways at once while not having full concentration, the magic holding Pinkie in place faded, and with Twilight too focused on hovering at the edge of a mind-blowing orgasm to cast a more independent paralysis spell, Pinkie Pie's legs began to kick and squirm, flailing impotently and making creaks (thankfully inaudible outside of the bubble) whenever they hit the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*pant, pant, hum*, I think it *pant* is time I *pant* finish this little experiment,\" Twilight said, deciding to stop magically stimulating herself and finish both Pinkie and her arousal in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting her hips and lifting her tail as high as it would go, Twilight gave a solid, forceful sit onto the remaining parts of Pinkie outside of her ass, forcing her back legs and poofy tail to curl up against her butt as they were forced against the bed. For a moment, Pinkie's butt seemed to pause at entering Twilight's, before suddenly entering with a heavy *pop*, Twilight's ravenous anus stretching sharply over Pinkie Pie's buttcheeks and thighs. Now, about half of Pinkie was in Twilight's stomach, while the other was in the intestines, with only her tail and calves left to be pressed into Twilight's buttcrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe electrifying feeling of suddenly consuming Pinkie's fat ass into her own, coupled with Pinkie's soft tail hair rubbing against her slit, drove Twilight over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-P-Pinkie..... ahhh.... nngggaaauggghhh!!!\" Twilight howled as she came, her femcum spurting out to soak Pinkie's tail like a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, Twilight let herself fall forward face-first into Pinkie's bed, the afterglow of her orgasm leaving her euphoric. On some vague notion, Twilight gave a light shove to Pinkie's hooves with her magic while sucking inward with her anus, the combination pulling Pinkie's tail and lower legs in with a soft *slurp*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her ecstasy faded and Pinkie Pie was being rapidly pulled into her belly, Twilight's thoughts turned to Rainbow Dash, and what she should do about her...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Channeling it into a Seeking spell, designed to radiate out and alert the caster when it hit whatever it was crafted to find (similar to a sonar wave), Twilight set it to find \"Rainbow Dash\", focusing on every detail of her friend-turned-cannibal, before sending it out, imperceptible to all but the caster, a sphere of expanding pink growing from her horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a little more than a minute, Twilight's horn flashed and a small twinkle of magic migrated down her horn and into her head. Instantly, Twilight Sparkle knew just where Rainbow Dash was, in the Cakes' bedroom, and on the bed itself, likely sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping off the bed, Twilight trotted out of Pinkie's room and towards the Cakes'. Twilight felt the magic on her backdoor fade as the last of Pinkie was shuttled into her belly, saying softly to herself, \"Ready or not Rainbow Dash, here I come...\", and licked her lips with a feral grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Creak*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the door, Rainbow Dash woke (slightly) from her food coma, her vision and thoughts blurry from her heavy rest.

The bolt impacted her face, which showed a flicker of surprise before going slack. Rainbow Dash's head then slumped against her bulging belly (which let out a low gurgle in response) the pegasus completely unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Twilight walked up to the bed and got up on to it, standing on all four of her hooves. \"Perfect, this is actually more fun than I thought it would be, I hope nopony takes issue with me doing this...\" she mused aloud as she lifted Rainbow Dash's bloated form up as she turned around and presented her enchanted nether regions to Rainbow's head and began to pull her towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueaking and blushing when she felt the tip of Rainbow's snout touch her sex-lips, Twilight began to push Dash into her marehood, which allowed her in with the ease of a carnivorous plant to an unlucky fly. Twilight's pussy was hungry, and Rainbow Dash was its prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rainbow Dash's snout entered her secret place, Twilight felt a sharp tingle of arousal jolt through her body, having to bite her lip to keep herself from moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft and wet sound, Rainbow Dash's head and shoulders entered, and with a contraction from the lips, were swiftly followed by her upper-forelegs, the natural fluids easing their entrance exponentially compared to her earlier feeding by anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nearly bit hard enough to bring blood, her nethers felt <i>on fire</i> with pleasure and need, the delicious heat coinciding with a drive to get Rainbow Dash deeper... to take her... <i>consume</i> her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow acting as if they were an actual pair of lips and a mouth, Twilight's vagina began sucking and nibbling at Rainbow, the flesh surrounding the entrance seeming to almost chew her inside, pulling her in smoothly until reaching her pony-filled belly, the rumbling obstruction getting smeared with Twilight's lubrication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing her vagina's problem, and forgoing the use of her bubble spell, Twilight carefully grabbed a trio of pillows from the head of the bed with her magic and set them at the foot in front of her. Clustering them together and fluffing them, Twilight pressed her face into the softness, making sure her mouth was covered. Raising her rump higher, Twilight gripped Rainbow Dash's form with her magic, and <i>shoved</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSufficiently muffled, Twilight's ear-shattering shriek of pleasure roared out into the pillows, while Rainbow's belly entered Twilight's canal with a wet and meaty *schhhluuuk!*, a dribble of fluid landing on the bedspread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilgiht was now drooling from both ends, her tongue and vagina alike leaking thick syrup onto the pillows and blankets, and her eyes rolling mindlessly. Through her overwhelming sensations though, Twilight noticed something amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I-I haven't cum.... not even close, I should have, but I didn't... it feels like something's holding me back from orgasming, while my arousal just keeps climbing?!</i>\" Twilight thought with a mix of frustration and elation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Rainbow's fattened behind and muscular legs, as well as her prismatic tail, were all that remained outside of Twilight's hungry nethers, being pulled in more leisurely now that most of her was where she belonged. As for the rest of her, her head now rested inside Twilight's... womb-stomach?..., while her massive gut and forelegs bulged out Twilight's lower body, giving her underside a new distinct lump alongside Pinkie Pie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every delicious inch that entered now, Twilight's arousal shot up another notch. Her body now felt absolutely euphoric, her every nerve firing with erotic signals. Her clit, while before had been winking more and more steadily, now bulged out from under its hood, unable to be hidden from how hard and engorged it had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all that remained of Rainbow was the last quarter of her tail, Twilight began to feel a sudden surge of drowsiness, her eyes getting heavy as she began to sink into her pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What? Why am I-... my body must be doing what Rainbow's was, making me sleep to ease digestion, but, I still haven't climaxed... I can't fall asleep yet!

During her sleep, Twilight would occasionally burp and fart out the air dragged in with Pinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Twilight's stomach, Pinkie had at this point lost conciousness, now left unaware of the bubbling acids that started to rise around her, the stomach grinding and rubbing them into her to break her down into fuel for its owner. Within 20 minutes, Pinkie's fur and hair had been melted off, turning the clear acids a rosy hue, and portions of were quickly burned into, letting the acids into her body and ending her life before Twilight had even begun to belch out the remaining air brought in by her meal as she continued to sleep. A half hour going by left Pinkie as nothing more than hunks of soupy meat and fragmented bone, which rapidly began to break down into a thick soup over the remaining 10 minutes of Twilight's sleep, being easily sucked into Twilight's intestines for nutritional absorption. Being as fat laden and oddly energetic as she was, Pinkie left a lot of excess energy for Twilight's body to process, which was rapidly converted into fat on Twilight's belly, thighs, face, and rump. Twilight's body quickly gained mass, her cheeks puffing up slightly, her belly receiving a thick layer of padding, and her thighs and rump gaining an inch and a half of thickness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Rainbow Dash in Twilight's stomach-like womb/uterus, she had never woken from Twilight's stun spell, Twilight's internal muscles depositing her smoothly into her uterus, which began secreting a magically formed fluid that would convert its occupant into nothing but thick orgasmic honey. Over the rough hour Twilight slept, Rainbow Dash became softer and softer, at first her form melting in parts like running taffy, then more of her melting quickly, like a popsicle under a heat lamp. Rainbow Dash's, fur, mane, and tail melted the quickest, absorbing the flesh, organs, and bones as they melted next, their visceral colors paling the polychromatic syrup surrounding them. In a partial reversal of its intended purpose, Twilight's transfigured reproductive organ had swiftly reduced a full grown pony into just blue-and-rainbow hued sexual substance, the thick fluid filling the chamber like a water-ballon filled with goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both processes finishing their final stages, Twilight woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ughhh... did I eat too much pie again?</i>\" Twilight thought drowsily as she sat up, her now pudgier belly jiggling, and her womb, full of Rainbow Dash's sticky remains, sloshing faintly.

Pleased overall at the results of her making Pinkie into her buttfood, Twilight turned to her nethers, curious at the outcome of eating a pony with her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the slosh in her lower abdomen, Twilight was uncertain of what had happened to Rainbow Dash, so gently brushed her magic against her slit to try to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh-aahhhggghhh!!!!\" Twilight howled, her nethers turning hot with bliss at the minor touch, and released a slight splurt of Rainbow cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Rainbow must've been reduced to a semi-solid unique form of my ejaculate, and the process and earlier near-orgasm seems to have severely heightened my  arousal, and I've never been able to produce so much fluid before...</i>\" Twilight thought, huffing and panting, as she looked at the colorful blotch on Pinkie Pie's bedspread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Twilight could consider what to do next, the poop Pinkie Pie had become fully heaped up at the end of her digestive tract, causing her body to signal Twilight that she needed to get to the bathroom, <i>NOW</i>!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Eeep!), guess I need to complete Pinkie's trip through my digestive system,\" Twilight said to herself before racing out of Pinkie's room and to the upstairs bathroom in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeee-eeee-eeee-eeeee! Ahhhh!\" Twilight squeaked, as the simple motions of running made slight shocks of heat surge through her excited sex, causing her to clench her hind legs with each trot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDashing in and sitting down on the toilet, and sighing in relief as the cold seat soothed her burning nethers, Twilight felt her anus loosen and begin to release her former friend into the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing to emerge was a ball of waste clogged with the largest and most solid patches of Pinkie Pie's hair, tail, and mane. The sticky snarl of hair and waste being pushed out slowly before dropping silently into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a 7 inch long turd, dotted with bits of fur and mane/tail, and containing digestion-smoothed shards of bone, squeezing out of Twilight's plot and plopping down to the water. \"Mmmmphh!\" Twilight groaned through her lips, as her bowels emptied themselves of pony remnants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA similar, yet longer and thicker log came next, the pleasure of release hitting Twilight full force now as it stretched her pucker wide open. This also had a rather potent side-effect though, as the pleasure in her tail-hole was triggering the built-up pressure in her womb and pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh-aahhh-feeeeelsssss soooo g-gooa-auugghhh!!\" Twilight moaned out, the mix of sexual pleasure and relief being overtaken by the former, causing her to clench her anus and cut the log in two, with the part that had already started to coil into the toilet falling with a light *splish*, the other half now trapped in her anus as her body tightened up, the ecstasy of orgasm flooding her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless of the possibility of being heard, Twilight Sparkle screamed in mindless bliss as a mind-shattering climax rocked her senses, unprecedented levels of endorphins filling her brain. Along with the explosion of pleasure, her cunt released an explosion of a more... substantial type. The sticky Rainbow Dash cum/womb goo, sprayed from Twilight's vagina like water from a faucet set on high, hitting the toilet water and the waste in it with a *sploosh*, swirling them around. The cyan and rainbow colored syrup flowed on and on from the thick purple lips of Twilight's sex, which were spread wide from the force as her vaginal muscles squeezed it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of being in her personal nirvana, Twilight snapped back to consciousness (and wiped off the embarrassing bit of drool that had leaked from her lolling tongue onto her chin) and looked between her legs. Seeing that the flow was not stopping, and that the water, Pinkie Pie poop, and Rainbow Dash cum mix was rising close to the rim, Twilight Sparkle grabbed the flush with her magic and turned it, clearing the bowl as the first half of Pinkie's remains, and more than that of Rainbow's, were sucked into the toilet and down to the Ponyville sewage system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's flow of honey was still going, being sucked away as the flushing ended, and even mixing with the new water as it filled up the bowl, leaving it at a little over half-full before a final moan from Twilight and a large spurt signaled the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...,\" Twilight sighed in relief, the shifting weight in her abdomen and the confined orgasm having been dealt with. Her intestines groaned and began to squeeze out their contents again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, time to take care of Pinkie Pie, now that that's over...\" Twilight mumbled to herself, before giving a light push with her anal muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body's response was a long stinky *pppppwwwwwwwrrrrrrtttttttttt!*, a re-emergence of the remaining half of the earlier turd, and a last spurt of cum that splashed on to the descending waste. The remaining few inches of poop dropped from Twilight's plothole into the pool of water and cum, and was immediately followed by a mix of short and loud farts and a couple small lumps of waste plopping into the toilet. With a relax of her bladder adding urine into the mess, Twilight was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a low moan of relief at having completely emptied herself of the remains of her traitorous friends, Twilight hopped off the toilet and grabbed a few squares of toilet paper to clean off first her anus and then vagina. The  toilet paper brushed against Twilight's pucker, collecting greasy smears of poo and a couple of tufts of Pinkie's hair, and what met with her nethers soaked up urine and Rainbow Dash stains. Throwing the paper into the toilet, Twilight turned to look at the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(giggle) Wow, you two certainly made a mess, I can't believe eating ponies could be this great. If only you hadn't discovered this by eating Fluttershy and the Cakes though Rainbow Dash...\" Twilight said, both sad and angry, her ears drooping and her expression darkening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was about to flush, a thought occurred to her, she might need evidence of her \"punishment\". Grimacing and giving an \"Ewww...\", Twilight reached her magic into the toilet and formed it into a pair of scoops to collect samples of the Pinkie Pie waste and Rainbow Dash goo, and deposited them into two conjured bottles (which she then sealed <i>tightly</i>). That done, Twilight Sparkle flushed her two former friends down to the sewers entirely with only a single disgusted glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two bottles of ex-pony in her magic, Twilight Sparkle washed her hooves in the sink.

Derpy's tail was folded against her butt in Pinkie's mouth, with her legs pointing up like a pair of chopsticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking and seeing her predicament (and not realizing Pinkie had caused it), Derpy blushed and said, \"Uhhh, Pinkie, can you put your head down so I can reach the floor? I can probably just pull myself out then,\" reasoning that she could get out easily if she could get her hooves down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Pinkie had a very different idea. She gulped hard, sending Derpy's plot into her throat, which made a large oval-shaped bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie Pie, what are you doing?! Is this some kind of wacky thing? Spit me out, quick!\" Derpy said worriedly, picking up quickly on what would happen if Pinkie continued to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling internally at Derpy missing the truth of her intentions, Pinkie Pie swallowed again, and again, and <i>again</i>, rapidly pulling Derpy in, from her waist, to her back legs and midriff, and then her wings and chest in quick gulps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Derpy do two things: A) realize Pinkie, for whatever kooky reason, was actually <i>trying to eat her</i>, and B) panic over the previous realization. She immediately began to thrash and kick as best she could, but with most of her body pinned so tightly and her hooves having nothing to grab or push on in her upward position, she couldn't do much. Suddenly, she remembered she could still scream, and sucked in as big a breath as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE-MMMMPPphhh?!\" Derpy started, before suddenly a ripping sound filled the air and a strip of duct tape covered her mouth. Looking down, she saw Pinkie putting a large roll of duct tape back into her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResuming her swallowing, Pinkie took in Derpy's chest and wings fully, and with another swallow, her forelegs, which she pinned before Derpy could think to hit her or push against her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting herself around in Pinkie's insides so she could face Pinkie's eyes, Derpy squirmed uncomfortably and showed Pinkie her teary-eyed and scared expression. Her response was a cheeky wink and another swallow. Derpy Hooves had now been swallowed up to her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wow, Derpy tastes really good, but not like muffins, more like white chocolate... with a hint of strawberry...</i>\" Pinkie thought as she swallowed Derpy past her head, leaving her lips to frame Derpy's face. Taking a moment to remove the tape from her mouth, Pinkie swallowed Derpy down completely, finishing her in two long gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Derpy's settled into her gut, Pinkie Pie licked her lips and let out a loud belch. \"Mmm-mmm! Dashie was right, Derpy was even tastier than Mr. Cake! I'm so <i>totally</i> glad I asked to do this with her!... I should probably go check on the customers and Rainbow\" Pinkie said to herself, patting her ballooned and squirming gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrotting out to the main room, Pinkie looked over the counter to see the few customers that had been there were gone, having finished their snacks or gone outside to the outdoor tables. The only ponies left were Flitter and Cloudchaser (a pair of near identical female pegasus twins, both differing shades of purple-blue and with differently-styled blue-white manes and tails), and Caramel (a smooth and light brown earth pony stallion with a dark brown mane), who had just come in. The ponies had been idling in a haphazard line and didn't notice Pinkie's gut for the brief moment before she went behind the counter, and moved up to a more ordered arrangement when they saw her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Pinkie, can I have a lemon smoothie and a few donuts with creme filling and chocolate sprinkles?\" Caramel asked as he went up to the counter first, depositing some bits for the purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving the \"Out to lunch\" sign (and making sure her gut didn't show through the display portion of the counter), Pinkie chirped, \"Sure!\" and in a flash put it all together, secretly thankful she and the Cakes took time in the mornings to make most of what ponies would want ahead of time before they opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Pinkie!\" Caramel said happily, going out to eat at one of the tables outside, preferring the fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Pinkie Pie\" Flitter greeted, her sister giving an accompanying, \"How you doin' Pinkie\" as they both approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing just the best! I had a really really really nice lunch...\" Pinkie Pie said happily, enjoying Derpy's now frenzied squirming in her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Anyway, can we have a choclate-vanilla swirl cake with peanut butter icing, large enough to share between us?\" Flitter said, putting down the bits required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comin' right up!\" Pinkie Pie said, getting out the cake and putting it on a plate on the counter, then asking, \"for here or should I get a box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here if that's alright,\" Cloudchaser answered, licking her lips at the sight of the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is, here you-\" Pinkie started to say as she moved the plate towards them, when a sudden groan from her stomach sounded out, signaling Derpy was beginning to digest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie blushed and put a hoof to her stomach, both worried that the increasing gurgles, moans, and churns from her stomach would make ponies ask questions, and thankful they covered the screams from the digesting pegasus inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stuff yourself again Pinkie?\" Flitter asked with a raised eyebrow, not bothering to look over the counter at how big Pinkie's gut really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah! You know me! There were some extras from what we made today and I didn't want 'em to go to waste!\" Pinkie said, slipping smoothly into the provided excuse, giggling and smiling as she normally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you overdid it a bit\" Flitter commented, while her sister said, \"Sounds like you went further than usual even for you!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a hoof to the back of her head in faked embarrassment (in reality, now that her moment of worry had passed, she was enjoying the ignorance of other ponies to the truth, and digesting Derpy was starting to really feel good too), Pinkie Pie said, \"Eh, maybe a little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're going to go to one of the tables, see you around!\" Flitter and Cloudchaser said in unison, and began to walk away from the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait girls!\" Pinkie said suddenly, getting an idea on what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Pinkie?\" Cloudchaser asked, both pegasi turning back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go upstairs to relax and nap for a bit, and I need you girls to do a couple things for me when you leave, in case I sleep too long,\" Pinkie said, deciding she could use some time with Rainbow Dash while they digested their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Pinkie, what do you need?\" Flitter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Cakes are going to be out for a while, they didn't say how long, so they can go check on a couple new orders coming up, and they took the twins with them so they can have a play-date with a friend and their foals. They said I can choose whether I run the store or not until they get back, and I want to close after you two are done, so can you please tell everypony you can for me and lock the door when you go out?\" Pinkie Pie lied, hopefully that would cover the Cakes being gone for a few days to maybe a week, and she knew Derpy was enough of a loner nopony would notice her missing until much later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Pinkie...\" Flitter agreed, though she exchanged a confused look with her sister at Pinkie's sudden request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Just turn the lock before you shut the door and put up this sign,\" Pinkie Pie said, hoofing over a sign reading \"Sorry everypony, we're closed\" as she moved out from behind the counter. This exposed her bulging belly to the sisters, who blinked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could comment, Pinkie Pie had bounced up to the stairs, which sent her gut bouncing like a basketball, and gave a casual, \"Enjoy your food girls!\", before she raced up them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pinkie Pie walked down to the Cakes' room, she could feel her belly grind and massage at Derpy's body inside, starting to melt her into mush to drain away. Giggling, Pinkie trotted into the bedroom, seeing Dashie now sleeping on her slightly softer gut like it was a bean bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Glurg! Burble! Glorp!* went Rainbow Dash's tummy, working forcefully at the lanky baker inside it, while her intestines filtered the rest of Cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in answer, Pinkie Pie's own belly grumbled in kind, making a momentary symphony of stomach noises. Pinkie's giggling at this was interrupted by a burp, which was followed by a sleepy *Urrrlp* from Rainbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling wide enough to almost split her face, Pinkie hopped onto the bed with Rainbow Dash, pushing her over gently to make room, and taking care to avoid waking her, then rollied onto her side to press her own swollen stomach against Rainbow's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Yawn, Burp* I'm so glad you let me join you Dashie, this is even more fun than you made it sound...\" Pinkie said to her sleeping friend, snuggling their full bellies together as she joined her in sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth stomachs' owners now asleep, the digestive process began to ramp up even further.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their guts had now truly shrunken down... for the moment at least, nutrients from the Cakes and Derpy circulating through Rainbow Dash's and Pinkie Pie's bodies, giving energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was too much to use though left behind fat, Rainbow Dash gaining a thin layer of additional chub to her belly from Mr. Cake, leaving her with a prominent, but small, pot belly, Mr. Cake's lanky form not adding any more than that. Pinkie had (despite having a near equally active lifestyle and metabolism to Rainbow's) gained more fat, noticeable even through what chub already existed on her body. Derpy hadn't been fat, but she was a larger pegasus than most, more stocky and thickly-built, and that was reflected in the mass that Pinkie's body had taken from her, new layers of fat added to Pinkie's belly making it stick out about 3 more inches, while her chubby ass had become plump enough to obscure a view of her head from behind. Interestingly, Pinkie's Earth Pony physiology had taken the rest of the additional pony-meal that would have been added to Pinkie's back and legs, and converted it into muscle rather than fat, Pinkie's legs now thicker yet more solid, noticeable packs of muscle that would bulge prominently were she to flex. There were similar changes to her back, making it more tough yet sleek-looking, like polished wood. This gave Pinkie an oddly appealing blend of hardiness and plush, making her look simultaneously more ample and soft yet also like she had taken up a serious training regimen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body deciding it was done sleeping, Rainbow was the first to rouse from her nap, yawning and smacking her lips, smirking when she saw Pinkie cuddling into her like she was her pillow, as well as her bigger form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to let Pinkie Pie wake up on her own, Rainbow Dash...</span></div></div>",

Her nose wrinkled, \"Whew Dashie, guess the Cakes gave you some nasty gas!\" she said, fanning her face with a hoof and sniggered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash chuckled as well, sitting up and answering, \"Yeah, I think I need to take care of the twins and Mrs. Cake,\" and rubbed her lower abdomen, \"it feels kinda heavy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rainbow Dash moved off the bed, Pinkie Pie's bottom let out a fart equal to Dash's own, though more bubbling, *Pwrshlltt!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie blushed. \"I guess Derpy needs to leave too...\" Pinkie said, then after a moment, lit up, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that \"light-bulb\" look, Rainbow Dash asked, \"What's your idea Pinks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Instead of us using the bathroom one after the other, 'cause I don't know about you Rainbow but I'm not sure I can wait much longer *ppptttt!*, why don't we use it together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie, how-\" but before Rainbow Dash could finish, Pinkie had rushed into the Cakes' personal bathroom, leaving the door open so Rainbow Dash could see her sit down on the toilet. Unlike what somepony would do normally though, Pinkie twisted herself around so she was facing backwards, her front to the back of the toilet, and turned her head around to look back to her partner in crime. \"Now, you come up and sit against my back, and we can let out our meals together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash rolled her eyes, \"Random idea Pinkie, but sure, let's do it...\" and moved into the bathroom with her. Pinkie Pie scooted forward a bit, Rainbow Dash taking up the space as she sat down, facing the door. Rainbow Dash's tail hung over the left side of the toilet, Pinkie's on the right. Both leaned forward a bit to aim into the toilet, their back fur rubbing together and their anuses and nethers opening up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash was the first to start their dump, her tight blue pucker quivering with a sharp *pooot*, and the head of a turd peeking out, squeezing out to a couple inches before Pinkie Pie's rosy pink butt-hole let out a turd of its own. Rainbow's log was long and riddled with cream and yellow colored fur, curling up in the toilet to over 7 inches, while Pinkie Pie's was thicker and shorter, with nothing unusual in it. Rainbow's turd coiled out into the bowl with a faint *plup* and Pinkie's splashed down nearly at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Rainbow letting out a quick and short burst of gooey shit followed by a long and fat log, containing a few clumps of brown, orange, and pink hair, with patters of blue fur, Rainbow's anus stretching both painfully and pleasurably as it slowly pushed out to coil with its predecessor. Rainbow let out a few grunts and moans, and a strained, \"Come on!\" as her digestive track forced out the remains of her earlier pony meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie on the other hoof, let out a silent fart before her tailhole simply opened wide and began pouring out a ceaseless rush of small logs and lumps into the toilet. Some were partly connected, some were not. Some contained gray fur and/or feathers or blonde hairs, some were just light brown waste. On and on, with bursts of loud and heavy gas mixed in, the remains of Derpy Hooves plopped into the bowl, which by now was more waste than water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their butts did their work, the two mares' vaginas let loose as well, Pinkie Pie's stream of urine being slightly darker than Rainbow's, splashing onto the growing pile of shit below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final toot and log from Pinkie Pie and the tail-end of Rainbow Dash's long turd slipping out of her anus, the two ponies finished their joint bowel movement. All in all, it had taken them around 10 minutes in total, with the last part taking up 2 or so of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Pinkie Pie, that was actually kinda fun,\" Rainbow Dash said, grinning as she hopped off the toilet and wiped her soiled cheeks and vagina clean then tossed the paper in, while Pinkie Pie twisted completely around (somehow without changing the way her lower half was facing) and looked into the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Dashie,\" Pinkie Pie said, her eyes widening in awe, \"between the two of us, we made those ponies into a lot of pony poop\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie was right, the combined discarded mass from Pound, Pumpkin, and Cup Cake, along with Derpy Hooves, had filled the toilet just a few inches short of the rim with stinky brown waste, interspersed with the occasional bit of mane, fur, and pegasus feathers. Urine had dug trenches in the poop, forming pools in its surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash chuckled darkly and agreed, \"Yeah Pinkie Pie, we did... so, you gonna get off the toilet and wipe or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, yes!\" Pinkie Pie said, spinning around on the seat and bouncing off it, ripping off a few sections of toilet paper with her hoof and rubbing them against her soiled plot-hole and slit, then dropped it onto the pile of poop. Looking in the bowl again, Pinkie Pie frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Dashie, I'm not sure if they're gonna flush, the toilet might be clogged...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash rubbed her chin with a hoof thoughtfully then shrugged, \"Maybe. Maybe not Pinkie, only one way to find out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Rainbow Dash's point, Pinkie Pie put her hoof to the lever, and flushed the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water rushed and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She pulled her in deeper and deeper, the large bulge formed on her underside sliding up into her stomach, where Rainbow Dash was now kept inside of to be digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitty let out a satisfied sigh, she also realized that this will definately fatten up her ass and make it look nice, she giggled and rubbed her belly before trotting off with her new meal digesting inside her, enjoying the last bit of kicking and pushing inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour has passed, the struggling has been gone and the buldge as well, Spitty knew well that Rainbow was now a part of her fat, and hopefully mostly a part of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delightful experience was constantly on her mind, it was all too good, she felt like she wanted to do it again, and as if on cue her stomach growls, already hungry for more ponies, it was settled for her, she wanted to have more. She decides to go after..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Spitfire felt nauseated at the large object squirming around in her behind, stretching out the tight walls to impossible proportions. The pony's entire body was lodged inside of her\u2019s-- half in her intestines, and half in her stomach. Rainbow Dash was definitely a fighter, and started wiggling with fury immediately, only serving to push herself further into Spitfire\u2019s tight ass.  <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cStop\u2026 squirming\u2026 damn it!\u201d</span> She yelled, sweating. Eventually, her body betrayed her, as it decided that the best way to get rid of the blockage in her rear was to drag it into her stomach to be digested. With this, her rear muscles began working autonomously, pulling Rainbow Dash into the moist, hot confines of her derriere. Eventually, Rainbow Dash\u2019s tail sunk deep between the athlete\u2019s firm plot cheeks, effectively plunging her entire body into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitfire tried to focus on getting the mare out of her before it was too late, but she being too bombarded with sensation. Her thoughts blurred together as her ability to think rationally was dulled by pleasure. It became impossible to concentrate. She had to admit-- this was the best thing she\u2019d ever felt. Every single tiny motion the mare inside her made sent ripples of pleasure coursing through her veins, making her shudder violently. All she could do was let go of her concerns and arch her back, raising her rear end in the air, enjoying the other mare\u2019s descent into her like gut. Spitfire was panting by the time Rainbow Dash was finally deposited entirely within her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rainbow Dash was even more uncomfortable with the events. Disoriented and confused, she had no idea what happened to her or where she was, only knowing that she was being restrained by something. At first she thought that it was somepony grabbing her, until she realized it was around her entire body. She finally opened her eyes, and saw fleshy pink walls squeezing down around her, slowly fitting tightly around her body. The walls seemed to knead a strange liquid against her skin, which itched and even burned slightly. It was so moist, it was like she had entered a sauna-- made even worse by the fact that she could hardly move a muscle. The smell in the air was pungent. Terrified and confused by all of this, she squirmed with renewed vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Spitfire, the feeling of a mare squirming in her stomach felt slightly less pleasurable than the feeling of a mare squirming in her butt, which allowed her to calm down a bit-- but as she did, she began to be gripped by panic. Lying on her back, she looked up at her now impossibly massive gut, Rainbow Dash\u2019s hooves leaving imprints on the side. <i>Oh no</i>, she thought to herself. If Spitfire didn't get her out soon, she was going to be digested in there! Why did this have to happen to her? She wouldn't be sent to the dungeon for digesting the mare, because it was technically not her fault, but how was she going to explain this to anypony? Rumors would abound that Spitfire was some kind of pervert that shoved Rainbow Dash up her plot on purpose, and nopony would want to associate with her anymore, for fear of sharing the same fate. She might even lose her job at the academy! She couldn\u2019t let that happen. She had to get help.</span></div></div>",

As she soared into the sky, high up enough that ponies on the ground wouldn\u2019t notice her huge belly, she tried to decide on her next course of action. Spitfire was baffled by her situation. Perhaps it would be better to be more discrete about this, but she just couldn\u2019t deal with this alone. She had to tell somepony. With that, she began making a beeline for the house of one of her fellow wonderbolts, <a onclick=\"$('#dropNote1').toggle (200);\" style=\"cursor:pointer;color:#0000ff;\" title=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Fleetfoot.</span> <span style=\"font-size:8pt;opacity:.75;text-decoration:none;\">\u25bc</span></a><div id=\"dropNote1\" style=\"padding:0px;display:none;\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Fleetfoot\" target=\"_blank\">http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Fleetfoot</a></div>  Fleetfoot was the wonderbolt she was best acquainted with, mostly as she was around equal to Spitfire in skill level, so they\u2019ve been locked in a bit of a friendly competition for a while now. Today, however, Spitfire was coming to her on different terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked on Fleetfoot\u2019s front door, shifting nervously as she waiting, anticipating the worst. A short but athletic light blue pegasus answered, looking curious upon seeing the look on Spitfire\u2019s face. This was obviously serious. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOh, hey--\u201d</span> Fleetfoot greeted, before gasping upon seeing her bulging stomach. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhoa, Spitfire! Are you pregnant?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cUh\u2026 well, no. Can we talk about this inside?\u201d</span> Spitfire asked, her voice almost a whisper. Fleetfoot stepped aside as Spitfire waddled slowly into the house, looking humiliated. She laid down on her back on the sofa, her belly in the air, Rainbow Dash\u2019s squirms subsiding somewhat. Fleetfoot sat on the other end of the couch, staring at her friend\u2019s belly curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cSo, uh. Are you gonna tell me what that\u2019s all about?\u201d</span> Fleetfoot asked, wide-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYeah\u2026 but you have to swear not to tell anypony, okay?\u201d</span> Spitfire demanded, finally acting a little more assertive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cCross my heart,\u201d</span> Fleetfoot nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWell\u2026 I was down visiting Ponyville, and this mare who was flying around got knocked out of the sky fell\u2026 well, right into my plot,\u201d</span> Spitfire explained sheepishly, so low she could hardly be heard. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAnd\u2026 now she\u2019s stuck inside of me.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitfire started nervously at the other mare, waiting for a response, but all she got was a few moments of silence followed by a simple, <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOh.\u201d </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201c'Oh'? Is that all you have to say?\u201d</span> Spitfire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019ve heard of this kind of thing happening before, but I never thought it\u2019d happen around here.\u201d</span> Fleetfoot said, a bit stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018this kind of thing\u2019? This has happened before?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYeah, every once in awhile I hear about somepony \u2018eating\u2019 a pony like this\u2026 but I\u2019ve never heard of it happening on accident,\u201d</span> Fleetfoot muttered, looking down at her friend\u2019s huge belly, a bit dizzy at the thought that there\u2019s an entire pony squirming around in there. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cCan I\u2026 can I feel it?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cUhh\u2026 sure,\u201d</span> Spitfire shrugged, as Fleetfoot sat on her haunches and started curiously prodding and rubbing her belly with her forehooves. It was a little weird, but Spitfire had to admit, a good belly rub did help soothe her aching stomach. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cIf this has happened before, how do they usually get them out?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThey don\u2019t. They usually get digested.\u201d</span> Fleetfoot said, as she pressed an ear against Spitfire\u2019s belly trying to hear the mare inside. It was futile-- Rainbow Dash\u2019s protests were completely muffled by the thick stomach walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t want to digest anypony!\u201d</span> Spitfire yelled, jumping up, and Fleetfoot stepped back, startled. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWe have to get her out!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWhoa, whoa, alright, don\u2019t panic!\u201d</span> Fleetfoot reassured her, trying to calm her down. She rubbed her chin with her hoof as she contemplated the situation. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cI\u2019ll think of something...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Fleetfoot comes up with a solution.</span></div></div>",

You just have to put this all behind you.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitfire tries to respond, but she can\u2019t find the words. She just looks down at her stomach, thinking of the mare inside. Now that she had taken the time to consider things, she realized that nopony had actually witnessed what had happened. Nopony would know about the mare\u2019s fate except for her and Fleetfoot. Plus, something about the idea of digesting another pony was just\u2026 exciting, for some reason. She had to admit, feeling the mare squirm inside of her plot, while confusing, was one of the best things she ever felt, and she never wanted to let the mare out of her stomach. It was the mare's fault, after all-- she should have paid more attention to where she was flying. She was just food now. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAlright\u2026 alright,\u201d</span> Spitfire relented, breathlessly. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cBut you\u2019re going to help me through this.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNo problem! Wait right here, I\u2019ll draw a nice bath,\u201d</span> Fleetfoot promises as she trots away, sounding perhaps overly enthusiastic. Eventually, the pegasus returned, and helped Spitfire hobble to a large, warm bathtub that was lit only by candles and filled with bath oil that smelled sweetly of lavender. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHere, this will help calm you down,\u201d</span> Fleetfoot says as she helps her friend into the tub.  Spitfire laid on her back in the large bath, her gurgling belly just poking out of the water. She closed her eyes, and felt the most relaxed she has in years. The bath itself was nice, but something about having another living creature inside of her belly was uniquely satisfying. Perhaps it was maternal instinct? She had never been a mother-- maybe this is kinda like what being pregnant felt like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOhhh\u2026 this is nice,\u201d</span> Spitfire sighed, content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cGood. Over the next 12 hours, your body will slowly turn the mare to fat,\u201d</span> Fleetfoot explains, sounding proud of her plan. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cAnd I figured it would make the, uh, \u2018transition\u2019 easier for the both of you if you\u2019re as relaxed as possible. So all you have to do tonight is sit back, and I\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWow\u2026 and to think I was so worried...\u201d</span> Spitfire yawned as she sunk deeper into the warm bath, feeling her troubles melt away. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cMost ponies would\u2019ve laughed or freaked out if I had come to them with this. I didn\u2019t think you would do all this for me.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHey, what are friends for?\u201d</span> Fleetfoot smiles. And she meant it, partially. But another part of her had an ulterior motive for helping out so dilligently. Something about the idea of a pony being sucked up Spitfire\u2019s toned, athletic plot and being slowly digested by the powerful mare made Fleetfoot feel light-headed with arousal. She slowly kneaded and massaged her friend\u2019s belly with her hooves, ostensibly to help her relax, but really just to feel the smooth skin of her stomach as it stretched over the mare inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the mare inside, the little spa treatment was working. Rainbow Dash was so disoriented by her surroundings that she couldn\u2019t think straight-- she hadn\u2019t even realized she was in a stomach yet. Her futile struggles had exhausted her, and she could only curl up into a tight ball and allow the stomach walls to squeeze in tightly around her. Spitfire\u2019s belly swung as she moved, swaddling Rainbow Dash like a cradle, and her predator\u2019s body heat combined with the warm bath water to turn the stomach into a sauna. Because of all this, despite the acid being poured over her skin, her fur coming off in patches, Rainbow Dash still somehow felt deeply relaxed. A kind of relaxation beyond anything she had felt before, almost as if she was returning to the womb. Her survival instincts faded, and she closed her eyes and fell into a deep slumber from which she would never wake up. She was now just a piece of food, to be processed into fat slowly but painlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Rainbow Dash was asleep...</span></div></div>",

Deciding what she was going to do to him, Rainbow Dash's tail slithered around Dumbell's waist, and pulled him underneath the bleachers, the pegasus was scared now of what was happening to him.

Did Twilight really just say that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm Twilight, a trip to a snakes digestive system is usually a one way trip.\" She said. Twilight could be so engrossed with her studies that she forgot the most important things, like not being digested alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilights looked at her undignified. \"Do you really think I would go in there without safety precautions? I know a spell that will protect me from the acids and as being part snake you should be able to reguriate me. If not I can just teleport out and if even that fails I just keep up the shield spell while you go to the hospital.\" She explained confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's the case.\" Rainbow Dash laid down and unhinged her jaw, allowing Twilight to climb inside. The unicorn wasted no time. Her horn glowed and a softly glowing shield coated her body, then she started to crawl down Rainbow Dashs throat. Twilight made mental notes on how her digestive tract was transformed to take up most of the snake body. Some sort of green liquid attacked her shield and Twilight guessed that she has reached the stomach. Her way was blocked by two skeletons, one pegasus and one gryphon. Rainbow Dash was not joking around. \"Say Rainbow Dash, how long did it take to digest them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the outside, the others were observing the bulge Twilight made as she wandered through Rainbow Dash. The cyan lamia pegasus answered. \"About five minutes after I swallowed Spitfire she stopped struggling.\" The others were shocked as they learned that Spitfire was alive and conscious while she was digested but didn't say anything. From inside, it got a little too scary for Twilight. \"Alright Rainbow Dash, could you get me out now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash tried to reguriate Twilight.</span></div></div>",

Those dinner partys were famous all around Equestria, only Fancy Pants closest friends were allowed there and no press has ever managed to sneak a paparazzi in there. Some ponies say this dinner is even more important than the Grand Galloping Gala and here she was, taking the train to Canterlot where she would be one of the guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the train arrived at the station, Rarity gathered her luggage and went out. She felt as if she finally managed to become part of the high society. In front of the train station, said stallion was waiting for her. \"Hello there Ms. Rarity, I am so glad you could make it.\" Rarity smiled as she saw Fancy Pants and his wife, Fleur de lis, waiting for her. Normally you'd expect somepony like him to be snooty and condescending, the truth is that he was easily one of the friendliest ponies in Canterlot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy Pants, Fleur, how nice of you to greet me here,\" She said in her best manners, holding herself with grace and dignity. She knew that Fancy Pants wouldn't care if her demeanor slipped a little but she couldn't help to show her best anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always nice to see a good friend.\" He answered while Fleur was fawning over him as if they were at a photo session. \"I'm sure you are excited for the dinner party, I can guarantee that you have never tasted anything like the meal that will be served there.\" He held a slight smirk as he said this while his wife appeared slightly nervous for some reason. \"Without further ado, shall we go then? The dinner party will be held at my mansion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity couldn't wait and immediately followed him to a cart that would bring them to his mansion. During the drive he continued their chat. \"Now Rariy, I always liked the privacy of this party. If you are invited or not mostly depends on the level of trust between us. I trust you completely to keep everything that happens during the party a secret, that's why you're here.\" Rarity felt honored that Fancy Pants considered her such a good friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, my lips are sealed.\" After a while they arrived at Fancy Pants mansion, which was second only to the royal palace in terms of luxury. Marble walls lined the hallways and exotic flowers were planted in the garden. Paintings of famous artists decorated the walls and the ground was covered in a plush carpet. A butler appeared and greeted Fancy Pants and Fleur de Lis. \"Good afternoon master, would you like me to accompany your guest to her room?\" He asked in a dignified tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please, she will be the guest on honor at tonights party.\" He said. The butler nodded and turned towards Rarity. \"Please follow me Ms.\" The butler led Rarity through the halls on Fancy Pants mansion until they arrived at a large ornate door. \"This will be your room Ms.\" He opened the door and Rarity stepped in, she gasped at what she saw.</span></div></div>",

On the pearly white marble walls hung paintings from famous artists and the bed was made with the finest silk sheets in all of Equestria. Fancy Pants butler noticed Raritys flabbergasted expression. \"While princess Celestia values moderation, master Fancy Pants always makes sure that his guests only receive the best.\" He explained to Rarity, who was standing in front of a large, ornate mirror. \"Very well then Ms. Rarity, I will notify you when the dinner begins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity spent the rest of the day exploring the mansion. Even though Fancy Pants appreciated 'charmingly rustic' things he was still living in luxury, everything looked as if it belonged in the royal palace. Rarity wandered the halls for a few hours before retiring to her room. She took a little nap before a knock on her door woke her up again, it was the butler that led her to her room. \"Ms. Rarity, it's almost time for the dinner party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that, Rarity checked herself in the mirror one last time and hurried down to the dining hall. The dining hall was already filled with several ponies, all of them the elite of Canterlot. Despite what happened at the garden party last time, all of them seemed happy to see Rarity again and  greeted her cheerfully. Fancy Pants motioned to a free seat next to him and Rarity sat down. \"It is quite nice to have you here tonight Rarity, I promise you that you have never tasted anything like the meal served this evening.\" Some of the ponies chuckled a bit at this, Rarity wondered why. \"Now, it is very important that you keep what's happening at this dinner party a secret, we all dearly value our privacy.\" He said and soon enough some servants came in with heavy plates. The plates were very large and had a cover on them, the smell was delicious but Rarity couldn't identify what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the servants placed a plate right in front of her and removed the cover. Rarity was shocked at what she saw.</span></div></div>",

Fleur looked pitiful, she was barely awake and was covered in sauce and had an apple in her mouth. She was steaming, indicating that she has been roasted. Fleur looked at Rarity, her eyes pleading with fear inside of them. Shocked, Rarity looked over to Fancy Pants. She saw that he, and the other guests, also had ponies on their plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFancy Pants only smiled at Rarity. \"Well Ms. Rarity, this is the reason why we keep this dinner party such a secret. If everypony found out what is served here we would be in a lot of trouble. Fleur here almost spilled something, which is why she is served on a platter herself this evening.\" He explained, while Fleur looked at him pleadingly. \"You knew not to talk about this dinner while we are in public, now you are on the menu yourself.\" He scolded her, before looking back at Rarity. \"Give it a try, you'll love it. And don't think you'll be saving Fleur by not eating her. She will be eaten tonight and your refusal only gets you on the menu yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was horrified, the most exclusive dinner party in all of Equestria involved cannibalism? \"How... how can you do this? This is so wrong and how do you even get those ponies?\" She cringed as she looked over the row of cooked ponies, most of them still alive and conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFancy Pants just laughed. \"It's kinda funny how it goes. You say the wrong thing to the wrong pony.\" He glared at Fleur while he said that. \"Or you owe too much money to the wrong pony and bam, you're served for dinner. All these ponies are in great debt or have jeopardized the secrecy of this event. Ms. Rarity, if you're not going to join us we're gonna have to make sure you can't tell anypony.\" After he said that, two of the security ponies moved closer to her. Rarity knew that this was a death threat. \"So Ms. Rarity, would you like to open this event by taking the first bite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was sweating bullets by now. She couldn't eat Fleur, but if she refused she would be cooked and eaten herself.</span></div></div>",

Rarity opened her mouth widely and took Fleurs haunches into her mouth. It was embarassing for her to be watched while having the butt of another pony in her mouth but the others didn't seem to mind, in fact, some of them turned their own plates around and did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Rarity pulled Fleur deeper down her throat. The mare was too tired from being cooked to resist or scream, instead she just let out a few whimpers and occasionally twitched as she was being devoured alive. As her belly was pulled down Rarity's esophagus, Fleur looked towards Fancy Pants one last time with pleading eyes. He however ignored her in favor of eating the pony that was served to him. Fleur just gave up at this point and remained still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity meanwhile was fighting with conflicting emotions. On one hoof this was so incredibly wrong, on the other she really did enjoy the taste. Rarity was so lost in her thoughts, she didn't even notice that she has already finished sucking Fleurs head down. She closed her mouth and after a few more swallows, Fleur de lis was resting inside of her stomach, waiting to be digested. Rarity quickly grabbed a glass of wine, not wanting to think about the taste any longer. It was not because it was horrible, it was because she actually liked the way the other mare tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guests were also finishing their own meals and as the last pony finished eating, Fancy Pants made an announcement.</span></div></div>",

Rarity enjoyed the attention but still, the ones she was interested in were not paying any attention to her, it was like some sort of cruel joke where she could get anything but the things she wanted. Finally she arrived at the library and knocked on the door. \"It's open.\" Called Twilight from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity stepped in, the library was a mess as usual. Twilight may be a genius but she couldn't keep a single room clean, sometimes Rarity felt bad for Spike. Said dragon seemed to be absent for today. \"Oh hi Rarity, what can I do for you?\" Greeted the purple unicorn her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Twilight, I came here because I need help with a spell.\" Rarity showed Twilight the page that contained the spell. Twilight read the text carefully and was a little surprised that Rarity would need such a spell in the first place. \"I think I can do this but why do you need it? Every stallion in town would love to be your coltfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except the ones I am also interested in. Please Twilight, if I want to find the perfect stallion I need this spell.\" Rarity gave her friend the old puppy dog eyes with quivering lips and a single tear. There was no point in trying to resist, Twilight ordered Rarity to go to the middle of the room while she went over the spell one more time.

While she cast the spell, Twilight began to wonder about some of the things she read in the book. It guaranteed that anything that had the spell cast on it would make everyponies mouth water and that nopony could resist sinking their teeth into that tender flesh. These implications sounded like potential trouble, for her it even sounded like it had something to do with food, not sex appeal. Thus Twilight forgot the most important rule of magic, concentration. Suddenly the spell broke and both Twilight and Rarity were flung across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few short moments, both unicorns recovered and stood up, groaning and rubbing their heads. \"Twilight, was the spell supposed to do that?\" Asked Rarity. The other unicorn apologized. \"Sorry but no, I lost concentration and accidentally cast the spell on myself.\" Twilight could feel how the spell seeped into herself instead of Rarity. \"I can try again for you, I just have to remove the spell from myself first, I don't want every pony in Ponyville on my flanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity didn't listen to Twilight though, the second she took a look at her purple friend she was intoxicated by a strange feeling of hunger. Suddenly, Twilight looked like the tastiest food in all of Equestria. A small part of her mind screamed at her that this was Twilight, one of her best friends but that small part was drowned out by a newfound appetite. Twilight now also noticed that Rarity was staring at her strangely and came closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity, why are you looking at me like that?\" She asked nervously. Rarity could already smell the other unicorn, it was heavenly. \"Oh Twilight, you look so amazingly good, I can't wait to taste you.\" Answered Rarity and licked her lips in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight meanwhile missed the true meaning of Rarity's words, she thought that Rarity was talking about sex and so she blushed. \"R-Rarity! This is just the spell talking, you are not even into mares.\" Nervously she backed away, other thoughts invading her mind. Twilight had to admit that Rarity was a very beautiful unicorn, this was surely a chance that would never come again. Twilight thought about letting Rarity have her way with her, not knowing the other unicorns true intentions.</span></div></div>",

Twilights eyes shot open as she now noticed that something was wrong, she looked behind herself and gasped in horror as she saw that Rarity was literally eating her.

Rarity tilted her head back, lifting her prey into the air and letting gravity help her swallowing. Twilight could only paw at the air now as she slipped inside even faster. She gasped as she felt her marehood being dipped into a small pool of liquid inside of the stomach.

Still donning her robe and slippers from the morning before she got out the treat she'd been saving, opening her refrigerator she levitated out a couple dozen gallons of the richest ice cream she could afford and set it out before her. \"now if this didn't work I'm going to have to diet for a month to get rid of the inches this is going to give me but... What the hay, as it were! \" and with that she dug into the container of the frozen treat. Her stomach growled almost complacently as the sugary dessert fell into it as she made short work of the first gallon. With a loud sigh of contentment and a gentle pat to her stomach she opened the second one and tore into it even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour there were a mess of empty containers and a unicorn with a distended belly filled with chilled dairy cream, and a happy smile on her face. She watched in amazement as her stomach shark right before her eyes, until over the course of a half hour the massive quantities of ice cream Rarity consumed had melted away, and not a single ounce added! She was ecstatic, and jumped up in joy only to be struck with unbearable hunger pangs. Her stomach twisted itself into knots inside her as she groaned in pain, she was so hungry so suddenly that she could hardly stand it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If all that ice cream couldn't keep me full for more than a half hour then I'd need something bigger, something at least pony sized!\"... She thought about this for a second, barely entertaining the idea before she heard a knock on her door. She stumbled, clutching her growling gut to the entrance to her boutique, only to open it and see...</span></div></div>",

Never mind dear, please come in!\" and with that Fluttershy entered the classy unicorn's home. As she walked through the entrance spied the empty containers of ice cream, quizically she walked in to examine it further. \"Rarity, did you eat all of this?\" As her friend turned around to face her a hot blush appeared on Rarity's face. It was incredibly uncouth of a lady to gorge herself, and to have her friend notice it, oh! It was incredibly embarassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... May have, had a little bit, yes...\" She admitted, covering her flushed face with a hoof. The shy Pegasus looked over Rarity's body, with apparent confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How in Equestria are you able to eat that much and not put on any weight at all?\" She got closer, giving the unicorn's stomach a soft poke, prompting a loud rumble from it.

She scanned the room for something substancial, but everything in her kitchen wouldn't do... Until her eyes landed on Fluttershy. The Pegasus was more than large enough to fill her belly! However FLuttershy noticed her hungry stare and began to grow worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity... Why are you staring at me like that?\" In a flash Rarity was on top of her, the fashionista unicorn bent her neck down and gave a gentle lick to her neck, forcing a soft blush onto the Pegasus' face. \"I had no idea t-this was how you felt about me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no darling, I'm flattered of course, but I don't.\" She stared her dead in the face and licked her lips, \"I mean to make a meal of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy gasped and...</span></div></div>",

Fluttershy screams as Rarity\u2019s teeth tear through her soft skin, but it\u2019s quickly silenced as the unicorn tears a chunk free and swallows it, leaving Fluttershy without a windpipe. The Pegasus spasms for a moment before lying still; she was dead and ready for Rarity to feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity groans happily as the sweet Pegasus meat teases her tastebuds before sliding down her throat and taking the edge off the hunger pangs.

Eagerly she takes the platter and some silverware with her to the table, leaving the completely stripped skeleton of her former friend on the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe digs in, shoveling sweet Pegasus meat into her muzzle as fast as she could chew and swallow. The unicorn has to admit that even without the spell making her so hungry, she would have immensely enjoyed the flavor of pony meat if it all tasted this good. Meat from Fluttershy\u2019s legs, flanks, rump and face all quickly started to vanish down Rarity\u2019s throat as she sates herself. The hunger finally started to abate as she was halfway through her meal, allowing her to slow down and savor Fluttershy a bit more. She finds Fluttershy\u2019s cute marehood in the remaining pile and licks it slowly, as if to get it aroused, before nibbling her way through it and groaning in pleasure. Everything about Fluttershy had been sweet, and her meat was no exception. Rarity finishes up her meal, her stomach bulging slightly and content for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits back and sighs contentedly.

Even small furs sold for fantastical prices, which explained why Rarity maintained a small walk-in closet-cum-furriers-workroom specifically for their preparation. Despite the fact that Fluttershy would only bring Rarity her little creatures if they'd died peacefully, and if she was really really sure they'd have liked a fashionable afterlife, investing in the retrofit and seeking out the training had paid for itself already. Almost. With a start, Rarity realised it'd now never finish doing so. No Fluttershy meant no more pelts.

Fluttershy looked simply amazing with all those extra pounds. Her soft curves and that slight jiggle in every step. The motions were downright hypnotic as those flanks shook a little while she walked past. It was no longer deniable for Rarity, she was very attracted to her friend, sexually. The shy pegasus mare noticed that her friend was staring but thought, it was out of jealousy. Ashamed, she looked to the ground. \"I think, if you can't gain any weight, I will lose mine too. It's only fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic spread through Rarity as she heard this. Fluttershy losing all that glorious fat? There was no way in tartarus she could let that happen. \"But Fluttershy, I was just... admiring you, please do keep your pounds. Otherwise the food would have been wasted.\" That she wanted to ogle her was something, she did not mention though. It was a difficult situation now. On one hoof, she loved Fluttershy's fat body, on the other hoof she did not want to creep her out by coming on too strong. Fluttershy was still a very delicate mare, so moving too quickly could ruin everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow mare just shook her head. \"No, it just isn't fair. Being fat is such a huge trend now and you can't follow it, so neither will I.\" In her mind, it was just the right thing to do. She knew from her experience with Photo Finish, how much all of this meant to Rarity, so she won't make the same mistake again. What she didn't notice was, that Rarity was desperate to keep her fat. Now was time for a decision, either Rarity could just admit her feelings to Fluttershy, which would either be hit or miss or she could try to be indirect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I think I will ask Rainbow Dash if she can give me some weight loss training, then we will be the same weight again.\"</span></div></div>",

Yet, with a subtle sway of the hips, all that was lost to the ether, drowned out by a much louder message. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm sexy and I know it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo watch the unicorn shop was to watch a hypnotist on stage. With a precision-strike compliment, a subtle smile, or a even a little sigh, ponies seemed to bend to her will. \"You can go first.\" \"I don't normally do this, but for you...\" \"And take one of these too, on the house!\" It came as no surprise that she had plenty of spending money left over to use on some of the traveling sales carts that stopped in town. She took the time to glance at the inventory of each, until one merchant addressed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Rarity.\" With a mild start, Rarity looked to the hooded merchant in the caravan. \"Why, yes I am. Do I know you?\" All Rarity could see of her was her face; a mare with a dark, leafy green coat and sharp yellow eyes. Everything else was covered by an oversized baggy robe.  \"No, you do not. Your reputation merely preceeds you. You may call me Charina.\" Rarity subtly looked over the items on display, seeing no common theme between them. \"It's a pleasure to meet you. If I may ask, what sort of shop is this?\" Charina grinned, \"Merely assorted odds and ends. I collect trinkets from one place and sell them in another, as a hobby of sorts. Although a mare like you probably isn't interested in sand bottles or dream catchers. I think I have just the thing for you...\" She magically lifted an emerald necklace from beneath the makeshift counter. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe decision was swift. Rarity's entire coinpurse was exchanged for the emerald beauty. She did not notice the brief glow it emitted as soon as she put it on. \"Thank you very much,\" Charina said with sincere glee, \"If you want anything else, come back by this evening.

Still, she couldn't help but feel nervous, all they knew was that the spell makes one \"predatory\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready Rarity?\" Twilight smiled. \"I think I have this down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready as I'll ever be darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded and her horn flared up, as magical light began to materialize and surround Rarity, lifting into the air. Rarity closed her eyes, and after a few seconds felt a strange ripple move through her, accompanied by a sharp popping sound as the spell took effect and she was deposited back on the floor with a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Get me a mirror.\" Rarity muttered, wanting to make sure there wasn't any unsightly changes as Twilight began examining her, making notes. She feel that something was off around her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike ran off, returning with a small mirror which Rarity took with her magic, looking her face over. Everything SEEMED normal so far... With a bit of trepidation she opened her mouth revealing sharp, carnivorous teeth in place of her normally equine ones. She gasped and Twilight quickly sketched the change in her notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating! Rarity, try thinking of food or something, I think the spell may have made you a carnivore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity didn't need to, she'd already put together the dots, and noticed an... urge. She hadn't eaten since breakfast and all of a sudden she was positively famished, and there were two rather tasty looking creatures in the room with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight, I believe that you are correct, in fact all of this thinking has got me feeling a bit peckish, perhaps you could go get the reversing spell and we could go eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Of course, the spell took a bit out of me too, I'll be right back with the tome I found the spell in.\" Twilight started upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity thought fast, this new urge... she wanted to fulfill it so badly. It would be a simple matter to grab Spike and run off to eat him back home, but Twilight would be a much bigger meal. Of course if she wanted to get Twilight alone, she'd have to trick Spike into leaving before Twilight got that book.</span></div></div>",

He scraped his hooves across the ground and got ready for the fight. \"Don't think ah'll make this easy for ya'll.\" The two ponies charged at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ensuing battle was fairly one sided, Applejack was much stronger and faster than Big Macintosh. He managed to score a few hits while dodging her snapping mouth but he was already exhausted while Applejack was just getting started. Finally she bucked him in the side and sent him flying. With a loud groan he hit the wall and laid there, too dizzy from the impact to stand up. This was it, he thought, maybe I deserve this for what I did back then. He saw Applejack approaching him with a salivating maw and prepared his last words. \"I forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want you to forgive me, I want you to taste delicious.\" She taunted as her mouth engulfed his head. Big Macintosh was exhausted but he had to buy Braeburn more time. Her pushed against her in a futile attempt to slow her down only to find his hooves disappearing down her throat. Even his powerful hind legs could only slow his descend down a little bit as Applejack worked her way over his belly. His nose came into contact with a pool of some sort of liquid, he has already reached the stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Braeburn put up some final barricades against his crazed cousin. The sound of battle had ended and Braeburn allowed some tears to flow. He wasn't so naive to think that Big Macintosh could have subdued Applejack. The quiet meant that he would never see his cousin again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A large table had been placed in a clearing at Sweet Apple Acres. At each of the two ends laid a large crate of apples, readily awaiting the two mares that would devour them. As it so happened, a major trading route was closed off due to unusually high roc activity, leaving Applejack with more apples than she could sell locally. Not wanting them to go to waste, she and Rainbow Dash decided on an impromptu eating contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight took the role of judge, reviewing the scenario aloud as the other two mares took their seats. \"Okay, here are the rules. Normally a winner would be declared based on how much food is consumed in a set time limit, but due to the circumstances, it will be based on how many apples are eaten before giving up.\" Saying it aloud gave Twilight a bad feeling about this contest. She was, after all, dealing with the two most stubborn ponies she knew. \"You each have your own crate of apples. I've personally verified that each one contains the same amount of apples, both in quantity and overall mass. I will watch and keep score. Are you both ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah sure am, Twi!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's get this show on the road!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, on my mark you-\" But the unicorn was interrupted by the starved mares munching away already, leaving her desperately grabbing for her scoreboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\nSeveral minutes in, neither Applejack nor Rainbow showed any signs of slowing down. \"Wow, Applephack\" Rainbow commented through a full mouth, \"Thif waf one of the <i>beft</i> ideaf we had.\" Applejack simply nodded with an acknowledging 'Mmm'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\n\"Ya know, Rainbow, you ain't gonna be the fastest flier if you keep packing 'em away like that.\" The pegasus paused for only a moment. \"Hah! Don't think you can win that easily! Even when I'm working off <i>this</i>,\" she said patting her slightly bulging belly, \"I'll be seeing it as proof of how badly I beat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight only sighed, wishing she had enforced a time limit. Despite what enthusiasts of the 'sport' say, watching these two eat all morning was proving to be one of the most boring things imaginable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\n\"Hah! Done and done!\" Rainbow rubbed her engorged stomach, the crate of apples now a thing of the past. \"Well, AJ? Ready to call it quits?\" Applejack took the time to swallow before answering, \"Ah've only got three left! Just wait a sec.\" Dash watched intently as her opponent polished off her crate. \"There, all gone. Guess it's a tie, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was unacceptable to the pegasus. \"Come on, there's gotta be a tiebreaker in case of something like this, right Twi?\" They both looked to the unicorn in question, only to find that at some point she had fallen asleep. \"Huh. Well we gotta find some way to settle this!\" Applejack knew Rainbow well enough to know that she wouldn't drop the subject until, in her mind, there was a clear winner and loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when an idea came to her. Upon retrospect, she would find it strange, perhaps blaming the thought on the competitive stress or postmeal bliss. But at the moment, it made perfect sense to her. She could prove right then and there that she had the bigger appetite!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Applejack spent a few more moments contemplating this idea. Should she really do that? The only edible thing around here was Twilight because if she ate Rainbow Dash it would probably be cheating and Twilight could still settle a winner from inside her stomach. Slowly Applejack crept closer to the sleeping unicorn while Rainbow Dash tried to think of a way to win this match, not knowing that the farmer already had a plan. Applejack now stood right in front of Twilight, who rolled onto her back in her sleep, and nervously bit her lip as she tried to make a decision. Then, as Rainbow Dash looked over to her, Applejack decided to act. Before Rainbow Dash could even ask what she was doing, she grabbed Twilights head and quickly shoved it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash was thinking, how should they do this? Of course they could just pick more apples or go to sugarcube corner, the pegasus liked the second idea most. She already turned around and wanted to ask AJ and Twilight where they wanna go when she saw Applejack putting Twilights head into her mouth. \"Wha.... what the hay are you doing AJ?\" She asked in shock but she got no answer. The orange earth pony already had her mouth full of Twilights head and was currently pushing her further down her throat. Rainbow Dash could not say anything anymore and just stared at the spectacle, jaw almost hitting the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was watching the two of them eat for several minutes. At first it was fascinating to see how much those two could eat. Twilight even considered running a few experiments on pony stomach capacity. After a while though it got pretty boring for her and it became harder and harder to focus. Eventually, she closed her eyes and succumbed to sleep. A few more minutes later though, she was roughly woken up again as she felt her body being moved. \"Huh, what? Sorry, I fell asleep.\" She said groggily and tried to rub her eyes, only to find that her shoulders were stuck in position and she couldn't move her arms. It was dark and wet and she could feel movements all around her. Panicked, she looked around, trying to find out where she was. She let her horn glow a bit and saw the slimy walls of Applejacks throat, she realized that she was being eaten and started to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack used Twilights confusion as she woke up for a few more gulps. Rainbow Dash also seemed to shocked to react at the moment, so AJ decided to send more of Twilight down her esophagus. A few gulps later Applejack could already feel Twilights belly button on her tongue. A huge bulge could already be seen on Applejacks neck as Twilight was forced down. As she reached the unicorns hips, the kicking legs became a problem. At this moment she hoped that Rainbow Dash was not looking to closely and snaked her tongue out, letting it slide between the other mares legs. From inside of herself, AJ could hear a gasp and the kicking legs became still, except for a delighted shudder. Applejack used this opportunity and grabbed Twilights flanks, shoving them past her lips. Immediately, Twilight tried to struggle again but now she could do nothing to stop her descend anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash watched part with shock, part with morbid curiosity as the lavender unicorn was eaten by the apple farmer. Her common sense told her to stop AJ, to pull Twilight out of the other mares mouth but something made her want to watch it. After watching for a few minutes as Twilight was sent down deeper and deeper with each gulp, her hooves finally disappeared past Applejacks lips and the orange earth pony craned back her neck, showing off the bulge that used to be a unicorn and gulped a few more times, sending Twilight into her belly. AJ let out a contended sigh as she finished her meal, while Rainbow Dash stared at the now moving belly, containing dozens of apples and a struggling pony. Applejack now turned around and faced the pegasus. \"Alright Rainbow Dash, I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was speechless as she heard this, Applejack ate her? For one moment she was still in her fleshy prison, surrounded by apple mush, then she punched the wall she could still reach. \"APPLEJACK, YOU LET ME OUT RIGHT NOW!\" She yelled before she resumed to struggle. Applejack had to wince at the sudden push. \"Ah am mighty sorry 'bout that but ah really wanted to win this contest.\" Twilight let out an exaspirated groan from within. \"Alright alright, you win, now let me out already.\"</span></div></div>",

There is nothing to eat here anymore and I ate more than you.\" From the inside, Twilight was facehoofing as she heard that Rainbow Dash was still caring more about winning than the fact that she was inside of a stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you may have eaten Twilight too but I can still eat more and I can prove it. If ponies now count then let me just find somepony to gulp down.\" Twilight couldn't believe what she just heard, worse yet, Applejack seemed to agree. \"Alright then, let's continue the eating contest with ponies.\" From inside, Applejack could feel Twilight push against her belly. \"APPLEJACK!

She quickly prepared a teleportation spell but then the groaning began. Twilight was kneaded and lost concentration, as she was pushed, shoved and moved inside of the other ponies gut. She also started to scream, since she knew this was a sign that digestion was starting, not surprisingly since the belly was already full when she got in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile their bellies were rumbling already, they ignored the mare inside of Applejack and set the rules. \"We both will have until sundown, who has the bigger belly by then wins.\" Declared Rainbow Dash. \"Sounds fair, so let's go.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were many ponies that loved Pinkie Pie. Her light-heartedness and love of fun and life was contagious. She was always cheerful, upbeat, and had a noble calling in life. More than just partying, her talent was to bring the festive spirit out in ponies and bring them together to celebrate. And while in her day-to-day activities she could be an annoying pest and a source of irritation for many, there weren't any ponies who could dislike her, although they all agreed that Pinkie was hyper active, and probably needed to chill out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it would come to a surprise to many of them that this whimsical pony was actually fairly calm when not in the presence of another pony whom she wanted to celebrate with. For every meeting, no matter how small or common, was like a small celebration to her, and when there were no ponies around, and nothing to celebrate, Pinkie would just smile and let her mind gently drift to nothing in particular, and everything in the universe--her imagination was extensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie had just put an order of cupcakes into the oven, and while fatigue never ever took her, she was leaning out the window and sighing, looking at a wind chime across the street and letting her mind wander. She hummed along with the sounds it made. She wondered if Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake would like windchimes. Then again, who in their right mind didn't love windchimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie laughed and randomly started singing a improvised rhyme about windchimes while she spun herself over to the kitchen's island to look at her cupcake recipe book. All sorts of clever little ideas were in here, and dozens of blank pages that were meant for the owner to put down their own ideas. She had written very tiny in them so that she could write at least a dozen recipe ideas of her own on each page, including the margins. It looked like a disaster. She started flipping through the regular recipes and came upon a dandy little idea that was called Cupcake Pony Surprise. It was less of a recipe and more of an idea, the only complicated part being the filling. Basically, it was a party treat where the baker bakes cupcakes in the physical likeness of her friends, with a candy-cookie cutie mark topper, and a jelly filled center the color of the pony's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie giggled. \"Gee, I wonder what my friends would taste like if they really WERE cupcakes.\" Bouncing her head back and forth and wobbling her legs around, she began to daydream about turning her friends into cupcakes. First, she'd put them all in a big bowl, and cover them in eggs and flower and some sugar and butter and oh maybe a little bit of brown sugar, and a little vanilla, and maybe some oyster sauce!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie rolled her eyes. \"No, bad brain, that's not something my friends would like!\" Then in her mind Pinkie took a big egg beater and whipped her friends all together into a technicolored batter, and they giggled! She poured them all into a big cupcake tin. Really, they'd be like one big giant cup-cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tummy growled as she started to smell the baking cupcakes, imagining what the smell of her friends would be like in a big tasty cupcake just for Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie blinked as something in the distance roused her and she discovered she had put herself up on the island at some point and was covered in flour. \"Oops!\" she laughed and hopped down, shaking herself free of the powder. The buzzer went off for her cupcakes and she got them out of the oven, let them cool, and then decorated them meticulously. She had precise control of her lips and was able to squeeze out frosting from a tube of paper quite well, and then sculpt it with a little knife. These cupcakes looked like they had little dolphins on them. They were for Sea Swirl, a pony with this same design as her cutie mark. She used to work for an ocean park in another town, but then retired here to ponyville. She looked quite young for her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie delivered the cupcakes to the front counter and watched Sea Swirl leave, thinking again of cupcakes looking like ponies and suddenly wondering what her friends would taste like. She sighed happily, daydreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake came down from downstairs and smiled at Pinkie. \"Okay dearie, the foals are asleep. You can go on your lunch break. Do you want to eat something here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie blinked, thinking about it... \"No Mrs. Cake. I think... I think I'll go out for lunch.\" A little saliva dribbled from her lower lip, as she began to think of who she should visit... and what she would try to bake them into. </span></div></div>",

She bounced up and down. \"Omygosh this is going to be so much FUN! I can't wait to surprise her, I know she's going to just love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie did a backflip and started to hop away to Rainbow Dash's house. She didn't take long to get there, as Pinkie had a way of moving through space that was more efficient than other ponies. She was near a tree as she was looking at Rainbow Dash's cloudhouse. Hidden inside the trunk was a pair of fuzzy boots that Twilight had enchanted to have a constant cloud-walker spell on them. She slipped them on and then bent the strongest branch on the tree towards the ground, and released. She howled \"WEEEEEEEE!\" as she flew through the air, crashing through Rainbow's upper window of her beautiful home and rolled along the blue-hued 'carpet-cloud'. She came to a stop at her feet, wobbling back and forth at high frequency before coming to a complete still abruptly. She was less than an inch from Rainbow Dash's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash, despite having just had her personal space violated in less than a second when she had previously been at home alone, just frowned in a calm manner and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey Pinkie Pieeee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HIYA!\" she chimed and began to wiggle. \"So Dashie Dashie, how are you doing? It's lunch time didja know? Huh? I bet you're hungry! I'm hungry! Let's have lunch together c'mon it will be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow blinked rolled her eyes. \"Fiiine Pinkie Pie. What did you have in mind.\" She was used to this game by now, but the upside was that whenever Pinkie Pie showed up out of nowhere, most of the time Rainbow got something out of it that made it all worthwhile, even if it wasn't immediately apparent. It would be nice to have a cut-and-dry experience with Pinkie for a change, but really, Pinkie thought in mysterious ways. She wasn't stupid, but her own little world seemed to have a logic of its very own that was frighteningly perceptive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie licked the underside of Rainbow's chin and mmmed, then nuzzled against Rainbow Dash. \"Okey dokey lokey. Let's get down to your kitchen and get baking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really in the mood to eat anything sweet though,\" said Rainbow, following after Pinkie as she took the initiative to start hopping downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you won't have to worry about THAT!\" she said. She entered the kitchen and started anticipating what she would need in order to prepare Rainbow. There were a lot of options open to her, really. She could stuff Rainbow full of food and fatten her up, for starters, or just use her as is. There were treats she could use Rainbow in that would require no baking, and if she decided to bake Rainbow and cook her, she had a special glaze with her in her tail that was the BOMB at keeping things from cooking. Usually it was used to keep a certain part of a pastry a pasty white, but in a thick coating it would keep Rainbow from cooking at all while still baking well with whatever treat she prepared. And that was just the tip of the ice berg. Pinkie was a mischievously clever little pony.</span></div></div>",

The pegasus was starting to shiver by the time Pinkie had gotten six scoops of vanilla onto her, and she had four more varieties she wanted to slap onto her Dashie. Pinkie loved it that Dashie enjoyed ice cream so much, there were so many good flavors here! Vanilla, Mississippi mud, caramel and pecan, mint chocolate chip, and ooooh bubble gum! Pinkie grinned as she got a huge scoop of the bubble gum, a scoop that shouldn't have even fit on the scooper, and plopped it down on Rainbow's crotch. The pegasus shivered more intensely and whimpered as the cold sank into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww Pinkie Pieee!\" she wailed, shaking, but Pinkie was already burying Rainbow in yet more ice cream. Scoop after scoop of the varying flavors was lumped down on top of Rainbow until she was chilled to the bone. The mound vibrated as Rainbow struggled to stay warm. Only her head was sticking out of the ice cream now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thihihihis wahahhahas a-ah st-st-st-stupid idehhehaahaha!\" stammered Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Pinkie will get you nice and warm soon!\" said Pinkie Pie, giving Rainbow a little lick on the nose. The Earth pony licked her lips and her tummy growled, promising Rainbow Dash that Pinkie meant it. Pinkie opened her mouth wide and chomped into the ice cream above Rainbow's belly, gulping down the mouthful of it. This would have given anypony else brain freeze, but Pinkie was eager for more. She took another bite, this time above Rainbow's chest and ate her way down to the pegasus's freezing flesh. She ran her broad, warm tongue over Rainbow's body and the pegasus began to shake harder, her body craving that warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh Pinkie hurry up I'm so cold!\" Rainbow whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie scooped a wad of mint into her mouth and pressed her lips up against Rainbow's, forcing the ice cream into Rainbow's mouth with a kiss. Rainbow tried to resist, but Pinkie's strong mouth overpowered her as she was forced to gulp down the ice cream. Pinkie's lips lingered on Rainbows a moment longer, her tongue swirling melted mint ice cream around her friend's mouth. She pulled away and smiled. \"See? It's GOOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie no please I'm so cold!\" Rainbow pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww but I'm your friend! Don't you wanna give me a biig smooch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie quickly swallowed a couple more gobs of mixed ice cream, then took a scoop of vanilla into her mouth and started kissing Rainbow again. The pegasus's body was feeling cold right down to her core as the ice cream chilled her stomach. She lapped small mouthfuls of vanilla out of Pinkie's mouth while their lips pressed against each other. This was torture for Rainbow, but the stimulation and ferocity Pinkie had was keeping her oven plenty warm and wet. Her labia didn't fare as well though, nor did much of the rest of her. As the ice cream leeched heat from Rainbow's body and began to melt, the still cold, sweet syrup worked its way between her legs and down the crack of her rump and dribbled onto her anus, freezing all of her. Her labia and vulva were chilled as the melting ice cream slipped into her nethers as well, mingling with the comparatively steamy honey her pussy produced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie unburied Rainbow bite by bite, dragging her tongue roughly over every inch of Rainbow's body that she uncovered--legs, leg-pits, chest, tummy, thighs, Rainbow's cutie marks... Soon there wasn't much solid ice cream left, must a pool of chilly mixed syrups that still pulled the heat out of Rainbow's body. Rainbow was hyperventilating, but also rocking her hips and sloshing the pool of syrups around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still the wad of bubble gum ice cream sitting on Rainbow's crotch, half-melted but just as good. Pinkie licked her lips and opened wide, pressing her entire mouth down clean over Rainbow's entire crotch, and then brought her lips down to a pucker and kissed Rainbow's frozen clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PINKIE!\" Rainbow screamed, the sudden shock of those warm lips on her cold, sensitive clitoris making her entire body jump. Wonderful bubble gum flavor filled Pinkie's mouth. She suckled on Rainbow's clit, making the pegasus whine, before opening her mouth back up to press the bubble gum ice cream deep into Rainbow's vulva, pressing yet more of it into her hot velvety tunnel with her tongue. Rainbow was beyond speaking coherently, and rambled half formed words without any grammatical order at all while Pinkie literally began to eat her out. The ice cream and chunks of bubble gum she had pushed into Rainbow were being dribbled back out, and Pinkie lapped it up along with Rainbow's sweet honey. Her lips worked Rainbow's while her teeth chewed the bubble gum. The flow of melted ice cream ceased from Rainbow's body, and Pinkie dove her long, strong tongue into Rainbow, penetrating the depths of her friend's loins farther than Rainbow had thought possible. Her chilled velvety insides relished and gave a squeeze of thanks onto Pinkie's strong tongue as it lapped up the residue of ice cream. The Earth pony pulled her mouth away and smacked her lips, then blew a bubble of gum and popped it right on Rainbow's pussy, covering her entire crotch in a pink film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie Pinkie Pinkie...\" Rainbow chanted, trembling. She was completely numb from the cold now. And yet her body never felt this good. No matter how hard a girl tried, there sometimes was just no beating the sense of surprise that came with another person's touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow jumped as Pinkie gave her a little kiss on the tummy, her smoochings moving up her middle and then to her neck, where she suckled. Pinkie was hover well over Rainbow, and her tummy, filled with three times as much ice cream as she'd ever seen another pony eat, grumbled for more. Rainbow squirmed as she heard the noise, knowing that the tummy was begging for her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was right, Rainbow, you're very scrumptious,\" said Pinkie. \"Wheeelp, guess I'll see you later!\" She gave Rainbow a quick kiss on the lips, leaving the pegasus shocked and nervous. Rainbow knew what was about to happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened a lot faster than she had anticipated. Pinkie scooped the big mixing bowl up in her forelegs and pressed the rim to her lower lip. Her mouth opened wide, like a cave. Rainbow thought she'd be able to fly right down her throat if she was so inclined. Pinkie tipped the bowl, the ice cream syrup poured into her maw and Rainbow followed suit. She slipped on the metal and ice cream and her frozen hooves squeezed their way into Pinkie's gullet. Rainbow gasped sharply as new life entered them. After being frozen in ice cream, her flesh couldn't believe how warm, how oven hot warm, Pinkie's insides were. It was like being dropped into a hot bath that was too fresh to enter just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie stop wait!\" Rainbow cried out, the fear of that heat scaring her more than that huge maw closing over her, but it was happening too fast. From the moment the bowl was tipped, to a second later, only Rainbow's hooves and ankles had entered Pinkie. But it took just as much time for her shins to slip down Pinkie's pipe, and then her thighs. Rainbow tried to catch herself as she literally was falling down into Pinkie's body, but her shaky, near bloodless forelegs slipped on Pinkie's wet lips and folded into her bulging cheeks. Rainbow yelled with shock as she slipped in to her chest, feeling her legs enter an even hotter place as they penetrated Pinkie's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Pinkie closed her jaws around Rainbow, stopping her just at the shoulders. She mmmed around Rainbow, running her tongue over Rainbow's wings and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no please let me out Pinkie I'm cooking!\" Rainbow cried, but as the life returned to her, her heavy breathing steadied and her flesh quickly became accustomed to the heat. Her flesh tingled, her nerves a little frayed, but as the heat baked into her, a feeling of absolute bliss washed over Rainbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuuuuuck...!\" Rainbow moaned. A heavy stream of tears suddenly poured from her eyes, and the pressure inside her lower tummy broke as a wave of pleasure rocked her nethers. She squirted fast and hard into Pinkie's stomach, her cum running down her thighs, thighs that twitched with every squirt. Her tail fidgeted against the esophagus. The heat, saving her from the cold, and those pleasant muscles nurturing her body with their touch put Rainbow on cloud nine. \"Oh sweet Celestiaaaaa...\" she huffed, and closed her eyes as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie smiled around her meal. The flavors that played on her tongue were overwhelming her. She wanted to keep staring at her friend's expression, but she just wanted to swallow her a lot more. She tilted her head up and gulped, wrapping her huge tongue around Rainbow's head and pushing her down quickly passed her lips. With another gulp it was over, and Rainbow's head disappeared down Pinkie's throat and passed her sternum, only appearing again as a bulge in her bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie let out a loud burp and fell down onto her butt, rubbing her tummy. \"Oh Rainbow I just LOOOVE making you smile! You're my  bestest friend.\" She kissed her tummy and wiggled, feeling Rainbow slosh inside her hot stomach along with the rest of the now fully melted ice cream.</span></div></div>",

Of course it was always worth experimenting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy opened the door a peek, looking out cautiously before noticing it was her pink earth pony friend. \"oh, hello there Pinkie.\" She said with a meek smile, opening the door wider. Without any care for social conventions the party pony bounced inside the cottage, her mind still on recipes. A bit late, Fluttershy responded \"P-Please come in\". Pinkie headed straight to the kitchen, which was all very neat and tidy, searching around for various utensils and cookware. She definitely needed some recipe, but the giant Fluttershy cupcake was a bit far fetched when she was so far away from her own bakery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was surprised by the quiet determination of her friend, she'd never seen Pinkie with such a stern look in her eye, it was... Unsettling. As if Pinkie read her mind, she turned to Fluttershy and gave her a wide smile. \"Oh, hi Flutters~! I just stopped by for a bit of lunch, I hope you don't mind!\" Fluttershy let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, I'm happy to have lunch with you, what will we be having?\" She said with a small grin.</span></div></div>",

Is that some sort of stew for pegasi?\" Fluttershy said shakily, watching as Pinkie got out the large portable wash basin for her larger animal friends, slowly filling it with water and setting it on the stove, the size of it big enough to take up all four burners on her stove. She looked up close, seeing the water bubble slightly \"Pinkie how much stew are you making?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink pony thought, if she revealed her intention to gobble up the shy pony she'd be likely to resist, and enjoy it less! So to remedy this, Pinkie decided to steer it in a different direction. \"Oh Flutters, this is uh... A hot tub! What kind of crazy pony could eat this much stew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy guess that... sort of made sense. It was a washtub, and this certainly isn't out of the ordinary for the silly earth pony, so she passed it off as normal. Pinkie pulled the washtub off the oven once the water was sufficiently boiling, and gestured for Fluttershy to step in, which she did cautiously. It was spacious enough for her to sink into the water with the greatest of ease, the warm water was relaxing, she lay back and closed her eyes, sighing softly. \"Oooooh Pinkie, this feels great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie giggled, watching as her next meal slid right into the hot water. Pinkie gathered up her other ingredients, carrots, potatoes, some onions and giggled as the pegasus served as stock for her broth. As Fluttershy relaxed Pinkie hummed a tune, to mask the sound of her preparing the ingredients. She peeled the skin off of the carrots before plopping them into the water, Fluttershy in a state of oblivious bliss. Carrots, potatoes, garlic, onions as well as various spices soon floated with the pegasus in the still warm makeshift pot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stirred as she smelled the sound of herself cooking, sniffing the air Fluttershy opened her eyes to see not what she thought was the hot tub filled with veggies, but the drooling maw of Pinkie Pie. \"P-Pinkie!! What is this!?\" The pink pony licked the broth, almost purring at the flavor, it was delicious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Fluttershy!

So, what do you say? You get a nice, warm soak, and I get a tasty lunch!\" Fluttershy, to both of their surprise, seriously considered it. She <i>was</i> enjoying the warmth of her 'bath', and the thought of being in in a soft, warm belly did sound rather inviting in an odd way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted a foreleg out of the stew and looked at it for a moment. The rich liquid tantalizingly dripped off bit by bit, and she could clearly see the spices sticking to her. Her curiosity ultimately overcoming the morbidity of the thought, she took a small lick. Pinkie was right; she <i>would</i> make for a great meal. The warmth and the flavor filled her mind, making her survival instincts sound downright selfish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... think that sounds nice.\" With that, Fluttershy made herself comfortable again in the stew, this time making sure that the ingredients mixed well with her.

Putting her lips on the edge of the bowl, the tilted it back, swallowing gulp after gulp of the delicious soup she had made. FLuttershy stared in horror as Pinkie's belly expanded way past the average capacity of a normal pony, groaning loudly. Within a few minutes she had tucked the massive tub's worth of soup down into her belly, leaning up in Fluttershy's face Pinkie let out a loud belch, giggled as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... I don't know if I've got enough room for you Shy, but we'll see if I can squeeze you in!\" Pinkie said, opening her mouth wide. Fluttershy barely had time to let out a squeak before Pinkie had fit her entire head in the wet cave that was the party pony's mouth.

She let out a small cry as Pinkie sucked down her flanks, her head poking into the sweltering stomach of the Party pony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Pinkie slurped up the back hooves of her friend, swallowing them and slurping up the pink tail and letting out a soft burp.

Desperately she tried to pull herself out of Pinkie's ass but with a final slurp she felt her legs following her inside. Her final thought before running out of air were: \"I hope Pinkie let's me out, I don't wanna die like this, eating by my friends ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie was lying on the floor now, the pleasure made her hair go poofy and her colors vibrant again. Her tongue hung out and she was drooling on the floor. She would have never guessed that this could feel so good.

All of them. Every single one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Redheart soon stopped pleading. She suddenly remembered that the office was largely sound proof for patient confidentiality. They might hear murmering, but anyone passing by might just assume it was a private conversation between medical professional and patient. Unless Redheart was needed and interrupted because of some emergency... then she was done for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unfortunately for her there was not a lot of emergencies in Ponyville. She squirmed unpleasantly as she felt that most of her was furless. She wasn't even sure when it happened. She could feel the pegasus next to her--Rainbow didn't have as much meat on her bones as she did when Nurse Redheart showed up in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" she sighed. \"This is the biggest mistake of my career... whoever heard of a doctor failing a patient and dying with them?\" She was sure that if anypony found out then she'd be demoted posthumously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Redheart clutched Rainbow Dash, feeling the two of them slowly being digested while her mind drifted off about the shame of her fate and the fate of her patient. She passed out before long, and the two ponies were left to gurgle away into a thick, nutritious soup that filled up Pinkie's belly and made it soft and pliant. Her small intestine began to slowly siphon off this nutritious sludge to keep the pink pony energized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie came to the end of her list only after her stomach was down to half the size it was when she'd finished eating. \"Hey where'd you girls go?\" she asked, then gasped as she realized what she had done.</span></div></div>",

Nurse Redheart braced herself and took a deep breath of Pinkie's unpleasant, acrid stomach air. The nurse punched her head through the muscle and felt much wetter, slimier muscle now working over her face. She lifted the ragdoll Rainbow into the muscle and through it, and then the body tugged on them and started pulling them out. Pinkie murred, shaking her body as she felt the two ponies move as one, thick bulge down into her lower digestive tract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh you ponieees!\" she said with a big blush. \"You're starting to make Pinkie feel needy!\" She giggled and decided this was enough of the doctor's office for now.

She returned to her table and gathered up Madame de Flour and pushed her party hat off. \"Sorry Madame de Flour but I'd like your company!\" she said and hopped over back to the bed with the flour on her back. She dumped the sack onto the bed and hopped up, straddling it. Her large belly made it a little hard to get into position. She found a good position and stuck her tongue out, huffing as she began to press her loins onto Madame de Flour. \"Oh Madame your burlap feels soo good on my furry pussy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie squealed and started slamming her hips up and down on the bag of flour harshly, shaking her belly a lot. Her energy and speed was cartoonish, and little blooms of white powder seeped out of the sack with every slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Redheart began to feel sick as she felt herself jostled up and down inside Pinkie Pie, but had to hold on as she was approaching her second orgasm with her sweaty butt pressed tightly against Rainbow's. Pinkie's shaking was helping them move even quicker through Pinkie's bowels. The tension was mounting. \"Oh please don't let me get sick in here!\" Redheart gasped, feeling the nausea build. \"At least let me cum first...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was making whooping noises as she humped Madame de Flour, the moisture from her loins having soaked through the bag and ruined some the flour inside, creating a stiffened clump of flour that she was pushing against. The Cakes in the floor below didn't pay her any mind. Pinkie had made stranger noises while playing shoots and ladders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ponies wailed out, the two mares reaching their climaxes within ten seconds of each other. Pinkie's miraculous body poured her girly cum all over Madame de Flour, ruining the whole bag, while Nurse Redheart's honey dribbled out and inbetween Rainbow's moistened sex, the combined flowery and musky scents helping to perfume Pinkie's swampy scented insides and relaxing Redheart's olfactory sense and stilling her stomach. \"Oh thank Celestia...!\" said the oxygen starved pony, eyes rolling into her head. She passed out.</span></div></div>",

She didn't even realize she was drifting off until it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Redheart and Rainbow Dash were in a bad position. Without either of them moving, and without Pinkie's excited motions bouncing them around, the two of them became stuck in the intestine while trying to come around a bend... or while a bend was trying to squeeze around them. The low oxygen kept the two asleep while the intestine rubbed a post-digestive slime into their fur and bodies... and either it was because Pinkie was just strange or because their medical science had underestimated the intestines, but the two ponies were softened as Pinkie slept. The two poor ponies melted together in restful, painless slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's friends payed a visit, asking where Pinkie and Rainbow were. The Cake's didn't know about Rainbow Dash, but said that Pinkie sounded like she was sleeping in her room. Pinkie's friends were saddened, but decided to not bother her and try and figure out what had gone wrong with all their careful planning for Pinkie's party on the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night came and waned on, Pinkie's stomach slowly shrinking as her friend and Ponyville's head nurse were liquified and absorbed into her bloodstream.

Well they'll never leave my parties ever again! Ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie jumped onto her hind hooves, forelegs raised high as she laughed maniacally.

Pinkamena saw them try to run away, but it was all to easy for her to catch them (since in reality they were not moving at all), and soon Pinkie's stomach was full of Sir Lintsalot, Rocky (all three parts of him) and Mr. Turnip, who was chewed up into parts as Pinkie ate him right out of his bucket. She kicked the bucket aside and rubbed her tummy. \"Hmmm... good friends... I can't wait to get the rest of my 'friends' inside here. Eating them should be plenty fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and decided it was time to go get herself some friends to join her. This was going to be a lot of fun. Pinkamena giggled. \"I might even say that I'll soon be a party of one!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole party inside of one pony, forever.

She licked her lips and walked through the kitchen's double doors, nose down and sniffing like a hound. Not paying attention the voracious earth pony walked, nose first, into the meaty rump of the shapely Mrs. Cake. Pinkie's tongue instinctively crept out of her mouth and licked the folds of the blue backers marehood all the way to her plothole, which quivered under her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake gasped audibly letting out a half moaning squeal, \"H-Honey you told me you couldn't do anymore today...\" she turned around and shreiked as she saw the pink hair of her house's tenant slobbering hungrily over her meaty plot. She didn't have any idea what to say. Pinkie couldn't hold herself back, the meaty taste she enjoyed so much with Nurse Redheart was present tenfold in the thick flank of this mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly she lifted her muzzle up from the crevice of the ecstacy filled baker, moving around to her front end. \"sorry Mrs. Cake, but I can't have you screaming and having anyone try to help you.\" she said with a wide mischevious grin. Mrs. Cake was still panting from her run in with Pinkie's curious tongue working her sensitive areas, the urge to finish herself off was almost too great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie, what do you mean by scream... ing...\" she was speechless as she stared down Pinkamena's gaping maw. Trying to run she turned her head only to have it engulfed by the earth pony's vast maw. Pinkamena let out an audible mmm of pleasure as her tongue wrapped around her prey's head curiously. Giving a powerful gulp she pulled Mrs. Cake's head into her tight throat and licked her throat gently. She raised her head up and supported he flailing meal with her hooves havinggravity aid the descent to her stomach. Her jaw cracked loudly as it expanded to encompass the wide stomach of Mrs. Cake as it too was swallowed down hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baker gasped as her head entered the stomach and landed on something... firm? It wasnt squishy like the throat had been, rubbing against it she determined it was a burlap sack covered in rocks and... lint!? What in the name of Celestia was this pony. Outside however Pinkie was in bliss, having so many friends inside her felt good, with another strong swallow she sent the whole of Mrs. Cake's stomach to join the party. Her tongue peaked inbetween the flailing legs of the mare begging for her life, and did as she had with Nurse Redheart. gently lapping at the folds of the older mare's pussy she was impressed at how much faster she was in spraying her juices onto Pinkie's tongue, though she did have a warmup earlier. The exasperated mare gasped for air in rhe sweltering stomach as she fslt her own juices drip into the hot cramped space to join her. With great haste Pinkie swallowed down the flailing legs and with a final large gulp, sent the whole of her meal down into her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay back against the wall and sighed happily, its good her friends are so delicious. Giving her large squirming belly a pat she let out a loud belch and giggled to herself. She felt the movements in her stomach stop as she released the last breath of air her meal was clinging to. She continued to massage her full stomach as she pondered her mext move.</span></div></div>",

That would be a terribly painful experience for any normal pony, but she never was considered a normal pony in first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Pinkie was enjoying the entire process. Her already distented midsection bulged and stretched with each movement the two guests made, keeping her in a constant state of arousal, arousal she didn\u2019t even try to hide, showing a constant grin and rolling her eyes in a way it made pretty impressive the fact that she still didn\u2019t bump into anypony yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she tried to not to make an scene, despite everypony was already staring at her distended belly with fascination, and that was making her even hornier.

He was one of her scaly friends, reptiles being the kind of creature she'd always felt closest to. If only dragons weren't so terrifying... although part of the reason they were terrifying was their size. The sheer fact that they could eat a pony in one bite petrified her, and yet here she was considering...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna wasn't small. He was about the size of a pony, albeit sort of stretched out. He'd surely be able to eat her in one gulp. There wouldn't need to be any \u2013 ulp \u2013 chewing... snakes weren't equipped for it, anyway. She didn't exactly want to go into Ana's stomach and be digested, but... maybe the only thing she wanted  less was to feed somepony else to Ana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply, her friend needed her help, and it was her destiny to give it. That's what her cutiemark meant, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna was sleeping at the moment. It wasn't a problem. She'd gotten lots of practice at waking snakes gently, for Winter Wrap Up. For some reason, most ponies like to wake the snakes. They'd always been the ones she most enjoyed, seeking their little eyes blink, and their tiny forked tongue flicker out to taste the spring, and the way they'd shake themselves as their awareness returned...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've done that for the last time, Fluttershy thought. Last Winter Wrap Up was my last Winter Wrap Up. It was a little weird. She'd seen the stars for the last time, spoken to her friends for the last time, eaten breakfast for the last time, slept for the last time \u2013 unless she took a nap in Ana's belly. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ana was surprised as she saw that her caretaker had no meal with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy softly cooed at the snake. \"It's okay Ana, I know you're hungry and I will help you.\" Then the pegasus started to shake in fear. \"You can eat me if you want to, I won't resist as long as you are fed properly.\" Fluttershy knew that the snake could understand her, communicating with animals was her special ability. Anxiously she awaited the snakes reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna understood what her caretaker said but couldn't believe it, who would volunteer to become a meal? Still, she desperately needed something to eat if she ever wanted to hunt for herself again so she opened her maw. The pegasus in front of her closed her eyes and laid down, awaiting her fate. Anas head snapped forward and engulfed the pegasus head. Like she promised Fluttershy didn't resist and Ana could start swallowing without a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy never felt so scared in all her life. Ana now had her in a firm grip and started to devour her. Fluttershy knew it was too late for doubts now, even if she started to fight now she wasn't strong enough to escape. Instead she kept her eyes shut and focused on the almost gentle swallowing rhythm as she was squeezed through the snakes long body. Despite her situation Fluttershy felt at peace, her sacrifice saved another animals life.

Even though her loves willingness was bizarre to her, Fluttershy was glad that she would finally have the chance. \"Oh Rarity, I am so happy that you want me to eat you.\" Overcome with emotion, Fluttershy pulled Rarity into a tight hug and gave her a passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breaking the kiss, Rarity looked at Fluttershy with seductive eyes. \"Before I become your meal I think I should have some nice last moments, don't you think?\" Fluttershy nodded and Rarity laid down, spreading her legs and revealing her already glistening sex to Fluttershy. The pegasus mare wasted no time and brought her head down to the marehood of her soon to be meal.

Fluttershy meanwhile enjoyed the taste, Rarity would be a fine meal indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a wave of sticky liquid shot into Fluttershys face as Rarity screamed in pleasure and orgasmed.

Even now that it was clear that Fluttershy was serious about the whole eating thing, Rarity did not attempt to struggle, her love for her best friend clearly being stronger than even her desire to live. Still, the unicorn mare shuddered a bit. \"This is a little scary, but also unbelievably exciting.\" She said as Fluttershy almost reached her flanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy couldn't answer, instead she just continued to swallow. Raritys crotch was still a little wet from her orgasm earlier and the smell was intoxicating. Fluttershy took her sweet time around Raritys flanks, licking every square inch of it. Her meal moaned again and only got quieter as Fluttershy moved over to the belly. A small part of the pegasus was still hoping that Rarity would call it off, get out of her mouth but Rarity kept still until her head was almost engulfed by the timid pegasus lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of her body was already inside of Fluttershys stomach, before the pegasus mouth closed around her head she said some last words. \"Goodbye Fluttershy, I love you.\" Fluttershy closed her mouth and swallowed a few times, sending the rest of the unicorns body into her belly. \"Goodbye Rarity, I love you too.\" Fluttershy sat down on her haunches and lovingly rubbed the large, squirming bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Rariy, I'm going to burp out all the air in there so you pass out. You don't want to be awake for what happens next.\" The burp that followed was almost inaudible but still did it's job. Soon enough, Rarity felt woozy and a few moments later she lost consciousness. Fluttershy was sad that she would never see Rarity again but was also happy that she helped her to fulfill her biggest fantasy. Yawning, Fluttershy stretched and decided to lay down for a while, while her stomach was busy digesting Rarity.</span></div></div>",

She had fallen asleep in Rarity's bed and the Yellow Pegasus looked around, the room dimly lit. \"What am I doing here?\" she thought to herself before a grumble from her rear filled the room. With that Fluttershy's lips turned into a happy grin. Her hoof rubbed down her belly as she looked down and the Pegasus flapped her wings happily. Her belly was visibly fatter but much flatter than when Rarity had filled it. \"Oh Rarity my little belly really did a number on you didn't it?\" she said excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy slid off of Rarity's bed and squeaked quietly as a pressure built in her rear. With a slight smirk, Fluttershy grunted softly and a squeaky fart slipped from between her now slightly large rear. Fluttershy blushed bright red and giggled happily as she shook her flank. \"Eww Rarity how unlady like of you!\" she said with a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of Fluttershy's rear, what was left of Rarity was ready and eager to come out.  The once beautiful unicorn had been completely digested by the meek yellow Pegasus's belly. Now all that remained was several pounds of brown, stinking poop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlutters quickly flew into Rarity's bathroom, eager to dispose of the remains of her friend.  Fluttershy blushed as she sat her rear down onto Rarity's toilet. Fluttershy began to grunt softly, several loud farts echoing inside the bowl as she relaxed her anus. \"Oh Rarity thank you so much.  I promise I'll reunite you will all of our friends very, very soon.\" she said as the tip of a large brown turd poked from between her cheeks. Fluttershy moaned softly as she relaxed and the large turd began to slowly coil into the water below. Surprisingly, it was rather easy to push out. Still Fluttershy grunted softly and clenched her anus, cutting the first length of poop off letting it drop into the water completely. \"Ah... Thank you for being so easy on my rear Rarity..\" she said with a little giggle as she began to push again. This time her belly rumbled and a stream of liquid poop quickly shot out of her rear, splattering the side of the bowl, causing Fluttershy to erupt into laughter. \"Oh Rarity! For how perfect you were as a unicorn, you are making one smelly, gross looking poop!\" she said inbetween squirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more minutes of pushing and squirting Rarity had been emptied from her body completely. Fluttershy hummed happily and wiped between her legs softly with several sheets of paper as she stood up. The yellow pegasus turned and looked into the bowl and grinned happily. She had filled it almost to the rim with what was left of its previous owner. The mess was quite smelly, but Fluttershy loved it. Not a single trace of Rarity was seen in the poop, and any pony who came in would just assume it was a slightly bigger than normal bowel movement. But Fluttershy was giddy, knowing that was all that was left of her friend Rarity.  \"Well Rarity, thank you for helping me make my wildest fantasies come true, but all good things must come to an end!\" she said as she pulled the nearby lever. Fluttershy squee'd as the massive pile of poop was swirled away, whisked into the sewers below, leaving only the smell of poo and the fat on Fluttershy to indicate she even existed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fluttershy walked out her belly rumbled again and she smiled wide. \"Hmm who should I eat next? she thought.</span></div></div>",

The bakery had customers lined up all the way out the door, today apparently being very busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing up and patiently waiting in line as it moved up, Fluttershy found herself getting even hungrier at the smell of sweets wafting out to her from the open door as the line moved further in. Unlike the ponies in front of her though, her hunger was for something much more delicious than mere sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh my, I guess this is going to be harder to deal with than I thought...</i>\" Fluttershy thought with a grimace, chewing on her lip. She couldn't stop staring at the rump of the pony in front of her, which she absently noted was Derpy Hooves. The deliciously plump bubble butt almost looking more and more appetizing with each and <i>every</i> step Fluttershy and the other ponies took forward. It looked so wonderfully round and full, like a ripe fruit, just <i>begging</i> to be gobbled down, each cheek jiggling slightly with each step Derpy took...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrenching her gaze away, Fluttershy looked around the bakery's front, which was crowded with extra cafe tables set out for more ponies to eat at. She could recognize a few ponies at the tables. On her left were Bulk Biceps, who was enjoying a plate of muffins, and the Cutie Mark Crusaders all digging into a large pile of ice cream. Over to her right was Doctor Whooves, enjoying a sundae and what appeared to be a glass of hot chocolate, a straw floating in it. He noticed the both of them as he looked up from his sundae and waved, then smiled as he took a drink from his chocolate through the straw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy returned the wave with her usual innocent enthusiasm, and turned her head around to look at Fluttershy, having noticed her waving at the Doctor as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Fluttershy! I didn't see you there...\" Derpy said, grinning warmly at her fellow pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh umm, hello Derpy, are you here for your usual?\" Fluttershy asked, trying not to think about how much she wanted to feel the bulge of Derpy's booty going down her throat, and feel her filling out her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm-hmm, I'm on my lunch break, so I thought I would get some muffins to go with my sandwich that I have waiting at home!\" Derpy affirmed with a vigorous nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's nice...\" Fluttershy said, trailing off when her eyes started flicking down towards Derpy's infamous rear again. \"<i>It looks so tasty, I think her butt is at least twice as big as mine...even <b>with</b> Rarity making me a bit fatter. If I ate her I bet it would give me a nice and fat bubble butt too...</i>\" Fluttershy thought, trying not to blush, and swallowing quickly to avoid drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to all this, Derpy Hooves continued to talk to Fluttershy, reclaiming the mare's focus on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you here to get? A parfait? A lemon cake? A banana cake?\" Derpy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I...ummm...actually need to talk to Pinkie Pie about something...\" Fluttershy said, deciding to just keep it simple rather than come up with something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, what?\" Derpy asked, tilting her head curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a secret, you know, private?\" Fluttershy said, her face turning red and squeaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay, sorry\" Derpy said in an apologetic tone, then smiled again. \"Well, nice talking to you Fluttershy, see you some other time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy then turned back towards the line, which she and Fluttershy had automatically been moving along with as they talked. A few ponies had reached the end, leaving Fluttershy and Derpy now inside the front room of Sugarcube Corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes going back down for a moment to Derpy's luscious buns, Fluttershy tentatively reached forward and tapped Derpy on the shoulder.

Predictably, this caused her to bump into the rear of the pony in front of her. Derpy turned around briefly to give a quick apology then turned back to Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we could talk about the thing I'm going to talk about with Pinkie...I mean, if you're that curious I don't mind telling...or...<i>showing</i> you what it is after I'm done with Pinkie Pie...maybe tonight around dinnertime...\" Fluttershy agreed, unable to stop herself from deepening the hole her impulsive offer had dug her into, while she moved forward in line as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh dear, now I might be in trouble. What if Derpy doesn't agree to be eaten? What if I chicken out and then things get awkward? What if she gets mad at me?

I'd love to find out more about you. I never really spend time with anypony, ponies don't seem to like having me around for very long for some reason...\" Derpy said with a happy and goofy grin, then turned her head back around as the mare in front of her in line got her order and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya Pinkie!\" Derpy crowed, giving the baker a beaming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Derpy-Derp, here for some muffins?\" Pinkie Pie responded cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Gasp* How did you know?!\" Derpy asked, her yellow eyes wide with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because everypony knows you love muffins silly!\" Pinkie Pie answered with a giggle, then set down an already made bag of steaming, buttery-soft muffins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...\" Derpy realized with a giggle, then reached down to her saddlebags to dig out some bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Derpy did so, she shifted a bit and automatically took a step backward, which unintentionally buried the still flustered and pensive Fluttershy in-between her plump and soft gray buttcheeks, which compressed around her face like dough. It was only for a moment though as Derpy reversed her previous motion, taking a single step forward as she moved to set down the bag of bits now in her mouth, freeing Fluttershy's now bright red face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go Pinkie Pie! Thanks for the muffins!\" Derpy said gratefully, as she dropped her bits on the counter for Pinkie Pie to pick out the amount needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Derpy, I know how happy muffins make you, and I love making other ponies happy!\" Pinkie Pie said as she swept up the bits needed and held out the bag of muffins for Derpy to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStowing away her bits and taking the bag of muffins in her mouth , Derpy turned herself around to see Fluttershy staring at her with a hot blush still on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'ff your faffe all w-ed Fwuttershy?\" Derpy asked through the bag of muffins, oblivious to what had happened behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a fever Fluttershy?\" Pinkie Pie asked as well, having not noticed what had happened, nor having seen Fluttershy in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">nothing</font>!\" Fluttershy squeaked to them both, her voice cracking from embarrassment and hidden arousal/hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy gave Fluttershy a look of concern, then changed it to a grin again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okie-dokie-lokie Fluttershy! I'll see you later tonight I guess! I've never had dinner with somepony else before, but my friend Harvest says that dinner-dates are really fun!\" Derpy Hooves said cheerfully, then trotted out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that comment, Fluttershy's face was now <i>purple</i>. Looking around the store, she only now realized what she had offered to Derpy would sound like without knowing what she <i>really</i> wanted them to do together, and now Derpy had said what she thought she had meant <i>out loud and in public</i>. Ponies in the store were either blushing or snickering, which only made her embarrassment worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's my line!\" Pinkie Pie called after Derpy in mock upset, then turned to her friend. \"So what do you want to order Fluttershy?...and are you <i>sure</i> you aren't sick? Because your face is just as purple as a plum, or an eggplant, or like when you mix red and blue really well, or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy, too mortified to waste any more time, put a hoof to Pinkie's mouth to stop her, then spoke in a frantic rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie-Pie-could-you-pretty-please-come-meet-with-me-at-my-cottage-afte r-work-I-have-something-<i>really</i>-important-to-ask-you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking with surprise, Pinkie Pie moved Fluttershy's hoof out of the way and answered with eager curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Fluttershy. If it's special enough to make you this excited I gotta know! Are you planning a surprise-\" Pinkie Pie started to guess while closing her eyes in contemplation, only to be interrupted by Fluttershy \"eep\"-ing and the sound of fluttering wings followed by a door being opened and swiftly closed. Opening her eyes, Pinkie saw only a dust cloud in the exact shape and size of her shy pegasus friend where the mare herself had just been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...oh well, I guess I'll find out for sure in a little bit...\" Pinkie Pie said with a nonchalant shrug, then waited for more customers to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy barely remembered the race back home, her mind catching up only after she had slammed the door of her cottage behind her. Panting from exertion, with her face still red from embarrassment, Fluttershy lay with her back against the door, while her animals all stared at her with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...umm, I'm alright everyone, don't worry,\" Fluttershy said, giving her warmest smile. \"I just am going to have a friend over in a moment...and later tonight for dinner\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer birds chirped encouragingly at that while Angel gave her a wink, which made her blush. Harry the bear, Mr. Mousey, and her otters all just tilted their heads in surprise, confused at Fluttershy apparently being so bold all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy couldn't help but smile as her animals nonetheless all gave their various \"words\" of encouragement and praise, her birds landing in her mane and nuzzling into it, while Angel came up to hop up on her back so she could nuzzle him with her nose. To her embarrassment, Angel suddenly gave a couple of sniffs and raised an eyebrow at her. She looked back at him and gave an embarrassed chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...maybe I can get in a quick shower before Pinkie gets here...\" Fluttershy said, then gave Harry a quick hug (trying not to think about the deep inhale she heard him take and the surprised noise she heard from him) and then urged her birds to leave her mane so she could go up to her bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a quick shower and she'd be clean and...not smelling like Rarity and sex...what <i>had</i> she been thinking today? As she got into the shower and turned it on, she answered herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I needed this more than I could've imagined. I should've handled my fetish better from the start, why can't I just be open about things?</i>\" Fluttershy chastised herself, as she had many times before, for her weakness and nerves. She could face down a dragon when it came to her friends, but her own wants and needs she would keep secret for years before finally doing something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fluttershy let the water wash over her, she hummed a tune, and found herself reminiscing about eating Rarity...</span></div></div>",

She figured that Rarity had made her get at least a quarter size bigger in than before, enough to be noticeable but not too excessive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I bet if Pinkie lets me eat her she'll make me <b>a lot</b> fatter...</i>\" Fluttershy thought with a mix of embarrassment and excitement as she gave her otters a pat on the head and went to make tea. Just as it was brewing she heard a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in Pinkie Pie, I'm making tea!\" Fluttershy called from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okie-Dokie-Lokie Fluttershy, and before you ask, I don't need any right now!\" Pinkie Pie said as she entered, giving all the cute little animals a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Pinkie Pie set herself down on her couch, Fluttershy poured herself a cup of tea and carried it out with her. Setting it down on her little table she then turned to her animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, not that you really have to, but could you all pretty please give me and Pinkie some privacy for a while...and maybe when Derpy comes later if it isn't too much trouble?\" Fluttershy asked politely, to which Angel gave her a wink and a nod and hopped out of the room, with all the others following after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so nice that you're so nice to your animals Fluttershy, but why do you need them gone for whatever-this-is?\" Pinkie Pie asked, tilting her head in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's kind of embarrassing...and I don't know if they would understand if I told them yet...\" Fluttershy admitted as she sat down in her armchair, then cleared her throat and went on, \"I'm actually sort of worried about what <i>everyone</i> will think of me with what I want to tell you, especially now. It is really important though, and I <i>need</i> to do something about it. I just hope you'll understand Pinkie Pie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I will Fluttershy, you're my friend, and friends stick with each other no matter what!\" Pinkie Pie answered cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay good, I hope so...because what I have to say is kind of weird...and even though Rarity understood, I don't know if everypony will...\" Fluttershy said, then launched into her explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she give a short one, like with Rarity, or did she give a longer one?</span></div></div>",

I hid it from everypony of course, how could I explain to anyone that I fantasize about <i>eating</i> them like some big and mean monster? So I just kind of kept suppressing it throughout the years, even as it put more and more pressure on me. Somedays it wasn't a big deal and I could ignore it and it would be fine, but others it's felt like I'd go crazy or just <i>explode</i> from the strain of not doing <i>something</i> about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy sniffled as memories of sleepless nights spent screaming into her pillow until her throat hurt filled her mind, looking back at Pinkie Pie who motioned for her to go on with a sympathetic look in return. Clearing her throat and wiping her eyes on her bathrobe, she blew on her tea and then took a sip before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the simplest way to put it is that I've had to fight my own feelings for years, and this morning I just couldn't do it anymore...\" Fluttershy said, trailing off as she wasn't quite sure how to tell Pinkie the second part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie meanwhile was clearly sympathetic to Fluttershy, her ears drooping sadly. To hear how much her friend had been suffering all this time, how much she had tried to deny something about herself that made her happy, it just didn't sit right with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fluttershy...I wish my Pinkie Sense could've sensed this and I could've helped you sooner...\" Pinkie Pie commented sadly, leaving the couch to hug Fluttershy for a moment before pulling back and sitting on the floor in front of her. \"I want to hear more Fluttershy, please continue...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, umm, sure Pinkie...it might be a bit...<i>gross</i> to hear about though...\" Fluttershy warned, but did continue explaining, \"Well, I <i>really really</i> like the idea of eating a pony...and feeling them and their meat inside me as it digests away...and, well, gets turned into poop for me to push out of my butt...just the thought or talking about it gets me kind of hot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that,\" Pinkie said with a slight smile at the now hotly blushing Fluttershy, then scrunched her face up in confusion as something ocurred to her. \"Hey Fluttershy, does getting turned on by eating ponies have anything to do with you being scared of being eaten by dragons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy squeaked at the question but answered with a touch of embarassment, though keeping her eyes on her lap rather than her friend's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, honestly I'm not scared of dragons <i>just</i> because they could eat me...it's more just that they are such big and dangerous creatures that I'm scared of <i>everything</i> they could do to me. Squash me, burn me, slash me...\" Fluttershy shuddered for a moment then went on, \"...that they just seem too much for me to handle like a regular animal, and since they actually are just as smart as we are they just intimidate me too much. Facing down that big dragon that time with my Stare has helped though, so that's good I guess. Why I said \"Eat a pony in one bite\" though was more me sort of...just saying that because I always think about how scared ponies are of being eaten...if I were to tell them about how I feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, I get it,\" Pinkie Pie said, then asked another question, \"So...can you actually <i>do</i> it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy's eyes widened and her head snapped up to look at Pinkie again, she wasn't actually asking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do what, Pinkie?\" Fluttershy asked, uncertain what answer she really wanted to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually eat a pony of course! I mean, we're supposed to eat grass and flowers and hay, and we aren't big enough to gobble each other up. That's why Nightmare Night is just a silly game after all!\" Pinkie Pie answered, giggling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually Pinkie...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I ate her and turned her into my poop, and all of this new fat on my body...\" Fluttershy answered, pushing away her awkwardness now, to the point of even undoing the knot on her robe to show Pinkie her chubby belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...did she taste good?\" Pinkie Pie asked, looking over Fluttershy's new chub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...yes, very good, and honestly I had developed feelings for her that weren't just sexual, and when she figured that out she said that she liked me too and that if that's how I show my love, by eating her, than she would go through with it to the bitter end...\" Fluttershy answered while tying her robe back up, smiling warmly at the memory of her and Rarity's special moment together. Her smile turned more hesitant and a bit apologetic at the next part, \"As I was pooping her out though, I thought about how much fun Rarity and I had had, and how it wouldn't be right for Rarity to be all alone as my poop and fat, so I promised her that I would reunite her with the rest of our friends...so...\" Fluttershy trailed off shyly, hoping Pinkie got where she was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can <i>totally</i> see that!

She was asking Pinkie Pie to <i>die</i> just so she could satisfy her body's urges after all. She turned her head away in her usual shy fashion as she attempted to explain more to Pinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-hem...Pinkie, I just want you to know that I don't intend to force you or anypony into this or make you feel pressured to be eaten, I just want you and the rest of our friends to be as close to me as Rarity is, that is <i>if</i> you're alright with it. I've just been burning up inside over this, and since Rarity actually <i>did</i> accept and even enjoyed doing it with me I just-EEEP!\" Fluttershy squeaked as her attempted placating was interrupted by her bathrobe being undone again and her layer of Rarity-chub exposed. No guesses needed as to who had done it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want <i>me</i> to be food for you too? I'm super duper flattered Fluttershy! I've never been eaten before, but if Rarity could enjoy it than I want a turn too! Besides, since it makes you happy and helps you fulfill that promise you made her, count me in for <i>triple</i>-no wait, <i>quadruple</i> sure!!\" Pinkie Pie chirped happily from underneath Fluttershy's barrel, innocently nuzzling her notable layer of belly-fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ummm...that's great Pinkie, th-thank you for being s-so accepting...\" Fluttershy said, her face burning red as she tried not to express how good it felt for Pinkie to be rubbing against her belly. \"Before we, ummm...<i>get started</i>, do you have anymore questions P-Pinkie?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Because I'd be happy to do it if that's what you want...\" Fluttershy asked, then quietly drank up the last of her tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie, being Pinkie, thought for a moment and then vigorously nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one Pinkie Pie? Do you want to go into my tailhole or into my flower?\" Fluttershy said with only a touch of her usual shyness at what she was saying. She was ready now, and also wanted to make sure all her friends enjoyed this as much as possible, so if Pinkie wanted to go into a different hole how could she say no?

Gurgle me up into fat!\" Pinkie Pie said eagerly, giggling as she bounced over to Fluttershy's chubby rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward, she could see Fluttershy's tight ponut poking out from the valley between her buttcheeks. It was small and the same yellow as her fur, a wrinkly hole surrounded by smooth yellow flesh that led into her furry rump, nestled underneath the dock of her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I wonder if I can <b>really</b> fit in there?</i>\" Pinkie Pie thought, then turned her eyes down further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy's pussy was as tight as her asshole, clearly Fluttershy hadn't had much experience with stallions, which wasn't a surprise considering how shy she was...and this whole \"eating ponies thing\" apparently. Her outer lips were soft yellow, with delicate folds of pink inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Fluttershy, here I come!\" Pinkie Pie said, then pressed forward until her snout touched Fluttershy's butthole. As expected, Fluttershy's untouched pucker resisted her entrance, the ring of muscle compressing against her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnff! K-K-Keep going P-P-Pinkie! M-M-My magic will f-f-fix it!\" Fluttershy moaned out, stuttering from the tension growing in her behind, while she simultaneously concentrated her magic towards her back-end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs requested, Pinkie kept pushing inward, managing to squeeze her snout in a bit deeper before suddenly Fluttershy's asshole twitched and stretched open, taking in Pinkie's head with a muffled *pop*. As Pinkie's head entered Fluttershy's colon, her intestines and her hips widened in order to fit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh...nnnyes!\" Fluttershy moaned again, the pleasure of Pinkie's head stretching out her sensitive virgin pucker overtaking any of the expected pain. Her blood began pumping down to her nethers, making her clitoris engorge and her lips began to moisten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Pinkie, she was surprised at how cozy it was in there. It didn't smell too bad, it was warm but not hot, and the walls around her were constricting but soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wow, so this is what it feels like to be eaten by a butt...it feels kinda relaxing</i>,\" Pinkie Pie thought with wonder, then drew in her forelegs and bent her back ones before pushing herself in deeper, Fluttershy's hole welcoming in her neck and shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Fluttershy's underside, the bulge of Pinkie's head was quite prominent, the fur and skin stretched into a vague shape just about where Fluttershy's little teats were, which in turn made <i>them</i> much more visible. Her nipples were hard, poking out from their furry mounds like toothpicks in a dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy's ass now began to suck Pinkie in on its own, muscles clenching and squeezing her in as the folds of yellow flesh of her tailhole crept over her folded forelegs like a python over a gazelle. The voracious pegasus' lower body was now ballooned out with what was basically half a pony now, and the mare herself was in quite a state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ooohhh...hnnngh! It feels so <i>good</i>! I should've done <i>all</i> of this <i>sooner</i>!....\" Fluttershy groaned out in ecstasy, her mind filled with a fireworks show of pleasure that was traveling straight from her sensitive insides, as they twisted and shifted to bring Pinkie deeper into her body. Her sex was partly open now, her clitoris winking out at each jolt of pleasure from the space above it. Her fluids were now dripping out like juice from a fruit, the clear liquid meant to lubricate a stallion's cock now simply making a slippery and wet puddle on Fluttershy's floor. Not that she was in any condition to notice or care...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was really starting to get into this whole \"being eaten\" thing, it was certainly making Fluttershy happy, and that was pretty much the number one thing in her mind. Along with that though, the walls of Fluttershy's intestines, the way they were gently massaging onwards towards the stomach was quite relaxing, and couple with the heat it almost felt like some sort of spa treatment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I hope at least one of our friends agrees to do what I am when it's their turn...I bet Applejack might like it, with how hard she works she must get really sore all the time...</i>\" Pinkie Pie thought, her mind getting a little sleepy now, she might just take a nap...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pinkie's chubby belly was squished inside, Fluttershy's formerly tight tailhole began sucking her in more forcefully, quickly inching its way over her hips and soon framing her fatty rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Pinkie...Mmmm...you're so wonderfully pudgy...I bet you'll make me so <i>fat</i>...\" Fluttershy mumbled, the thought exciting her more now that she had already experienced the results of her hunger for ponies. Her wings were fully extended and her pussy was pouring out more fluids beneath her, enough that she could feel it staining the fur around her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight *squelch* as Pinkie's chunky rear was squeezed inside Fluttershy's ravenous booty, Pinkie's three party balloons disappearing behind Fluttershy's butterflies. After that, it was only a minute or two before Pinkie Pie's back legs and tail were slurped in steadily, chasing the path of their owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before the hooves and tail disappeared though, Fluttershy hit her peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaah! YESYESYESSSSsss...\" Fluttershy shrieked and hissed out without restraint, her mare-honey spurting out of her to add to the puddle beneath her, turning it from clear to a milky yellow. Her orgasm made her clamp down hard and bend over further until her chin nearly touched the floor, that final clench pulling the last of Pinkie in with another *pop*, sealing her inside to be pulled into the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, Fluttershy pucker tightened back up, and her body slowly began to shift back to more normal proportions as Pinkie was pulled closer and closer to the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....ahhhh...hmmm...that was amazing Pinkie Pie, thank you so much. I never knew that could be just as good as with my mouth...\" Fluttershy said, as she rolled over onto her back next to the puddle of her own juices. Her gut area was subtly shifting the mass in it further and further onward, but it overall appeared to be just a huge yellow misshapen orb on Fluttershy's body. Fluttershy stroked it gently with her hooves, just like she had with Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Pinkie Pie, she was squeezed out into the somewhat roomier stomach with relative ease, her butt squishing into the fleshy floor and the pooling acids. She giggled as she felt them tingle slightly, it tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowee Fluttershy! That was really fun! I see why Rarity sort of liked it if being eaten the other way was like that too!...Can you hear me? Yoo-hoo, Fluttershy?\" Pinkie Pie called from within the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy jumped a bit at Pinkie's quick response, her swollen belly muffling it only a little bit. She recovered quickly though, and smiled happily that things had gone as she had hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Pinkie, don't worry, I can hear you...just so you know Pinkie, I don't think we'll be able to really talk this over, since I need to let out your air so that you don't feel yourself digesting...I'm sorry...\" Fluttershy said regretfully, then took a deep breath and let out a *brrp* which was also followed by a *frrt* from her rump, which made her blush bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh right, I guess that makes sense, the air wouldn't all come out of my mouth when a pony enters <b>this</b> way...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Pinkie Pie heard all of it (except the gas that is), and nodded her head affirmatively. She understood that, and she <i>had</i> considered a little nap earlier...though this one probably wouldn't end now that she thought of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy watched as Pinkie's form in her tummy settled itself down and stopped moving. Since Pinkie was now where she belonged, Fluttershy decided to get to work on making a little something, either for just Derpy or herself as well if she said no to being dinner, while her belly got to work on her meal. Oh, and cleaning up this puddle she was laying in too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so, she found herself thinking eagerly of eating more ponies, and in particular her hopes of eating Derpy that evening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mmmm...I bet she'll feel so good inside me...I can't wait to taste her delicious buns...</i>\" Fluttershy thought, her cheeks reddening again as her hunger surfaced...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThat evening...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fluttershy was quite pleased with herself, and the dinner she'd made. It was a simple but pleasant spread, buttery rolls and a mess of assorted carrots, lettuce, onions, pea-pods, and other vegetables all steaming on their plates. Along with that was a basket of cinnamon-flavored muffins for dessert all set in a small basket covered by a checkered blue and white cloth. She liked cinnamon, and she hoped that Derpy didn't mind it in her muffins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had been busy with dinner and dessert, Pinkie had digested nicely. It had been a bit of a chore getting and using her cookware with her large gurgling yellow belly wobbling and bouncing in front of her like a basketball whenever she stood on her back legs to handle them (making the bread and muffins had been particularly interesting, what with the mixing sending her belly swinging too and fro like a pendulum), but she had managed without anything bad. Along with the sounds of her rolls and muffins baking, and her vegetables boiling in the seasoned mixture they were stewing in, were the sounds of her tummy grumbling and churning away at Pinkie's pudgy form. Her belly had steadily gotten smaller and smaller as the hours went by and evening descended on Equestria, its wobbles turning to sloshes as Pinkie was turned into thick meaty goo that was then slurped down into her intestines to be drained of every drop of nutrition and water that it could, and the results spoke for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy's belly had swollen quite a bit, the furry yellow ball of fat jiggling cutely with every step, when earlier it had been just a slight layer of give to her middle. Fluttershy's buttcheeks, which had previously been just a bit rounder and fuller from Rarity, now were the size of melons, her hips having widened a bit as well to accommodate her much fuller rear. Fluttershy had also noticed that compared to Pinkie Pie's bouncy booty her own butt was still somewhat firm as well as fat, being much more rounded and solid rather than doughy and squishy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she set the table she felt something in her bowels shift, followed by a growing pressure in her plothole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" Fluttershy said in worry, clenching her anus tight and hurrying to finish setting out her spread, \"Please Pinkie, just wait a bit longer and I'll let you out...\" Fluttershy blushed hotly at her words, and then swept her and Derpy's plates of food onto her quaint little dinner table. She <i>knew</i> Pinkie couldn't hear her but politeness was as innate to her as having wings was, and the playful reminder to herself that the weight in her bowels was the only thing left of her other than fat was making her cute little clit wink from inside the sizable valley of her bottom, though she knew she'd have to wait a while before she could play with her cooter any more. She was about to go to the bathroom and <i>then</i> have a guest after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all of the food was set out on the table and the kitchen was cleaned up (she had already gotten the living room mopped and the carpet cleaned of her fluids before she started dinner), Fluttershy rushed to the bathroom, both out of desperation and excitement. She had a friend to say goodbye to after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quickly shooting up the stairs and into her bathroom, Fluttershy immediately sat her expanded butterfly booty down on the toilet seat, her tail lifting and her ponut stretching out from between her cheeks in preparation. She could feel how much poop Pinkie Pie had made, as her colon felt <i>quite</i> full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Pinkie Pie, here we go!\" Fluttershy said cheerfully, then relaxed her internal muscles. This was followed immediately by the head of the first log Pinkie Pie had become poking its way out of her tailhole, the fat turd stretching out Fluttershy's pucker as it snaked bowl into the bowl. In response, Fluttershy couldn't help but let out a \"Hnnn!\", and scrunch her face up rather cutely as she pooped out Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds of the long and thick brown coil of waste coming out it finished and the tail-end splashed into the toilet. What followed next was a pair of loud (but oddly sweet-smelling...) farts that echoed in the toilet bowl-*PPPRRTT! FFFWWWRRRTT!!*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...that felt <i>so</i> good...and yet I still have so much more...\" Fluttershy said softly and giggled, playfully squishing her fattened ass into the toilet seat, causing it to squeak against the porcelain. Fluttershy then resumed disposing of her friend, another turd pressing out of her back door, just as long and wide as the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes to better focus on the feeling of disposing of yet another friend, Fluttershy quickly adopted a blissful smile as the next log inched its way out to join the first, avalanching out of her butthole to plop down on top of the thick mass below it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my...\" Fluttershy said, peering down between her legs to see what she had produced so far. The two long and thick turds had curled around the bottom of the bowl in loose spirals, leaving only the outer edges of the white surface visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I <i>still</i> don't feel empty...\" Fluttershy said incredulously, rubbing at her still full-feeling guts. Deciding to step things up a bit, Fluttershy shut her eyes again and scrunched up her face, then began to push. Grunting (or as close to a grunt as she could get anyway...) Fluttershy first released a long and loud *<i>ppppupupuppprrrrrrrrrttt!</i> of gas, which was followed by a quick feeling of moving weight in her anus and then the next log was pushing its way out of her pucker over an inch before it too simply avalanched out into the pile she had already made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued smoothly for the next couple logs, each length as large and long as the ones before, and all being pushed out in a long stream by the increasingly red-faced and sweaty pegasus. Unfortunately, this was not to last, as the final and sixth turd was even bigger and fatter than the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnnnn...uhhhnnn...\" Fluttershy groaned out as she pushed with her bowels, only for the waste to only start to poke out of her hole before stopping. She stopped when she felt a sharp pressure against her plothole, most likely the logs wider length hitting at her anal walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh..huff...oh my Pinkie, I'm sorry but you <i>have</i> to come out now...you're pony poop now, and you can't stay inside me anymore...\" Fluttershy panted out, then grit her teeth and gave a single strong <i>push</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did it thankfully, Fluttershy moaning loudly as her anus stretched wide and the last bit of Pinkie-waste inside her sliding heavily out into the bowl, signaling the end of her first (but not last) Earth pony meal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*hwoof...heff* Wow, I guess it's a good thing I ate Pinkie with my butt...or that might've really hurt...\" Fluttershy said as she peered between her legs to look at the mound of stinking (yet still with an odd hint of sweetness) brown poop now filling her toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like with Rarity, there wasn't a single trace of Pinkie to be seen in it, and about the only odd thing that you might say came from her would be that odd sweetness. Other than that though, this was simply a pile of abnormally thick and large dark brown ropes of waste stretching and coiling in loops all around inside of the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...I hope Pinkie doesn't clog it...\" Fluttershy said with a sad frown, then reached for the toilet paper on the wall beside her. Ripping off a few sections (less than with Rarity, since she had been a lot messier) and rubbed away at the hole nestled between her cheeks. Once her tailhole had been cleaned, she dropped the folded and dirty paper on top of the pile of poop and put her hoof on the flusher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please Pinkie, just go down...please don't clog my toilet...\" Fluttershy pleaded as she bit her lip and pushed down, causing the toilet to roar and the mess to start floating as water rushed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy breathed a sigh of relief as well as satisfaction when part of the mound was sucked away with a thick and heavy *gluk*, the long coils of waste being rushed and squeezed down the hole leading into her plumbing a bit more slowly and steadily than a typical bowel movement. Apparently Pinkie only <i>just</i> fit down the pipes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for being my food Pinkie, you felt fantastic going up my rear, and you felt even better coming out of it...I promise the rest of our friends will join you and Rarity soon...say hi to her for me!\" Fluttershy said with a smile and a wave as she flushed the rest of the mess down, watching it spin around and around in the whirlpool of toilet water before being sucked down to join her first meal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy couldn't help but laugh at the thought that she'd just done to Pinkie what the party pony often did with cakes and sweets, and now Pinkie would be broken down and washed away just the same as Rarity almost certainly had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe...mmmm, my friends are so wonderful...I wish I had decided to go to Rarity sooner...hmmm, I guess Pinkie added some chub to my face too?\" Fluttershy said to herself, halting her pondering as she looked up and into the mirror while washing her hooves in the sink. Pinkie had apparently also made her originally average cheeks become round and plump, adding a bit of adorable doughyness to her soft and delicate features. She gently squished at the cushy additions on her face, giggling at the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess now I just wait for Derpy...though I doubt she'll be much longer, and I-\" Fluttershy said thoughtfully, only to be interrupted by a knock emanating from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttering her way down the stairs and to her door, Fluttershy cautiously set herself against it and opened the door a crack. Peeking out with one of her beautiful teal eyes she saw...</span></div></div>",

Rarity became a little scared, knowing what this sensation meant. She pushed against the stomach wall to get Fluttershy's attention. \"Fluttershy dear, could you let me out now? I think digestion starts to set in soon.\" Indeed, a small pool of green juices was slowly forming underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy felt the sudden push and looked down.

The white unicorn could feel herself being pushed out of the stomach, much to her relieve, and make her way back out of the esophagus. The shape of Rarity's head was visible in Fluttershy's neck again as she coughed up her friend. Soon enough, Rarity entered her friends mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy opened her mouth and Rarity's horn poked out from between her lips, followed by the rest of her head. Rarity was covered in saliva and a bit of digestive juices by now but since she was out of the stomach she was out of danger. With some difficulty, Fluttershy managed to press Rarity's shoulders out of her throat again and as soon as her front hooves were free, Rarity helped Fluttershy by pushing herself out. As Rarity's dock was inside of her mouth again, Fluttershy couldn't resist giving her friends marehood a delicate lick, causing the unicorn to moan in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few short moments later, Rarity's hind legs were dropped to the ground again and she could pull the rest of her tail out. Rarity was lying in a small puddle of saliva and digestive juices. Outside of Fluttershy's stomach they were not so pleasurable anymore. \"Phew, I need a shower more than ever. But I loved that experience.\" Proclaimed Rarity, before giving her friend a seductive glance. \"Would you like to join me in the shower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy nodded enthusiastically and followed Rarity into the bathroom. Rarity was swaying her tail, giving Fluttershy a good look of her haunches and pussy. Together they stood under the showerhead, after the water started running, they began to make out. Rarity already explored the inside of Fluttershy's mouth and now it was time to explore the inside of Rarity's. Their tongues danced together, wrapping around each other while the two mares softly stroke each others backs as Fluttershy stood on two legs against the wall, Rarity leaning against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Rarity broke the kiss and went lower, licking Fluttershy's neck, chest and belly before arriving at her delicate marehood. Fluttershy began to breath faster and heavier as Rarity started to suckle at her clit. Rarity's tongue lapped at her pussy as she sucked at her friends clitoris. Eventually Rarity went deeper and buried her tongue deep inside of Fluttershy's wet slit, invading it with her tongue. Fluttershy was loudly moaning in pleasure at the sensation, as Rarity also started to massage her teats with her hooves, Fluttershy couldn't hold it anymore, with a loud moan her juices were spilled right into Rarity's eager mouth. The unicorn mare eagerly lapped up all of Fluttershy's love juices, diligently licking her pussy clean while she recovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're still hungry Flutters.\" Fluttershy opened her eyes again and saw that Rarity has turned around and bowed down to present her haunches to the pegasus. Fluttershy put her hooves on Rarity's flanks, softly massaging them as her tongue went to work. She gave Rarity the same treatment as she received at first, getting pleased moans from her friends. Then she got an idea. Using her hooves, she spread Rarity's flanks and went higher towards Rarity's anus and licked across it. Rarity was surprised by this but still loved the sensation, moaning even louder. Fluttershy inserted her tongue into Rarity's rectum, licking at the inside of it while taking one hoof from Rarity's flanks and starting to clop her off. It took only mere moments before Rarity screamed in pleasure and spilled her own love juices over Fluttershy's hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they have recovered from their orgasms, Fluttershy and Rarity continued their shower, occasionally sharing a few displays of affection for one another.</span></div></div>",

Fluttershy sauntered slightly as she walked, wings fully erect and her flower dripping as her greatest fantasy was coming to a close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity begged and pleaded with her friend for parity but eventually the churning noises of the stomach got too loud for her to try to cry out over. She whimpered as she felt her fur begin to melt off, as the lack of oxygen choked her to the point of passing out. Fluttershy felt this happen and let out a small sigh of relief, at least her friend wasn't suffering any longer. She let out a large yawn, followed by a smaller burp as she broke down Rarity's body for nutrients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to retire for sleep she climbed the steps of the boutique and found Rarity's lavish room, climbing into her bed she rubbed her loudly gurgling stomach until she fell asleep, and as she slept the bulge in her midsection grew smaller and smaller until it was the size of her normal stomach, plus a new layer of fat.

Yes, there was definitely something wrong with the look of his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just couldn't quite put his claw on it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight whinnied and reared, this time not so beautifully backlit \u2013 although clearly visible to his reptile eyes \u2013 jabbing a forehoof in a direction that, as his gaze followed it, identified their fleeing prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with a flap of her great wings, she leapt into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could smell the fleeing ponies' fear, and it intoxicated him. They knew if he and Twilight caught them, they'd die brutally. The thought delighted him, and would've even if their scent hadn't made them easier to hunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoaring his passion to the raging sky, he bounded in pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two of them, the fleeing ponies, one each for Twi and he...</span></div></div>",

I know you have a lot of work to do.\u201d</span> Twilight called over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d</span> Spike muttered as he continued the arduous task of organizing the new library. The castle\u2019s library contains copies of every book in the royal archive, which basically contains any book of note ever written. It was refreshing that Twilight didn\u2019t have to go out and specifically order the books she wanted anymore, but unfortunately, organizing all these extra tomes was a nightmare. The cyclopean crystal walls of the library were like a winding maze, and Spike got dizzy just looking at it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Twilight was having the time of her life poring over various ancient tomes that she had never even heard of before. She had been testing out new spells all day- most of them duds. But eventually, one of them was bound to do something interesting. She was sure of it. So eager was she to start studying that morning, in fact, that she skipped breakfast. She was getting a little hungry, she noticed. Maybe it was time to take a break for lunch. Just as she had that thought, a delicious smell overwhelmed her nostrils, like roast veal. Being a herbivore, the smell of meat usually didn\u2019t appeal to Twilight; but for some reason, right now, it seemed mouthwatering.Twilight turned her nose to the air, taking in the smell, curious as to its origin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cSpike, are you cooking something? It smells great,\u201d</span> Twilight called towards the kitchen, only for the dragon to appear by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cWhat? No. I\u2019m still organizing the library,\u201d</span> Spike gave her an odd look. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cI don\u2019t even smell anything.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stared at the dragon, and realized that the smell became stronger the closer she was to him. Could he be the source of the smell? Perhaps that spell wasn\u2019t a dud after all? Maybe it was a fragrance spell, like the ones Rarity uses? Whatever the cause, he smelled delicious. She took another whiff of the air, closer to him this time, and the smell of veal overtook her. Her empty stomach grumbled loudly, demanding something to fill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cUh\u2026 what are you doing?\u201d</span> Spike raised a brow, taking a step back from the hungry mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cIt\u2019s you. You smell\u2026 delicious,\u201d</span> Twilight said, her eyes closed in bliss at the simple smell, and her stomach grumbled so loudly this time that Spike could hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cWell, I\u2019m not on the menu,\u201d</span> Spike rolled his eyes. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cWe can go down to Sugarcube Corner if you're that hungry.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could respond, Twilight, no longer thinking clearly, sent a lick along his cheek. Even the small hint of flavor she got from that was divine. Apparently, he didn\u2019t just smell delicious-- he <i>was</i> delicious! <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cWhoa, gross! You\u2019re acting really weird, Twilight,\u201d</span> Spike said, bringing his hands up to push the mare\u2019s face away, only for his hands to be engulfed by something soft and wet. He opened his eyes to realize he had accidentally shoved his hands in her mouth. He tried to pull them out, only for the mare\u2019s lips to clamp down on them as she savored the flavor. Twilight was stunned. This was the best thing she\u2019d ever tasted! Her mind clouded by the effects of the spell, she decided on one course of action and one course only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight jerked her head backwards, bringing his head and shoulders into her mouth as well. Before Spike could react to anything that was happening, she reared her head back, lifting the small dragon into the air. As gravity began to pull him deeper into the mare\u2019s gullet, Spike instinctively pushed his claws against the skin around the entrance to her throat, trying to keep himself from being pulled inside. He dared to open his eyes, and before the enveloping saliva could force them shut again, he got a terrifying glimpse down the mare\u2019s throat, which yawned open as if beckoning him to crawl inside. If he really did get pulled into her throat, he wasn\u2019t sure he would ever get back out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cCome on, Twilight! This isn\u2019t funny,\u201d</span> he yelled as he began resisting with renewed energy, but his complaints fell on deaf ears. Twilight was in a state of ecstasy she\u2019d rarely felt before. For all her life, she was always worrying about something. Always second guessing her every action, analyzing every situation. Always trying not to disappoint Princess Celestia her whole life made her a bit neurotic. But in this moment, all of her inhibitions melted away. For the first time in years, Twilight felt the bliss of being truly comfortable. She didn\u2019t have to worry about anything, or try to impress anypony. She just had to relax and enjoy the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike, on the other hand, was not so comfortable. Quite the opposite, actually. His calls were silenced as Twilight's throat muscles gripped tightly on his snout, and he finally realized that she wasn\u2019t just joking around, in her own typical weird Twilight way. She was actually planning on swallowing him whole! This epiphany came a little late, though, as by this point she had closed her mouth around his feet, and his arms and shoulders had joined his head within her throat. He felt her throat muscles undulate and pulse unnaturally around him, slowly pulling him deeper into her esophagus like a conveyor belt. Soon, he was entirely within the mare\u2019s throat, and it clasped so tightly around its prey that he couldn\u2019t even move a muscle. Worse than the discomfort was the helplessness- all he could do was stay immobile, and wonder what kind of fate was awaiting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight\u2019s throat bulged to almost impossible proportions as the dragon slid down it, his descent assisted by a combination of gravity and her repeatedly swallowing. Eventually, the bulge in her throat disappeared into her chest, and Spike was deposited into a slightly roomier chamber. It was large enough for him to move around in a bit, and the walls and floor was covered in flowers, vegetables, and strange juices. He quickly realized he had entered Twilight\u2019s stomach. Fortunately, being a herbivore, Twilight\u2019s stomach was only made to digest plants, flowers, grass, and the occasional pastry. Her stomach acids were completely ineffective against Spike\u2019s tough scales. A supply of oxygen leaked in through the stomach lining, so luckily he could breathe in his new fleshy prison. So he was completely safe, at least, if incredibly disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sat on her haunches, rubbing her distended belly, a warm smile on her face. The dragon fit snugly in her stomach; to an outsider, it would look like she was simply a few months pregnant. Spike wriggled a bit, getting comfortable. The soft, smooth walls, the sauna-like heat and moisture, and swadling effect of her distended stomach subtly shifting back and forth like a cradle made it downright relaxing. <i>It\u2019s not all that bad... I almost wouldn't mind staying in here for a while,</i> Spike mused to himself, before quickly dispelling those thoughts from his mind. Maybe the spell was messing with his mind, making him relaxed and submissive to his fate? He had to stay focused! He began pushing at the walls of her stomach, making visible bulges in the mare\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cTwilight, can you hear me?\u201d</span> He yelled, his voice muffled dramatically by the thick stomach walls.<span class=\"cgreen\"> \u201cThe spell\u2019s messing with your head, Twilight! Snap out of it!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the influence of the spell was lifted, and Twilight could think rationally again. Well, as rationally as she possibly could considering the circumstances. She looked down at the bulges in her belly, and felt nauseous. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cOh\u2026 dear\u2026 \u201d</span> Twilight gasped. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cI\u2026 knew that some of the spells in this library would be dangerous, but I never would\u2019ve expected\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cTwilight, what the hay kind of spell was that?\u201d</span> He yelled, his voice muffled dramatically by the thick stomach walls. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cIs there some kind of reversal spell that can get me out of here?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cI don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no precedent for something like this,\u201d</span> Twilight stuttered, a bit light-headed. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cAre you okay in there? You can breathe, right?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cYeah, I\u2019m safe in here. It\u2019s just really nasty.\u201d</span> He said, though he actually felt quite relaxed. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAren\u2019t you a super-powerful alicorn now? Can\u2019t you just teleport me out of here?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cI\u2019ll try, but it\u2019s a little dangerous when I can\u2019t physically see you.\u201d</span> Twilight said. She looked down at her distended belly and felt a twinge of the instinctive joy of maternity in her heart, as if she was a pregnant mother. It was a pleasant feeling\u2026 but she couldn\u2019t let it distract her. Her horn lit up the dull crystals with lavish magenta coloring as it glowed brightly, as she concentrated on trying to teleport Spike safely out of her stomach.</span></div></div>",

Then, he was lifted slightly, feeling the non-meat digesting fluids drip off of him a little. And with that, any daze he had before was gone, as he now was moments away from escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"Yep, that's me,\"</span> Spike affirmed to Twilight. Might as well make sure she knew her magic was grabbing the right thing. With that, the magic suddenly hardened, completely enveloping the dragon in light, his vision also being filled with the familiar light. And then, in an instant, a few sensations came to him. One was the almost chilling air in comparison to the inside of Twilight, one was the much fresher air (though he still bore some of the stench of her insides), and another was the light of the outside world. It kinda stung after his brief trip into the dark abyss that was Twilight's stomach, but his eyes soon adjusted. He looked behind himself, and saw Twilight's grin, albeit clear nervousness in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Guess that wasn't quite a dud...\"</span> she noted, her face silently begging Spike to find some kind of humor in this. However, Spikes' nervousness came out more in the form of a blank expression rather than a grin, his eyes darting around as if trying to focus on anything other than what'd just happened. Soon, Twilight too darted around for something to focus on. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Sooooooo...\"</span> Twilight's nostrils suddenly picked up the smell that lingered on the dragon. Perfect, a diversion. Spike soon got the message when Twilight brought a hoof over her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"I should really shower-\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yeah, I-I think a shower would do nicely.\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shared another nervous glance at each other, before Spike slowly backed away, eventually making his way to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stood outside of the door, hearing the showerhead running, steam seeping from the door. She nervously clopped at the ground as she stood by the door. She just couldn't get her mind off of that stuff earlier... especially as the shower seemed to reveal that yummy smell from before. As mouth watering as it was, it just reminded her of that horribly awkward silence after Spike was let out of her stomach. She felt like if they tried to move past this issue, they'd never be able to properly move solve this issue. Maybe... maybe they had to talk about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Sooo... didn't know I could fit that much...\"</span> Twilight began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"I-is now really a good time to talk about this?\"</span> Spike asked from the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"No, it really isn't,\"</span> Twilight admitted. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"But if we push it off, I'm not sure we'll be able to, you know... conclude? I just feel like we're gonna ignore it, but there's always going to be that tension...\"</span> After that, there was a pause, before Twilight heard the shower stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"Alright, so we wanna talk about what happened?\"</span> Spike asked.<span class=\"clgreen\">\"From my perspective, your spell made you want to eat me, you swallowed me whole, and I just spent the last half hour scrubbing your lunch off of me. Sounds like a succinct summary to me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, yeah, from a strictly physical point of view that's what happened...\"</span> Twilight admitted. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Though... I couldn't help but feel something else going on...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"What do you mean?\"</span> Twilight had to be careful here. If she worded this wrong, she might've revealed some... interest in Spike's unfortunate position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, I just figured a more analytical approach might be helpful here,\"</span> Twilight fibbed. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"I mean, it isn't every creature that escapes a trip to the stomach in one piece.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"Mhmm...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"So, I guess I was wondering... How did it feel in there?\"</span> Twilight couldn't see it, but Spike's eyes widened in surprise. What the heck was she talking about? How did she think it felt?! Spike was about to shout as much at her, but then he remembered the brief... calm. The sauna-like atmosphere, the gentle lull... Would that be a normal thing to feel? Or would he be weird for admitting something like that? Spike's snark faded for a moment as he considered his next words.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Point was, he wasn't sure what he was going to do, but he certainly wasn't expecting what was coming. He took a few paces out of Twilight's home, when suddenly, he heard a frantic clopping of hooves. He turned towards it, just in time to see a vague pink blur rushing towards him. Faster than he could yelp, the blur slammed into his chest, yanking him off his feet and onto his back, the force of the tackle dragging him through the dirt several feet until the two forces came to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike was dazed by the initial hit, his vision filled with an explosion of colors as he's left to get his marbles back. When he did, he was soon greeted by an odd sight, even for the subject in question. Leaning over him, he saw a certain pink pony with a poofy pink mane, the ecstatic pony wildly sniffing over him while her hooves are at either side of his shoulders. Spike groaned and tried to nudge Pinkie's muzzle away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"Pinkie, what are you doing?\"</span> the dragon asked. It would be a silly question to ask most of the time, but this was weird even for her. Despite his nudging, the pony simply leaned in close and kept sniffing, her pupils thin as she lauded in the strange new scent. Despite that, if her next statement was anything to go by, that didn't seem to dull her demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Oh, I just smelled something funny,\"</span> she said. <span class=\"cppink\">\"Well, not funny, I suppose it's more funny that I smelled it out here at all. No, it was more yummy wummy. I dashed to it thinking it was some super duper supper, but then I wound up slamming into something scaly. And that was you!\"</span> That didn't quite explain enough for Spike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"What smell? I didn't smell anything,\"</span> Spike said, again trying to nudge Pinkie away again. But Pinkie again ignored the gesture, and now buried her nose against Spike's chest, sniffing greedily. Spike shuddered a little, Pinkie's nostrils tickling him a little. Pinkie let out a contemplative \"hm\" as she brought up her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"Did you do something to your scales?\"</span> she asked. <span class=\"cppink\">\"You smell dessert-y!\"</span> Spike, realizing his pushing wasn't convincing Pinkie, flipped onto his belly and started to crawl away, grumbling to himself. However, his motions were stopped when Pinkie lowered herself, the front half of her body pinning down the majority of his. When she did that, Spike grit his teeth, clutched the ground, and tried to pull himself free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"What the hay are you doin' Pinkie?!\"</span> he asked as he fruitlessly pulled himself. His question was partially answered when Pinkie buried her nose against the back of his head, and loudly sniffed his scent, which only caused the dragon to wriggle more. Things only got worse when he could swear he felt some saliva dribble onto his back. <span class=\"clgreen\">\"P-Pinkie! Did you just-?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"I can't help myself~ You made yourself smell too good~\"</span> she practically moaned out. Spike tried to glare at Pinkie from over his shoulder, which was halted when he saw her lower her muzzle towards her neck. And then, suddenly, her tongue darted out, starting at the base of his neck, before she dragged it up the back of his head and behind his ear, the little dragon freezing up and his expression falling to a combination of shock and disgust. He couldn't believe she actually... <span class=\"cppink\">\"Mmm~ Even tastes good~\"</span> Her muzzle again lowered to his neck, and he felt her lips coil around a patch of it, suckling softly as her tongue kept lashing out at whatever bit of flesh was exposed to her. Spike blushed and his toes curled as he felt her almost intimate suckling on his sensitive neck, a nervous shiver running along the length of his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">\"Pinkie... that feels <i>really</i> weird...\"</span> he said, practically pleading her to stop. With a pop, Pinkie's lips came off of Spike's neck, and she nuzzled against his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">\"I know it's not super TV-Y, but I can't help it! You're driving me crazy!\"</span> Pinkie squealed, one hoof wrapping around his front possessively. Her tongue lolled out again and she buried it against his cheek, and slowly dragged it up the side of his face, the dragon frozen with terror. He felt extraordinarily uncomfortable about this. He didn't know what Pinkie meant about his smell or his taste, but all he cared about was this weird tasting and suckling thing! If he felt this weird about this, he couldn't imagine how awkward it must look to everypony else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just after the defeat of King Sombra, a large feast was held inside of the palace of the crystal empire. All the crystal ponies were shimmering, showing of their name-giving crystal-like skin. At the head of the table was the dragon who brought them back their crystal heart, which repelled the dark unicorn who wanted to take over the empire yet again. Spike has become the most important hero of the empire on that fateful day. His friends were also celebrated for their help, Spike still remained the most important one of them though. Twilight Sparkle was sitting next to the old mayor of the empire, a red shining mare named Ruby. \"It is really monumental that our empire was saved for good, by a dragon no less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Twilight had to stop for a moment. She knew dragons could be scary but there was something about Ruby's tone of voice that hinted at something more going on here. She decided to prod carefully, trying to find out more about this. Come to think of it, she noticed that sometimes the crystal ponies had flashed Spike an almost fearful look before he saved the crystal heart. \"Say, what is so special about a dragon saving the empire? Dragons did work together with ponies in history... occasionally.\" Twilight then looked at her hooves, still sparkling with their new found crystal shine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby shifted nervously in her seat, looking nervously at Spike, who was still enjoying the party. She then returned her gaze to Twilight and went closer, whispering into the purple unicorns ear. \"Well, maybe for regular ponies but the thing is very different with crystal ponies. You see.... we have coats, encrusted with crystal, dragons eat gems, you can pretty much guess how things were between the crystal empire and dragons.\" Ruby couldn't help but shudder a little at the thought. Twilight also became a little paler in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a line of ponies came inside, a large, buff stallion, a petite mare with the body of a fashion model and a chubby looking mare. All of them looked around and immediately started to grin as they spotted Spike. They approached Spike and bowed down to him, making the small dragon feel a little awkward. \"Oh great hero, we know we couldn't thank you enough for what you did for us so a small group of ponies gathered and we were the most fitting candidates to give you the treat of a lifetime as thanks for saving the entire empire.\" Said the buff stallion, looking at the small dragon with deep admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby meanwhile started to look very nervous and hissed into Twilights ear. \"Are they going to propose what I think they will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came as the buff stallion continued to speak. \"Everything we own wouldn't be enough for saving us from that tyrant so we will offer even more. We know more than anypony else how much dragons love to eat gems, so we three offer ourselves to you, as a meal.\" The entire room went deadly silent as he said this, everyone stared in shock at the three crystal ponies. After a while though, Spike broke the silence with loud laughter. \"Oh man, for one second you guys really got me, good one.\" He said between giggles, believing them to be joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three ponies looked at him awkwardly, their grins disappearing. \"We are not joking, we would have had to endure a lifetime of slavery if you hadn't returned the crystal heart. It is only fair that some of us give their life to show you their appreciation. Don't worry, we volunteered for this.\" Now Spike stopped to laugh, he knew they were serious. \"You really want me to...\" The three crystal ponies that offered themselves only nodded. Spike looked nervously around the room, thinking of what he should do. On one hand, those crystal ponies would die if he ate them, on the other hand, he did wonder what they taste like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Opal looked and smelled delicious to the hungry dragon, which was surprising since he\u2019d only ever eaten jewels before. \u201cDragon\u2019s don\u2019t eat cats, do they?\u201d Spike thought as Opalescence sensed something was wrong and started to wriggle uncomfortably. Maybe it was just because he hadn\u2019t eaten his cake yet, but right now the feline seemed more appetising than any gem he\u2019d eaten before\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Opal, I\u2019ve got a good idea for a punishment\u2026\u201d Spike said, smiling mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was certainly different than eating gems, a lot more warm and squirmy, but Spike still enjoyed it, and was almost purring as he gulped down more of his delicious snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t enjoying the process one bit. She kicked and struggled all the way down, trying desperately to escape the predator\u2019s smelly and moist jaws. Opal meowed in protest as sticky saliva dripped into her eyes, but Spike only responded with more pleasure filled noises. He was clearly enjoying his meal, which was of little consolation to the cat as he devoured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that it was time to finish, Spike sucked in the cat\u2019s tail like a strand of meaty spaghetti and GULPED as hard as he could, sending Opal down to his waiting belly. He lifted a paw to feel the wriggling bulge as it went down his tight throat, eventually landing in his stomach and filling him up instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike belched loudly and patted his stomach where Opal lay, kicking and struggling inside as his belly started digesting and absorbing her soft body. \u201cmmm, that was much tastier than boring old gems\u201d Spike said, the smell of cat still on his breath. And luckily for him, the whole house was full of nice, little critters for him to devour next\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He reluctantly grabbed the blankets and covered himself up, trying to convince himself that it wasn't time yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BWWWAAAAAAUUUUURRRRRPPPPPPP!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell now it was no denying it, if what he just head from the other room told him anything. He through the covered off his bed, jumped down and rubbed his eyes as he made his way to the castle kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pancakes sizzled in the pan and Spike flipped them through the air, a fresh stack of pancakes already set up next to him, fifteen layers in total with enough maple syrup and jam for each layer. A steamy cup of coffee and hot chocolate also ready for breakfast as Spike finished his last pancake. He grabbed both plates and began to set up for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike later relaxed in his chair as he waited for Twilight, taking a sip from his morning hot chocolate. The cushions made from the softest cloth available, and the chairs made with the strongest wood available, which was especially needed considering the weight Twilight had gained from her diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the purple alicorn herself walked into the dining room, groggy and tired, her stomach pudgy and her flanks even more so. Spike reckoned they were as wide as he was tall, which was due to happen considering her pony diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Twilight, Coffee's on the table.\" Spike said as the alicorn took her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Spike.\" She said as she took a sip of her beverage, sighing on relief as she placed the drink down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we begin?\" Twilight asked, Spike nodded and cut a slice of his much smaller stack of pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ate primarily in silence, Spike understanding this because Twilight still tried to wake herself up. He knew she was more of a night pony then a morning pony, so it was no surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you stole another midnight snack?\" Spike asked Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, study sessions always make me hungry and I didn't want to wake you up.\" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who was it?\" Spike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just some young stallion walking through town by himself, so I just followed him until there was no one around and had myself a little bit.\" Twilight explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep that up and that chair's going to break.\" Spike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny Spike.\" Twilight said back, the two sharing a little chuckle as they ate their breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Twilight told Spike she would clean up from her last night study session and the dishes, and that he should be back before dusk. She gave him a list of things she would want with the dinner tonight and gave him a bag of bits to get the items and a few things for himself.

Truly a great honor!\" The mare said, pronouncing herself loud enough the guards on Canterlot walls could hear her.

Dinner is ready!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike waited a minute before the purple mare herself walked into the dining hall, taking her seat and eying her dinner, her flanks filling out the seat to max capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Spike, exceptional as usual.\" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome.\" Spike said, biting into a gem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike continued to eat his bowl of gems, watching the sight of Twilight devouring another pony in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight lifted the pancake, bringing Creamy Cookie up with it as it wrapped around her, the ice cream band whip cream all joining around her. Twilight licked her lips before opening her maw wide, wide enough as to take in the ponies head, which still had a small topping of whip cream with a cherry on it. Twilight's magic brought her meal forward before engulfing the mare's head into her mouth, and started to lick the sauce and topping off the mare's face, moaning at the delicious taste of her meal. She soon swallowed  her throat enlarged with the image of the ponies face showing through it, he shoulders now being licked and covered in saliva by Twilight's tongue. It was here the Twilight had also started to eat the pancake, and started to eat the fluffy base with light nibbles as she swallowed one again, taking the mares shoulders into her throat. Twilight was in heaven from the taste of the toppings mixing in with the mares fur and natural taste, and licked the mares chest until it was fully cleaned of toppings or cream before swallowing once again. Twilight chew through the bottom pancake and swallowed the piece before starting to lick all over the belly, causing the legs outside her mouth to twitch and move around from the sensation. A slight bulge could be seen in the already pudgy pony belly that belonged to Twilight. Twilight tilted her head up so gravity would assist in the swallowing, the flanks and legs hanging limp outside of her mouth. Twilight began to lap at the caramel sauce covered flanks before swallowing once again, bringing more of Creamy Cookie inside her stomach, creating a larger bulge in her stomach and her flanks into Twilight's mouth, leaving only her legs and tail outside. She swallowed again, bring the legs into her mouth before all that was left outside was the tail. Twilight slurped it like spaghetti and took the largest and loudest gulp, fully sending the mare down to her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stomach bulged out, the mare inside still moving around inside causing grumbles and gurgles from the stomach, and all the gas built up into a Monstrous loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPP.\" ;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, you truly know how to make a mare happy Spike.\" Twilight said, licking the remaining cream from her lips and taste left by the delicious.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stood up from her seat, her stomach sagging towards the ground and made her way out of the dining hall, Spike following behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were soon in a small room, a desk with papers, documents and shelves galore, a desk expected for the princess to use for royal duties, and in the corner a large beanbag and in another, a large comfy care, fitted with the finest cushions in Equestria. Twilight went for the beanbag and laid back, her gut sagging to the ground as it began to digest the mare inside her stomach. Gurgles and churning could be heard inside of it. Twilight rubbed it with her hoof but she knew it wouldn't be needed as Spike pulled a still that sat in the room and sat himself in front of Twilight, and began to give her stomach a massage with his claws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight truly felt at peace right now. Another mare was adding to her figure and her number one assistant was massaging her stomach as she digested Creamy Cookie. She thanked Princess Celestia and Luna for teaching her on the privileges of being a Princess of Equestria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed as the bulge in Twilight's stomach soon decreased until on a little bit of bulge could be seen over the original layer of fat.

He had been wrapped up in string candy to the point where he couldn't move. He tried to reach and down and bite through it but found that his snout had been tied up to. His bed also felt weird, almost like a leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon whatever was covering him came off and light shined through, spike was able to see around him and looked in shock. He was one a plate of lettuce and had been served on a plate, but that what wasn't the scariest thing in here room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering over him where his six friends, except they all looked extremely different. They each had a dark look, their grins filled with charm pointy teeth, their pupils shrunk to a size almost unrecognizable and saliva dripped from their mouths. All of they, looked down on the Drake, and each licked their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike tried to speak but the rope candy prevented him from doing so. Soon he saw Pinkie chew through the ropes, but could run as he was gripped in purple magic and hovered above the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, yummy dragon...\" He heard Twilight say, but it didn't sound like a twilight at all. It sounded almost like a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck are you guys doing!?\" Spike yelled.<br>\r\n\"What do you think stupid dragon?\" Fluttershy said, her shy demeanor gone as he saw her stomach, bulging hugely with a serpent like body pushing against the edges, a goats face occasionally popping up there and again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn fact, he noticed a lot of his friends had bulges underneath them. Applejack and Pinkie had the largest, what looked like a whole family was in each of their stomachs. Rarity and Rainbow had the smallest bulges, looking like a small bulge with a filly inside each. But Twilight had no bulge underneath, and she was drooling ferociously, her tongue constantly licking her lips, her stomach loudly growling for something to fill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls...you didn't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! And they were delicious...\" Pinkie said, hissing the last sentence like a snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, tastes like chicken.\" Rainbow said, belching orange feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now all that's left is one little, delectable dragon.\" Twilight said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Spike, we won't miss you.\" Twilight said as she opened her mouth wide and threw Spike in with her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight!\" Spike screamed as he was thrown into the large mouth, watching the world be replaced with pink games and slimed walls as he fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd fell.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd fell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike screamed as he woke up in a cold sweat. He took in deep breathes, gasping for air as he checked his surroundings. He was back in his bed, in the castle, across the hall from Twilight's room, no demonic friend gone nuts. Just him, in his bed, sweating from a horrible nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid back down in his bed, trying to get back to sleep. But found himself soon floating out of his bed, covered in a purple magic aura, and towards Twilight's room. Spike was immediately reminded of his nightmare as he floated towards the voracious mare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe floated into the room to see Twilight laying on her side, her horn magically glowing, a wide smile on her face. Spike immediately began to struggle in the bonds.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No! No! Don't sleep eat me! Please don't sleep eat me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what is this?</span></div></div>",

Spike was confused and looked up to see Twilight looking down on him, a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tw-Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you from your room Spike. Were you having another nightmare again?\" Twilight asked, a caring, almost motherly tone in her voice.

You had tied me up and put me on a plate, the girls had eaten their families and then you...and then you...ate me, like I didn't mean anything to you.\" Spike said, tears beginning to swell up in his eyes. Twilight rubbed his back and brought him closer into the furry hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Spike. I would never do that to you. You mean to much for me.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You mean it?\" Spike asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it must be a bit scary for you, having to live with six mares who eat any moment might gulp you down. But I promise you we would never harm you. You do so much for us, and have done so many things for us without expecting anything in return. Your my little dragon, your our little dragon, and we will never harm you. You were my first friend Spike. I hatched you and from that day you have been with me, every step of the way. From magic kindergarten to Nightmare Moon to Discord to Chrysalis to Sombra to Tirek, you've always been their for me, ready to help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike's eyes began to water again, but not with dear, but with joy. He smiled at his guardian as he nuzzled himself into her fur coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Twilight.\" He said, his voice muffled. Twilight smiled and closed her eyes, patting him on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you to Spike. I love you to.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends soon began to fall asleep, enjoying the warm embrace as they held each other, knowing that they would wake up with someone by their side. Spike finally felt to slumber with a grin on his face, knowing he was never alone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pffft</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" </span></div></div>",

Before they could ask they already got the answer. \"Right now the elements of harmony bind Discord in his stone prison but the problem is, the elements are bound to you.\" She began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that a problem?\" Asked Rainbow Dash, who was confident that she could do anything required to wield the element of loyalty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a problem because you are all mortal, when you die one day the elements would have no bearer and Discord will be free again.\" Now it dawned upon them, as long as they lived Discord was safely sealed away but when they are dead nopony would be able to stop him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a way to make you immortal though, by turning you all into alicorns.\" Announced Celestia, leaving Twilight and her friends with their mouths agape, never did any of them hear that this was even possible. Twilight immediately asked the princess how this is supposed to be possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a very... strange process. Basically I would have to...\" She stuggled with the last words that could forever changed the way these little ponies looked at her. \"I would have to unbirth you.\" An stunned, awkward silence filled the room as Twilight and her friends tried to process what they just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, beg yer pardon?\" Asked Applejack, who tried to think if this was really what she thought it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I will have to... shove you into my vagina so you can be reformed in my womb.\" She looked at them with fearful anticipation.</span></div></div>",

Nervously, Fluttershy approached the Princess, who bent lower, causing her marehood to part slightly, giving the present mares a look inside of her. A sweet smell hit Fluttershy's nose as she came to a halt, directly behind Princess Celestia and her heart pounded like crazy in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shaking, yellow hoof was raised and poked against the wet labia and Celestia had to suppress a small moan. Another hoof quickly followed as Fluttershy started to push herself in and Celestia had to grit her teeth as the shy pegasus's head entered her marehood. Fluttershy was intoxicated by the enticing smell all around her. Now that nopony could see her head anymore, she couldn't resist licking across the inner walls and sampling a taste of the Princess's juices. Celestia could no longer keep it down and moaned in pleasure as the wriggling Pegasus licked her from the inside, rubbing her delicate tongue all over the walls of her marehood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight decided to help them and went behind Fluttershy, gently pushing her. The unicorns head was red, witnessing this ritual and knowing she would be the next, disappearing into the womb of her teacher. Slowly but surely, Fluttershy's body slipped past the labia with a wet slurping noise, leaving a small pool on the ground. Celestia panted heavily, catching her breath, before turning to Twilight. \"Thank you my student, would you like to go next?\" Twilight looked at the parted lips of Celestia's pussy and the bulge in her belly, showing that Fluttershy was already curled up in the womb.</span></div></div>",

A shiver of pleasure went down Luna's spine as the felt the hooves inside of her. For a moment she just enjoyed the sensation, before slowly lowering her rear. Twilight kept her hooves outstretched, causing them to be pushed deep into Luna's womb. The Princess of the night was not almost sitting down as Twilight's head rubbed against her wet cunt, covering her in the juices and causing Luna to moan in pleasure. They stayed like this for a moment, before Luna let herself fall on top of Twilight and pushed her head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia could not help but feel aroused as she watched her pupil disappear into her sisters cunt. Luna had her head now and slid backwards, while her pussy started to slurp up Twilight. Soon, both of her rear hooves were slurped up by the labia and with two down, there were four more ponies left.</span></div></div>",

They will suffer greatly. Only then can the Elements be Reborn as Alicorn.

You, my student, need a pegasus and an earth pony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight didn't want to ask, but now it was morbid curiosity.  \"The... dose, is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia looked into her student's eyes.  \"You don't want to know.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight glared back.  \"I have to know.  We all need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie bounced.  \"I don't!\"  <br>\r\nRainbow shrugged her wings.  \"Actually, yeah, maybe it's better we don't know, Twi.\"<br>\r\nFluttershy, predictably, mumbled something about it being ok.<br>\r\nRarity, for her part, had full faith.  \"It's the Princesses, dear, whatever it is can't possibly be terrible, can it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left Applejack, and Twilight looked to her. <br>\r\n\"Ah... ah'm sorry, Princesses, but... ah guess ah gotta know too, not that ah get none of that magic stuff, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sighed.  \"I understand.  But the process must be started... Luna, since both of these faithful fillies are to be your foals, it falls upon you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're leaving?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sooner we begin the process, the safer for everyone.  I must do it in the heat of the day, which is running short, while Luna has all evening to explain to you, my student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Celestia left, with Pinkie, Rarity and Fluttershy following.   RD shrugged again.  \"Guess I gotta hear this too.  Booooo-ring,\" she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwi and Applejack looked at one another, before Twi turned to Luna.  \"You will explain, please, Princess, the cost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, we willst,\" Luna replied.  And she did, in methodical detail.  How each of the three would become inserted, full-size, into her womb.  How they would then be un-matured down to a fetal stage.  How, if all went according to plan, the six would be reborn Alicorn foals, with their memories restored magically after their second birthday (by which time they should already be matured).  Then Luna took a breath, and looked away from the trio (by this time, even RD was paying attention, sorta).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Luna spelled out, explicitly, the true cost.  How each of them would become Alicorn, but at the expense of two lives a piece.  Twelve sacrifices in total.  Approximately every two months, both Luna and Celestia would consume, whole, a living, full grown mare of the proper type, in order to imbue the missing traits upon two of their unborn foals.  And, how upon their birth, their diet would consist of carved up stallions, until they were grown enough to dine \"properly\" so that they could mature correctly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H... how many,\" Twilight finally asked, horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna admitted she did not know, but she knew the answer was in the dozens... and Celestia, born in a time of plenty, had eaten more than Luna had, which granted Celestia her greater stature and power.  Luna was born during a famine, and ponies were a bit harder to come by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be a hundred lives... given for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be even more,\" Luna admitted, still looking away from the trio.  \"Never before hath there been so many ponies in Equestria available.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah think this is nuts,\" Applejack said, snorting.  \"T'aint worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna didn't turn to face AJ.  \"Thou art wrong, Applejack, but we doth understand.  Consider, a hundred, given to protect millions in the long future.  The cost, tis true, high.  Yet, thou knowest one must sometimes remove a tree from thine orchard, so that the others might thrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there is no other way to preserve the elements?\" Twilight asked.  \"None at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nay, there ist none.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three ponies glanced at each other, with a frown on each face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash looked between Twilight and Applejack.  \"I don't know what to do,\" she admitted, looking down first.  \"You two are both way way smarter than me 'bout stuff like this.  You know what's right and what isn't, when both choices isn't.  I trust ya... whatever you both decide... I'll trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked upward.  \"It is... a horrible choice.  But if there is truly no other way to protect Equestria...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twi!\" Applejack said, aghast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, AJ.  I mean... I get it.  Morally, it's bad, ok?  It's like murder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T'aint just LIKE murder.  Ah don't believe what ah'm hearin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To save the millions of ponies in Equestria... and the billions that will be born after them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight,\" Applejack said, as she stared down at the floor and kicked her hooves</span></div></div>",

And although it was still far too early for there to be any noticeable effects, all six ponies were starting to feel uncomfortably warm. Worst of all, none of them had any idea what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept apparently, Pinkie Pie. \"Wait! Idea!\" Suddenly, her mane and tail poofed back out to their normal volume (in all the excitement, they had deflated without anyone noticing). She grabbed Celestia's horn with one of her front hooves. \"Pinkie Pie, darling, what <i>are</i> you doing?\" Rarity inquired nervously, noting party pony's somewhat manic expression while trying to clean herself off. \"I am just about to be <b>brilliant</b>!\" came the eager reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie trotted up to a confused looking Twilight Sparkle and, without any warning, repeated the maneuver she had performed on the princess, snapping Twilight's horn clean off at the base.

To everyone's surprise except Pinkie's, a golden aura enveloped the treat, which floated up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash was the first to speak up. \"What the <b>HAY</b> just happened?\" Pinkie giggled as she snatched the piece of candy out off the air and popped it in her mouth. \"Isn't it obvious silly?

Phase one of my plan to save Equestria from burning like one Sweetie Belle's glasses of orange juice is a complete success!\" Twilight stared at her old horn for a moment as it lay on the ground, completely inert, before snapping out of her stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um that's nice Pinkie, but her horn alone isn't going to let me move the sun and moon. Yes, it makes me <i>powerful</i> enough to move them, but I don't have the <i>energy</i> to move them all year round while we think of another solution to this problem.\" \"What in tarnation are you talking about Twi?\" Applejack inquired. \"I thought you unicorns got your magic from your horn.\" Twilight nodded. \"That's true. But we need energy to convert <i>into</i> magic. Yes, my magic is much more powerful now, but my personal reserves of it are the same they've always been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy spoke up. \"So, um, does this mean Pinkie's plan won't work?\" Pinkie laughed. \"Of course it will you guys! Switching Twilight's horn was just phase ONE! There's still <i>way</i> more work to do!\" \"Alright,\" Twilight said, \"You seem to have a plan. What is it?\" \"It's simple!\" Pinkie replied. \"After we make it so that you can reliably raise the sun and the moon, our long term goal is to find a way to either preserve the elements of harmony without anyone getting eaten or anything like that, OR! to find a way to destroy discord, preferably also without anyone getting eaten.

Even if she didn't have her magic anymore, she could still fly, and she would still be enormously strong. And if Pinkie Pie was any indication, they couldn't be sure that Luna wouldn't just find a way to reattach it. \"Good idea.\" Said Twilight. \"Applejack, why don't you take Pinkie to Luna and bring her back here so we can work this out.\" With that done, AJ nodded and galloped out of the throne room, followed by a bouncing Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, they returned, Applejack dragging Luna's now headless body by her ethereal tail, and pinkie balancing Luna's hornless head on top of her own, while holding her horn in her mouth. After depositing the disassembled princess parts, everypony turned to Twilight. \"What now Twi'?\" asked Applejack. \"Well, when Pinkie took my head off my body, I could still feel and control it until she attached me to Celestia's body. I think we'll have to attach somepony else's head to Luna's if we want to avoid her making too big of a scene. The only problem is, who should we use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do they pick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Twilight rubbed her eyes and realized she was in Celestia's castle, or at least just outside of it. She flew up and looked around. It didn't look that different from her own home. She decided to go find the princess. She was excited to learn what this dimension had to offer. She walked around for a bit and already noticed a big difference from her Celestia's castle. There weren't any guards at all. <i>Maybe they have the day off?</i> she thought to herself. She went around a corner and bumped into something.<br>\r\n\"Hey, who are you?\" A familiar voice said. Twilight looked at what she bumped into to see that it was princess Celestia herself!<br>\r\n\"Hi, my name is Twilight Sparkle.\" The purple alicorn responded.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's nice to meet you, but might I ask why an alicorn such as you has come all the way to Equestria?\" Celestia asked. Twilight smiled and told her about how she became an alicorn and how she was from a different dimension. She told her about what her home was like and different events that happened to it. Princess Celestia listened carefully and nodded as she spoke. She didn't seem to react much. Celestia then smiled. \"Why don't you join me and my sister for dinner? It would be a shame for you to come all this way for nothing.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, that sounds great!\" Twilight said and happily followed her. As they walked, Twilight still looked around to see no guards at all. \"Where are all of the royal guards?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't need guards. Unlike your Celestia, I am strong enough to protect the castle by myself. Now, about your spell, I have heard of it, but I have never tried it myself. Seeing you though, and hearing about your land makes me want to try it as well.\" Twilight nodded. She though about where this dimension's Twilight was, but decided to ask later. They got to a dining hall with a pretty big table. \"Stay here, while I get my sister. I just know she would like to meet you.\" Celestia left, while Twilight looked around the room.<br>\r\n\"Too bad the others couldn't be here, this place is pretty interesting.\" After a few minutes, Celestia and Luna came in.<br>\r\n\"I'm back Twilight, and I have a special question for you. . . .</span></div></div>",

'Rain-Blow Dry'?\" The awkward chuckle she got was answer enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Rainbow, what do you do here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Dash took a moment to process the question. \"Oh, I'm just visiting. Rarity, Pinkie and I were planning on going home tomorrow.\" Twilight raised an eyebrow. \"Really? Applejack made it sound like you and the others lived here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow simply shrugged. \"You must have misheard or something.

I coulda sworn she said she was going back home yesterday. Course, I lost track of everypony pretty quickly. Rarity was all 'business dresses business' and Pinkie went off to do, uh, Pinkie stuff I guess.\" Rainbow shrugged. \"You must have just missed her or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you don't live here,\" Twilight said, \"What are you doing here?\" Rainbow shuffled uncomfortably for a bit. \"Uh, did your world have an incident with a baking competition and a half-eaten cake?\" Twilight slowly nodded. \"And it was all because Rarity, Fluttershy and I were jerks, and then Pinkie went and ruined the competition anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, that <i>did</i> happen in my dimension.

What...\" She had a bad feeling about this question. \"...What punishment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow glanced off to her sides. Satisfied nopony was listening, she merely whispered \"You know,\" and subtly stroked her throat a little. An awkward silence followed as Twilight awaited further explanation. None came. Instead, the pegasus slowly began to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean... you don't... yours doesn't...\" Dash looked as if she were on the brink of tears as she held back her laughter. \"Y-you know, you should just go see her now. Really. Go. You wouldn't want to keep her waiting past dinner.\" And just like that, Rainbow was left rolling on the floor in laughter as Twilight slowly backed away, confused and slightly frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\nTwilight stood trembling at the door. The message was simple, but nervewracking. <i>'Her Highness is waiting for you in her private chambers.'</i> This was it. The moment of truth. She <i>knew</i> that this dimension's Celestia had to be like the sweet, motherly ruler she knew, but Rainbow had left her second-guessing this assumption. <i>Did the spell not work? Is this just a misunderstanding? Only one way to find out, I suppose.</i> Slowly, she opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, my dearest student,\" said that familiar, soothing voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay. Good. This is good,</i> Twilight thought as she stepped inside,<i> She's calm, she's referring to me as </i>her <i>student, it's okay. Everything's going to be okay. Right? Right.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in. You've had quite the journey, I hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight barely noticed as the princess used her magic to close the doors and set aside the young mare's saddlebags. Instead, she was focused on the sight before her. The lighting was as dim as the dusk outside, with the brightest light coming from a warm fireplace. Celestia sat before it, lounging on some cushions placed on the floor. The ceiling was dome-shaped, and was painted like a starry night sky. To the side, she could see a massive, opulent four-poster bed alongside a vanity dresser. The princess looked over her shoulder, and silently encouraged Twilight to join her by the fire.</span></div></div>",

The energy needed to be contained, but I couldn't risk a sealing spell or moving her to another part of the castle. I'm sure you know the dangers of magical flares.\" Twilight nodded. \"I did something that may come as a shock to you. I needed to protect both her and the bystanders while the flare ran its course, so I did something drastic. I swallowed her whole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's thoughts came to a complete halt.\"You... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to speak with a reassuring tone, Celestia continued. \"It was something I occasionally did as a sign of closeness or as a test of trust, but never with any malicious intent. In fact, before that day, I had never done it under such extreme circumstances. My body took the full force of the flare, preventing any further harm to the others. Before long, the little filly exhausted her powers and fell asleep. Ever since, she has told me that no place in the world feels safer than my belly. That feeling of closeness and trust...

Uh, how often have you eaten my friends... and I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It so happens that you've been in my stomach more times than anypony in all of Equestria's history.\" Celestia replied. \"I suppose that's why I've taken to mixing in some other ingredients; when somepony's flavour becomes familiar to me I like to experiment to find what compliments them better. As to your friends Applejack looks like a most appetising pony but I've yet to find a good time to indulge in her, but Rainbow Dash has been in my belly three times so far and Rarity's only gone down twice now. Fluttershy's quite a delicacy and I've managed to eat her five times now but Pinkie Pie's almost made for my dining table.\" She gave her prospective meal a wink. \"I must've stuffed her down my throat eleven times by now. Rainbow Dash has a rather spicy tone to her, Fluttershy's like potato salad in a way but with her own flowery taste, Pinkie Pie's essentially a walking sponge pudding and Rarity's got this sweet canape-esque flavour. As for you, my delectable student,\" She rested a hoof on Twilight's shoulder, \"You're more along the lines of a club sandwich stacked full of flowers and smothered in mozzarella.\" Twilight still felt somewhat anxious knowing that she was gonna be gobbled up by her own beloved Princess but the casual nature of it all helped to dampen her fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I have a cheesy flavour,\" Twilight asked, \"Why do you want to put whipped cream on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pony flavours aren't so easy to pin down.\" Celestia explained. \"I remember once I ate your maths teacher when she came to me fussing over your style; she first tasted like banana cake. A few months later she came back with a request to leave her role as a maths teacher and become one of the palace staff, so I obliged after a thorough discussion and ate her again to indicate that anypony in my service is more likely to be my food than those who aren't so intrinsically linked. That time round I had a pot of tea on standby to wash her down, but she tasted of strawberry jam and clotted cream that time round. You can't be sure what you'll taste of each time I eat you.\" Twilight thought this over and came to a conclusion.</span></div></div>",

Celestia then casted a spell on Twilight, making her pass out. When she woke up, she had trouble moving. She looked behind her to see that her wings were tied up with her front hooves. Her back hooves were also tied up tightly. She tried to look around. It looked like she was still in the palace, but something was very different. Everything was huge! Suddenly, she could hear a door open and a familiar voice started to speak. \"Did you enjoy your nap? I hope you did because it's almost time for lunch.\" Celestia stepped in front of Twilight, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so big? Are you really going to eat me?\" Twilight asked. Celestia nodded and gave her a small lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very tasty, like a basket of strawberries, but yes. I will eat you, that's why I shrunk you, so you could be inside of my burrito without being harmed.\" Celestia turned Twilight around. Twilight saw that Celestia had the ingredients for making a burrito. The tiny alicorn was forced to watch Celestia make her future edible prison. It was a simple burrito, it was some cheese, lettuce and beans on a tortilla. Celestia then lifted Twilight up with her magic and set her right in the middle. \"Don't worry, you'll have company.\" Twilight was confused until she saw a shrunken Fluttershy emerge from the princess's hair. She willingly flapped over to Twilight and laid next to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fluttershy? What are you doing? Aren't you afraid?\" Twilight asked, feeling her friend's soft fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, of course not. She has eaten me five times so I'm used to it. In fact I asked for this, I wanted you to feel more comfortable.\" Fluttershy said, giving a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want me to feel comfortable, then why am I tied up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can't have you escaping. After all, you did run from princess Celestia.\" As Celestia listened to her two living meals, she started to wrap her food up. It was loose enough that the ponies had a little wiggling room, but tight enough to the point where they couldn't escape. She then wrapped the two ends up, closing their escape. She was very happy with her work, knowing that two cute and delicious ponies were inside, ready to be devoured at her command. Meanwhile, Twilight had calmed down. Though she couldn't see anything, Fluttershy was with her, so she was ready. The whole place started to rumble as Celestia picked them up. She chomped away at the burrito with no mercy. After the third bite, Twilight and Fluttershy could see Celestia's open maw. \"Are you ready Twilight? You are about to be devoured by Celestia herself.\" Fluttershy said. Twilight nodded in response to her question. As they entered the giant mouth, Celestia's teeth came down, separating them from the rest of the burrito. As soon as they landed on the tongue, Celestia could feel them. She made sure to be extra careful. Celestia swirled them around, tasting and massaging them with her tongue. She hoped her visitor from the other universe was having fun. Luckily for her, even though she was tied up, Twilight was having a lot of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really exciting!\" Twilight said and laughed. Fluttershy nodded and hugged Twilight. As Celestia started to tilt back, Fluttershy pointed to the back of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here comes the next part, it'll comfortable, I promise.\" Celestia swallowed them, giving a small burp. For Twilight, it felt a little weird, feeling the chewed up pieces of salad and cheese, but Fluttershy wasn't lying. It felt soft and nice. They landed in the princess's stomach acids. To Fluttershy, it felt like a nice hot tub. After a few minutes, Celestia finished her burrito and teleported the two ponies out, like she promised. They landed on the table, still shrunken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my faithful student, how did you enjoy the ride?\" Celestia asked, winking at the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It felt so awesome! It was like an amazing but calm ride. It felt really nice being safe inside you!\" Twilight said excitedly, as Fluttershy untied her. Twilight then looked up at Celestia.</span></div></div>",

Princess Celestia floated it out of her hooves and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my little pony.\" And gestured with a hoof to indicate that she could depart. \"Perhaps I should eat her again soon, anyway. At least she should calm down when it becomes clear that she's not gonna die in my digestive system.\" With that a butter knife floated off the tray bearing all the other confections and the tub of chocolate fudge opened in mid-air. \"Rarity, would you be so good as to put on Twilight's cream wig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, princess.\" Rarity answered with a bow. At that point Twilight felt the first layer of chocolate fudge being spread up one of her forelegs, causing her to shudder both from the cold and the implications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are rather prompt with these requests.\" Celestia remarked in response to Twilight's shudder. As she spread the chocolate fudge over one of Twilight's legs Rarity floated the whipped cream right over Twilight's head; Twilight soon knew the minutes were ticking away as she felt the foam-esque sensation of the cream on her scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess,\" Twilight asked, \"Wouldn't I be a bit rich with all this chocolate and cream?\" At this Celestia giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, Twilight, I once ate ten ponies dripping in honey and jam for breakfast, and I had three griffons smothered in camembert on the side. I think I can manage a chocolate fudge unicorn sundae.\" Celestia once again licked her chops in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten whole ponies?!?\" Twilight cried more in astonishment that terror, to which Celestia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a biology study session for you and some of the other students; one of the griffons was your biology teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not,\" Twilight gasped as she thought back to her school years, \"Monsieur Pancras?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The very same.\" Celestia held a hoof to her mouth as she salivated at the memory. \"Such avian goodness, quite possibly bacon and eggs with feathers.\" By now all of Twilight's legs were smothered in chocolate fudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what about the other two griffons?\" Rarity asked as she waited for further instructions on how to decorate Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His wife and the Griffanese ambassador.\" Celestia replied. \"The former was his personal request and the latter was a demonstration of where I put POWs whenever war broke out. It's particularly brilliant since they know I could program enzymes to dissolve my prey any time I want.\" Twilight looked really frantic now, fearing that the indulgence would cause Celestia to lose control and begin digestion on those she didn't intend to. \"Relax Twilight, I've been eating ponies for over five thousand years so I know how far I can go.\" She now used the spreading in the fashion of stroking. \"Rarity, could you do an outline of Twilight's cutie mark? I'd like to keep it exposed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, princess.\" Now Twilight felt the combination of the precision spraying of whipped cream on her flank and the spreading come stroking with a butter knife covered in chocolate fudge on her back; she was now coming to terms with the fact that her beloved mentor was looking at her as food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's a scrummy pony, then?\" Celestia giggled as she finished spreading chocolate fudge all over Twilight while Rarity gave her a beard made of whipped cream. The only purple bits left were her tail and possibly her cutie mark, even her horn was covered in cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may, princess?\" Rarity chanced. \"I think some sprinkles on the back of her neck and a couple of wafers to make it look like she had stubby wings would finish off your sundae.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a wonderful idea.\" Celestia beamed with gastronomic joy. \"If you could do the wafers I'll add the sprinkles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is it.</i> Twilight thought with uncertainty and anticipation. <i>She's sure to eat me within the minute.</i> She felt a strange solid sensation on her back as Rarity stuck the wafers on and then a slight tickle went down her spine as the sprinkles rained down on the mixture of chocolate and cream. \"Princess, won't the carpet get all messy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think nothing of it, my succulent student. I'll lap up as much as possible and the cleaners will take care of the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You surprise me, princess.\" Rarity remarked. \"Have you never tried to eat somepony elegantly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, now and again,\" Celestia replied in a tone that suggested that any more wise-cracks about etiquette and elegance and Rarity'd be back on the menu, \"But it's much more satisfying to let yourself go with the kinds of meals you have to swallow whole.\" She smacked her chops with gusto; Twilight knew for sure that the time was upon her with the ravenous way Celestia was looking at her. \"Only one last thing, Twilight. Shall I swallow you tail first or head first?\"</span></div></div>",

On the one hoof going in head first would provide the opportunity to study Celestia's insides with a clarity she never thought possible before; on the other hoof, going in tail first would allow her a few last words for both Celestia and Rarity as she went down. Eventually Twilight managed to squeeze a reply out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tail first, I guess. Maybe I could offer some insight into the sensation of being dragged down your throat, Princess?\" She was clearly shaking her knees and elbows as she thought about what was coming. Celestia's look of ravenous predation became tempered with one of reassurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would I ever meet a version of you who wouldn't be so studious?\" She remarked as she promptly levitated Twilight into the air, causing her snack to yelp. Twilight felt herself being swung round and round as Celestia began her indulgence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, Princess,\" Rarity commented, \"I really didn't think you could be such a connoisseur with ponies.\" Twilight managed to give her a glance of bewilderment. \"I have heard that the first bite is with the eye, but you seem to be regarding her more along the lines of a fine wine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way ponies are like wines.\" Celestia replied. \"Every one has their own signature taste. I suppose it's like your cutie mark, it's all part of what makes you special.\" Twilight's discomfort with her situation ebbed a bit at this as she thought about this comparison. \"Of course, the second important thing about wine-tasting is...?\" Twilight found she was no longer being swung about but was now orientated with her back to the floor and her hind legs pointing to Celestia's muzzle. <i>So, now's the time.</i> She mused. <i>I really am Princess Celestia's food.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aroma.\" Rarity answered Celestia's question. Whereupon Celestia began to take deep breaths through her nose, slowly rolling Twilight round again to take in the scent of every part of her unicorn sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite right.\" Once she was done Celestia gave one last lick of her chops that was rather uncharacteristic where Rarity was concerned regarding how loudly she did so. \"And now we get to the flavour itself.\" Twilight looked down her barrel at this, expecting Celestia's tongue to come reaching out to its latest guest, instead Celestia had one last thing to say before her mouth would be otherwise engaged. \"Any questions before you go in?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"N...Not really, Princess.\" Twilight felt uncomfortable as she said this, knowing it would mean immediate consumption. But Celestia's expression of eager hunger was now mixed with a warm motherly tone as she gave her just a few more words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, my delectable student. It's time for tea.\" At this Celestia's mouth opened up with comparatively little sound, however there was a happy groan emanating from her throat as her tongue emerged, almost like Twilight was receiving the red carpet treatment just after a torrential downpour. She couldn't help but tense up as she found herself moving closer to the waiting maw, her tail now most certainly the nearest part of her to Celestia's mouth. Twilight decided she should make the most of her last moments outside of Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity, how was it for you when you last went in?\" The mare in question seemed taken aback by this and didn't answer until Twilight felt a sharp but not unpleasant tug on her dock as Celestia's tongue wrapped round her tail and pulled her in with more vigour than she anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rather like a trip to the spa.\" Rarity replied. \"The muscles in her oesophagus caress you as though you're receiving a massage to every part of your body. Her tongue probes every nook and cranny, releasing the tension wherever it reaches. And then there's the soothing warmth and humidity in her stomach that's somewhere between a sauna and a bath. Why, for an act that's almost eccentric it's simply divine, albeit typically inconvenient.\" Once she'd finished Twilight felt Celestia's lips close around her hind hooves, the tongue have released her tail and now slurping the chocolate fudge of her legs as they were pulled in. For all the instinctive fear she felt Twilight had to agree that Princess Celestia's tongue really drew out the tension in her muscles, but figured it just made ponies easier to swallow. \"So, does the Celestia you know enjoy the occasional pony?\" Twilight gave Rarity a glance, expecting it to be the last for the day and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never known the Princess to ever look upon someone as though they were food.\" Just then she noticed her hind hooves were brushing against something else inside Celestia but before she realised they were in contact with the tonsils the first gulp occurred, drawing her in right up to the knees. At this stage Celestia's levitation spell slackened off and her head rose as a passionate yummy sound rang round those same hooves. \"Have you ever known the Princess refusing to eat someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only Princess Luna as far as I'm aware.\" Rarity replied. Celestia neglected to say anything on account of her mouth full of unicorn and not wishing to upset Twilight's journey by nodding or shaking her head. One more gulp and Twilight's rump found itself resting against the lower lip, her legs firmly sealed behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess this is goodbye.\" Twilight mentioned to Rarity, having little else to say at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's not goodbye.\" She answered. \"It's only <i>au revior</i>.\" Rarity's smile coupled with the sensations of the gullet's muscles fixing her hooves in place and the tongue doing everything it could to caress and taste her legs gave Twilight the reassurance that where she was going would not be the last place she'd ever see. She gave Celestia a smile that spoke of regret for doubting her and of serenity in her situation. Despite the look of acceptance in return it seemed that Celestia's hunger hadn't dimmed in the slightest as she gave another gulp, dragging in Twilight's rear to the point that the whipped cream surrounding her cutie mark started to get smudged on her muzzle. Twilight just managed to get a look at the throat but couldn't believe how little her legs showed in light of her comparative size. Indeed Celestia was still wearing her regalia, which made Twilight worry more about the discomfort of having a large pony going past than about the fact that she was going down there. Another gulp and her cutie mark was no longer visible, her dock now sat in the pharynx and her hind hooves were now firmly within Celestia's body. One more gulp and a much firmer grip came upon her hind hooves as they finally entered the stomach. As Celestia's tongue continually caressed her abdomen...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     After so long, it had come to this. After freeing Equestria from the Iron-Fisted rule of Discord, after halting the Griffon Kingdom's global conquest, even after establishing a tenuous ceasefire with the Dragons of the Western Badlands, Celestia thought that she and Luna had vanquished the mightiest foes that would ever stand before her. How wrong she was. Never in all her wildest dreams, her most outlandish imaginings...her darkest nightmares...had she ever thought that her beloved sister, the princes Luna, would betray her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It wasn't Luna's fault. Celestia had kept that fact well in mind as she battled desperately against the twisted perversion her sister had become. It's not her fault, not entirely. *I'm as much to blame for this as she is! Why didn't I do more to prepare her for the burden of ruling? Why didn't I warn her that moving the heavens is all to often a thankless task?!* Celestia's shame fueled a charge of white-hot energy in her horn, which she loosed at the ebony demon in front of her, trying with all her might to just get in one good hit, that might stun her opponent. Then, maybe she could reason with Luna - or whatever she had become. Then she might restore peace in her lands once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    *It's possible she's still Luna - still in there somewhere! Please let it be possible...* Another bolt of energy shot from Celestia's horn like a howitzer. *Please...?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     For her part, Nightmare Moon - The name that this evil simulacrum of Luna had taken for herself - was more than a match for the daytime ruler before her. Any attempt by the princess to damage her met with utter futility; bolts of light meant to connect with the would-be usurper connected with fog; Celestia conjured magical locks and chains to ensnare her, and Nightmare Moon conjured the keys to those locks; Celestia used telekinesis to hurl large objects, Nightmare Moon breathed out a miasma so thick and corrosive that those objects disintegrated completely. What Celestia would call a battle for the ages, Nightmare Moon called child's play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"You are weak, Celestia! I should have rebelled against you eons ago!\" Nightmare Moon bellowed, shaking the battlefield with an imperious authority. \"You and your pathetic day are not fit for this country - not fit for <i>my</i> country!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Struggling to her hooves, a tear formed in Celestia's eye. *This wasn't supposed to happen! This, this <i><b>thing</b></i> can't be my sister! I used to feel such a rich harmony between us and-*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Of course! That was the answer to stopping Luna from losing herself forever! The Elements of Harmony!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Celestia would have to be quick. She charged up more energy, this time turning herself into a beam of light that shot straight up and away from the conflict, ricocheting off of invisible things in the air toward the hiding place of the Elements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"How very typical of my elder sister.\" Nightmare Moon noted coldly, \"Running from difficulty is truly what she does best.\" The she-devil wrapped her starlight mane around herself like a cloak and transformed into a cloud of blue effervescence, following her radiant sister close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Within the dimly lit clearing, on a pedestal, rested the five orbs representing the Elements of Harmony; one for Honesty, one for Loyalty, one for Laughter, one for Generosity and one for Kindness. Celestia stood in front of the pedestal, light radiating from her horn and all around her. Normally, wielding the Elements by oneself would be impossible, since the sixth Element - the Element of Magic, the only Element that had no material form - could only be awakened by a close bond. It was only because they were sisters and endured so much together that the Alicorn sisters were able to use the Elements against Discord. No matter how fervently she wished, no matter how devotedly she prayed, no matter how she demanded, the Elements remained dead-as-a-door-nail stones. That was when she heard the sound of Nightmare Moon's mocking laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Was this your plan, dear sister?\" The cloud of night sky descended and formed once more the body of Nightmare Moon. \"You know as well as I do that it takes more than one to activate the power of the Elements of Harmony!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Celestia remained silent. Her face indignant and angry, tears of rage mixed with tears of fear and rolled down her regal face, now matted with dirt, blood and the salt water from her eyes. She turned to face her enemy. Elements or no Elements, she was determined to finish this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"How dare you look at me that way?\" Nightmare shrieked. \"I am the one who has been betrayed! NOT! YOU!\" She let fly a black jet of hate at Celestia, determined to make her feel just a fraction of the anguish she had felt for years. The jet collided with a barrier of light Celestia had wrapped herself in, causing it to disperse into a thousand tiny demonic phantoms and dissipate. Shocked that, at last, one of her spells had failed to find its mark, Nightmare Moon was caught off guard for Celestia's retaliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"SHUT! UP!\" Celestia reared up on her hind legs and stamped the ground, turning her light-shield into a wave of solar heat that slammed into Nightmare Moon with the force of a meteor, singeing her coat and launching her backwards, stunned and moaning. \"YOU ARE NOT MY SISTER, FIEND!\" A small sphere of white flame launched from behind Celestia toward the creature, the fire clinging to her and making it difficult for her to move or concentrate. \"LUNA IS KIND!\" Another ball of fire assaulted Nightmare. \"LUNA IS CARING!\" And another. With each declaration of Luna's better nature, another orb would launch itself seemingly from out of nowhere, until Nightmare Moon was covered in a silver-white blaze. Some small part of the two must have known that they were the Elements' doing, though why they came to life now was anyone's guess, the Elements were forged from a magic as old as the planets themselves, and no one could honestly say they had any insight as to their workings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Now...\" Celestia dawned a deadly-calm demeanor, standing triumphantly over the writhing nightmare monster. \"For your punishment, monster: For the crime of kidnapping, corrupting, and robbing me of my dear sister, for assaulting the princess of Equestria, for threatening the lives of my subjects, I hereby banish you to the most unforgiving dungeon in the cosmos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     What happened next, nopony could have foreseen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The earth began to rumble so fiercely that lesser creatures would fear it might split open and swallow the very mountains. An flame covered Nightmare Moon rocketed straight up into the night sky screaming. A great force pulled open Celestia's maw and her head jerked upwards, facing the heavens. Then, the fire engulfed Nightmare Moon shot down towards the earth at an angle, facing forward, she had a perfect view of where she was going: right down Celestia's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     All that could be heard was a great, earsplitting \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooo\" that started out as such, but became muffled and muted as Nightmare Moon was forced down. Down into the vengeful belly of Princess Celestia, who was every bit as surprised as her enemy at the turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The battle, and magic of the Elements had tired both Alicorns greatly, and in less than a second, they both drifted from consciousness. The artificial night that Nightmare Moon created gave way, as a golden-white star resumed its proper place in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Some few hours past before Celestia roused from slumber. Remembering the battle and its resolution, she looked at her stomach to discover that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***Sorry if the vore part seemed weak in this chapter, it will be a more prominent element in future installments, trust me***</span></div></div>",

To her dread, this means that also her little sister has met her demise inside of her stomach. Celestia frantically felt at her belly. It was a little bigger after it was done with her meal, a thought that made Celestia shudder. But nothing seemed to be inside. Celestia broke down in tears, knowing that her sister was dead now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened during that time:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare Moon woke up again at a stinging sensation. Her eyes opened, only to find darkness. The dark alicorn tried to move, but she was tightly restricted by the stomach that held her so she could barely even wriggle. Again something stung her and she couldn't do anything against this annoying stinging. It was disgusting, slime practically covered her entire body and she felt something stinging dripping on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the thought hit her. The stinging sensation, she was inside a stomach. \"No, this is impossible.\" Fear surged through her body as more of the stinging liquid started to cover her. Nightmare Moon thought it would be impossible, but she was being digested. \"Damn you Celestia, if you do this you'll never see your sister again!\" She screamed, but Celestia was still out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare Moon frantically tried to wriggle inside, to find an escape, but she could not move an inch while her body was covered in stomach acids. \"Nooooo, let me OUT!\" She screamed again as her skin started to burn. Her fur was already falling out and even her feathers started to melt. Even if she was let out now, she would make for a pitiful sight. Her bravado was forgotten as fear, pain and panic consumed her mind. \"Please, I'll do anything you want but let me out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thrashed around and her body felt like it was on fire. She could only scream in pain as she was digested alive. Soon the acids broke her skin down and before her flesh could follow, Nightmare Moon couldn't take it anymore and faded away. The gastric juices left nothing of her, even the bones were turned into jelly and absorbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia slowly got out of shock and realized what just happened.

A slight calm, Celestia noted, that wouldn't last very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia tapped her hoof against her chin. \"Well, um, I'm, er, right here, Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kind of - promise to not freak out, but - well, you're inside me. More specifically, my stomach...\" Celestia held her breath, waiting for Luna's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few minutes, there was no sound from Luna. \"Luna? Are you, eh, there?\" Celestia instantly regretted asking that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>OF COURSE WE ARE STILL HERE, GLUTTON! WHERE WOULDST WE GO?!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Well, there's always...* Celestia smiled despite herself, trying to not explode from Luna's explosive use of the Royal Canterlot Voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>WHAT HAPPENED?! DID THINE APPETITE FINALLY GET THE BETTER OF THEE?! DIDST THEE FIRE THY COOKS FOR NOT BAKING ENOUGH OF YOUR SWEETMEATS?!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's use of the Royal Canterlot Voice was causing Celestia's stomach to inflate. She was beginning to feel a great deal of pressure in her gut. \"Luna! Luna, please, I know you're upset and scared, but I need you to calm down before-\" <b>BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP</b> Celestia had belched. Then, she began to laugh. She laughed harder then than she ever had before in her entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belch was so loud and abrupt, in fact, that Luna instantly ceased her ranting. She still sat there, in her sister's belly, looking madder than a hornet, madder now than she'd been a moment before - Luna did not like to be interrupted. As soon as the laughter started, and her fleshy cage started to shake up and down with that laughter, she started, too. It started out with a choke, then a snicker, then a snort and then a series of chortles and guffaws, punctuated with giggling and \"hee-hee-hees\" when her breath ran short. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duet of gigglefits continued for what must have been ten minutes, before Celestia had noticed something happening...</span></div></div>",

The five orbs began to circle around Celestia in a perfect circle, bobbing up and down, increasing in speed until they became a ring of many-colored light, shooting sparks of starlight all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tia? What's going on? I-I'm starting to feel strange! You're starting to digest me!\" She began to struggle, splashing about in, what she didn't recognize as, the remains of Nightmare Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia rubbed her belly to calm her sister down. \"Shh, it's okay, Luna. I think the Elements are going to help us.\" At this Luna calmed down, her faith in her sister and in the Elements of Harmony keeping her from panic. Outside, the Element-Ring shone a shaft of light on Celestia, imbuing her with a measure of their power. She began to feel as though she had more control over the Elements, that she could make them to what she wanted. Celestia hardened her gaze, purpose burning in her eyes. She knew what she had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing the Elements to stop spinning, the elder sister confirmed what she felt; she <i>did</i> have a modicum of control, maybe more. \"Flexing\" her willpower again, she issued a mental command at the Element orbs: *Get my sister out of me!* The five, glowing stone orbs started to orbit an invisible point in space as electrons orbit an atom. Inside her sibling's stomach, Luna started to shimmer and turn translucent. The Elements were beginning to work their magic. She was saved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Celestia's eyes stayed fixated on the orbiting spheres and a mirror of light that formed in the center of them. Her focus was so intense, that she didn't notice her stomach reverting to its normal size, Luna disappearing from within. Then, as if viewing her walking through a thick fog, Luna's image started to appear in the light, as she strode closer and closer to Celestia, it started to become larger - more full-sized. As she grew, so too did the light encasing her, until finally, the Elements fell to the ground as the light-bubble burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's mane and coat were covered in saliva and gastric juices (can a starlight mane even get wet?), as her hooves hit the ground she shook herself as dry as she could. She'd need a proper bath later, but for now, a shaking would be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was...interesting.\" Luna said. \"I don't think I'd want to do it again anytime soon, but I'm glad that it didn't get any worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia chuckled, glad to have her sister back, but there was a very important question still tugging at the back of her mind.</span></div></div>",

I remember that I was...upset, because our subjects didn't notice the work I put into the night sky...again...\" She trailed off, feeling ashamed at what she'd done next. \"I wished that they could see my constellations and meteor showers all the time, I wished that they loved my nights like they did your days.\" Luna's lip started trembling a little. \"I remember wishing that there <i>were</i> no more days. And then, the next thing I knew, I was no longer in my room, I was...suspended, in pitch black, and all I heard around me was a cruel laughter, it chilled me to my core.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna...\" Celestia said, sympathizing with her sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna continued. \"I remember the laughing voice telling me that she'd make my dreams come true, she said that I'd never have to worry again, she called me a, a...morsel.\" Her voice broke on that last word, a tear dropped from her shut eyes. \"but then I heard you, I heard you calling my name, you reminded me that, even if my nights sometimes go unappreciated, I'll always have you, sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia stayed quiet, intent on hearing every detail<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next thing I know, the voice was screaming, and then she got quiet, and I well, ended up in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Celestia concluded, turning to the Elements. \"So that's what they did. Luna, I think the Elements gave me the power to, for want of a better word, purify you. With my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna could hardly believe it. She knew that the Elements could behave unpredictably, but she always thought they imposed order in a more direct way. After all, she and her sister did wield the Elements against Discord once before, but they only awakened the Elements of Harmony and directed their energy at him, but it was the Elements themselves that turned the beast to stone, with no input from the duo other than 'Stop Discord!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose that explains how I was saved from, whatever it was that had me, but what about the second time, sister? You said you 'thought' the Elements were going to help us. You and I created the spark of Magic to stop what I'd become, but I don't remember any such sensation when I was inside you.\" Luna sat down, deep in thought over this conundrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia had a semi-knowing look on her face as she examined the lumps of rock embedded in the ground. \"I think...I may know what happened. The Elements bathed my body in light, and when they stopped, I felt like I could, well, control them, make them do what I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna raised an eyebrow. \"Tia, are you saying...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia nodded. \"Yes, I am; The elements...\"</span></div></div>",

Everything they knew about the Elements of Harmony told them that what just happened shouldn't happen, and yet, it did. She could only wonder what this meant - the Element of Magic was immaterial, save for when it brought the other Elements to life. As soon as the Elements had served their purpose, Magic dissipated. Celestia became worried at this - would she disappear? She checked herself, first her hooves, then her wings and finally her flanks - everything seemed to be solid, she sighed, relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she remembered how it felt to have control over the Elements of Harmony like that. She remembered how it felt when she swallowed Nightmare Moon, the power she had over the life of another pony. True, as the princess, she had power over ponies' lives already, but that experience was on a much more personal level. She remembered what it felt like to hold Luna inside her, having someone so close emotionally, be so close physically as well, almost like what an expectant mother must feel like, the feeling was so titillating in fact, that it made her privates moisten a little. Levitating the Element stones off the ground, Celestia considered what to do with them. She definitely had control over the Elements of Harmony, at least to an extent, and she liked what they did for her. *Maybe...* she thought. *If I've become one with the Element of Magic, I can become one with the other Elements too.* Excitement began to flow to her head and her nethers. *Then, I'd be able to use this power as much as I wanted, I'd turn my body into a hell for my enemies and a haven for my friends! That's a perfect idea, Oh Celestia, you sly mare, you!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, she set her vorish plan in motion. Luna watching from behind, unaware of what exactly her sister was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia began with the orb of Honesty, jolting it with a spark from her horn to activate it once more. She decided to devour the Elements of Harmony and make them a part of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would she consume them?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Princess Celestia licked her lips at the stony Element orb. She wasn't sure why, but it seemed to be more appetizing than it was before, probably a residual effect of the power the Elements gave her, the equine royal decided. Taking the ball into her mouth, she found that her lips and jaws stretched just as they had when she swallowed Nightmare Moon; not as wide, obviously, but still beyond their normal width. Still, she thought she might have trouble swallowing it, so she would have to make it more bite-sized. *Shrink!* she thought at it, and in compliance, the Element-Meal shrank to about half of its original dimensions. *Perfect.* By the time she worked it to the back of her mouth, the Element of Honesty was coated in her saliva. \"MMMmmm\" Celestia moaned, *It tastes like raw magic!* She could hardly wait to experience the same flavor in the other Elements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the moment of truth. Celestia gave a hard swallow, her esophagus opening to allow passage to the medium-sized stone. It seemed oddly easy to swallow, and Celestia could have sworn it was aiding somehow in the peristalsis. Though it had been reduced considerably, it was still a large enough object to cause a visible bulge in Celestia's throat. From the outside, Luna could see the holy object make its way into her sister's stomach, she watched with her face contorted into a mix of disbelief and morbid fascination. Landing with a barely audible splash, Celestia could feel its weight in her, along with a pleasant warmth radiating from deep within her. \"Mmm, what a lovely experience, I can't wait to do that again.\" A hungry look in her eye as she turned to face the remaining four Elements. She'd started drooling just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister wait!\" Luna called out at last, finding her voice again. \"What are you doing? That can't be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia seemed not to hear her at first. Picking up the Element of Kindness and repeating the process with it, she turned to meet Luna's gaze as she gulped. \"Don't be such a wet blanket, little sister; I know what I'm doing.\" Her voice was as a bell whose ringing carried mischief. \"I can't really explain it, but it feels like the Elements <i>want</i> me to eat them.\" She stopped trying to explain as the second Element found its twin in her stomach, the weight and warmth increasing, causing Celestia to shudder with sexual arousal. \"Ooooh. Well, that's twice as nice.\" She giggled naughtily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna scoffed. \"Mother and Father would just die if they knew what a glutton their eldest daughter had become. It's not enough for you to eat vast quantities of baked goods, you must also devour inanimate objects as well? And the Elements of Harmony, no less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Blah, blah, blah* Celestia mused as she finished a third Element. Its presence in her intensified the heat in her loins to the point of being unbearable. She still wanted to eat the rest of the Elements, but now her arousal was just too great to ignore. She was about to do something that just may cause Luna to faint from embarrassment. \"Let's see if we can't get you in here in a more, shall we say, interesting way?\" She whispered to the orb that represented Generosity.</span></div></div>",

It appeared to be smooth; in order for what she had in mind to work, it would need to be, to help prevent any...well, injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Shrink.* She thought at the sphere -- it complied. Much as she wanted to feel its full size inside her, far better to be safe than sorry. *Now then, let's get you 'home'* Lifting the Element of Generosity over her back and towards her nether-region, she inhaled and braced herself. Princess Celestia rubbed the reduced Element up and down the length of her slit, preparing it for the process and coating the Element in her juices. She moaned -- the cold of the thing causing her vagina to pucker at first. *No point being squeamish now* She thought. *Not after coming this far.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia rotated the object, completely covering it in liquid, so much so that it was dripping with the stuff. It had shrunk less than the other Elements, resembling a shiny, grey cantaloupe. Much like her mouth with the other parts of the set, Celestia's cunt was also open and awaiting its meal, with Generosity awaiting to join the other Elements inside. Obligingly, the alicorn pressed the Element of Generosity against her entrance. Her pink walls quivered around the invading object, hungrily sucking it further and further in. In response, the Element began to vibrate, whether to better pleasure its host, or due to proximity to the other Elements, no one could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the orb settled in her womb, Celestia had experienced several small orgasms. What's more, much like with the others, the latest insertion radiated a warmth that -- rather than giving the princess relief, only made her want more inside of her. The consumption of four of the five physical Elements of Harmony had stirred an intense feeling of hunger within. Not just a hunger for food or other living things -- oh no -- but a hunger for power, and the hunger to use that power. One Element remained. *Four down* Celestia thought. *One to go. But maybe I've been greedy; maybe my dear sister would like to get in on this, as well* The plan formed in her head instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Luna~\" Celestia cooed as she awoke the last Element, representing Loyalty, with another lightning bolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna, who had done her best to ignore what had just transpired, turned herself back around to face her sibling. Loss of patience was obvious in her voice. \"What is it, sister? I'm not going to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder sister didn't give Luna a chance to finish her sentence, \"Think fast!\" She flung the red-glowing stone at Luna, who hadn't enough time to react. There was a flash of light as it struck her, but no \"Oof!\" or indication of pain or surprise on Luna's part. Inspecting herself, she'd found that her body was precisely as it had been before. Inspecting her sister, however, Luna had found that her figure was back to its previous trim self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tia,\" Luna cocked an eyebrow. \"What happened? What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe solar princess gave a little chuckle. \"Isn't it obvious, my darling sister? I fused the two of us with the Elements of Harmony. Now <i>we're</i> the Elements; I'm Magic, Kindness, Honesty, Laughter &amp; Generosity; whereas you have Loyalty all to yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was shocked! \"But if you're five of the Elements and I'm only one of them, doesn't that mean that you have most of the power?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia shook her head. \"No. Not exactly: We're still equals, Luna. I just thought that you'd like to have a taste of what this feels like. It's good, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded. \"Y-yes, I suppose it does...\" Luna felt warmth, a familial kind of warmth, perhaps being an Element of Harmony made her feel more connected to her sister than she had in an era. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia began walking away from the clearing. \"Good. Because all this binge eating has given me an idea for a few new laws around here. I'll explain on the way. Oh -- one more thing: with me being a majority of the Elements now, you'll find that while we both have increased appetites, you will...\"</span></div></div>",

Chocolate milk no longer rained from cotton candy clouds, the laws of physics were no longer inverted and night &amp; day once again lasted roughly 12 hours each. Perhaps the most relieving change, however, was that Buffalo no longer danced across the landscape in tutus and leotards. Across the great land of Equestria, from Appleoosa to Manehatten to Las Pegasus, the citizens rejoiced in their restored harmony of Celestia &amp; Luna ruling once again. In no place were the people more visibly appreciative than Canterlot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nobleponies were squeamish and reality twisting around on itself made their vast inheritances useless, so obviously they were especially glad to see things return to status quo. Sure, they were short of memory from meeting so many other high rollers daily, so they wouldn't long remember that these particular mares from Ponyville saved civilization. That didn't seem to matter so much to the wielders of the Elements, though; Twilight Sparkle, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, Applejack, Rainbow Dash and even Fluttershy were enjoying the adulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rarity was being chatted up by Hoity Toity, discussing ideas for a new line of clothing likely capitalizing on the surreal nature of the past few days. \"Bouleverser\", he called it. Shock Value.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applejack entertained a crowd of well-to-dos with details of the showdown with Discord. She kept the tale pretty true to life, embellishment not being a personality trait she practiced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow Dash, on the other hoof, stood on the opposite end of the hall where the celebration was being held. She had originally planned to find one of the Wonderbolts and try again to schmooze her way into the team, but she'd been sidetracked by thankful citizens wishing her to \"tell them all about it.\" While Applejack had done her best to stay accurate and objective, Rainbow Dash let her natural exhibitionist show in <i>her own</i> retelling of the return of harmony. Something which drew a much larger gathering, with louder applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While Rainbow &amp; Applejack actively sought out attention, Fluttershy kept herself to a small table sipping tea with two other Ponies, one a zoologist, the other a botanist who worked in the royal menagerie. The trio softly carried on a conversation about their careers, hobbies, and their favorite plants and animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For her part, Pinkie Pie felt more at home with the 'help', as the nobles called them, than the nobles themselves. Hoofstands into the punch bowl, conga lines, cupcake eating contests. Pinkie Pie's revelry managed to create a gravity well of fun, anypony close enough was pulled into it, whether they knew what was coming or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Last, but - at the risk of invoking a cliche - least, there was Twilight Sparkle, who beheld the entire scene with a sense of fulfillment and pride, standing alone from them all. Not one year prior, the purple unicorn had no friends to speak of (save for Shining Armor and Spike), and as much interest in changing that. Now, now she had five wonderful friends with whom she saved her homeland no less than twice, all thanks to the bond that they shared. It was a bond for which none of them would trade anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was just before she felt tears of joy welling in her eyes that she heard the voice of her mentor in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why don't you and I sneak away for a bit, Twilight? I've got something I'd like to offer you...and your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight turned to meet her teacher's gaze. Princess Celestia glanced at an out of the way door she used for quick escapes during these kinds of gatherings, signaling that was the door they should take. The protege nodded in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was rare for anyone, other than the maids, to enter princess Celestia's bedchamber. Even Twilight never had the opportunity. It was a surprisingly humble bedchamber, furnished with a bed just big enough for the princess herself; Philomena's cage, which had a sheet draped over it; a fireplace permanently blazing with a magical flame, the only source of light; and a few bookshelves with a scroll stand. Twilight and the princess spent some time catching up and sharing a laugh over the pupil's foalhood misadventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deciding now was the time to spring her offer, Celestia put her plan into motion. \"Listen, my student, about my offer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight stifled her giggling and perked her ears up, offering the princess her full, undivided attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You and your friends have put yourselves at great personal risk for the sake of Equestria.\" Celestia took a sip of tea. \"You have the thanks of every one in the land, me included, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight Sparkle cocked her head to the side. It was strange to see the princess, of all ponies, was having trouble addressing one of her subjects. Especially since she said she was offering something, and who in their right mind would refuse an offer from the most powerful, wise &amp; just creature to ever grace creation with her presence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meanwhile, Celestia's thoughts and heart were racing - was she sure that the suggestion she was about to make was a good idea? Would Twilight understand and accept her if she new of the princess's little kink? Could she? And what of her friends? What if they refused? What if they told?! She'd lose the respect and trust of her subjects! She'd be the laughing stock of her kingdom! Not even Luna knew about this! Oh gods -- What if they suspected Luna of being a...freak like her?! Discord could well feed off the chaos that would cause and break free once more, whether or not the Elements of Harmony were there to help or not! Celestia was about to risk everything for the sake of indulging her twisted fetish! The thoughts and fears rising to a crescendo in her mind, a din in her skull! Until, like a clear, silver bell, silencing the cacaphony, Twilight spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Princess? Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And just like that, the fears, the doubt, the guilt all ebbed away. No turning back, the princess reassured herself, no regrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Princess Celestia shook her head and breathed a sigh of relief. \"Yes, Twilight, I'm fine now. Thank you. *Ahem* I'm just going to be direct with you: I don't think that a stained glass window is enough for you and your friends -- not by a long shot -- for me to properly thank you for placing your lives on the line to protect my kingdom, your home, from the threats that assail her. So, I think it only appropriate that I offer you and your friends the chance to join me here in Canterlot Castle as my lovers.\" Celestia smiled at her student, confident once more in her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight Sparkle, always ready with a response, was utterly speechless. Twilight Sparkle, whose countenance always reflected the finest Equestrian education, was now frozen in an expression of wide-eyed, slack-jawed flabbergast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia took the opportunity to explain exactly what she meant. After all, even when Twilight is at her worst, she is still her most capable student. Her ears and mind could not help but listen to what she had to say, no matter the topic. \"It's a lot to consider, I know, but to call the perks of being my harem 'perks' would be an understatement: You'll be treated like royalty - like heroins deserve - be made immortal thanks to your bond to me; my fortune and influence will make sure you want for nothing; your families will be raised to nobility; <i>and</i> you'll be able to enjoy the pleasures of my body, both outside...and in.\" She finished with a smirk and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Had Twilight just heard the princess right? A chance for her and her friends to be the princess's personal lovers?! Such an honor! Why, it was almost too good to be true- wait...what was that last part...? \"Er...'in', princess? I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There will be time for an explanation later, my dear Twilight. For now, just know that you don't need to fear anything from me. Return to your friends now, and tell them about my offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight Sparkle nodded. As she headed out the door to return to the festivities, she heard the princess's voice once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"One more thing, Twilight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, your majesty?\"</span></div></div>",

I'll have an answer for youuu...sometime next week, if that's not too long?\" Twilight said, tapping her hoof on her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The princess gave a warm smile and a chuckle. \"Not too long at all, Twilight. Remember who you're talking to, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight returned the smile and continued out the room, magically closing the door behind her. The purple unicorn had much to consider about this new turn of events: On one hoof; she'd never considered that the princess may be sexually attracted to other mares, much less her! Twilight didn't really mind this, though, as she'd harbored semi-romantic feelings for her ruler for some time now. She blushed a little as her mind wandered back to when she first learned about sex, sexuality &amp; masturbation, she'd spend many a night furiously kneading her teats and vulva, fantasizing about scenarios wherein she and the princess would act out the sauciest scenes in her favorite harlequin romance novels, fantasies she'd long ago given up on and dismissed as the feverish dreams of a young mare who didn't know what she wanted. Now, Twilight would have the opportunity to make those fantasies a reality, partially, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight's body returned to the ballroom on auto-pilot, that is until her mind snapped back to the present by a volley of noise and a blur of pink popping up in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Twilight! Why'd ya leave? Didjya wanna play hide-and-seek? You shoulda told us if you wanted to play that!

All eyes were now on Twilight, and most were either confused or perturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkie Pie scolded her friend for losing her temper. \"There's no need to shout, Twilight. If you wanted my attention, you only had to ask.\" With that, her expression changed back to it's normal, happy-go-lucky smile. \"So what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now supremely embarrassed &amp; flustered, Twilight buried her face in her hoof. \"Just...just go get the others, I've got something I need to tell you, but it's getting late, and we should get to the train station. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some time after the celebrations came to a close, and the daytime along with it, princess Celestia sat alone in her bedchambers, gazing out at the night sky. Her conversation with her student replaying in her mind for the umpteenth time. It did not, however, play out in her head as it had in truth, instead the princess had had the courage in her imagination to tell her pupil exactly what she'd meant when she dropped that little innuendo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stupid.\" She whispered to herself. \"I should've just told her what I meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deciding that a midnight snack might cheer her up, she called for her mare-in-waiting. When the mare arrived, Celestia sharply gave her orders as soon as the door creaked open, before the young thing could even say \"You called, your majesty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bring me a cake. Now. One of the Violet Transgressions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The servant bowed her head and left, wordlessly. It took her a few minutes to return with a cake sculpture of Twilight Sparkle, built to scale and made to look lifelike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your...er, cake, princess.\" Said the servant, placing the large silver platter down on the floor of the bedroom, doing her best to not offend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eyes locked on the cake, Celestia dismissed her mare-in-waiting, but with more grace this time. \"Thank you, Minty. Take the rest of the night off. And please, keep this to yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once she was sure she was alone with the sinfully decadent foodstuff, she lit a few candles, and decided to act out a few little fantasies of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What shall I do to you tonight, my lovely, lovely student?\" Celestia mused to the frosting-covered doll. \"Shall I pretend to be Discord, come to reclaim control of Equestria, while you make believe you are me? Or perhaps...hmm?\" Princess Celestia stopped in front of the cake and placed her ear close to its mouth, pretending to listen for a minute before jerking her head back and gasping, followed by a light giggle. \"Oh, Twilight, you're so naughty. How on Earth did you find out about my little vore fetish? No matter, you've violated the student-teacher trust and now I'll have to punish you. Although, now I suspect you may not view it as a punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia placed her lips on the mouth of the Violet Transgression, her tongue taking small licks of the frosting as a sample of what was to come. With a smack of her lips, she complimented the confection. \"Mmm...you taste even better than I imagined. I'm really going to enjoy this.\" Celestia made a mental note to give the baker a raise later. \"Now then, where shall I start? Hmm...how about here?\" The solar mare pointed a hoof at cake Twilight's horn. Taking the appendage in her mouth, Celestia moaned lightly before pulling it out of the head and chewing. The outside was candy coated, to simulate the hardness of a real horn, while the inside was made of the same cake the rest of the body was, with a cherry syrup filling. (A little macabre,) Celestia thought. (but no less tasty. I just hope that these cakes haven't spoiled the real thing for me...) The sun princess kept on eating, gorging herself on the treat, taking bigger and bigger bites out of it. When she didn't bite, she took long, slow, sloppy-wet licks out of the frosting, leaving strips of bare cake exposed for the goddess to see. On and on she ate, swallowing slower, harder and louder with each new mouthful of moist, chewy goodness until, at last, the Twilight Sparkle dummy found its place in her downward-bulging gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Moaning with abandon, Celestia flopped down on her bed, massaging her belly with her forelegs, licking the last crumbs of cake off the platter. \"MMMmmmm. Let that be a lesson *urp* young lady.\" She said before dozing off into a deep, restful slumber, gurgling sounds and heavy snoring filled the royal boudoir that night.</span></div></div>",

All they knew is that Twilight had 'something to tell them', and had been casting privacy spells and muttering the entire trip so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright, enough is enough! Twilight, you've soundproofed this place, covered up the windows, sealed off the doors to keep the other <i>sleeping</i> ponies out, checked five times for scrying spells, took away anything we could write with, next you'll be brainwashing everypony on the train into forgetting the trip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good thinking, Rainbow! It'll be just a few-\" Twilight then noticed the looks she was being given. \"Er... maybe we're ready enough. Wait, shouldn't we make this room teleport-resistant?\" The stares persisted. \"I, uh, suppose you've waited long enough. It's just so... well...\" Rarity walked up to her, putting a hoof across Twilight's shoulders. \"Twilight, dear, you can confide in us. Whatever happened to you at the celebration, we can assure you word of it will not leave this place. Right, girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assuring agreements and nods were enough to loosen Twilight's lips. \"...Okay. But I'm sure you'll be able to appreciate the secrecy. You see, Celestia took me away from the party to tell me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\nNot even the chugging of the train made it past the soundproofing spell, leaving complete silence in the wake of the bombshell Twilight dropped. The first to actually collect her thoughts and speak was Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy howdy, that's... quite the offer there. You're sure that's what she said?\" Twilight nodded, \"To the letter.\"  Pinkie took the opportunity to whisper to the stunned cowpony, <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"I told you the princess was into you.\"</font> Rarity was unreadable, perhaps even she herself didn't know what she thought. \"So, you're saying that the princess... Princess <i>Celestia</i> is... <i>interested</i> in us? All six of us? ...At <i>once</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was visibly sweating as she decided it would be a good idea to forgo any and all eye contact forever. Rainbow Dash, oddly enough, seemed to have a look of serious contemplation. \"So, immortality, huh?\" Rainbow slipped back into her own thoughts, letting out the occasional 'Hmm.' Twilight decided to wrap up her speech for the night, \"She's expecting an answer sometime next week. I suggest you all seriously consider your options, regardless of how you feel right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, Applejack added, \"Twi has a point. It'd be good to sleep on this one. Ah'll try to have an answer by Saturday.\" At the mention of sleep, the ponies came to an unspoken agreement that if there was anything else to say, it could wait until at least morning. Soon enough, they had retired to their bunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Except for Twilight, who had a fun night of dispelling her countless security measures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\nAs the week passed, Twilight listened carefully to everything her friends had to say. Deep down, her own mind was already made up; she'd love nothing more than to spend her days with the wonderful mare that guided the sun. She just hoped the others would come along, the thought of leaving them all behind for one pony's pleasure didn't quite sit well with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weekend came, and it looked like the other five saviors of Equestria were...</span></div></div>",

One by one they nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Each of the five had their own reasons for agreeing to this: Applejack's family needed money; Fluttershy just wasn't the sort to disappoint; Rarity was still infatuated, somewhat, by the idea of being a princess; Pinkie Pie, well, she was mostly looking forward to seeing how much fun she could get up to &amp; Rainbow Dash decided that she'd never leave her friends again, no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In fact, Rainbow's reason had been a commonality between all of them. Ever since Twilight used her magic to free each of them from Discord's corruption, they each internally vowed that no matter what the future held for them, they'd face it together. That's not to say, of course, that joining a royal harem was a bad thing, far from it. All of the things that the princess promised through Twilight, they knew she'd happily deliver them.

That makes sense.\" A little voice in the back of her mind still had doubts, but she honestly couldn't think of any other explanation. Her mind then realized what it had just thought; Cunnilingus. With Princess Celestia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought alone helped Twilight ease her mind that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------</div><br>\r\nSaturday morning arrived after an agonizingly slow week. Twilight didn't discuss anything about the offer with her friends the entire time, save for coordinating a cover story for friends and family. As far as they knew, the girls had an offer to move to Canterlot in case the elements were needed again. It wasn't an outright lie; Just a truth that could very conveniently cover up another, more unseemly truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was pondering how she would ask her friends about their decisions. Would the group split up, or will it be all or nothing? What if one of them came along due to peer pressure? Many other what-ifs and disaster scenarios clouded her mind until a knock on the door interrupted her stupor. She went to the front of the closed library, and found herself inviting in Applejack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Twi. Me an' the girls talked about the offer at Rarity's place last night.\" In a way, Twilight was relieved already. The others had already, for better or worse, come to a consensus. \"And...?\" The time it took for Applejack to open her mouth again was long enough for Twilight's stomach to tie itself into a knot five times over. \"They're all in.\" Twilight soon found herself breathing again. \"Th-that's great! I'll write to Celestia right away!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although there is something I've been meaning to ask... What's gonna happen with Spike?\" \"Well, he'll have to move back too.

There he will be briefed on arrangements and accommodations.\" \"Woah woah woah,\" Spike interrupted, \"I'm getting my own room in the castle!?\" The guard nodded, and led him into the castle itself.

What if... what if her brother found out!? Noticing the unicorn's sudden onset of shivers, Applejack told her, \"Don't you start worryin' now. You know Celestia well enough to know she's not gonna bite yer head off or nothin'.\" Even though it was unrelated to her concerns, it did bring some comfort. Soon enough she will be with Celestia, and all will be right in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard suddenly stopped at a large doorway that Twilight remembered being referred to as a 'Royal VIP Suite'. \"This is where you will all be staying until long-term arrangements are made. Inside you will find further instructions on what is expected of you. You may enter now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls eagerly made their way into the room. It was large and dome-shaped, not unlike Princess Celestia's own personal quarters. Unlike the starry theme of Celestia's room, however, this one recalled images of sunny, green fields. The furnishings, from the throwpillows to the shelves, had the colors of wild flowers, and a closer examination would show that they even smelled the part. In the center of the room floated a scroll, which Twilight busied herself with as her friends continued to take in their surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What's it say, what's it say?\", Pinkie asked over Twilight's shoulder. Glancing over the sheet again, Twilight told them that they should move to the next room before she explains. Filing into the doorway opposite of the hallway entrance, they completely missed how the room had suitably darker colors compared to the living quarters. The paintings of Equestria's moonlit landscapes were ignored, and the scented candles at the ready were a mere footnote. What dominated their vision, instead, was the gargantuan mattress that was clearly designed for the six of them to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... I suppose I should start with <i>that,</i>\" Twilight began, \"It says that while Celestia will, uh, busy herself with one of us at a time at first, she will eventually want us to... 'Coordinate our efforts', if you will. So we should use some of our time to, as she put it, become physically acquainted with each other over time.\" They collectively blushed, but Twilight was glad to see that Fluttershy took this information as a que to snuggle up with Rainbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Furthermore, on a day-to-day basis, we may do as we will, provided we are back here by sunset, unless we have some conflicting arrangement. After sundown, the mirror in this room will glow whenever the princess desires... company. We merely have to touch it to be brought to her side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may interject,\" Rarity interjected, \"It appears to be glowing at this very moment.\" Sure enough, the previously unnoticed full-body mirror mounted on the rightmost wall had taken a subtle yet unmistakable glow. A pang of nervousness struck the group; it was one thing to know that they were to tend to the princesses needs, but it was another thing entirely when it was going to happen <i>right now!</i> \"So,\" Rarity continued... </span></div></div>",

They were not eating dinner together however, instead Twilight Sparkle WAS the dinner, lying on a plate before Celestia. The small unicorn winked at her mentor and smiled. At least as much as she could, since a large apple was stuffed into her mouth. \"I must say Twilight, you are by far the tastiest meal I have ever eaten. Maybe it's because you taste good, no matter how you are prepared. You were delicious with that potato stuffing too.\" At that last sentence, Twilight blushed and folded her ears against her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Celestia moved in, slowly wrapping her lips around the apple in Twilights mouth and locking them into a strange kiss. Then her lips engulfed Twilight's complete muzzle, as the lavender unicorn closed her eyes. The horn was a bit of a challenge to get inside but eventually, the entire head was travelling down princess Celestia's throat, while the princess murred in pleasure. She licked every inch of that amazing body, enjoying the taste and lubricating her for the journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally made it to the flanks, a different taste hit her tongue. Celestia chuckled slightly as she tasted the juicy marehood of her lover and meal. Her hunger could wait a little, she wanted an appetizer. Her long, dexterous tongue slipped between the soft folds of her meal, causing her to moan loudly from the inside. This was by far her favorite part, getting to the juicy bit. Twilight's clitoris poked against Celestia's tongue, while her rear legs were squirming and shaking in pleasure. The hungry princess tilted her head back, in preperation of what would come now. As Twilight orgasmed, a large load of her juices was squirted directly onto Celestia's tongue, slowly running down her throat. The taste was heavenly, sweeter than the best honey she ever tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this done however, the princess wanted to waste no more time and continued to gradually swallow her meal. It was a lot easier now, since Twilight's body was completely relaxed. With just a few more gulps, the flanks and legs disappeared down her throat and she could close her mouth again, as the last bits of her meal were deposited into her stomach. With Twilight devoured, the princess leaned back to look at the large, squirming bulge. Twilight was not trying to escape though, instead she was giving her a nice massage from the inside. Happy with her meal, princess Celestia started rubbing her belly.</span></div></div>",

Even so, looking down at herself, Celestia couldn\u2019t deny that she\u2019d been packing on the pounds more than usual lately. Magic burnt calories, but apparently not enough to keep up with her appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least today, so far it had been easy for her to refuse most of the ponies offering themselves to her. Sometimes ponies would be refuse to disrobe, even knowing how much she hated the taste of fabric. Some would even come in caked in makeup and perfume, which always made her queasy. It was all terribly inconsiderate, like they were just using her for their own pleasure. Granted, that was usually the case anyway. At times it made the Princess feel like she was whoring herself out and that she was being looked down upon for doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, she longed for the honest ponies. They wanted to feel good, but they wanted for her enjoyment as well. A number of castle servants and guards had garnered a reputation for being her \u2018favorites\u2019 for how often she ate them. Petitioners who at least knew how to not talk out of their asses would also be duly rewarded, which amounted to mostly the non-nobles. It was rather sad how few of the upper crust managed to spot the patterns that \u2013 to her \u2013 were all too obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, for those who managed to trigger cravings other than her appetite, Celestia would grant them extra special rewards. She\u2019d invite them to her chambers at night for a little fun. Sex would just be the warm up, but in time they\u2019d move on to inserting the lucky ponies up her ass, vagina, or \u2013 if she were feeling extra kinky \u2013 up the futa cock that she normally kept hidden.

She looked very tasty and while she wasn't fat, she looked much more filling than any of those skinny maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoondancer noticed the hungry look in the princesses  eyes and became nervous. \"Well, my name is Moondancer, I know your student, Twilight Sparkle and wanted to invite her to a little get together in the west castle courtyard.\" Moondancer hoped that this would get her off of the menu. While she would be honored to end up inside the princess one day, she wanted to continue living just a little longer. \"I was just on my way to the library and I won't waste your time any longer.\" She gave the solar monarch a nervous smile before attempting to get away, only for a magical pull to drag her back. Combined with the look she was given Moondancer knew, she was food now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she turned her head around, only to see the open maw of the princess coming closer. \"T-thank you for this honor your highness.\" She said. Moondancer was glad that the sun princess deemed her a good meal but also sad that it would happen so soon. Still, she closed her eyes and accepted her fate as white lips engulfed her head. Moondancer could feel princess Celestias tongue lapping against her chin and blushed slightly as her face was licked throughoutly. Her body went limp as her head was slowly pulled down the throat by gradual swallows, she did not want to resist. If the princess was hungry, it was considered shameful to resist her appetite, so she would not struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight Sparkle was just on the way to her teacher, when she suddenly heard something strange. It was a series of wet slurping sounds. The purple unicorn went to investigate the noise, until she finally found the source. She could only get a glimpse of Moondancers cutie mark, before it disappeared where many ponies have disappeared to before. The rear legs of the other unicorn stayed motionless, as they were slurped up along with the tail, letting the large bulge on the princessess neck slide down even further. While Twilight has seen it many times before and did not exactly consider Moondancer a friend, it was still weird to see a pony she knew eaten alive, knowing she would soon be a layer of fat on Celestias flank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoondancer grunted as she was pushed through the tight tube, down into the waiting stomach of the princess. Finally she could feel herself entering a larger space, as she entered her final destination. With a few more gulps, the rest of her body soon followed and she lied there, curled up inside of princess Celestia. Moondancer wondered just how many ponies were in her position before and what they felt but it was useless now anyway. All Moondancer could do now, was to lie there and wait until digestion starts. She closed her eyes, hoping to lose consciousness before that happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight waited some more, until she could see that the bulge completely disappeared from her teachers throat and left her with a hanging gut. Celestia sighed happily, as she turned around and noticed her student. \"Oh, Twilight, I'm sorry that I didn't notice you. I ran into Moondancer as she tried to invite you to a little get together and couldn't resist.\" Twilight felt a little guilty, if it wasn't for her, Moondancer would not have come to the castle today. \"It's okay but you should probably send a guard to the get together, so the guests know that Moondancer... has become one with the sun.\" It was a term often used by guards when telling friends and family of Celestias meals about their fate. \"But anyway, I came here to tell you...\"</span></div></div>",

These ponies would devote their lives to being the food for the princesses and breeding, to keep their numbers up, in exchange the normal populace could remain safe from this ritual. Most would call it bizarre, some even sad that these ponies now existed only to be eaten but after generations, they did not dread their fate for one second.

Truthfully, it had been some time since the alicorn princess had felt any significant guilt for eating a pony. The truth was she rather liked it. Ponies tasted good, and she loved the feeling of them moving around inside her. She\u2019d long made peace with the necessities of her job, as had Luna. Cadence hadn\u2019t been hard to convince and Twilight, in time, would also come around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPonies selected for consumption came from all manner of backgrounds. Some were convicts. If a pony happened to be in jail for a speeding ticket and had the bad luck of catching the princess\u2019 eye, that was it. Since the life force of any pony would do, regardless of age, that meant orphans were also a treat she would indulge in from time to time. Ponies that had gotten too old without finding their cutie marks, petitioners that annoyed her, or even that one maid wearing a delightful orange perfume. There weren\u2019t really any limits. The only ponies truly safe from the ravenous princess were those of importance, such as Twilight and her friends, or special agent Sweetie Drops. Everypony else was fair game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther, given that their days were numbered, Celestia had also taken up the hobby of showing her meals a good time. She\u2019d woo and romance them, which usually ended in sex. Ponies were easy prey when in the afterglow. Sometimes she\u2019d take the play further and use ponies to satisfy her more exotic appetites. The only limit was her imagination, and she\u2019d had more than a thousand years to explore her creativity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with much restraint that the princess stopped herself from prancing giddily in place. The doors to the astronomy tower were pushed aside and the alicorn princess. The doors closed behind her, leaving her alone with her meal-to-be. But who is it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All the ponies bowed as per usual, which was something Celestia was beginning to tire of; the multitude of Her subjects bowed out of fear and respect for Her great power, which made Her feel as though they were deliberately trying to keep their distance from Her, but many ponies of the elite classes bowed purely for the formality of it all, which She despised all the more for the sense of hypocrisy it emanated. She sat down and waited for the typical opening of such a meeting as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting rolled on in the classical style; one self-important pony rose and gave Princess Celestia a spiel about his/her successes and contributions before asking for more royal backing in some form or other and then another would take their place and the whole procedure would start all over again. Celestia had to be very careful in determining who should be granted their requests and in what way they would. She could've disowned every pony who made such demands if She so wished but politics were a whole different ballgame when compared to divine intervention; in the case of the latter She could simply will anything to be or not with physical motions and magical auras being pure theatre where She was concerned, but had She done the same in the former there would be a vacuum in Equestria's socio-political structure that could only be filled by mortal ponies at this time, not to mention it would ruin Her millennia of effort to encourage religious tolerance and diversity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Golden Tomes,\" She interceded at a chosen point, \"Has Equestria's bibliographic potential increased since you've been given the lease on the Starlight Publishing Centre... three months ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it has, Princess.\" He replied. \"I have been able to check over the company's accounts and have found a way to yield a 6% output with a reduction in expenses of 5%.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then perhaps you could explain why unemployment figures in Canterlot have gone up by 6% and the publishing rate of new books has dropped by 10%?\" Having reigned over Equestria for over five thousand years Celestia had come to know every little wrinkle, trick, turn of phrase and spin that sapient mortals could come up with; indeed She had mastered the art of detecting when somepony wasn't telling Her the full story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Golden Tomes now sounded rather unsteady, \"In order to improve the acumen of a business you have to make cutbacks, even a few lay-offs if need be, and the lack of new books is simply because there aren't many ponies writing them at this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And would you be able to theorise as to why they're not writing as much as they were <i>last year</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I guess there's not enough inspiration around for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lack of inspiration, indeed?\" Celestia's timing was naturally impeccable. \"And it would seem that's only happening in Canterlot, on account of the publishing figures from Manehatten and Fillydelphia having gone up by 2%.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A logical conclusion of course, Princess.\" He announced with a sense of relief, which She soon quashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I believe that this time last year you seconded a statement made by Magnolia that Canterlot was the most inspiring city in the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you certainly wouldn't find any other city worthy of inspiration.\" Magnolia interjected. \"Manehatten is an overcrowded city of <i>modern</i> design filled with low-lives and the <i>nouveau riche</i>, Fillydelphia's a glorified dockyard, Cloudsdale has a charming style but all that cloud... it should be a mere weather factory as there's no other purpose for it; true ponies live on the ground these days. As for those <i>foreign</i> cities: The zebras seem to require our own architectural designs as they can't even think of living away from the jungle, the griffons are so military they can barely plan anything without grids and numbers and those vulgar diamond dogs won't even come up for air where cities are concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I really do see your point.\" Celestia answered in a discreetly sarcastic tone. \"Who would dare live in the clouds in these <u>modern</u> times with all these <u>modern</u> ponies taking up space on the <i>ground</i> where they're liable to get in the way of our imports arriving at <u>port</u>. Do correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the term 'nouveau riche' translates as 'new rich' from the <i>Griffanese</i> and the highest proportion of zebras in Equestria lies in <i>Fillydelphia</i> with a healthy Zebrican community developing in <i>Manehatten</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all due respect, Princess,\" Magnolia replied, \"But maybe these griffon terms wouldn't have entered our noble language were it not for the fact that those predatory mongrels kept bringing in their foul habits thanks to your generosity being perhaps a bit too... plentiful? We had them on the run in the last war! We could've driven them back to their islands if we stuck with it for another year or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid,\" Celestia answered with strained patience, \"That griffons are very proud creatures. If I had refused them the chance for peace talks when they were willing to do so we'd probably have still been at war for another decade to great expense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fail to see how that would've been of such consequence.\" Upper Crust stated. \"Equestria's the wealthiest nation in existence. And we all pay our due taxes.\" Celestia suppressed a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So glad you brought that up.\" She levitated a selection of papers. \"The VAT rate has been set as anything up to 12% since the year 913 of the Second Age, the Income Tax rate has been a statutory 10% since the year 765 of the Second Age and National Insurance has been 3% since the end of the Diamond War. So the maximum tax rate is usually 25%. Now, if we look at your records, Upper Crust... you and your wife hold a shared bank account for business purposes, right? Good, now the both of you have made 13,207,048 bits since the start of the Third Age and your last tax payment consisted of... forty-seven bits, four shillings and five pence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe your majesty realises we're not eligible for VAT.\" He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were that completely true,\" She replied, \"I think you'll find that you've never paid more than a 1% tax rate in that time period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear Princess,\" Blueblood declared, \"While I'm sure we're all appalled by this news I think you'll agree that those of us of a royal heritage are above such things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a case of circumstances in that case.\" She answered. \"'Prince' Blueblood: Last year's expenses come to 7,999,011 bits and I do believe you've applied for another 200,000 bits for building modifications.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course. 8,000,000 bits a year is not enough for a royal's lifestyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The full list includes 15,000 bits on dating, 20,000 bits on cosmetics, 59,000 bits on clothing, 350,000 bits on dining out, 5,000 bits on jewellery, 72,000 bits on servants' wages, 78,312 bits on travel, 69,000 bits on opera tickets, 52,163 bits on decoration, 85,200 bits on a private airship, 234,500 bits on a 15-acre estate, 432,000 bits to fix-up said estate, 5,300 bits on electricity bills, 75,210 bits on new furniture, 53,212 bits on vanities and... what's this? 6,393,114 bits sundry? Care to explain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a fabulous investment opportunity in a machine to revolutionise harvesting.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which was unlicensed.\" Celestia pointed out, quickly deducing what he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly not. I licensed it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which you have no authorisation to do. I've seen a few licenses issued in the past few years with <i>your</i> signature on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there was the film industry investment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Blueblood: The Story of a Silver Spoon.\" She recalled. \"The Prince and Himself. All Roads Lead to Blue Blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Blueblood pushed on. \"The most noble account in three epic chapters.\" The list of pointless investments and hidden expenses rolled on. \"And I simply must have a swimming pool installed below my bedroom balcony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall speak more of this.\" Celestia told him. \"I've discovered a fair number of tax cheats while going through these records and many of them are seated within my line of sight. It seems few, if any, of you understand the basic tenet of taxation. It's like dairy farming; you have to get the most milk for the least moo, but it seems that I've been getting plenty of moo but little in the way of milk. As things stand right now it might not seem like much of a consequence but the laws laid down in the earliest years of the First Age dictate that all guilty of tax dodging must pay up one way or another.\"</span></div></div>",

Please let me go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only answer was to be pulled closer to the night princess who opened her mouth impossibly wide. Feather Duster tried to beg for her life but her cries were silenced as her head was engulfed by the slimy cave that was princess Luna's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeather Duster tried to struggle but the princess powerful magic held her helplessly in place. She tried to scream for help but the princess throat and her noise cancelling spell muffled her screams to nothing. A powerful gulp sent the maid further down princess Luna's throat and her forelegs started to enter the mouth too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulge on Luna's neck moved around as she took another gulp, sending the maids front legs and her chest into her throat. Feather Duster cried and screamed in the darkness her head almost inside the stomach already. Luna meanwhile had to struggle to fit the massive girth down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother big gulp and only the hind legs of the maid were sticking out. Her head was now completely inside the stomach. Feather Duster knew where she was and screamed even louder. Luna knew she had to hurry now. The large belly and wide flanks inside her throat bulged out and she couldn't breathe anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lunar princess threw her head back and cancelled the magical hold on the pony, letting gravity assist instead. With a few smaller gulps Luna took the hind hooves slowly inside and slurped up the rest of the tail. With one final gulp the rest of the mare was now completely inside her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna let out a content sigh as Feather Duster struggled inside of her. The princess couldn't help but to giggle at the tickling sensation this cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssh, don't worry, I promise this won't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna let herself fall on her bed and rubbed her large belly. Over time the struggles grew weaker and weaker. Finally Feather Duster ran out of air and lost conciousness. Luna's stomach gurgled as her digestive juices started to work on the mare. For the rest of the night she just laid there, enjoying the warm rumble of her stomach as it gradually shrinked down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually her stomach shrunk close to its original size plus a few pounds. This plump mare would stay on her flank for quiet some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest in peace Feather Duster, you were even more filling and delicious than I hoped for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now it was almost time to lower the moon again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duty calls. I guess that was my last pony meal.\"</span></div></div>",

Was she, how do the modern Ponies put it? 'Fibbing'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeather shook her head. \"Not at all, your majesty - your sister spoke the truth. It's just that ever since I was young, I'd heard stories of how you and your sister...indulged your appetites in the olden days. It always kind of scared me, but, well, it excited me too, y'know? So I thought that if I worked hard and got a job here at the castle, that Princess Celestia might eat me, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and when, when I asked the Princess if she'd eat me, well...obviously, she said no...\" the maid Pony looked at the ground, becoming a tad misty-eyed. \"But then she said that I shouldn't feel too disappointed, because she said she had a feeling that you'd be coming back soon!\" Feather's voice lifted and took on a cheery tone. \"So I waited and waited, and you know what? She was right! You did come back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see.\" Luna chuckled. \"You were hoping that after a thousand years of being trapped in the moon, fallen victim to my own bitterness, that I'd be eager to return to my old habits, eh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeather nodded with a smile on her face, it seemed that at long last, her dream of being food might come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well rest assured, loyal subject:\" Luna said, slipping back into the traditional Royal Canterlot Voice. \"<b>Thy Princess is most ravenous indeed, and we have selected thee to satisfy our hunger!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeather Duster's face lit up! She immediately bowed and began kissing Princess Luna's hooves. \"Oh thank you, <i>thank you,</i> Princess! I'm so honored that you'd choose <i>me</i> to be your next meal!\" She said between planting her lips on the royal hooves, her voice bubbling with reverence. Who'd have thought that a humble servant would be able to become so close to her beloved Princess in this day and age?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Enough adoration for now; present thy meaty flanks to us! So that we may administer the royal taste test!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeather Duster eagerly met the Princess's demand, always keeping her shapely rear above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna spent the next several minutes appraising her food. She gave long, lingering licks up and down the fleshy buttocks in front of her, alternating between the left and right flanks, each one getting closer and closer to the center, until finally her tongue found Feather Duster's privates. Luna's final lick commenced at the clitoris, lavished the labia, perused the perineum, and finally, swirled around the sphincter, each act provoked a barely restrained gasp from Luna's willing prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna found Feather Duster to be exquisite, and although she had suspected it beforehand, her lingual assault had confirmed her earlier suspicion: this little mare was in heat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Princess Luna? Is my, my meat to your liking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna decided to drop the Canterlot Voice for the moment, but kept the Elizabethan dialect. \"We find thy flavor to be beyond our expectations, Feather Duster - and we expect nothing but the best in all things!\" Luna walked around to meet Feather Duster eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, we also tasted a desire in thee, a need.\" Luna leered, causing the plump maid to blush; she'd gotten pretty good about hiding her heat from regular Ponies, but Luna was no regular Pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now the question becomes,\" Luna circled around Feather Duster. \"Dost thou wish for us to devour thee now?

Feather Duster wasted no time in pleasuring the Alicorn. Her tongue skirting Luna's vagina, flicking it with short teasing actions. Luna gave a small moan. Slowly, her wings unfurled themselves until they spread to their full glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna charged her magic and pulled a chest from beneath her bed labeled: 'Luna's toys! All others, hooves off! This means you, Sister!' Undoing the latch and opening the box, Luna willed a large rubber toy in the shape of an stallion's erect penis, complete with an unusually large flared head and simulated veins - for that extra realistic feel. *Good ol' Girthy* Luna thought. *Our exile may not have seemed so long if we had you* Bringing the dildo closer to her, Luna began to fellate the prosthetic. Once she felt that it was sufficiently moist, she levitated 'Ol' Girthy' up and behind her, till its head was poking at the entrance to Feather Duster's snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeather gasped and stopped the ministrations to look behind her at the offending device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do not mind him, dear Feather Duster. He's just lonely after so much time being cooped up in our room with no one to play with. You don't want him to be lonely, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeather Duster shook her head, still slightly bemused by the size of the plastic cock. \"N-no princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" Princess Luna used her magic to push the dildo harder against Feather's genitals. \"We shall oblige.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of stillness, the sex toy was inserted into Feather Duster's pussy with surprisingly little resistance. Luna looked on as she fucked her meal was fucked hard by the phallic  device with the aid of her own telekinesis. For about fifteen minutes, Feather Duster writhed in unadulterated pleasure on the floor, moaning and gasping, sighing and yelping. As that golden moment came closer and closer, Luna sped up in her magical ministrations, keeping her pumping in perfect rhythm with Feather Duster's bucking hips and vaginal contractions. Finally, the plump maid invoked Luna's name in the biggest orgasm of her soon-to-be-over life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, Feather finally came down from the afterglow when Luna had finished cleaning off Ol' Girthy with her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were we not serious when we said that Alicorns make for excellent lovers?\" Luna giggled as she placed the dildo back into the treasure chest, and moved that underneath her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeather Duster nodded in total agreement. \"That was astonishing, your highness. It's like you knew exactly what my body wanted.\" The maid sat up on her resting place on the bedroom floor. \"You made me climax so hard, I think you knocked me right out of my heat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeather Duster's praise made Luna smile. It was indeed a shame that she would have to be devoured, the way she sounded and looked during sex was very cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that my needs are met, your highness, how do you want me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna mulled it over for a minute before deciding that she'd rather...</span></div></div>",

Contrary to what old stories on the subject of Alicorn cannibalism say, they don't need to unhinge their jaws to ingest their prey, rather, the laws of physics are more lenient when it comes to their mouths and throats, allowing for things like this and the Royal Canterlot Voice. Feather knew what came next, she placed her hooves inside the nocturnal Pony's mouth, followed closely by her head. After this part, Luna took over, as she had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping her meal's shoulders past the back of her mouth, Luna shifted her focus to getting that curvy, flabby belly into her maw. She decided that the best way to handle that would be to lubricate the mare's tummy inch by inch with her tongue, just like with the dildo. Luna stuck her tongue under Feather Duster's belly and gave careful, ponderous swipes from side to side, making sure not to miss a single spot. The taste drove her wild! She really was the perfect meal, eager and large enough that Luna had to take her time and savor everything. The lashings of course tickled Feather Duster, causing her to giggle. In an effort to stifle herself, Feather Duster pressed her face against the princess's esophagus, if there were a third party in the room, they'd be able to see the outline of a very happy mare's face's molding in Luna's coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo on they went: lick by lick, inch by inch and giggle by giggle, until the tips of Feather Duster's hooves and her face were poking into Luna's stomach. Luna meanwhile, had gotten most of the maid's body into her gullet. Now, only the hindquarters remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Our tongue won't be able to reach up and around her bottom,* Luna thought. *Perhaps we should change tactics.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith as much strength as she could muster, Luna lifted her head so that her snout was facing the ceiling, she'd let gravity and peristalsis handle it from here. On Feather Duster's end, she felt her body pushed into the stomach behind her. The final swallowing happened so fast that Feather landed in the princess's stomach rather haphazardly. Once she was all in, Luna's own belly touched the floor. It would be rather difficult to reach her bed at this point. Soon enough she righted herself as best she could and decided to get comfortable and enjoy her final moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna giggled, not having heard a peep from Feather Duster. \"Don't tell us thou hast forgotten the most important part, Feather Duster? The part where you tell us if there's a specific part of your body you want us to add to our own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeather Duster thought for a few moments before deciding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, I've spent years cultivating this body into the perfect royal meal. I've gained and lost weight more times than I care to count. I'd be truly honored if you'd emulate my figure, so that the best part of me could live on through you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night princess was truly touched, Feather Duster was willing to bequeath Luna with what she treasured more than anything else in life; her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna prepared her goodbye. \"It shall be done, dear Feather Duster: I'm honored that you would give me your fat. Your beauty shall add to my own, and through this, we will be together forever. Thank you, dear meal, and goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, princess. Thank you for making my dream come true.\" Feather Duster said sleepily as exhaustion and lack of oxygen overtook her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly exhausting herself getting onto her bed, Luna promptly fell asleep as well. During her slumber, Luna's stomach acid worked on breaking down Feather Duster's body, its magical properties transmitting the fat on her form onto Luna's own. By the time digestion had done its job, Luna looked like she had eaten a whole palette of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cakes baked goods, the fat placed on her body perfectly mirrored that of Feather Duster's own figure.</span></div></div>",

Now that she has overcome the first large hurdle she worked on the next one, her large belly. Thankfully Feather Dusters fat was very soft and she could squeeze it into her mouth very easily. The maid moaned and panted all the way, overtaken by the pleasure of having her ultimate fantasy fulfilled. As she opened her eyes she could already see the princesses pearly white teeth. \"Thank you.\" She moaned again, taking in her last view of the world before the jaws closed and Luna proceeded to slurp up the front hooves while Feather Duster already sat in a small pool of stomach acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few gulps later the entire body of the maid was inside of Luna's stomach where she eagerly awaited the moment she would become part of princess Luna.

It was time-consuming and required careful monitoring so as to not overcook it however, so it took a special occasion to warrant so much work. \"How does that sound sister? A special meal for a special occasion.\" Celestia opened her mouth to respond, but a growl from her stomach answered for her. Luna chuckled as Celestia blushed in embarrassment. \"Well, I guess that answers that doesn't it?\" Luna continued cheekily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia took a moment to think of the last time she had cooked pony. It was a unicorn, roasted whole and covered with a honey glaze and stuffed with a bread stuffing. A simple recipe but one of her favorites. The sweet smell wafting from it was irresistible, the soft texture and sweet flavor teasing her taste buds as the meat melted in her mouth,... She snapped out of her stupor as she realized she had been drooling slightly, Luna's cocky smile making it blatantly apparent she knew she had won. Celestia sighed in defeat as the old memories of feasting on her subjects swept away the last of her resistance. \"Few ponies will care about Blueblood's disappearance, but getting him into an oven without making a scene might be difficult. Also, the cooks will be mortified by the idea of cooking a pony, it will take some convincing for them to cooperate.\" Celestia said, looking a little concerned. Luna's smirk didn't waver. \"Trust me sister, I have a plan. By tomorrow night you'll have roast Blueblood.\" And I'll have my delicious-looking maid, Luna thought. A meal as fine as her deserves the finest preparation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia nods. \"Very well sister, I'll leave it to you to make the preparations.\" She says as gets to her hooves. \"I... I admit I'm looking forward to tomorrow's dinner. Blueblood will certainly make a finer roast than a noblepony.

And few ponies were as important as a chef.  New chefs were often horrified by their \"preparation\" dreams, treating them as bizarre nightmares.  But over time, and with careful repetition and variation, some would become ready and willing to become the Most Royal Head Chef - and those who could not begin to enjoy the process in the dreamworld would find they had nightmares about being promoted to that role.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna made her way to the kitchen, to ensure that her chosen pony, Peppercorn, was in fact the Most Royal Head Chef (in dreams one could not be entirely certain, of course).  She was somewhat surprised to see Peppercorn apparently working with a Griffon.  But she was relieved to see Peppercorn wearing the emblem of the Head Chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peppercorn, attend me,\" she stated.  The pegasus stallion, and the griffon next to him, both bowed deeply.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, what may I do for you?  I have... heard that you rejected the last meal we prepared, did it displease you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neigh, thou art... ahem, you are an excellent chef.  I have merely been... awaiting a more... special meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeppercorn's wings flared.   \"Highness,\" he whispered.    Then his eyes darted left and right.  \"If I may humbly suggest we continue this discussion someplace more private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead on, my faithful chef.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio flared wings, and lifted into the air, to the rafters above the kitchen proper, where Peppercorn had established a small office, Peppercorn motioned to the Griffon who accompanied him.  \"This is Gilda, newly hired as an apprentice.  Equestrian by birth, despite her heritage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no objection to working with meat, Apprentice Gilda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda's beak dropped open in surprise.  \"I... no, your Highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I welcome you to the service of the Crown.  You will both prepare a feast for my sister.  If you do it correctly, it will be the first of many.  If you fail...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall not fail,\" Peppercorn stated with confidence.  \"May I ask... who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The most useless Prince, Bluebood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna eat a pony?\" Gilda squawked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiled at the griffon.  \"Peppercorn will not be able to properly enjoy the flavor.  To both of our mutual disappointment, I am sure.  However... I will allow you a small taste, young apprentice.  I assume you have never tasted the perfection that is roast unicorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.... just some bunnies and stuff like that,\" Gilda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The meat will arrive shortly.  Ensure that none whose stomachs are... squeamish are in attendance.  If any protest, they are to be sent to the dungeons, for later snacking.  You understand, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, highness.  I... we shall not fail you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes... no, fold your legs inward... rump higher, yes, yes, just like that, highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will take a dozen baths to wash out,\" Blueblood stated miserably.  \"Why is this even necessary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a bit large to carry, highness.

They await your... guidance,\" Peppercorn answered.  \"The rest were rather eager to assist with this particular... dish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia had tuned out the discussion entirely, as she slowly reached out with her magic, and grabbed at Blueblood's left rear leg, pulling it up into the air, and causing most of his left flank to to fall off his body gently along with the leg.   Ever so slowly, she brought the morsel to her face, and took a small taste of the roasted flank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept the morsel in her mouth briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your verdict, your Royal Highness?\" Peppercorn asked, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the end, Prince Blueblood... you were a good pony.  A very good pony, indeed,\" she answered, before tearing into the morsel she'd already removed with reckless abandon.  Luna joined her, if only because if she didn't start now she might not get any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yes, Gilda did get her promised taste.  </span></div></div>",

She had the ability to influence parts of a dream, but not immediately. They could not harm her, and she'd been in a lot of nightmares, but sometimes you never know what to expect. Sometimes the dreams are harmless enough, giant spiders or dragons or evil trees. Then there were times where you walked in on nightmares about ponies being infested with horrible parasites that would burst out of the victims chest before waking them up and ejecting Luna from the dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trotted along and soon came across a clearing, and there she spotted Feather Duster, cowering. Luna saw she was not alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare Moon, standing tall and proud and menacing, loomed over Feather Duster with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna felt a flicker of annoyance and guilt. This was one of her least favorite nightmares. It seemed the maid was afraid of her, deep down. It started to hurt her feelings, but then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare Moon stepped over to the pony and knelt down, pressing her body against Feather Duster. Nightmare's stomach growled, and Luna felt the emotion of excitement echo through the dream. Luna's eyes widened as she suddenly had the epiphany that Feather Duster was not really scared, but merely that the emotion of fear was being emulated--she'd encountered this plenty of times before, where an emotion would be a part of the dream almost as if it was necessary to the plot of it, but that ponies could have different emotions about the dream later, such as having dreams about falling in love with someone they actually hated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare Moon began to lick the dock of Feather Duster. \"You're going in me soon, little one. You escaped from me when you were a child, but now I found you at last!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeather Duster gasped. \"Please don't eat me mistress!\" she cried, but the pony's excitement mounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna stepped forward, but her presence alone broke the dream and dispersed all manifestations in the dream with the exception of scenery and Feather Duster herself. The maid looked up and around, shocked to find that Nightmare Moon was gone. She became lucid, and then took notice of Luna and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-p-princess! Oh no, don't tell me this is a dream! Is that really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes, it is,\" said Luna. \"We seem to have interrupted something, fair maid.\" Now that she was addressing a subject, her compulsion to use the royal we entered into play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid blushed and then hung her head, cringing in embarrassment. \"I apologize from the bottom of my heart madam, I don't mean to have a nightmare about you, please forgive me! I know how hard it has been for you to know what others feel about you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna blinked. \"It has been painful for us. We do not wish harm nor fear on our subjects no longer; pray tell, though, why did you seem happy that my alter ego was harassing you so? Was her intention not in fact to swallow you whole and alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid blushed. \"Oh... Oh its embarrassing to say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiled. \"Do not tell me that thou art desiring this thing to happen to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid looked surprised, then nodded her head in shame. \"I have had this dream since I was a child. I grew very fond of it over time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna grinned and stepped forward, her eyes beaming. \"Sweet maid, Feather Duster, are you not aware that we the Alicorn Princesses actually used to perform this very thing in the past?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid looked shocked. \"What? No, that's... that's just part of the legend! The fearsome Princess of the Night and her hunger for pony flesh, it is well known, but nothing like that is said of Princess Celestia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna grimaced. More bucking lies. She doubted Celestia let this happen intentionally--she just had a lot of respect for the free will of ponies and no doubt this was the commoner's vision of history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps this was a bad approach,\" said Luna. \"We apologize for our shocking words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, is it true?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, both we and our sister did eat ponies for a time,\" said Luna. \"Celestia has already told us about how she surrendered this practice long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said the maid, unsure how to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we mean to say, is,\" Luna started, then hesitated, looking for the right words.</span></div></div>",

For now you only have what you believe it feels like to work with, my magic can make it real. Of course, you will wake up again in the morning, when I digested your body in this dream so no worries.\" She explained, hoping it would make the decision easier for this maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was no way that Feather Duster could possibly resist. \"My Princess, it would be an honor to be your meal tonight.\" She said with a deep bow. Luna licked her lips and mustered her body. She started to drool at the sight and now she could eat her all up and would not even have to share with her sister. Feather Duster looked up again and smiled as she saw the hungry look in Princess Luna's eyes. \"I hope that I taste as good as you hope your majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna came closer, circling the mare a little, before giving her a lick. The maid shuddered in pleasure, as the tongue of the alicorn wandered from her neck, all the way down to her backside and flanks. \"Oh Feather Duster my dear, I guarantee you would not have managed to dust off one piece of furniture before landing in my stomach, if you had worked for the palace back in the days.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid was proud to hear that. Even if some might think it's a little obsessive, she made herself so plump and often got massages in order to make herself tender, just because this would make her the perfect meal. \"Thank you so much Princess Luna, I wish I had lived already back then. But please do not tease me anymore, I want nothing more than to be inside of you.\" She cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna could also not wait anymore, she had to get this one into her belly. \"Understood, one last thing though.\" She leaned down, her face right next to Feather Duster's. \"In your dream it was Nightmare Moon, do you want me to take her form for this? Do not worry, I am not bothered by it and if it makes this better for you, I will gladly become Nightmare Moon once again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeather Duster had to think for a moment.

Getting all of this mare inside would be a challenge if she played by the rules of reality but it would still be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna decided against using her powers in the dreamworld to cheat and instead prepared Feather Duster, licking the mares large buttocks and flanks, while the maid moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she felt, that Feather Duster was lubricated enough, Luna pressed the soft flanks together a little and opened her mouth wider than anypony would think it to be possible. As she got closer and her lips started to engulf Feather Duster's flanks, the smell of arousal hit the Princess' nose. Playfully she licked between the buttcheeks, over the wet slit and anus, earning her another gasp of pleasure. \"P-please Princess, enjoy your meal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna did just that, slowly pushing more of the maid into her mouth. The Princess was glad, that she did not have to breathe in a dream, if she was to eat Feather Duster in reality, she would not be able to really take her time. Giving the maids marehood a few more licks, Luna moved on, pulling her deeper down her throat. As Feather Duster's front hooves lost contact with the ground, Luna was licking across her teats and belly, throughoutly enjoying the taste of the chubby mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Luna let herself fall back on her haunches, as she already had half of her meal down. The craned her neck upwards and stopped swallowing, instead letting the other mare slowly slide down. Feather Duster enjoyed herself, as her body rubbed against the inside of Luna's throat. Her rear hooves were already inside of the Princess's stomach and wriggled around a little. \"Thank you so much, this feels better than I would have ever imagined.\" Feather Duster said, as only her head was still outside. Slowly her world became dark, as she saw the teeth of the Princess, slowly closing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few more gulps, Luna sent the rest of Feather Duster's body down into her stomach, there said mare was now curled up. Luna's belly was almost stretching to the ground now and the felt happy, being so full. \"Thank you Feather Duster, you were truly a meal worthy of my royal tongue. Tell me, do you wish to wake up now or do you also want to experience being digested? I know it is probably part of your fantasy but... if you want it to feel real, I can't guarantee it will be painless.\"</span></div></div>",

Bothered her... and aroused her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For the remainder of the day, Luna was lost in thought. Thoughts of swallowing her sister, digesting her and adding her mass to her own body. The big sister, the superior sister, the more beloved sister, being totally helpless before her. Something that, somewhere deep down, she may have wanted all along. She did not know and right now, she did not care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Whenever she passed her sister in the hallways of the large castle, her blush would deepen and she would involuntarily bite her lip as Celestia walked by, much to the latter's confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Luna?\" She tilted her head as she stopped in her tracks. \"Are you quite alright?

She was doubtful that she would have the courage to go through with it. She was reassured, almost ironically, by remembering something her sister had told her so many years ago: \"No problem is so great that a well-laid plan cannot overcome it, if executed properly.\" She worried that her motivations were the same kind of monstrous want and pettiness that had morphed her mind and body into that of Nightmare Moon. She came to realize that it was not an envy of her sister's position or the love she got in place of herself, but a primal hunger and a predatory desire to unite with her sister on the deepest, most literal and physical level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>And indeed, is there not a kind of symbolic importance to this?</i> She thought. <i>Is it not the way of things that day eventually wanes into night?

The twilight of the diarchy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Princess Luna turned back to the drawingboard, satisfied with her musings. She'd properly outlined the general way in which she'd do things. Now for the specifics. First off; how should she eat her? Raw or cooked? The former could perhaps be handled by herself, but she would need... cohorts.</span></div></div>",

She traced the bulge down to her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Aaaahhhh....!\" Luna sighed in delight. The Night Princess laid her body down on Celestia's bed, allowing her massively swollen belly to spill out onto the sheets. \"Delicious!\" The Lunar Princess smacked her lips and rubbed her stomach.

For, while she herself was more powerful than Celestia, Twilight could surpass BOTH of them COMBINED if she wanted to. Especially after Tireks' incident. And two, and more importantly, she really wanted Twilight to say yes. Because, what no one knew, was that, ever since her first nightmare night since her return, or perhaps even before that, when she, along with the other element bearers rescued her from Nightmare Moon, she had been in love with the purple mare. She hadn't acted on it because of the diferences of their life spans. But now, Twilight was an Alicorn. Thus, like her, she would live forever. She wished that she and Twilight could one day rule Equestria as a couple. She wanted for them to be together more than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">*But, I'll have to risk it.

Forever.*</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mind set, she glided upwards, until she was hovering just above the balcony of Twilight's bedroom. She landed and looked inside. The room was currently empty. But the lights were on. That meant that Twilight would return here soon. Luna carefully opened the double windowed doors and silently entered Twilight's bedroom. Upon doing so, she heard noise coming from a door that was on the left side of the bedroom. That sound resembled water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\"><i>*She's taking a bath before going to bed.*</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna couldnt help it. Knowing that Twilight was bathing, she couldn't help thinking about the purple alicorn all wet and glistening with water. She tought of her now longer slender legs. Her flanks. Which were oddly quite shaped and toned, despite the fact that Twilight had spent most of her life reading on her bedroom back in the Canterlot palace or on the royal archives. She tought of her majestic wings. Wings that surpassed even hers in beauty. And he horn. Oh, how Luna longed to suck and lick all up and down of Twilight's horn until the purplae mare released inside of her. She would swallow it all and lick off all that remained. And then Twilight would return the favor. Luna had had countless fantasys like that involving Twilight. A quite noticeable blush was forming on Luna's face. Another thing that was making itself quite noticed, was a heat between Luna's legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Luna suddenly began to hear another sound coming from the bathroom. It was humming. It seemed that Twilight liked to hum while bathing. A habit she herself shared. Luna tried to dicern the notes and find out what song Twilight was humming. And she was shocked when she recognized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><i>*Hmmhmm mhmhm mhmh hmhm...*</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cindigo\">*It's my lullaby! She... My love... Is humming my lullaby.*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that the mare she loved not just knew her song, but was so fond of it as to hum it in such a private moment filled Luna with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the humming and the water stoped. Signaling that Twilight was done with her bath. Luna decided to go to the shaded side of the doors leading to the balcony, by the curtains, and wait until Twilight was comfortable. Then she would reveal herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been an exciting day. First, the element pearers had a competition of strenght, stamina and wits in several challeges. The she had to help Mayor Mare with reorganizing her office. Then she helped Cherilee with the little ones. She liked working with children. But mare can they be tiring\" Even for a princess. Last, but not least, Pinkie had trown them all a party for they're competition, which had ended in a tie. Twilight had competed with either, her Unicorn, Pegasi or Earth Pony sides. But never all three. After all, it wouldn't be fair for her to go all out againts them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*yawn* Mare, I'lll never get tired of Pinkie's parties. Sure, the ones at Canterlot were, somewhat, fun. But no party beats a Pinkie Pie party.\"</span>, mused Twilight out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then picked up her telescope and her charts and went towards the balcony doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Now, time for some stargazing before sleeping!\"</span>, said Twilight, with a smile. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Hmm... I want to learn more about the stars. I mean, the books are good and all. But, maybe I should ask Luna to teach em about them. I mean, what better source to learn about the stars and the moon than the very being that controls them? Hmm... <i>Luna</i>.\"</span>, Twilight whispered the lunar princess name in a dreamy way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight had often dreamed of her fellow princess. Ever since meeting her after defeating Nightmare Moon. She also tended to compare how she saw her then and how she sees her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Luna sure was cute after Nightmare's fall. *giggle* She looked adorable! But now, in her older form, she went from cute to sexy. <i>So darn hot and sexy...</i>\"</span>, Twilight purred that last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUbestknown to her, a certain moon princess was listening to everything she was saying. And, altough she was trying to stiffle it, her blush kept growing more and more. She couldn't belive what she was hearing! Just like she desired the purle alicorn, Twilight desired her! What was more, she wanted to learn from her! If Twilight asked, she would say is in a heartbeat. Wether it was for the lessons or some *ahem* naughty fun. Luna noticed that the heat betewwn her legs was getting worse. And it was begging to be calmed. Luna couldn't take it anymore. So, she decided to stop hiding and try to bed her love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Good night, Twilight Sparkle.\"</span> she said in a husky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, Twilight droped her instruments and stared in surprise at her \"guest\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"P-princess Luna? How long have you been here?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Oh, a little while. Since you were bathing, to be more specific.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blushed profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"S-so... You-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Heard it all? Yes. Still, where did you learn that song you were humming?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Celestia used to sing it to me as a filly whenever there was a storm. She never said to who it belonged tough.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"I see.\"</span> Luna smiled. Touched that her sister, and soon to be meal, had kept her song alive. <span class=\"cindigo\">\"That song, Twilight. Is my lullaby.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Eh? It's yours?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Yes. I used to sing it to the little ponies of Equestria during the times after defeating Discord. When Equestria was begginging to recover.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I see. Honestly, I think it's beautiful. I do not know the lyrics tough. I only know the melody.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"I can sing it to you later, if you want me to. And I would very much like to teach you what I know.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's eyes widened. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"F-for real?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*squeal*\" Twilight run over to Luna and hugged her tightly. Her astronomy instruments forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna blushed heavily at having such close and personal contact with the mare she loved. She then was shocked by Twilight's next action. For the smaller alicorn, altough she was almost Luna's height, kissed her full on the lips! It was a sweet and intense kiss. Altough a bit clumsy. Twilight didn't stoped there. She used her tongue to knock on Luna's teeth, requesting entrance. Luna, too shocked to do much, could only comply. Twilight didn't wasted anytime. She explored avery bit of Luna's mouth with her unexperienced tongue. Eventually, Luna joined in. And he had to admit that, while it was clear that Twilight was inexperiant, what she lacked in experience, she made up for it with dedication and passion. Eventually, and reluctantly, both broke up, for they needed to breath. Bothe were blushing hevily and panting quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Twilight...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Luna, I know I was quite forward.

She breathed deeply to calm herself. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"I love you, Princess Luna di Selene.\"</span>, when Twilight said that, she did so looking full on Luna's eyes. Those beautiful blue eyes that always mesmerized her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna suddenly began to cry. However, they were not from sadness. No. They were from the immense joy she was feeling right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"A-and I love you, Twilight Andromeda Sparkle!\"</span>, Luna the initiated another kiss. This one more passiontae that the other. Twilight knew she was inexperienced. So, she let Luna take charge and teach her how to properly kiss her marefriend. Her princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they separated again, Twilight was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Wow...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"*chuckles* Wow indeed, my dearest.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled.</span></div></div>",

By the way Luna, I want to tell you three things.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"What is it, beloved?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*blushes*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"*giggles* Yiu're so adorable when you blush dear!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"T-thank you. Anyway, first, those two were my first and second kisses.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Really?! Hmmm. How lucky can I be? Still, I would have thought that a mare as meautiful as you would of had a at least one partner before.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"No. I wanted to preserve myself for when I found the one. The one that makes me feel safe in their embrace. The ose that makes my heart soar. And that one, is you. My precious moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Oh, my beloved star...\"</span>, said Luna, tearing up a bit. She was touched that Twilight had saved herself for her. And at Twilights nickname for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Second, I want you to know that I you mustn't worry. I will aid you on your fantasy of eating Celestia.\"</span>, Twilight smirked when Luna froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"H-how do you...?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"You see, after the battle with Tirek, when you, Celestian and Cadence took all of your magics back, some remined withing me. I manaed to control iy. But, tkanks to Cadence's magic of love, altough I could not see the fantasies of others, I managed to decipher some bits and clues. Your's was like a bright light in the dark because of your magic inside of me. So, altough I wasn't sure, I decided t gamble and risk that that wasr fantasy. Not to mention that, with how strong your desire and fantsy are, it's not really hard to decipher. Even for a rookie like myself.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"I see. But, why? I mean, Celestia-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"She has always been a second mother to me. Yes. That will never change. But, it's time for changes. Celestia had made many mistakes lately. And, one of the many thiggs that my adventures have taught me, is that, in order to lead, one must be willing to fight for their people. One must be willing to make sacrifices and show corage and inspire others. But, when we fought against you, against Discord, Chrysalis, Sombra and Tirek, it was me and my freinds that fought. Celestia didn't move a mussle! I saw you tough. You wanted to fight alongside us. You wanted to fight and protect your subjects, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Yes. Yes, I wanted to. But Celestia said not to.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I thought so. Also, she's too compassive. I mean, of the fight against Chrysalis, because she feared harming her subjects, myself and Cadence included, she tuned down her power and underestimated the enemy. She could have ordered for us to leave and I would have teleported us all out, for crying out loud!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded. Altough she hadn1t been there, she knew that there were Time Plants and over the palace, they were like many hidden cameras that, when activated trough magic, they show the caster what happened in there. The more and stronger the magic used, the more one can could see. Thus, she knew that Twilight was telling her the truth. She had been severly dissapointed with her sister for what had happened on that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Besides, I have to confess, that this vore thing is something I've always been curious to try.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Oh? Is that so?\"</span>, sid Luna, with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yeah. Anyway, the third thing I wanted to tell you that... well, it'll be better if you look between my legs love.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Aroused, are we?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Y-yes *blushes* But that's not all. Just look. You'll understand when you do.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna, altough a bit confused by her soon-to-be mate's words, did as requested. Twilight spread her legs and raised as high as she could, so as to avoid causing physical discomfort for her princess. Her beloved moon. Soon enough, Twilight hear Luna gasp loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"T- Twilight, is this...?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yeah. And it's natural. You see, when I was born, I can with a little \"extra\" part.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded. Ans she couldn't help but lick her lips, longing to taste Twilights thick and long \"horn\". Twilight couldn't help but sensing relief and pride that her soon-to-be-mate approved of her \"colt parts\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Well, my precious moon. Shall we take this matter to a more appropriated location?\"</span>, said Twilight with a seductive tove and indincating her bed with her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"*murrrr* That sounds splendid, my dearest star.\"</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight was leading Luna to her bed. She couldn't belive what was happenig! She and Luna woud finally be together! So, she wanted to make this, their first time together, as special as she could. Suddenly, she remebered a few advices that Rarity had given to her about dates once. She turned to Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Um, Luna?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Yes my dearest?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*blush* W-well, would you mind stepping out for a bit?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Why?

I want to make a surprise for you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Twilight, I don't need anything special. I only need you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I understant that. But, please. This will be our first time. And I want it to be something that both of us will never froget for the eons to come!\"</span>, said Twilight. Sporting the biggest blush she ever had. Her entire face was glowing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Very well.\"</span>, she said, stepping out of Twilight's royal chambers. Before going out conmpletely, she peeked one more time and said, <span class=\"cindigo\">\"Just don't take too long dearest. It's not polite to make a mare wait, you know? *wink*.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled at Luna's seductive tone and at her eagerness in beggining their \"fun\". And she was just as eager. So, she didn't wasted any time. She beggan to reform the bedroom and to look for the appropriate clothing for what she wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Meanwhile-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna had gone to the new library of Twilight's castle. She was anxious as to what her beloved had planned for them. Truly, the castle itself was nothing short of magnificent. But the library was something where she prefered to saty whenever she visited her now marefriend. It was the only place of the entire castle that gave that home feeling that Twilight's previous library on the Treehouse gave, before that wretched Centaur destroyed it. She had gone to the library searching for a particular kind of book. She was looking for a cookbook. One that specialised on sweets. Just like Twilight wanted to give her a present, she wanted to give her beloved a present too. She found one that was centered on chocolates. She found the cover strange. Because it had many things she hadn't seen before. Then again, even if she was immortal and had seen plenty of things in her life, it's impossible to know everything. As there was always something new popping up. She noticed that the book was from Prance. She tried to translate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"\"O...Oh, Swe...Sweets.\" Ah! I got it! <i>Oh! Sweets!</i>\"</span>, she said, giddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened it and began to browse. She saw many articles but none seemed good enough for her love. Then again, in Luna's opinion, nothing was good enough for her Twilight. Then, an article drew her interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Yes! This one will be perfect for the both of us!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna the gathered what she needed and began to make the yummy treat for her and her love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Three hours later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was giving the final touches when she got a mental singal from Twilight, indicating that she could now go to the bedroom. So, she used her magic to clean everything up, hid her gift on her mane and teleported right behind the bedroom's door. She raised her hoof and knocked three times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Do come in love.\"</span>, said a seductive and flirtatious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Don't mind if I do!\"</span>, said Luna in a similar tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered the bedroom and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"*GASP!!!*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes became as wide as dinner plates because of the vision she had. The room looked completely different than it was beore! The bed had been replaced by a Queen sized one. The mattress was tan colored. The bed-sheats were from different colors. The mattress' cover was purple, like Twilight's coat and the sheets were magenta, like Twilight's magic. The wood where the mattress was above of was midnight blue, like her coat. And the covers linking the wood pilars of the bed's corners were indigo and silverish white, like her mane and the moon and stars she commanded. Truly, it was a bed that fitted them both. The ceiling now portrayed the starry sky that they loved so much and was enchanted to make it so that the constellations it showed changed frequently. The crystal walls had been painted a darker shade of indigo. A point in between her coat and Twlilight's. The furniture, aside from the bookshelves, was now a slightly darker tone of Aqua. The bookshelves were pink colored. She then took a look at Twilight. Who she tought was the main jewel of this master-piece. Her beloved was wearing a dark-red dress with light-red highlights that hugged her curves not too loosely and not too tightly and that showed and highlighted her now more slender legs. It also was cut in a way to give the watcher a slight peek under the dress. As if inviting to take a better look. Luna also moticed that her beloved had brushed her mane and put a flower, which, to Luna's further surprise, was a Night-Keeper, her own creation, just above of her right ear and applied a bit of make-up. Luna noticed a bit of shadow on her thin eyebrows. Just enough to slightly darken them. She also noticed some blush on her cheecks and, last, but not least, the amethyst colored lipstick that Twilight had applied on her soft and tender lips. Lips that Luna wished to kiss over and over again and never stop doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"M-my love...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I- is it too much?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"No. Thank you my love. Both, the room, and especially you, look lovely.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"H-honest?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna looked in shock at her and feigned hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Twilight Andromeda Sparkle, do you honestly think that I would lie to you? I'm hurt!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*pffff* Ha, ha, ha, ha! Oh Luna, you are so funny!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Now she laughs at my misery! Does your malice know no end?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was laughing so much that she was about to cry. Luckily she didn't. Otherwise it would ruin her make up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Geez love. You sure know how to, how do you say it? Ah, right. Jest.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Thank you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"You're welcome. Still, there is one more thing I'd like to do before we begin.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna rised an eyebrow, Twilight got down from the bed and kneeled on both of her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Twilight?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I learned this was how you did it back then. Before you were banished. So...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight then fondled oer arms on the ground and bent down until her forehead touched her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"I'm unexperienced and a bit clumsy. Still, I hope that you accept me, my love.\"</span>, she said, rising her head and looking at Luna in her eyes. <span class=\"cviolet\">\"Please take good care of me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw next was a midnight blue blur tackling her into the bed. Upon landing, she also felt tears falling on her shoulders. She looked at Luna and found that she was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Luna?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"F-fret not dearest. I'm crying out of joy. Not sadness. I herby accept you and I solemnly swear that I will take good care of you! You have no idea how much it means to me that you would go out of your way to do this for me on the way it was back then. Thank you my love! Thank you so much!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"No Luna. Thank you, for accepting me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"You're welcome. By the way, did you knew that, what you did just now, is not a request for sex or courting?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Eh? Then, what is it for?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna got close enough to Twilight so that she could whisper to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"It's a proposal for marriage, my love.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"M-marriage?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Eeyup! *giggles*\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"*gulp* If you'll have me...Then I'll gladly marry you, my beloved moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's eyes went wide. She rised hr head and looked at Twilight in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"A-are you serious?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwlight grabed Luna's head and brought it close until their lips were almost brushing against each other and looked firmly and serious in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Luna. My love. My beloved moon. I have never in my life been so serious.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Oh Twilight!\"</span>,said Luna, filled with the utmost joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe enveloped Twilight with her wings and embraced her with her hooves and hugged her tightly against herself. All of this while giving Twilight the most passinate and love filled kiss so far. She didn't stoped there. She began to prench kiss her marefriend, who responded with equal passion, and began to undress her oh so slowly. She spread her wings and made it so that Twilight and herself were standing on their back legs. She began with the Night-Keeper on Twilight's mane. She then undid her mane-style, letting it flow freely. Then she began removing the dress. First the neck, then the shoulders, the chest, the waist, the rump, wich she took the chance to caress slowly and sensualy, delighted at the gasp and at the soft moan that her mate let out, and finally her back legs. Once the dress was out, Luna gently droped Twilight back on the bed and used her wings to slowly descend on top of her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Are you ready for the best night of your life? To be mine and for me to be yours, forever more?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Yes my love. I wouldn't go on with this if I wasn't. Luna, my precious moon, I want you. I want to be with you. I want to be yours and for you to be mine in every sense of the word. I want to be bonded to you in any possible way. *chuckle* With sex being the first one.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Very well then. Then let us begin. And, once we're done, we will belong to each other, for eternity.\"</span></span></div></div>",

Sugarplum, Luna thought her name was. <br>\r\n\"Rise.\" Luna commanded. The cream colored mare complied, the ends of her deep violet mane sweeping the floor. \"You needn't be so formal with me. Though I am a princess, I am also a pony like anypony else.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll remember for next time.\" Sugarplum promised. \"What can I do for you,  Princess Luna?\"<br>\r\n\"Promise you will not judge. It is what some may call an archaic practice, but my sister and I will be resurrecting the tradition on Sunday night.\" Luna replied.<br>\r\n\"What might that be, Princess?\" Sugarplum asked.<br>\r\n\"Before I was banished, my sister and I would regularly indulge in the flesh of ponies.\" Luna responded. To her surprise, the cook didn't even wince. \"Do you not find this abhorrent? Are you not disgusted that your beloved princesses partake in cannibalism?\"<br>\r\n\"I've heard the rumors Princess, and yes, it was a bit jarring at first but you are royalty. What you do behind closed doors is your own business.\" said Sugarplum coolly. Luna was a bit taken aback by this, but the chef seemed serious so she continued,<br>\r\n\"On Sunday evening I will require you to take Prince Blueblood, shear him, marinate him, and roast him without killing him. My sister and I will take care of that.\" Luna smiled, baring her teeth. \"Are you able to do that for me?\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever my princess wishes of me.\" Sugarplum bowed out of respect.<br>\r\n\"Excellent...\" Luna nearly growled with lust. Perhaps Nightmare Moon wasn't completely gone... </span></div></div>",

She thought of how triumphant she would feel in front of that pathetic, mewling excuse for a stallion and how he would scream when she took that first, agonizingly slow bite... Luna actually became a bit aroused. Yes... Yes... To look into the eyes of true royalty, knowing your life was a sham, as the rightful ruler of the land devoured your very being... If she reinstated the practice of royal cannibalism, perhaps it would be enough to quell the lingering darkness in her heart. She mustn't dwell on it any longer, she still had duties to perform. It was early morning now and her elder sister was already seated in the great balcony. Luna channeled her godlike magical ability, lowering the moon as her sister raised the sun. She yawned and trotted towards her bed. It was nearly Thursday by now, and Sunday couldn't come quickly enough.<br>\r\nLuna awoke at the crack of dusk, ready to raise the moon. Oh, what day was it? Friday? Despite her endless hunger, time has slipped away from her. There were preparations to be made. Upon raising the moon and seeing Celestia retire to bed, Luna briskly walked back to her own room. She must be dressed accordingly for such a momentous occasion. Rifling through her wardrobe, she found the perfect dress. A delicate piece spun from black silk, its hem falling just beneath her haunches. Luna smiled at herself in the mirror. The dress had soft, lacy straps and wasn't overly flashy, just the way she liked them. Unlike that... that PRINCE. Luna breathed in deeply, walking over to her jewelry box and removing her favorite necklace. A large, oval locket, crafted from silver. It had been a gift from her sister, shortly after she had returned from the moon. Celestia had admitted that when she had originally banished Luna, she thought it was permanent. Luna raised the locket with her magic and inspected it through misty eyes. It was gorgeous, no expense had been spared in its making. Tiny circles of onyx and sapphire (or perhaps blue diamond, Luna was no geologist) were set alternating on its rim. A crescent moon, nearly the exact one on her cutie mark was carved in the center. Supposedly a spell had been cast so the silver would never tarnish. It was truly the work of an artist. But the real treasure was inside. Luna popped it open. On one side of the locket was herself, smiling in a way that she had never let her subjects see in the older days. On the other side was her dear sister Celestia. Luna marvelled at the technological advancement for a moment. They just pointed and shot, so you could do things like smile, instead of holding completely still for and hour or so while waiting for a portrait to be finished. <br>\r\nSnapping out of her astonishment, Luna put the locket away and hung up the dress.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I think I'll invite Celestia to dinner on Sunday...\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight took some time to clean up as Luna looked around the library, taking a moment to admire how much pony architecture has changed over the centuries. This was the first time she\u2019s even been to the humble town of Ponyville, and she\u2019s never seen anything like it before. There was a lot that has changed over time, and quite a few things had happened tonight that Luna simply didn\u2019t understand. She\u2019d have to ask Twilight about some of the quirkier aspects of Ponyville culture tommorow. Particularly the whole \u2018gobbling ponies up\u2019 thing. In centuries past, ponies feared the prospect being swallowed alive by their princesses-- and these days they have an entire holiday dedicated to it? These were strange times indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Twilight, preparing to hit the hay for the night,  tosses her robe and novelty wizard hat from her Starswirl costume into a small compartment full of similar knickknacks-- keepsakes from adventures long past that she couldn\u2019t bear to throw away. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cSo, did you have fun tonight?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cOh, yes! We greatly enjoyed the night\u2019s festivities,\u201d</span> Luna announced, cheerfully, though she was disappointed she didn\u2019t get a chance to play more party games on account of, well, everypony screaming and running away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cAre you sure? You seemed a little bit uncomfortable at times,\u201d</span> Twilight asked. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cDid you just find it strange how different everything is nowadays?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cYou ponies\u2019 traditions are many and strange, indeed. But if we are to, uh\u2026 \u2018fit in\u2019 around here, we must acclimate to this modern culture,\u201d</span> Luna sighed, but put on an air of pomp and royal certainty. Still, Twilight could sense a hint of dejection in her voice, as if the princess was overwhelmed by this new society and missed the old Equestria that she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cDon\u2019t stress yourself over it too much,\u201d</span> Twilight recommended, still humbled and faintly amused to see even an all-powerful alicorn princess struggling socially. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cPonies today are a lot more understanding than they were a thousand years ago. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll accept you for who you are, no matter what.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThank you, Twilight. We know well how accepting you townsponies are, we simply\u2026 need some time to get comfortable,\u201d</span> Luna replied simply, not even bothering to use her signature purple prose, giving a genuine smile for the first time of the night since she first tried to spider tossing game. Twilight showed Luna the guest room in the basement area of the library, nestled among the roots of the gargantuan hollowed-out tree. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThanks, but we think we\u2019ll stay up tonight.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey returned to the atrium of the library, and Luna pored over some of Twilight\u2019s vast collection of books while Twilight walked into the restroom to take a warm bath and get ready for bed. Suddenly, there were three heavy knocks on the Library\u2019s door. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cCould you get that?\u201d</span> Luna moved to pull open the heavy wooden library door, before a delightful smell invaded her nostrils as she drew close, like vanilla and chocolate. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cMm! What could that delicious aroma be?\u201d</span> Luna wondered to herself, quickly growing excited. Perhaps somepony had baked her a massive, delicious cake as an offering! She loves cake! She pulled the door open, waiting to chow down on a delicious treat, only to see an exhausted-looking filly standing before her. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHello, princess! It\u2019s, uh, Applebloom. Applejack\u2019s sister.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess quickly realized what the source of the delicious smell was. The filly was covered head-to-toe with melted and blended chocolate, sugar, cake batter, vanilla, and every other delicious coating you could think of. For a small moment, Luna assumed that she was planning to offer herself as a nightmare night treat, until she saw the small pillowcase full of candy the filly was holding. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cSorry we didn\u2019t make it to the ceremonies. Scootaloo got the bright idea that we should spend all night trying to get our cutie marks in candy making. It, uh\u2026 didn\u2019t work out,\u201d</span> she sighed, gesturing to the melted candy that coated her fur. She overturns the pillowcase she was holding, dumping its contents on the ground. Compared to the melted candy splattered across her mane and fur, the candy she was offering was rather paltry. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAnyway, to make it up to you, here.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cOh\u2026 hmm. We are sorry, child, but this isn\u2019t nearly enough,\u201d</span> Luna frowned, visibly disappointed by the meager pile of half a dozen small candies. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHey, it\u2019s all the candy we have left. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s the thought that counts, right?\u201d</span> she shrugs with a chuckle, before making motions for the door. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAnyway, I should be heading back. I\u2019ve got to get a bath, wash all this off me. It was nice meeting ya, anyway.\u201d</span> Before Applebloom could walk out the front door into the cold night beyond, however, Luna stepped in front of the door, blocking the exit. Startled, the filly looked up at the princess towering before her, who suddenly took on an almost intimidating presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cOur apologies, Applebloom, but a royal cannot let thee get away with defying sacred traditions. It would set a terrible precedent! Surely, thou understands,\u201d</span> Luna announced sternly. She had swallowed ponies before, a few times, in the more lawless eras of many centuries past. It was mostly the most despicable criminals that she devoured, as well as any subjects that willingly offered themselves for one reason or another. She wasn\u2019t planning on eating any ponies during her visit to Ponyville, but if it was part of their sacred traditions, she certainly wouldn\u2019t complain. She did want to prove herself to the local townsponies, no? It didn\u2019t hurt that Luna\u2019s mouth was already watering at the smell of the melted sweets splattered all over the small pony\u2019s fur and mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom suddenly started levitating above the ground, and her limbs went stiff, as if she wasn\u2019t in control of them anymore. She quickly realized that Luna had picked her up with her power of telekinesis, and was slowly hovering her towards the alicorn, who looked almost like she was licking her lips hungrily.<span class=\"ctan\"> \u201cUh, princess? What are you doi- <i>mph</i>!\u201d</span> Applebloom\u2019s query was cut short as the princess, who was almost 5 times larger than her, closed her mouth around the filly\u2019s head, knocking her bow off onto the floor. Luna was immediately overwhelmed by the taste. Like swallowing one big, delicious three hundred pound cake in one bite. She had been chowing down on every sweet imaginable for the entire night, but none of it even compared to this. She had to admit-- after over a thousand years, she missed the taste of ponies. By the time Applebloom could even register just what was going on, only her hind legs were still sticking out of the princess's gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight emerged from the shower, her fur still slightly wet, a towel wrapped in her hair. She seemed content, only for her face to change to that of shock and terror as she saw what was occurring in her own living room. Twilight immediately began yelling something or another-- Luna was too wrapped up in her meal to pay her any attention-- and immediately sprinted up to Luna, trying to pull the earth pony from her maw. <i>\u2018Just what does Twilight think she\u2019s doing, interrupting a royal while she\u2019s eating? How uncouth!\u2019</i> Luna thinks to herself as she pushed Twilight away with a hoof, and take one big last gulp, closing her mouth around her meals hooves, reducing Applebloom to a massive bulge in her throat, and soon, a small, wriggling bulge in her already massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna burps as she finishes her meal, before turning her attention to Twilight, who was sitting on the floor starting shocked at Luna\u2019s belly as it bulged and undulated with the pony inside. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cMy dear, Twilight! What has gotten into you?\u201d</span> Luna scowls at the stunned unicorn. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cDon\u2019t you know how rude it is to interrupt a princess while she\u2019s eating?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cY-you...\u201d</span> Twilight said, recoiling back across the wooden floor, shock and awe on her face. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cYou <i>swallowed</i> somepony...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWhy, yes, we \u2018gobbled her up\u2019, as you townsponies seem to put it,\u201d</span> Luna explains, as if nothing was wrong. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cShe didn\u2019t bestow her princess a satisfactory offering. Is this not part of Ponyville tradition?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna didn\u2019t get a response right away, but something about the look on Twilight's face told her all she needed to know-- Luna had made a terrible, terrible mistake.</span></div></div>",

So, all the princesses <i>did</i> used to eat ponies? Well, uh\u2026 that does explain a lot,\u201d</span> Twilight said, considering the idea. Twilight had asked Celestia about those scrolls before, but Celestia always seemed to suddenly get dismissive and cryptic, refusing to give a straight answer. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t matter now. All that matters it getting her out of there. How much time do we have?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cTheoretically, if we keep using anti-digestion spells, she can live safely in my belly for years,\u201d</span> Luna responds, pondering this question. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cBut while we\u2019re under the effects of the spell, I can\u2019t extract nutrients from any of the food I eat, so we can\u2019t keep that up forever. I\u2019d starve! So we\u2019d say thou has about\u2026 a week to come up with something.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cAlright. That should be more then enough time,\u201d</span> Twilight said, turning her attention back to her spell books, searching resolutely for a solution to this whole mess. Meanwhile, Luna puts on the stethoscope and presses it against her belly, which was already so big that the filly hardly even left a bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cArt thou alright in there?\u201d</span> Luna speaks loudly so that the filly could hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cPrincess? Yes, I\u2019m alright. Just trying to get comfortable,\u201d</span> the muffled voice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cSo.. thou aren\u2019t angry, or scared?\u201d</span> Luna asks, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOf course not. Just a few months ago, this whole town got torn apart by these bug creatures that multiplied and ate everything. And the month before that, it got attacked by a 50-foot tall bear! So I\u2019m pretty used to weird things happening around here,\u201d</span> Applebloom responded. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cBesides, it\u2019s surprisingly roomy in here. And there\u2019s candy everywhere, too!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWell, it\u2019s quite a relief to hear that you\u2019re comfortable, at least,\u201d</span> Luna smiled, charmed by the filly\u2019s enthusiasm. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cDon\u2019t you worry. We\u2019ll have you out and about again before you know it!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna set the stethoscope on the ground, and laid leaned against a bookshelf, rubbing her distended belly, staring up at the night sky through a window. It was almost half an hour before Twilight spoke again. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cI\u2019ve got it! I found something!\u201d</span> Twilight announced, and Luna hurried over to her, looking down at one of the spell books she had laid open on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWhat is it? What kind of spell did you find?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cIt\u2019s a spell that can be fine-tuned to teleport a very specific object to a very specific coordinate, without the user needing to see the object directly,\u201d</span> Twilight explained, gesturing to the particular page in her spell book. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cIt should get Applebloom out of your belly safely\u2026 however, it is difficult to cast. It requires me to draw runes with very particular and complex configurations. It should take a day or two to prepare. I\u2019ll get to work on it right away.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cGood work, Twilight. Thank you for everything,\u201d</span> Luna says, and starts walking towards the stairway to the basement. However, Twilight stops her with a hoof before she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cAnd hey. Don\u2019t tear yourself up over this too much, okay? You didn\u2019t know things were different now. Somepony probably should\u2019ve filled you in before you had to make public appearances,\u201d</span> Twilight reassured her, and Luna smiled.<span class=\"cnavy\"> \u201cThank you, Twilight. It is very comforting to hear that,\u201d</span> Luna responds, before trotting down the basement stairs, and laid down on the small, rickety bed in the guest bedroom. She was originally planning to stay up tonight, but after that exhausting meal, she was beat. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s much she could do at this point. All she could do was gently rub her engorged belly as she drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Unlike mortal ponies, alicorns have less of an urgent requirement for basic needs such as food and sleep. However, getting a good night\u2019s rest was still deeply satisfying. Luna could tell from the lack of movement that Applebloom was still asleep, and so she moved slowly and gently, careful not to wake up the filly resting inside her belly. She crept up the the dark stairwell, lighting the path with a simple illumination spell, to see Twilight Sparkle in the living room still working diligently on the spell she was crafting. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cGood morning, Twilight,\u201d</span> Luna greeted cheerfully, only to receive no response. Twilight looked absolutely exhausted, slumped over her tomes as if she could barely stand. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cDid thou get any sleep last night?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cUh\u2026 no, not at all. I was working on\u2026 the spell,\u201d</span> Twilight shook her head weakly, and Luna could hear the exhaustion in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThine work will be sloppy and poorly thought-out if one is exhausted, Twilight,\u201d</span> Luna warns, seeing how messy the rune was inscribing had already become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 fine. Don\u2019t worry about me. I just need to\u2026 get this done...\u201d</span> Twilight yawned, dismissively. Luna rolled her eyes. Celestia had warned her that Twilight could be unreasonably stubborn if she feels something is important. Luna decides to grab Twilight with her powerful magical telekinesis, lifting the mare in the air and carrying her up the stairs towards her bedroom. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cWhat? Hey! Let me go!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThou mortal ponies need your rest,\u201d</span> Luna insists, sternly. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWe shall take care of things in the meantime. There is no need to worry.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cLuna, I\u2019m\u2026 fine. I don\u2019t need\u2026 any...\u201d</span> Twilight complained, before Luna dropped her onto her bed. Twilight immediately stopped her bickering as she was struck by how comfortable her own bed was, and was immediately out like a light, finally getting some sleep after hours of exhaustion. Luna smirked at the sight of the unicorn mare curled up in the blankets before closing the door and trotting back down the stairs. She could tell that it was still early in the morning with a single glance out the window, and took a moment to admire the sunrise as she ponders what she would do today.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luna realized that she had gotten so caught up in the chaotic events of last night that she didn\u2019t get to explore the quaint little town of Ponyville as much as she had wanted to. Since it seemed like she was going to be spending a few more days in town, she might as well have a look around. She crept out the front door, and began wandering the village. The village was stunningly complex and beautiful, considering the fact that the last time she was around this region, this entire area was an untamed jungle. As she walked, she began to feel Applebloom tapping against the sides of her stomach, trying to get her attention. It seems her belly swaying as she walked roused the filly from her sleep. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cHold on, Applebloom. Let us try something,\u201d</span> Luna says, deciding to make conversation a little bit more convenient. She sat down in a back alley, out of sight of passersby, and her horn lit up as she strained herself to perform a powerful spell. She successfully forged what is called a \u2018telepathic link\u2019 with Applebloom, so that they could communicate directly into each other\u2019s minds without having to speak out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cApplebloom? Can you hear me?\u201d</span> Luna tested this new link, speaking to the filly telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cUhh\u2026 loud and clear,\u201d</span> Applebloom responded, sounding a bit confused. Her words were beamed directly to Luna\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cFantastic! Oh, and, good morning,\u201d</span> Luna responded cheerfully, and continued on her way. Luna\u2019s belly was already so large that Applebloom hardly even made a bulge, and now that they could communicate with each other telepathically, it would be almost impossible for an outside observer to tell that the princess held an entire pony within her stomach. Now that nightmare night was over, the ponies of ponyville seemed much more excited than scared to see the princess of the night. The townsponies smiled and waved as she walked by, and she waved back, almost giddy with excitement. After all that struggle and isolation, the felt that the ponies had finally accepted her. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cNow, what does thou need, dear?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI\u2019m hungry\u2026 could you grab something to eat?\u201d</span> Applebloom asked with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cDid thou already eat <i>all</i> that candy?\u201d</span> Luna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cUm\u2026 yes,\u201d</span> Applebloom admitted with an (invisible) shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWell, then! We shall visit a local diner,\u201d</span> Luna agrees, admittedly excited at the idea of another meal. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cAfter our exile, we are not familiar with modern earth pony cuisine.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna continues to wander Ponyville aimlessly, occasionally asking the townsponies about the best diners in town. Applebloom relaxes as the princess walks, her belly swaying back and forth like a hammock. While it was a bit gross in the alicorn\u2019s stomach, Applebloom had to admit, it was probably the most comfortable and relaxed she\u2019s ever been. She could probably stand staying in here for a few days. Eventually, the princess happens upon a quaint-looking shop, and licked her lips at the sight of the delicious pastries inside. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWill, err, \u2018Sugarcube Corner\u2019 be sufficient?\u201d</span> she asks telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cSugarcube Corner? Oh, yeah, that place is the best!\u201d</span> Applebloom cheers, immediately excited at the mention of the name. Luna walks through the front door, a few tiny bells wired to the door ringing as she enters. The bakery was almost completely empty, save for Mr. and Mrs. Cake, the couple who ran the shop. They looked shocked for a moment to see a royal walk into their humble diner unexpected, and immediately ducked behind the counter. Luna sits down at one of the many empty booths, and smirks a bit to herself as she hears the couple whisper excitedly to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cCode red! Code red! We\u2019ve got a princess!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWhat? A princess? What is a princess doing here unannounced?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s Luna, she\u2019s still in town!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cWhat do we do, what do we do?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cJust grab everything we have. We\u2019ll lay out a buffet. Quickly!\u201d</span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake emerged from behind the counter, smiling nervously, dragging some table cloth along behind her. With one fluid motion, she knocked everything off the table in front of Luna-- including a few glass vases, which shattered on the floor-- and draped the table cloth over it instead. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHello, your majesty! It is an honor to serve you,\u201d</span> Mrs. Cake bowed, trying her hardest to remain composed. Before Luna could respond, Mr. Cake emerged as well, struggling to balance half a dozen serving trays along his back, and another three stacked on his head. Before she could even tell them what she wanted, they begun laying down all the best dishes they had. A photogenic display of assorted cakes, pies, and pastries was soon laid on the table, so organized in their arrangement that, if she didn\u2019t know any better, it would seem like it was planned out hours in advance. Luna couldn\u2019t help but to be impressed by their handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">\u201cAll-you-can-eat, on the house! Only the best for our most valued customer,\u201d</span> Mr. Cakes announces, a similar nervous smile on his face, as if he expects the princess to lash out at him at any moment. Instead, Luna licks her lips, glancing over the vast table of pastries before her. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThese look perfect!\u201d</span> She complemented, before immediately chomping down, eager to devour the delicious pastries. The couple could only watch in shock and awe as the massive alicorn tore through the entire buffet in moments, downing entire cakes in one bite and dumping a tray\u2019s worth of cupcakes down her throat. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhoa, hey! Slow down!\u201d</span> Applebloom yelled, as the endless pastries Luna was wolfing down rapidly filled up the cramped space within her stomach. Luna\u2019s belly began to expand even more as she continued clearing the table, until the entire buffet had been decimated before the couple\u2019s eyes. Luna leans back in her seat with a decidedly inelegant burp, rubbing her belly contentedly, which now bulged three times its usual size. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cOh! Excuse us. Our compliments to the chef,\u201d</span> Luna smiles as she walks towards the door, tossing an entire sack full of bits over her shoulder as she left. The couple could only stand there, stunned, watching as she walks out of the bakery, their entire inventory resting in the alicorn\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna\u2019s now massive stomach swayed underneath her as she walked, and she seemed to struggle to even stand. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cUgh! Did you really have to eat so much?\u201d</span> Applebloom complained, as she was completely covered in more sweets than she could possibly eat in a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI apologize, it was indeed a\u2026 ugh\u2026 poor decision in retrospect. We just haven\u2019t had that many sweets in so, so long...\u201d</span> Luna groans, as her stomach gurgles as it bears the weight of the pastries within. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cDoes thou know of anywhere we can rest? Your princess needs to\u2026 lay down for a while...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom was growing increasingly frustrated with her situation, but decided there was no use fighting it now. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHmm...\u201d</span> Applebloom considered the question.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Applebloom gave Luna directions to a little tree house in an orchard on the far outskirts of town. It seemed perfect-- it was far out of the way, and no one would just stumble upon it through the complicated weave of apple trees that made up the orchard. It was just the right place to rest for a few hours without being bothered by any unexpected ponies. So imagine Luna's surprise when she climbed up to the tree house only to find there were already two foals sitting inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHey! I saw that! You're supposed to put the money back in the bank, not just give it to yourself!\u201d</span> The orange pegasus filly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNuh-uh! Bankers can take a 'bankers fee', sometimes! Rarity told me so!\u201d</span> The white unicorn filly insisted. The two foals were sitting around a board game in the middle of the room, arguing incessantly with each other. Luckily, they were facing away from the front door, so they haven't noticed Luna yet, giving her some time to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWho are the two foals sitting in the tree house?\u201d</span></i> Luna asked Applebloom telepathically, so she couldn't be overheard. <i><span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThou said there wouldn't be anypony here.\u201d</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOh, those are my friends.

They're cool, trust me.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna stood there pondering her next course of action, hesitant, before shrugging. <i>What's the worst that can happen</i>, she mused to herself. She decided to loudly stomp her hooves on the wooden floor in a way that sounded like somepony was walking up the stairs, to get the foals' attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHey, Applebloom! Where have you be-\u201d</span> the orange one started without looking, before both foals turned and gasped upon seeing the royal princess of the night standing in their tree house unannounced. The white one immediately bowed respectfully, and the orange one gave her a strange look. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUh, what are you doing?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i><span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhat do you mean, what am I doing?

Right, right!\u201d</span> The orange filly responded, before quickly giving a sloppy excuse for a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna couldn't help but giggle, before waving a hoof.<span class=\"cnavy\"> \u201cYou may stand,\u201d</span> she smiled, and the foals stood, looking up at her in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cIt is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, your highness! I am your humble subject, Sweetie Belle.\u201d</span> The white one announced, before nudging the orange pegasus in the side and whispering, <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i><span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNow introduce yourself... and make it fancy!\u201d</span></i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cOkay.

Sweetie Belle facehoofed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWell, we appreciate thine hospitality, but thou will find there will be no dungeon-sending anymore,\u201d</span> Luna reassured the foals. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThose days are over. Thou may treat us as thine equal, now.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHey, see? We didn't even have to worry!\u201d</span> Scootaloo smirked at Sweetie Belle, who in response only glared in exasperation. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cSo what brings a princess to our little treehouse? I'm pretty sure you already have a cutie mark.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cActually, Applebloom sent us,\u201d</span> Luna said, sitting down next to them. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cI assume you are her friends?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYup!\u201d</span> Scootaloo nodded. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cSo you know where she is?

Luna gestured towards her belly, which bulged three times its usual size. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cHere, listen.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cUh... okay,\u201d</span> Scootaloo raised a brow, confused but not wanting to question the demand of a royal princess. She put the stethoscope on and pressed it against Luna's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cScootaloo! Scootaloo! Hey! I'm in here!\u201d</span> Applebloom yelled. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cApplebloom?\u201d</span> Scootaloo gasped. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAre you... in her stomach?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYeah, but I'm okay! It's actually not that bad in here.

I don't freak out over anything!\u201d</span> Scootaloo scoffed, posturing. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cBut, uh... this is a bit much.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cHey! What? What do you hear?\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle stepped forward, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cApplebloom's in, uh, there,\u201d</span> Scootaloo shrugged, poking Luna's bulging gut. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cBut she's alright though. It's safe in there, I guess.\u201d </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhat? Luna... gobbled her up?\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle gasped. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThat's... so <i>cool</i>! I thought all that was just a legend!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cIt <b>is</b> just a legend,\u201d</span> Luna spoke up. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cAfter all this is sorted out, we may never eat another pony again.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cAw...\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle sighed, looking a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna laid back on the hard wooden floor of the tree house as the foals went back to arguing. She was definitely way too old to keep up with the pace of their bickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI didn't figure you'd like gross stuff like this.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cIt's not gross!

Why?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cHaven't you read the Sweet Tooth comic books?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWell, I don't really read that many books...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cIt's about this pony who's special talent is her ability to eat anything... including bullies! Nopony messes with her!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI don't know, sounds kind of dumb.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhat!?

Unfortunately, the foals appeared to play very fast and loose with the rules of every board game they played, and Luna struggled to keep up. She didn\u2019t know how they could possibly be having fun with this.  They made up new rules every minute and then arguing over whether those new rules were valid by some arbitrary criteria, and before long Luna was started to feel a little dizzy. It didn\u2019t help that hunger was slowly pooling up in her gut. It was a cruel irony-- her stomach was stuffed to the brim, and yet she couldn\u2019t digest any of it, so she felt like she was starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhy\u2019s your stomach being so noisy?

She seemed unusually interested in the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cWe do not know yet. Twilight is working on a ritual that should be able to rescue her,\u201d</span> Luna explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cOkay...\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle said thoughtfully, staring at the Princess's unnaturally distended belly, before sheepishly asking, <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSo\u2026 would you mind if I\u2026 felt it?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cDo as you wish,\u201d</span> Luna shrugged. Sweetie Belle cautiously kneaded and rubbed the massive alicorn\u2019s equally massive gut, hesitantly at first but more eagerly over time. Luna found the belly rub to be immensely relaxing. She hadn\u2019t felt like this for centuries now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cYou said Twilight cast a spell so that it\u2019s safe in there\u2026 right?\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle asked, eagerly. Luna didn\u2019t like where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cUh\u2026 yes, little one. Why dost thou ask?\u201d</span> Luna responded, hesitantly. Suddenly, Sweetie Belle threw herself on the ground in front of the princess, bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cTwilight will never cast this spell again, probably, so this is my only chance to, uh\u2026 I want to see what it\u2019s like inside somepony\u2019s belly!\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle begged. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cPlease, princess! It can\u2019t harm anything, right?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cYou <i>want</i> us to\u2026 eat you?\u201d</span> Luna said, a bit shocked, so quietly that the foals almost couldn\u2019t hear her. The foal wouldn\u2019t be harmed, of course, but she had promised to never eat another pony ever again! What would Twilight think? On the other hoof, Luna did feel like she was practically starving. One more snack couldn\u2019t hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you!?\u201d</span> Scootaloo said, trying to snap the other foal out of it. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYou don\u2019t just ask somepony something like that! Why would you want to get eaten, anyway?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cThis is our only chance to try! Maybe I\u2019ll get my cutie mark, after all? If I don\u2019t try now, I\u2019ll never know!\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle explained, enthusiastically. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cBesides\u2026 I\u2019ve always been a little curious...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cUgh! What\u2019s going on now?\u201d</span> Applebloom groaned, hearing the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cYour unicorn friend said that she would like to join you,\u201d</span> Luna said telepathically to Applebloom, as the pegasus and unicorn argued incessantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cReally? She wants you to\u2026 huh. Well, she does talk about this kind of thing a whole lot,\u201d</span> Applebloom said, thinking. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cIt would be nice to have some company in here, I guess. I\u2019ve been soooo bored.\u201d</span> Ugh! Luna had hoped Applebloom would talk her out of it, but she just endorsed the idea. She tried to find some other excuse, but the idea just seemed more tempting every minute. Back in the old times of the kingdom, many ponies would come to her begging to be swallowed, and she would fulfill their requests. Every good princess needs to make sure her subjects are happy, right? Surely, Twilight would understand...</span></div></div>",

It was probably best that she stay inside for now, until this whole mess had been sorted out. If she went wandering around outside, somepony might notice her bulging belly and realize the truth, and she couldn\u2019t imagine the chaos that would ensue if everypony reacted like Twilight did at first. Besides, she kind of just wanted to relax today. As she was laying there pondering this, she felt Applebloom tap against the walls of her stomach from the inside, as if trying to get her attention. Luna giggled, as she pressed the stethoscope against her belly to address the foal. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cGood morning, Applebloom,\u201d</span> Luna smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cGood morning, princess...\u201d</span> Applebloom says, before letting out a cute yawn as she stretches slightly in the cramped interior. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cSo, uh\u2026 did you and Twilight find a way to get me out of here yet?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cYes, Twilight has been working on a spell,\u201d</span> Luna nods. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThou should be out within a day or two.

We always wondered what the appeal was.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cReally? Heh...\u201d</span> Applebloom chuckled, sounding drowsy. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWait.. was this a long time ago? If you swallowed them before you knew this spell you\u2019re working on, how did they get out? What happened to \u2018em?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cOh\u2026 um...\u201d</span> Luna stutters, realizing that she\u2019s said too much, and is probably digging herself into an even deeper hole. Before she could make up an answer, though, there was a knock on the door, interrupting their little conversation. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cOh! There is somepony at the door! Hold on,\u201d</span> Luna said, putting the stethoscope away, and trotting down the stairwell. She pulled open the heavy wooden door to see a orange Earth pony standing before her, wearing a cowboy hat for whatever reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pony seemed to a little shocked to have a princess answer the door, but composed herself quickly, immediately bowing before the alicorn. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cOh, my! Pleased to meet you, princess!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cOh please, the pleasure is all ours,\u201d</span> Luna waves a hoof, giving the pony permission to stand. <span class=\"cnavy\">\u201cThou must be one of Twilight\u2019s friends, correct?

I was just wondering-- has my little sis been by here? A little yellow filly with a big red bow?

Her belly grumbled anxiously as Luna pondered which meathod would be best for filling her cavernous gut. After a few minutes of thought she feared her dinner would escape, and decided to be direct in dealing with rhem, she'd go about it as always. With a swift movement she landed before the two mares, spreading her wings in a display of dominance before calling out to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEHOLD, CITIZENS OF EQUESTRIA! GAZE UPON OUR VISAGE AND DO NOT FEAR!\" despite her order the two ponies backpedaled slightly, adjusting her voice she spoke again \"Dear subjects, we appologize for frightening thee, twas not our intent, we would like to appologize\" with this she bowed her head slightly hiding her smirk and extended her hoof. The frightened pair stared at the symbol of royalty bowing before them. Lyra was the first to step forward and accept her hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it Princess Luna.\" Luna raised her head with a wide smile on her face. Luna slowly enveloped the teal unicorn's body in a telepathic field and gazed at her intently.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"We are sorry about this...\" Luna opened her mouth wide as she raised her meal up to her face. Lyra was confused, a question forming on her lips as she was forced inside the hot maw of the princess. Luna teased the unicorn's face with her tongue as she magically slide her further back into the cave that was her mouth. Out of the corner of her eye she noticed her meal's companion turning to run, she magically grabbed the other pony's hooves and hung her in the air as one would hang meat. As she felt Lyra's nose press against her throat she gave a powerful gulp and began her meal's descent into her gurgling stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the point Luna decided to get more comfortable, she sat on the ground and spread her legs to make room for her soon to be distended gut. As she swallowed Lyra's horn she winced in pain slightly as the sharp apendage pushed against her throat's soft flesh, inspiring her to swallow quicker. An outline of Lyra's face could be seen in the Princess' tight throat, this caused Bon Bon to scream in terror, only to have her mouth magically held shut. Luna giggled as she swallowed again, releasing the telepathic grip on each part of the unicorn she swallowed allowing her to struggle and squirm. with a few short gulps she had swallowed up half of Lyra's body, and a slight bulge had formed in her once petit stomach. she held her head up high and released the grip on the unicorn, allowing gravity to aid in her swallowing. Faint screams could be heard from inside her stomach as her meal struggled to get free. A powerful gulp sent every part but the unicorn's back hooves down into the lunar princess' belly, she smile as her front hooves caressed the squirming bulge that was her gut. She swallowed down the rest of her meal's legs and slurped up the rest of Lyra's tail, and with a swallow sealed her meal's fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, its been a while since we have had a meal as delicious as you!\" she belched loudly and gave her squirming belly a pat \"or as filling...

Luckily, the ponies in Ponyville welcomed her and even gave her a flower necklace. Luna, who still looked ashamed, was surprised by the kindness she was offered. Still, one thing remained. Celestia saw that Luna was still in her weakened state, barely any taller than a normal pony and without her celestial mane, she was also unusually quiet, considering that Luna used to be the loudest pony in Equestria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia hid her dismay at the implications, her sister would need more power to return to her old glory and there was only one way to do it. Her sister would need to devour her subjects. When an alicorn starts to lose power, only eating the flesh of other ponies can help them regain that power. Celestia had to eat half a town worth of ponies before reaching her current level of power. Unfortunately for Luna, her own pony binge was the one recorded in history. Celestia may have been able to get all history books mentioning the practice burned, that did not stop the rumors though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping the guise up, the princess of the sun celebrated the return of Luna with the other citizens of Ponyville until they returned late at night. Her little sister was pleasantly surprised to see that a nightlife developed in her absence, and that many ponies were still up after sundown. Celestia decided to let her sister spend the night with her since her old room needs to be renovated first, also she would have to talk to her. At first they laid there in silence, Luna already had in idea what her sister wants to tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna,\" She began. \"you know, if you ever want to be able to raise and lower the moon again you'll need to...\"</span></div></div>",

Twilight Sparkle gave her dragon comanion Spike a gentle pat on the head and made her way to her bedroom, the day was almost through, and she had a big day tomorrow.  She checked her nightly routene checklist (altered due to her trip planned for tomorrow) for instructions. She combed her mane exactly 100 times, brushed her teeth and checked the contents of her suitcase, aloud she listed its contents, \"Spare clothes, extra toothbrush, volumes 3-14 of 'Practical Powers and Sensible Spells' (reminder to rebuy the first two), Zecora's expandable stomach potion, notes from my lesson with Pinkie Pie, and some salt... I think I'm ready!\" Twilight jumped into bed and quivkly burried herself beneath the covers, but before retiring to slumber she grabbed the note on her bedside table and read it one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dearest Friend Twilight Sparkle,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been a while since we have last spoken, and I appreciate your writing to me through my sister, despite what your friends have learned about me the rest of Canterlot avoids me as if I were that terrible monster. Well that isn't entirely true, there has been a silly rumor with a lot of danger involved with it being believed by more and more ponies everyday. They believe if they consume me they'll obtain my power, and I've had a few attempts ony life because of this rumor, I've sustained enough bitemarks and seen down enough throats than I'd have liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to your invitation I would like to say yes, but if you and I were to have this 'sleep over' I would have ot be in the castle here in Canterlot instead. I will make the necessary preparations for you to visit in exactly one week, I look forward to seeing you once again my friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYours truly,<br>\r\nPrincess Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. I'm not sure if my sister has been intimate with a non-alicorn before, sorry :(<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.P.S. thank you for teaching me how to create faces with grammatical symbols, it is very fun indeed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the note ended. Since reading it Twilight had done research on the history of alicorns and what little was known about their body structure. she found their jaws had a hinge, a trait which all ponies had but few knew how to use, Pinkie Pie being the exception she knew of. Unbeknownst to her friends Twilight had always wished Celestia would take her not only as a student but also as a mate, but never dreamed of asking her, due to her massive lifespan she could never be with  non unicorn, but this was a way to fix that problem! Twilight planned to consume the Princess of the night whole and alive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dreampt of the possibilities of being intimate with the princess, how much more efficiently Equestria would run under her rule, and even more of how the Princess of the night would taste, she smacked her lips softly in her sleep as sje dreamed of it. She was arroused from sleep by her dragon companion late in the afternoon, with an hour left to catch her train, her estimated arrival would be right after the moon had been completely raised, freeing the Princess' time. Twilight quickly got up, brushed her hair so she looked nice and took off for the station slowly, clutching her precious luggage tight in her mouth. As she approached her friends who were waiting to see her off, Rarity being the first to approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now darling, it isn't everyday one is a Princess' guest, are you sure you don't want me to do your mane for you? I promise it aont take long, I just want you to dazzle them!\", she was shoved out of the way by a slightly annoyed Applejack, \"Dont worry your pretty little head about  the Princess, y'all got experience with royalty, just have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUN!? Without me!!\" Pinkie Pie chimed in with a slightly annoyed tone, \"How can anyone have fun at a party without Me! Twilight you gotta promise that I can come to the next one! Pinkie Promise!!\", Twilight gave her friend a solemn nod as they did the ritual together, and then gathered all her friends together for a large hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you girls in a few days, take care of Spike for me!\" she chuckled warmly and stepped on the train, placing her luggage beside her she pulled out her books and began the long trek to the metropolitan city of Canterlot. The scenery flew by her as she read fervently, thinking back to her preparations and the importance of this night. She thought about how she would keep Luna's mouth shut, one word from her and the guards would come running, she could always eat her headfirst, hard to scream when your head is jammed down a pony's throat, but then there was the issue of the horn getting in the way, either way she would work it out when she got their. That time was fast approaching however, as the sun began to set on Equestria and the moon was visible in the sky, Twilight wondered if raising the moon would become her responsibility after she took over Luna's roll, and she became quite saddened by the fact she wouldn't see her mentor on the trip, but when the sun rose her transformation would be complete and she would be together with Celestia, in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that thought the train came to a gentle stop at the Canterlot station, releasing her into the bustling Canterlot night life, the sound of music both light and heavy in style poured out under the stars, it was obvious some ponies prefered the night to day. Twilight looked up to the palace and scarcely made out the dark blue form of her meal to be. As she made her way to the palace she pulled out Zecora's potion (a potion, she might add, that required a LOT of conviencing to get) and downed it quickly, smacking her lips, it tasted bitter like unripe berries, she hoped the Princess would help her get the taste out of her mouth. The castle gates opened up wide and in the grand foyer stood Princess Luna in light blue Pajamas decorated with stars and planets, a wide smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND TWILIGHT SPARKLE!!\" Twilight shrunk at the use of her royal voice, as everypony nearby turned to view the spectacle of 'Princess Shut In' calling somepony her friend. \"WE WELCOME YOU AS OUR MOST HONORED GUEST TONIGHT ON THIS, THE MARKING OF THE FIRST OFFICIAL ROYAL SLUMBERPARTY\" Twilight covered her bright red cheeks and quickly went inside, following Luna as she literally bounced up the stairs to her room, this coupled with her space themed PJs gave her the appearence of a young filly, Twilight guessed thats what she was like when Rarity and Applejack stayed with her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luna opened the door to her royal chambers Twilight walked inside and saw the room was filled with...</span></div></div>",

Then the pillow came closer again and Twilight shut her eyes, anticipating the next blow, which never came. Slowly she opened her eyes again to see the pillow just floating in front of her and a smile on princess Luna's face. Slowly a grin formed on Twilights face as she took the pillow. \"Oh, it is on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some time, both mares just hit each other with the pillows until they got tired and decided to move to a less active game. Princess Luna had a wide assortment of board games in her collection, which they played one after another while eating their snacks. Still having her plan in mind, Twilight held back with those, also using little tricks to make it look like she ate more than she actually did, like forming a ball of chips that was actually hollow inside. After the games they also shared a few scary stories, which they were both really good at. They even called the stories off early, fearing that they won't be able to sleep if they continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they both were giving each other make overs and were now lying on the bed, facial mask on and cucumber slices on their eyes. After playing most of the night they were tired and called for some relaxation before bedtime. As they laid there Luna sighed and started to speak. \"Thank you for this fun slumber party Twilight, we really needed that.\" Then the princess smile faded. \"Since our return we have dealt with so many ponies trying to eat us in an attempt to gain our power. It feels good to just forget about them and relax for one night.\" A twinge of guilt spread through Twilight as the princess said that, considering what she wanted to do. \"You're welcome.\" She said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more silent moments, they decided to take of the facial masks and go to sleep. Twilight carefully observed the moon princess, looking for any signs of her sleeping. Then Luna's chest rose only slightly, indicating that she was now in slumber land. Still, after what Luna said, Twilight had doubts. She was one of the few friends princess Luna had, could she really betray her trust to become Celestias mate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Twilight almost sighed but held it back and instead slowly engulfed Luna's head with her lips. If she could get past the shoulders she would be safe, so she decided to quicken her pace. She almost reached the shoulders as Luna stirred again, waking up this time. \"Wh... what's happening?\" Twilight quickly pushed the princess shoulders in before the confusion could settle, locking her forelegs in place. Luna meanwhile realized what was happening. \"TWILIGHT SPARKLE, HOW COULD YOU? WE DEMAND THAT YOU LET US OUT IMMEDIATELY!\" She screamed in the royal Canterlot voice. Twilight was thankful for the noise cancelling bubble she cast as the loud voice rattled her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna did not get an answer, instead she only felt more gulps as more of her body disappeared past the unicorns lips. Fear spread through the princess mind and she spread her wings as far as she could to block her descend. \"Please, let me out.\" She begged, not as loud as she screamed before. Twilight only pushed at the wings with her hooves and a struggle began. Luna desperately tried to keep her wings spread as they were the only thing keeping her from being food right now, while she kicked her rear legs, trying to somehow push herself out again. \"GUARDS, HELP ME!\" She screamed again as her wings lost the battle and were pushed against her sides again, before Twilights lips engulfed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNopony came, so Twilight could continue without much difficulty, now that the princess only means to stop her descend had failed. Luna begged, screamed and wildly kicked with her rear legs as she was swallowed and pushed through the tight, fleshy tube. On Twilights neck, outline of Lunas head was clearly visible as she squirmed on her way down. Eventually, Twilight reached the princess flanks and the moon cutie mark disappeared past her lips and the princess rear legs stopped kicking as they were locked in place, Luna could do nothing anymore. Princess Luna reached Twilights stomach and started to curl up inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight slurped up the princess tail and gulped a few more times, sending the rest of the princess body down her throat and into her belly. After this large meal, it was difficult for Twilight to even stand and her belly hung down with the princess inside. The purple unicorn decided to heave herself onto the bed, where she laid on her side. It was eerily quiet, Luna has stopped screaming. Only one muffled word reached Twilight ears. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gave her distended gut a sad look. \"I am really sorry but... if I get together with Celestia, she would outlive me and would be in grief. I just love her so much, I am sorry.\" Twilight explained to Luna. Inside of her, the princess of the night hung her head. Of course it was about Tia, as long as she was happy it didn't matter that Luna would die. They spent a few more moments in silence before a noise broke the silence.</span></div></div>",

I will do anything you want.\" She begged and gasped as she felt some sort of liquid drip on her, followed by an itching sensation. Luna continued to scream as the stomach acids started to cover her whole body. She could also feel movements as the stomach churned, rubbing the acids even deeper and softening the princess up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gritted her teeth as she heard the muffled screams, guilt surging through her body. The wild kicks started to really hurt her belly, so she hugged it tightly with her hooves to keep the princess still. \"Sssh, it will be over soon.\" She kept rubbing her belly and giving Luna soothing words to calm her down in her last moments. After a while, the screams stopped and Luna didn't move anymore. Twilight sighed in relief now that it was over but was saddened to know that Luna was no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the night, Twilight watched as her belly gradually shrank down again, absorbing the princess body as it was turned into sludge.

The guards sighed in relief, believing that their princess has regained her survival instinct. \"Oh wait, I forgot.\" Her horn glowed and her horseshoes, regalia and tiara came off. Then she gave her rear hooves back to Pinkie. \"Those could have given you indigestion, please continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards were slack jawed again as Pinkie now grabbed the princess hooves and put them into her mouth. Luna shuddered slightly as she felt the tongue brush against her fetlocks but the feeling was not unpleasant to her. Slowly her legs were pulled inside the pink pony, who throughoutly licked across the legs to make them slide in faster. Soon the reached the princess flanks. Luna blushed slightly, Pinkie Pies tongue was licking across her most private parts and even slipped between her buttcheeks and poked at her anus. Luna had to admit though, if the guards weren't present she'd probably invite Pinkie Pie to take her time at that particular area. The thought of this being her final moments also added a strange sense of eroticism to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was done with the flanks, her lips were now wandering up, brushing past the princess teats. Luna had to fight to keep her wings tucked in but managed to keep them at her side until she felt the soft, warm wetness around them. Soon her belly was inside of Pinkie throat and Luna took one last view of the world. The night sky, she could see through a window, was beautiful, she hoped that her sister or Pinkie would take good care of it. She could now see the inside of Pinkies mouth and two rows of teeth. Pinkie then  closed her mouth and everything went dark for the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie craned her head up and gave a few mighty gulps. The lower body of the princess was already sitting inside of her stomach and now the bulge that made up the rest travelled down into her waiting belly. Pinkie Pie sighed and let herself fall to her side as she felt Luna curling up inside of her. \"Thanks princess, you were great.\" Pinkie Pie burped and Luna has gotten into a comfortable position. \"You are welcome. Goodbye then, and please remember me well.\"</span></div></div>",

Feeling the princess of the moon squirm inside of her as she digested into nutrients for Pinkie can created quite the drowsy effect. The guards surrounding Luna had evidently disappeared for the night as Pinkie looked up at the gorgous sun.  Standing up on her hooves, she noticed that 3 feet had been added to her as well as several dozens of pounds on her frame. A hot pink horn portruded from her head as she unfolded her wings. \"Oh, Luna...I'll make you proud...I'll be the best party princess ever!\" Pinkie thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good. You're awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party pony turned to see Princess Celestia looking at her. Strangely, the sun goddess's appearance was not of anger or rage but of acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always knew that Luna was going to pass the mantle down to the next pony someday and it seems like she's done it. I guess I'll just have to raise the moon until you learn how to.\"  Celestia continued warmly as Pinkie tilted her head in confusion.<br>\r\n\"Pass the mantle?\"<br>\r\n\"...Well, you might as well know seeing that we're sisters now. The only way to create an Alicorn is by devouring another one. Why...I remember...it's very faint, but I remember at one time I was an Earth Pony. That was before I devoured Princess Solia and oh, how wonderful she tasted! When I awoke, I was in the form I am today. It took me a long time but I adjusted to it after a few months.\" Celestia paused here to smile at the memories as well at noticing that Pinkie was staring at her new wings and horn with wonder.<br>\r\n\"Speaking of adjusting, we're going to have to get you started right away on your new life as an alicorn, Pinkie.

Truth be told, the Sun Goddess couldn't blame her for being so excited. After all, how often was is that a pony converted into a goddess? Celestia dimly recalled that she had a similar reaction to learning what she had become. <br>\r\nPinkie Pie froze in the middle of a leap as she considered this.

The first lesson, is that you must only give your power to a pony pure of heart like yourself.  Never to one who wishes power for power's sake, or is cruel.  Luna accepted you because of who you were, and someday you will do the same.  Hopefully not for a very, very long time, but just the same.  Our abilities are too powerful, and our duties too important, to allow a pony with any darkness in her heart to ascend the throne of Equestria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good ponies, gotcha!  Oooh, can I put one of those disco strobe lights on the moon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia smiled serenely.  \"We can discuss that later.

Celestia turned away from Pinkie at the table, to see a Pinkie waiving and smiling behind her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"  Celestia turned back to the table... and Pinkie wasn't there.  \"Was that a teleport?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno!\"  Pinkie sat back down at the table.  \"So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My point is, Luna and I were in the custom of eating Breakfast and Dinner together, right after sunrise and right after moonrise.  For you, actually, my Breakfast will be your Dinner and vice versa, since you will be awake all night.  In public, you may enjoy polite amounts of sweets offered to you.  But in here, away from the eyes of other ponies, we eat as we must to keep up our powers.  I warn you, this may seem a bit... extreme, even for your appetite.  But then again, you ate a whole princess last night.\"   Celestia smiled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always been a good eater!\" Pinkie agreed.  \"Do you remember the Mmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" Celestia said, shaking her head.  \"A single gulp, as I recall.

Each bowed before the alicorn to whom their meal was presented, and departed the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then,\" Celestia said, as she raised the lids of both trays with her magic, \"let us dine, my new sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie licked her lips, and looked down at the meal she was presented with...</span></div></div>",

Luna's chest slipped out of Pinkie's throat completely soaked.  The saliva dripped sexually down where her boobs would have been if she was human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna wiggled her hips and hooves free of Pinkie's maw.  \"Thank you, Pinkie, I can get it from here.\"  Luna placed her hooves on Pinkie's face and pushed.  her legs slipped out of her throat one at a time.  Strings of saliva stuck to them as they left.  The sight of it put blushes on the guards' faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna stood at her full height.  \"Thank you, Pinkie Pie, this has been fun, but I'm afraid that I must retire now to bathe myself.  Guard, ready a bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome princess.  Let me know if you feel like doing it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, speaking of such\" the general explained \"I regret to inform you that the punishment for eating a princess is death by digestion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I gotta say it?  She let m-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that you enticed her into a state of vulnerability and exploited her emotions.  As I said, she is emotionally compromised (and insane)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, listen here,\" the princess exclaimed \"this is no just punishment for a valiant service and sacrifice.  (and I am not crazy!)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, your highness, but it is the law after all,\" the general said with steadfast charisma. \"(Shush, princess)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the law,\" the princess replied with the steely voice of a thousand rapiers.  \"(if you tell me shush one more.time...)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, guys?</span></div></div>",

The last thing I'd want is for my friends to be sad.  Gasp!  What if they're sad anyway because I'm not there!  What if the party isn't good without me?!  Who's gunna feed gum-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna opened out mouth and closed it down on Pinkie's head.  'geeze, better stop that before it starts!'  Luna gave mighty swallow, sucking Pinkie deeper into her throat. She raised her head and the tiny pony in her throat to the sky.  Only Pinkie's hind legs and hips stuck out of Luna's lips, kicking playfully (if there is such a thing).  Another swallow, and Pinkie's hips disappeared into Luna's lips and slipped into Luna's throat.  The cute bulge Pinkie made in Luna's long throat traveled down the length of it before disappearing into her chest and stretching her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final swallow, Pinkie's hooves slipped down into the depth, soon to join the rest of the Pink party pony.  Luna lay a hoof on her belly.  \"Rest well, Pinkie.  You might not get a better night's rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem\" the general butt in \"we haven't yet filled out the proper paper work for an execution.  Princess, you have just committed murder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck you general.\" the Luna ate the general.  To say that Pinkie had mercy on his body is to lie like a bloody pirate.</span></div></div>",

It gives me that kind of motherly pleasure that I really am providing nurture and love to the pony I am looking after. Back then, when you were on a sugar high, I realised that this is a great opportunity to experience this desire. It is essentially meeting two goals in one stroke: I get you to sleep, while I experience this desire. Unfortunately, at that point, it took me some convincing to get you, as a young filly, to calm down. But it is nonetheless a wonderful experience. So\u2026 about that question\u2026 I am willing to have that experience with you, but now as a grown up mare, do you wish to do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Twilight hears this reply, she finally understood Cadence\u2019s actions and the pleasures.

As she feels more of herself entering the Princess's body, she starts to feel an orgasm coming on. \"Ohh... Princess, take me in!\" she moaned as she feels her vaginal walls gather fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Cadence is slowly taking in more of the pony when she came to Twilight's hind quarters and legs.

She wanted so much to have a foal of her own, but Shining Armor was not free to give her one, and he even said he was not wanting to mate just yet, but Cadence had a strong urge to be a mother. Recently, she had heard of a new method some mothers were using on to help keep their children from aging to adulthood and leaving the house, for some did not want to leave their mothers. This in turn kept the mothers themselves young, yet only few knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a method known as unbirth. Though most stallions found it too odd for their tastes, mares found it to be a very interesting method. Most would only do so if the child agreed to want to do it, but some did it to pleasure themselves, which Cadence didn't smile upon, yet even some mares had not gotten the word yet, or had the same opinion as the stallions. Today, Cadence could take no more. She ordered meetings be withheld for a month, saying she needed an escape from the pressure of politics and was going to pay Ponyville or Canterlot a visit. Seeing as nothing major was happening the ponies agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence was now given a window of opportunity to find a pony willing to become her foal.

Twilight, instead of being scared of what had happened, actually enjoyed being inside her foalsitters womb.  Soon Cadence suggested that whenever it was just them, Cadence would let her spend time in her womb when she had to take a nap or they had to go out. usually when they went out, they assumed Cadence was pregnant, and they were right to a degree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight had also discovered while she was in Cadence's womb, an umbilical cord would gently attach to her and Cadence would be able to feed her through it plus, she didn't need to use the little fillies room. Cadence had to admit to herself that she was in a state of bliss when Twilight was in her womb and sometime wished she never had to let the little filly out, for she felt so maternal having to provide for another. One side effect they had been noticing though, was that Twilight had started to develop a loss of bladder control to an extent where she was wearing nappy's at night and during her naps and training pants in the day when she was up and about. Twilight tried to prove she didn't need them, but a few too many accidents proved otherwise. Cadence also noticed another side effect was that her teats were starting to grow with milk inside, and sometimes lactated, but everypony thought it was normal for a mare in her teens, but she thought it might be preparing her for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence had also developed a feeling of actually wanting Twilight to become her own actual foal, and to help her keep the feeling at a low level, she sometimes would play baby with Twilight and Twilight enjoyed it as much as she did, for she didn't say it out loud but she was starting to feel that Cadence was like a second mother to her. Also to help Cadence with her lactation, when they played baby, Cadence fed Twilight her milk and Twilight enjoyed the sweet taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was just another day together alone, and Cadence was preparing to have her and Twilight go out. \"Alritght Twilight, are you ready to go in my special room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhuh,\" Twilight nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, crawl on in sweetie,\" Cadence said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she rose her tail to expose the marehood to the little filly and Twilight soon began to crawl in.

It was time to pay Equestria a visit. Princess Celestia nervously paced in the castle throne room, awaiting her most faithful student and the other Element bearers. When she looked towards the door, a sense of relief washed over her as she saw Twilight Sparkle and her five friends come in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Princess, what's wrong?! Why were we called here? What-\" Twilight began.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm...regretful to say that...\" Celestia took a deep breath and levitated a large box over to her. \"HE has returned.\" She opened the trunk with a gasp, there were no Elements, merely thin air. Suddenly, Discord appeared, ready to play his game.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hello Celestia. A warm welcome to you, as well.\" Discord mockingly bowed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What are you doing here?!\" Celestia demanded.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I just came to see my...old friends. I've been awfully lonely. \" Discord remarked, dragging a claw across the underside of Twilight's chin, drawing blood. \"You know, being trapped in stone for THOUSANDS OF YEARS can do that to a pony.\" He began to stroke Twilight's mane. Twilight looked at her dear teacher with tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't touch her!\" Celestia venomously comanded. Discord's tongue snaked out from between his lips and lapped at Twilight's face.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And WHO, exactly is going to stop me?\" Discord asked. Celestia rose up in anger, her horn shooting a golden beam which he easily deflected, then covered his mouth to yawn. \"Bor-ing. It's time for my meal.\" Discord wrapped his slimy tongue around Twilight's muzzle, slowly drawing her into his gaping maw as she screamed. Twilight began to thrash and kick desperately as he made quick work of her, soon her entire head was down his throat. Celestia stared in horror as Discord held Twilight's struggling forelegs together, pushing her farther towards his stomach. Twilight's remaining five friends were holding each other and sobbing as they heard Twilight's cries from Discord's belly as his stomach acid began to dissolve her head. Only her lower torso, back legs, and tail were visible. Discord raised his paw and claw, forcing the purple pony's back hooves down his gullet with a sickening snap. He slurped up the last of Twilight's tail, swallowed, burped loudly, then began to pick pink and violet hairs from inside his mouth among the many weeping mares. He looked at the delicious sight before him, a once powerful adversary and the bearers of the Elements of Harmony staring at the writhing bulge in his gut. He smiled sadistically, getting to the point. \"Now then...WHO'S NEXT?!\"</span></div></div>",

She heard of some kinkier gryphons prefering to eat their meals that way but never tried it herself. She laid down on her back and guided the pink pony towards her anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie couldn't believe what was happening as her nose hit the opening of the gryphons ass. She tried to scream but before the could open her mouth she was shoved inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda gasped in pleasure as the ponys nose entered her anus. She stayed like that for a few minutes, just enjoying the sensation of the filly squirming inside of her butthole. Finally Gilda decided to wrap this up and pushed at the back of the pink pony's head and pushed the rest of the head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie tried to put her front hooves against Gildas legs to push herself out but the gryphon saw this and grabbed both of her hooves and held them against the ponys sides. With pull the shoulders went inside her ass and locked Pinkies front legs in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda decided to speed things up. She lifted herself up on her feline hind legs and carefully stepped over her victim, forcing it to sit on her haunches. Slowly she lowered herself down, pushing more and more of her prey up the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon could feel it as Pinkie squirmed around inside of her and enjoyed every second of it, wondering why she didn't always eat like this. Finally she was sitting on the ground with almost all of the pony taken by her ravenous hole. As she laid on the ground again only the hind hooves were still sticking out which Gilda delicately pushed inside. Completely exhausted the gryphon decided to take a nap herself while waiting until Stinkie Pie reached her stomach to be digested. Gilda fell asleep very quickly with Pinkies movements giving her an internal massage.</span></div></div>",

She pulled away suddenly, jerking away from the wall and falling backwards to end up lying on the ground, pulling Pinkie down by her neck too so that her head was just sat on the gryphon's lower belly.<br>\r\n\"You would not believe how BORED I was today!\" Gilda complained, \"I think you owe me a little fun to make for it, don't you?\"<br>\r\nPinkie's throat still being held in a vice-like grip, the party pony could not reply, only stare back fearfully while making the occasional squeak as she futilely tried to get back on all fours and pull away.<br>\r\n\"What's that? Yes?\" The bully said mockingly, \"I thought so. I'm still gonna eat you, but this way I'm gonna enjoy myself a lot more.\"<br>\r\nAs she started pushing Pinkie's head downwards, the pony's fear gave way to confusion. What did she mean by 'eating her a different way'? The way she was moving her head right now, she could almost mean she wanted Pinkie to eat her, but that was just silly! Gilda was way too much of a scary, meany-pants for this pony to want to do anything like that, and even if she was nicer, she'd still have to beWOAH!<br>\r\nThe pink mare's train of thought was suddenly and forcefully derailed as Gilda, still holding her head, yanked her forwards, burying her muzzle in the gryphon's snatch.<br>\r\nBoth girls gasped, one in shock, the other in pleasure and closed her eyes as the mare began to struggle properly to remove herself from the very private place she now found her snout lodged. Having pulled Pinkie upwards again, Gilda released her throat, but started pulling harder on the back of Pinkie's head, jamming it further and further into her increasingly wet pussy until with an odd 'SHLUCK' sound and a final terrified glance upwards, the earth pony's head was pulled completely into the enfolding heat of her vaginal canal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie had apparently just realised that she could speak again, and had started trying to scream for help to no avail, as her pleas were simply muffled by the encroaching, moist walls, and the vibrations did nothing other than stimulate Gilda further. Panting hard and drooling slightly from the waves of pleasure running through her, the predator leaned forwards to grab her prey's forelegs, which Pinkie was desperately using to push against her feline inner thighs to attempt to extricate herself. Holding them steady, Gilda forced Pinkie's forelegs back against her sides, and with nothing else holding the mare up, jammed her inwards. She could feel her pussy stretching out, driving her steadily towards a climax as she felt herself slowly giving way to the wriggling morsel that continued to seek escape and call for the help of her friends, even as her shoulders unrelentingly entered the pulsing maw and her face started to poke through the gryphon's cervix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce past the tricky bulges of Pinkie's shoulders, there was even less holding her back from plunging inwards, and quite suddenly she shot forwards. Fur rushed over sensitive walls, and Gilda arched her back, eyes snapping open and barely suppressing a scream as her orgasm hit her. She could feel her prey moving within her, struggling desperately as her withers and lower back slid easily into her, slowing only as her rump approached her dripping lips, creating a growing bulge in the gryphon's belly. Pinkie's head was completely held within the hot darkness of Gilda's womb now, and she'd managed to pull one of her legs through the cervix in order to push herself out. It was no use though, every time she pushed backwards, she would rub up against the inside of Gilda's cunt, stimulating it and causing it to contract down on her, pulling her in further and making it harder for her to breath. Neither of them questioned how the victim was still able to breath; Gilda was completely overrun by wave upon wave of pleasure, breathing heavily as she neared her second climax, and Pinkie was occupied now using both legs to push herself out, not realising that having removed them from the ring of the cervix, she was that much easier to pull inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSight had left Pinkie's world, but in the darkness she felt so hot and tight she thought she might melt! The salty tastes and smells of the gryphon's insides were overwhelming, and over the constant sounds of her captor's heartbeat she suddenly heard Gilda's snarky tones. Panting a little, Gilda had managed to regain some of her senses, and took a moment to admire her squirming, distended belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun in there?\" she breathily asked, mocking her unwilling occupant. The mare held tightly within her regained some of her lost vigour at that, putting up quite a fight and emitting muffled yells about how her friends would help her or some lame garbage like that. Gilda couldn't care less what she meant, and her eyes rolled back as she indulged in the responding wriggles of the trapped pony. She felt herself building up and up with the internal massage she was getting, and leaned forwards to grasp the pony's pink butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I am.\" She pulled. \"Oh, <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>YES!!</b></font>\" she screamed as her cunt briefly resisted the rump, then tilted her over the edge as it ran smoothly over it, feeling every sensual inch of the body entering her. Pinkie screamed with her, she only wanted to perhaps make a new friend, play some pranks, and now she was trapped with the boiling hot walls of another's womb bearing down on her, squeezing her so much that the grossly distended bulge of her captor's belly momentarily stood still, twitching only slightly as it tensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for air, Gilda lay on her back with only the party pony's legs below the hock protruding from her. She basked in the aftermath of her fierce second orgasm, and in the internal massage of Pinkie's movements. Her belly was making it harder to breath when she was on her back, so she rolled over onto her front, straining for a moment to stand on all fours, disorientating her passenger, now swinging beneath her effectively on her back now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo, that was good stuff right there. Just a little bit more...\" She exclaimed, back up to the wall as she finished speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, No, Please NO!\" At this last glimpse of a presence in the outside world, Pinkie screamed a final plea and made a last-ditch attempt to wriggle her way out, but due to her new position, she only succeeded in falling further inwards as Gilda pushed her rump against the side of the alleyway. Wedging the poor mare's legs against the solid surface, Gilda leisurely reveled in the sensations of her sliding the last of her prey into her pussy, letting out a groan of satisfaction as she felt the pink hooves move in, in, until with a soft \"thup\", she heard and felt her cervix close behind them as Pinkie was finally, irreversibly trapped within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the soft sobbing from deep within her, Gilda turned and sauntered out of the alleyway back into the streets of Ponyville, now thankfully abandoned to the quiet of the night. With her gut swaying ponderously beneath her, Gilda reflected on what she had just done. She had never experienced something that even came close to that before, it was something she resolved she'd have to try again at some point, just the odd dweeb here and there that nopony would miss. Looking down, her belly was truly massive; it nearly touched the ground! She'd certainly succeeded in getting that stupidly persistent pink pest out of the picture, now she just had to do something about the belly. Meh, she'd think about it in the morning, For now, she headed back to the inn she was staying at and settled down to rest, quickly lulled to sleep by the sense of fullness and occasional flash of bliss the came with Pinkie's sporadic bursts of activity. Her pink victim unfortunately did not share her untroubled mentality, and confined within hot, tight, moist prison she found herself in, she simply cried herself to sleep, wondering if her friends would ever find out the terrible fate that had befallen her.</span></div></div>",

She landed and perched upon the weather vain on the top of the roof, looking down at the town using it as a vantage point. She was unable to locate the annoying pink pony who had sullied her friendship with Dash, but she did spy two familiar faces. One belonged to a yellow pegasus she had a less than pleasant meeting with before, the rude mare had bumped into her carelessly without looking. Closely examining this pony, she saw that she was leaving the crowded town and heading into an isolated area of the forest, an easy target... At the same time however, from the building underneath her a stunning white pony with a purple mane and tail walked out, carrying some paper and an empty basket, she remembered this pony from the party! She hadn't done much to Gilda, but being one of the friends that turned Dash into the traitor she was today made her a prime target, as she walked into a large wound building she also made an isolated target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which prey would Gilda pursue first?</span></div></div>",

She took off from the roof and flew above the cloud layer, looking for the Pegasus' house, only to find that it was a cottage on the ground. What sort of freakish Pegasus lives on the ground? Watching carefully from the cloud cover the grounded Pegasus went inside her ramshackle cottage, and moments later a window was opened, freeing over a dozen birds into the sky. Fluttershy turned her back as she saw her feathered friends fly into the clouds, and just missed the Griffon stick her beak down and snap one up in a single bite. She swallowed hard and sent the tiny bird down her esophagus and into her stomach. She belched up some feathers and licked her beak, a perfect appetizer before the main course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda slowly began her descent into the cottage through the open window, landing nearly silently behind the yellow pony as she used her mouth to poor food into a small bowl. She snuck up behind her, crouching down into prime pouncing position, counting down in her head... 3.... 2... 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrrrrp\". The yellow pony jumped as the Griffon accidentally let out a slight belch, spraying feathers from her beak. She covered her mouth in embarrassment  and shame that she let her position be given away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing in here!? This is a... Private residence...\" Fluttershy trailed out as she saw the feathers float to the floor, recognizing them as the ones belonging to one of her pet birds. \"Did... Did you e-eat my...\" Fluttershy was met with another loud, wet belch from Gilda, as she cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I ate your stupid bird.\" She said nonchalantly, using a claw to simulate picking the teeth she didn't have. Fluttershy let out a soft meep and backed up against her door, her ears drooping out of fear as the much larger Griffon approached her. \"And as filling as it was, I'm still hungry, I think pony is on the menu for today, specifically little yellow shy ones.\" She pressed her claws against the frightened Pegasus, opening her beak and letting her prey see down to the inevitable destination, when a thought popped into her head, why was she limited to just using her throat as the gateway to her gut, why not use the back entrance as she had heard some members of her species  were fond of doing?</span></div></div>",

Its been a long time since I got to enjoy pony meat...\" Fluttershy let out a terrified whimper as the griffon opened her beak wide and took in her muzzle, rough feline tongue scraping along her nose. Gilda's mouth was a lot larger than it looked, she was able to fit Fluttershy's entire head inside, her tongue teasing and tasting her prey. Fluttershy finally began to start to struggle, her hooves pressing against Gilda's chest trying desperately to free herself, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Gilda forced herself to swallow, pulling the crying pegasus' head down her tight throat, She moaned and stroked the bulge in her throat as Fluttershy began her downward decent into Gilda's stomach. Forcing her wings against her body the Griffon was able to force the body of her pony meal deeper down her throat. With half the yellow pegasus sticking out of her mouth, Gilda raised her head to the sky and let gravity assist. Gulp after gulp she forced the squirming equine into her gullet, until the only thing left outside her furry stomach was the soft tail of the pony, which Gilda sucked down hungrily, and sealed the pegasus' fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her cramped stomach Fluttershy struggled meekly, begging in between sobs for release, her soft voice unable to pierce the thick flesh of the Griffon's belly. Her claws gently caressed the slightly wiggling bulge, \"Ahhh, delicious... Thanks a lot Butterfly or whatever, you made a great first meal.\" As her gut convulsed under her touch Gilda slowly drifted off to sleep, stomach gurgling loudly as she stroked it.</span></div></div>",

She let out a loud long belch, small strands of pink hair and yellow feathers coming out of her beak drenched in saliva and stomach juices.

Due to the fact that ponies are just part of a gryphons diet, only very few gryphons are ever allowed to visit Equestria but are also allowed to eat one pony each day under certain conditions. The two major conditions were that single parents or ponies under the age of eighteen were not on her menu, which was the reason nopony ever celebrated theirs in flight school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she arrived in Ponyville, ponies gasped and flew away from her, knowing that she could eat any of them on a whim.

Back in flight school she was the first and only pegasus to ever approach the gryphon and they became friends. This was also the reason why Gilda would never eat Rainbow Dash, she was the only pony that won't flee the second she saw the gryphon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she arrived at the cloud home that Rainbow Dash lived in. \"Hey Dash, I'm here.\" Called the gryphon out and seconds later a cyan head with a multicolored mane popped out of a window.

It was difficult for Rainbow Dash every time as Gilda's prey would always cry and beg Rainbow Dash to save them. \"By the way, can I come along? I've made a few friends here in Ponyville and I would really prefer if you didn't eat them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda nodded, it was hard enough to find a friend when all ponies are on your menu so she wouldn't want to have Rainbow Dash fall out with her. \"It's cool Dash, just point them out for me so I know not to eat them. But seriously, I'm starving.\" Normally any sensible pony would be running for the hills if they heard a gryphon say that but Rainbow Dash stayed calm. \"Alright then, let's go for a fly.\" Gilda agreed and they made their way into town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news about Gilda's arrival spread fast, Ponyvilles streets were sweeped empty. One condition for gryphons was that they could not break into a home, that's why ponies that lived in a town visited by a gryphon usually only went out if absolutely necessary. What most ponies didn't know is that gryphons were usually not as fast as a well trained pony, so staying indoors all day and getting chubby just made them an easier meal if they had to go out. At first their search seemed to be fruitless when Gilda spotted somepony on the ground.</span></div></div>",

She knew Ms. Cheerilee even though they weren't friends. Ms. Cheerilee was of age and did not have a foal, that means she was free game for Gilda. \"No Gilda, you can eat her.\" Rainbow Dash felt a little knot in her stomach. She knew that she practically condemned Ms. Cheerilee to die as gryphon food but she couldn't take it back now either as Gilda was flying directly towards Ms. Cheerilee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Cheerilee was in a hurry. Since she stayed behind in school today she only just heard about the gryphon moments ago. The teacher knew that the school was a public building and so it would not keep her safe, she had to hurry up and get home before she was found. In her hurry she did not notice a growing shadow underneath her until she felt a pressure and was knocked down. Ms. Cheerilee grunted and opened her eyes again, she gasped as she saw eagle claws next to her head, she was found by the gryphon. \"Hi there, lunch.\" As she heard those words, Ms. Cheerilee started to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash stayed in the air and watched the spectacle, Gilda lifted Ms. Cheerilee up to her mouth. The teacher was crying and begging, as she noticed Rainbow Dash she started to scream. \"Rainbow Dash! Please help me I don't want to end up in a gryphons stomach.\" Rainbow Dash could do nothing but look solemnly at her. \"Sorry Cheerilee, but you know the rules, she is perfectly in her right to do this and I can't help you.\" Ms. Cheerilee stared at the pegasus in disbelieve before her eyes were drawn back to the open back before her. A weak no was the only thing she managed to say before her muzzle disappeared inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetrayal and fear surged through the teachers mind as her chin touched the gryphons tongue. In all her life she would have never believed that this would be her end, eaten by a gryphon. Cheerilee knew about the laws and that there was nothing anypony could do, this only added to her feeling of total defeat as she slid down the gryphons throat. She desperately tried to kick but this only made her slide down even faster. Eventually, her rear hooves lost touch with the cool air and the beak clamped shut around them, completely sealing her fate. Cheerilee was then pushed through a tight ring and dropped down in some sort of chamber. Ms. Cheerilee cried to herself as she curled up, she knew enough about biology to know what happens next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Rainbow Dash watched as Gilda gobbled up Ms. Cheerilee. A strange feeling that she hasn't felt since her time with the junior speedsters welled up inside of her as she watched the bulge that Ms. Cheerilee made travel down Gilda's throat. As Gilda closed her beak and send the teacher into her belly with a few more gulps it started to dawn on Rainbow Dash what this strange feeling was. This strange feeling she got as she watched the swaying gut was, without a doubt.</span></div></div>",

She's going to... I shouldn't be...'</i> Unfortunately, thoughts of the deed only kindled her inner fire. Effortlessly, her friend had swooped down, overpowering and devouring an innocent pony. Cheerilee would be broken down, absorbed, and forgotten by the griffon before the day would end. And if she so desired, Gilda could have easily duped and eaten Dash instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow struggled to make sense of it. Was it Gilda's demonstration of strength and dominance? A thrill from the fact that by all rights, the pegasus herself should be on the menu? Is it time to finally fess up to her old friend? What's that yellow thing waving in front of her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-loooo! Ground control to Rainbow Dash!\" During her introspective moment, Rainbow almost didn't notice Gilda right in front of her, waving her claw at her face. \"You were out of it for quite a while there. Something up?\" With a sigh, Rainbow tried to clear her thoughts. <i>'Just tell her how you feel, ignore that belly of hers, and- oh Celestia I can see it wriggling still.'</i> She bit her lip as Gilda followed the mare's gaze down to her stuffed gut. The griffin's face soured, and Rainbow knew she had to do something before she was hit with an 'I see how it is' speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Rainbow Dash was a mare of action. Anything Gilda had to say was halted by a sudden hug. After a few moments in the embrace, Gilda slowly returned the favor, unsure about what was really going on in her friend's head. \"Listen, Gilda, there's something I gotta confess to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking the embrace, Rainbow began whispering something to Gilda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Seriously? You <i>like</i> this?\" The griffin gave the most incredulous look within recorded history as she grabbed at her still-jiggling stomach. Rainbow slowly and shamefully nodded. Gilda thought on this for a moment. \"All right.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gilda had been taken aback, to say the least. She might\u2019ve expected this from another griffon, but this was the furthest thing from the reaction she expected from a pony. After all, Gilda was currently in the process of digesting one of Rainbow Dash\u2019s own kind. How could Dash possibly be enjoying that? Gilda\u2019s first assumption was the pegasus must be lying for some reason. Perhaps Rainbow Dash was just trying to relate to her? After all, griffon culture and pony culture couldn\u2019t be further at odds. Perhaps Dash was just extending an olive branch? Then again, there was also the possibility that Dash had a more sinister purpose. Perhaps Dash was trying to mock her, passive-aggressively? Gilda had stared into her friend's eyes for a few seconds, trying to discern her motive, but the pegasus\u2019s expression revealed nothing. Sighing, Gilda had decided to take the direct route; lying on her back, presenting her distended belly into full view, and daring the pegasus to prove herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cW-what?\u201d</span> Rainbow Dash stuttered, though she could hardly speak through the lump in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou heard me. In Griffonstone, it\u2019s customary to offer belly rubs after a friend has a \u2018big meal\u2019,\u201d</span> Gilda explained smugly, wriggling her belly back and forth, taunting the flustered mare. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cSo if you\u2019re such a big fan, here\u2019s a prime opportunity. Start rubbin\u2019.\u201d</span> From the tone of her voice, it seemed like the pegasus wouldn\u2019t have a choice either way. Guided by the massive predator\u2019s demands, she slowly approached her friend\u2019s belly, which by itself was almost the size of her entire body. Her eyes scanned everywhere else they could; glancing over the griffon\u2019s powerful, muscular thighs, and staring briefly into her friend\u2019s proud, piercing eyes. The eyes of a predator. By the time she finally laid eyes on the griffon\u2019s belly, she was already light-headed with arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"clblue\">\u201cOh Celestia...\u201d</span></i> Rainbow Dash whispers to herself, wide-eyed. This was the first time she had gotten a really good, long look at the griffon\u2019s belly. It was almost as big as her entire body! It squeezed tightly over the mare inside, vaguely showing the form of the doomed earth pony. A shudder ran up Rainbow Dash\u2019s spine every time she saw the tight skin bulge or contract. She watched as, despite the mare\u2019s protests, the belly squeezed in tighter and tighter around her, trying to immobilize the squirming mare so she can be digested without resistance. She was sure the mare was screaming, but her screams were completely silenced by the thick belly walls. Rainbow Dash bit her lip. The Griffon\u2019s stomach was so\u2026 so powerful. It was just taking a full grown mare -- a living, thinking, feeling being -- and grinding her up like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the reality of the situation dawned on her, Rainbow Dash was filled with a primal fear. Almost every part of her psyche told her that this was dangerous, and that she should run away as fast she could. And somehow, her fear only made her more aroused. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI\u2019m waiting,\u201d</span> Gilda teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash\u2019s entire body shuddered as she laid her hooves on the griffon\u2019s humongous belly. It felt like sparks of lightning were going off inside her chest. It felt so... surreal. She hadn\u2019t felt anything like it. She locked her hind legs together, trying futilely to hide her arousal as she began softly kneading the thick, distended flesh. Her heart fluttered as she could feel the sleek body of the mare continuing to wriggle and squirm. She could imagine Cheerilee trapped in there, wriggling, struggling, begging for help. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHuh. You\u2019re\u2026 eager,\u201d</span> Gilda raised a brow, surprised by how excited Rainbow Dash seemed. Rainbow Dash\u2019s rubbing grew faster and faster, and in response, more and more gastric acid was kneaded onto Cheerilee\u2019s flesh. Rainbow Dash\u2019s heart sunk as she realized that, by offering a belly rub, she was directly speeding up Cheerilee\u2019s painful demise. Her hooves were shaking so much, it was hard to stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAaah...\u201d</span> Gilda sighed, enjoying the massage. She was used to getting belly rubs from griffons, who had sharp, jagged talons, so getting a massage from a pony\u2019s soft flat hooves was a nice change of pace. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou really were being honest, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</span> Though Gilda believed Rainbow Dash was being honest now, she still didn\u2019t understand the situation. How could a pony possibly be enjoying this? Being on the bottom of the food chain, weren\u2019t ponies instinctively wired to be terrified of this kind of thing? But when Gilda took a good look at how her friend was acting, and the look on Rainbow Dash\u2019s face, everything suddenly clicked into place. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHold on a second\u2026\u201d</span> Gilda says, filled with realization. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI get it now. You don\u2019t just <i>like</i> this. You\u2019re <i>getting off</i> on this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash\u2019s face was instantly flush with a bright shade of red. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cU-u-ummm...\u201d</span> She stuttered, trying to think of a response, but only making herself more obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHahaha! Oh Celestia, Rainbow Dash!\u201d</span> Gilda said through uproarious laughter, interrupting the massage. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou\u2019re one of those those predator fetishists, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cA what?\u201d</span> Rainbow Dash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda stood up and moved in close, leaning ominously over Rainbow Dash so closely that the mare could smell her meaty breath. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? Most ponies run the other way when they see predators coming, but you, well, you get aroused by the thought of being digested, don\u2019t you?\u201d</span> Many monsters swallow ponies whole. Hydras, manticores, quarray eels\u2026 the appetites of these creatures has been a constant threat to ponies for generations. Thus, all ponies are instinctively wired to fear being swallowed, above all else. However, back in Griffonstone, there were rumors of ponies who had that instinct reversed -- instead, they were aroused by the thought of being swallowed whole. Gilda always assumed the idea was just a joke, but apparently, Rainbow Dash had been one of those legendary fetishists the entire time. Come to think of it, that explains a lot. Gilda always assumed that Rainbow Dash was simply brave to have befriended her, but maybe the pegasus had been secretly wishing to be devoured...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash knew that she couldn\u2019t hide it anymore. She just had to let the truth come out, and let Gilda react however she was going to react. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</span> She admitted, squeezing her eyes shut, not wanting to see the expression on her childhood friend\u2019s face.</span></div></div>",

Trixie was right, if they had such a lengthy contest, she would get back the bones for a burial back at best, she needed something quicker. She then remembered her other big strength, beauty. \"Could you hold digestion off long enough for a beauty contest?\" She asked. \"Each of us gets ten minutes for preparation and after that, the ponies here will decide who is more beautiful, what do you say?\" Rarity hoped that Trixie agrees, that would pretty much guarantee her victory. Not only was she the mare that almost every stallion, and quite a few mares, swooned for and also they would hardly vote against her if it means she and Applejack end up as prey for this cannibalistic pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie thought about this, she could hold digestion off for a little longer. Inside of her, Applejack was waiting for the answer, holding her breath. If Trixie agrees, she could get out of here, if not it would be her end. Finally the magician answered. \"Fine, let the audience decide which one of us they like more. Go ahead and use the make up in my cart. Don't worry, the make up does not have any spells on them turning you hideous.\" She led Rarity to the back stage, where a table and a mirror stood ready. On the table were many different make up products. \"Thank you, I will need just a moment.\" Said Rarity, before entering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of waiting, in which Trixie showed a few more tricks to the audience, Rarity emerged. The make up job she used was subtle, yet her natural shine seemed to be vastly improved, her eyelashes appeared a little longer and her fur looked like silk. The audience gasped at the beauty and gave Rarity a heavy applause but Trixie still wasn't convinced. \"I admit, you do look very beautiful but we shall see if you are not merely a finer looking meal. Now it's my turn.\" With those words she disappeared behind the stage. Rarity was sure of her victory but the mare still shivered at the hungry look Trixie was giving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity waited for the magician to show up again, nervously waiting for the verdict. She looked at the crowd, where several ponies looked unsure. This made Rarity think, would they really vote for her, so she and AJ would be spared such a cruel fate or would they really vote Trixie the winner. Rarity gulped her fear down, as Trixie emerged yet again. \"And now I shall present you the Beautiful and Gorgeous TRIXIE!\" The crowd looked at the emerging magician...</span></div></div>",

Her silver mane had been groomed to perfection, with simple yet elegant swirls of light blue complementing the existing diamond like sheen of the magicians mane. The wavy style of her hair swished brilliantly as she swung her head up into the air to demonstrate the full range of it's beauty. Trixie's mane wasn't the only thing she had touched up on however, her eyes sparkled brightly like billions of flawless amethysts shimmering with the brilliance of Celestia's great sun. She had applied the perfect degree of eye gloss and her lowered eyelids demonstrated it to it's greatest potential giving her the eyelids the likeness of freshly polished robin's eggs. She smiled the subtlest of toothy grins that gave a delicious glimpse of what was looking to be Rarity's future. Each tooth was individually shined and polished to the likes of the refined pearls clung to by the largest of scallops.  Her entire face had been molded into a perfectly honed piece of modern artwork that sat high atop as the centerpiece of the stage. But unfortunately for Rarity, the rest of Trixie's body was just as incredible. Trixie's hooves were shined perfectly, her coat flowed with the likeness of royal cloth, her front legs were smooth yet muscular enough to be pronounced and her tail was on the same degree of perfection as Trixie's lustrous mane. But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was the hind quarters of the magician. Her stomach had shrunken just a tad, with Applejack still very much alive inside. But Trixie had digested just enough of the cowpony to draw some fat into her plot. As she showed of, Trixie shook her entire body around and eventually her hind legs were displayed for the crowd. Jaws hit the floor as her luscious behind shook for the on lookers. Nopony could look away, even if she only displayed for a few brief seconds. <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   The unicorn did one more twirl around and finished as she came back to face her awestruck crowd with one last sassy snap of her tail. She looked over and smirked at Rarity, who had been watching in something between absolute horror and tentative lust for the very desirable mare in front of her. Trixie chuckled and turned back to her hypnotized audience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well ponyvillians, which unicorn do you behold as the most beautiful creature in all the land? The GREAT and POWERFUL, TRIXIE! Or marshmallow pre-maredonna over here?\" There was hesitation in the audience, but the vote by a pointing of hooves clearly showed that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The unicorn hoped that the damage would not be too serious after AJ was let out again. Of course, the showmare would have to let the farmer out now that the audience voted... for... Rarity looked at the pointing hooves, staring in disbelief as they clearly pointed at the magician. It was clear that nopony voted her, despite the fact that her loss would mean she will be eaten. The fashionista felt betrayed, didn't these ponies knew what would happen now? Didn't they realize that they doomed her? Slowly, Rarity turned her head towards Trixie, who licked her lips and looked hungrily at the fashionista.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity gulped and backed away. Even though she lost the contest, there was no way she would just let this brutish cannibal gobble her up. She glared at the crowd down below. \"How could you do this? you all knew what was at stake.\" The approaching mare laughed at this. \"Well, of course they would have voted for you normally, so I would have to let my prey go but I cast an honesty spell on the crowd, so they could only answer truthfully.\" Rarity gasped as she took a closer look at the crowd. Now she could see that some of them seemed to try to point at her instead of Trixie but their arms merely shook. \"W-what guaranteed that you're not cheating? I demand a rematch, without spells.\" She begged, only to get another laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, I am clearly the prettier mare and they all agree. This spell is in fact the only way this could end fairly, with you joining your friend inside my gut.\" Rarity tried to back away further, as she collided with something. She looked back and saw a blue barrier, blocking the exit. She turned around and started to pound her fists on the barrier. \"Please! Somepony! Help me!\" She screamed as she tried to break through. Trixie has already approached her though and grabbed the other mares flanks. Rarity gasped as she felt her butt being licked and lifted off the ground, as her upper body fell down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white mares legs were pushed against her side, as her cutie mark disappeared past blue lips. Rarity frantically struggled to get out again but as she tried to push herself out, Trixie quickly shoved the mares front hooves inside. Now the white unicorn could only stare in horror, as she was slowly devoured alive. Due to the barrier around them, nopony else could do anything either. Soon the mares body was joining Applejack, who was horrified that her friend would share her fate, leaving Rarity one last look of the outside, past Trixies teeth. Then everything went dark, as the showmare closed her mouth. \"Was there ever any doubt? Now, the great and powerful Trixie is sated, I shall not accept any more challengers for today. Maybe tomorrow when it's time for breakfast.\" She said with a chuckle.</span></div></div>",

The first thing she saw was a jawdroppingly gorgeous blue unicorn in the mirror. She could have easily made her living as a model, but - she thought with a lick of her lips - where's the fun in that? The full-body mirror gave Trixie a good view of her catch today; her belly bulged out as it happily churned the two foolish mares inside. It made her meal all the more succulent knowing that, truth spell aside, she had <i>earned</i> this meal without resorting to cheats or deception. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magician took a seat in front of the mirror. Her engorged belly rested on the floor, forcing her hind legs to her sides. She admired the mare in the mirror, who looked like the very picture of happiness; A beautiful mare who had tackled the challenges before her, seized victory, and claimed her prize. The struggles of the two snacks in her belly were barely visible. That simply would not do! Seeing no need to hide the smirk on her face, she said with false annoyance, \"Ugh, Trixie demands you stop that struggling! You're making her sick!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer food fell for the ploy and redoubled their efforts, unwittingly providing Trixie with an incredible massage. The unicorn allowed her tongue to loll out as she felt her tummy wriggling in place. Unable to reach her loins, she did the next best thing and rubbed what little of her stomach that she could reach. The muffled pleas from inside her drove her wild with the sensation of complete power over those who challenged her and failed. Many ponies had been made meals before, but these two were bringing her complete bliss! </span></div></div>",

When she looked back, Twilight was giving her the most adorably pleading gaze she had seen since she ate that little yellow filly from that farm on the edge of town earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Trixie?

The stetson hat came of off her head and fell to the ground before her shoulders followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Applejack wanted to face her end with dignity but as she was clamped in the slimy throat this notion flew out of the window. She started to thrash around and beg for her life. Trixie only rolled her eyes and continued swallowing. Did this pony really think that Trixie would place the life of this peasant over her own desires? After a lot of thrashing and screaming from the orange earth pony she was finally fully swallowed. Trixie let out a small burp as she went over to her bed. A nice nap is exactly what she needed to digest her meal. Laying down on the soft mattress she gave her huge, squirming belly a rub and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately Applejack kicked against the fleshy walls but nothing she did had an effect on Trixie.

Applejack felt neither sad, angry or afraid she has long given up and waited for the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acids already reached up to her belly button and her more sensitive parts already felt like they're on fire. Thankfully, she already felt dizzy and knew she would not have to feel this pain much longer, her senses were already dulled. Finally she lost consciousness and sank down into the steadily growing pool of acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Trixie watched as her belly started to shrink down again as the earth pony was being digested. Trixie hoped that her meal would squirm more, but at least she was tasty. The taste was only part of the reason she did this though, Trixie throughoutly enjoyed the feeling of power she got from eating other ponies, from dominating them and hearing their begs and cries before they were sent down to her stomach where they are broken apart into nothing but a nutritious soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting for the rest of Applejack to digest, Trixie pondered her next step, maybe she should stay for a while, maybe her meal had some friends she could entice to take vengeance and ultimately join their friend in her belly fat.

Not only do they show no signs, but they will likely never even know there's anything wrong with them... Aside from the occasional odd fetish or an unusually strong stomach. However... a few of us, such as the Great and Powerful Trixie have Active NCD. At some point in their late childhood or young adulthood, they start to show certain... symptoms, and the pony will need to begin devouring others to live, if they go too long without feeding, the symptoms will return and their body will shut down.

That she announced it so readily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight faltered. It WAS odd. Why would she basically tell everypony that she planned on eating somepony?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple really. Trixie NEEDED them to know. She's been through this song and dance before you see. As long as the pony knows before time that stepping on stage could land them in Trixie's stomach, <i>she can't be legally held responsible for their death.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little legal formality to aid those with NCD.

We are built perfectly capable of swallowing others whole.\" Trixie pause and demonstrated, opening her mouth wide, an eerie sight. \"And our organs are different too. Normally they seem the same, all in the right positions and such... But if we're... feeding... our organs shift, making room for our soon to expand stomach.\" She paused and looks at her own stomach. \"Trixie is not certain how her skin is able to stretch so much and return to normal so quickly though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blinked. \"So... Applejack was ALIVE when you digested her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie sighed and rubbed her forehead. \"Yes. Trixie doesn't know whether she was conscious or not though. She did not struggle... Besides, given her abilities, Trixie could've done worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie's mouth isn't the only orifice that offers entry to her stomach. Your friends last moments could've been much more... personal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What other orifice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie didn't reply in words simply turning around to give Twilight a good look at her plot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you... can use...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie is quite capable of such feats yes.

How would you know if somepony was an inactive sufferer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie grins. \"Why are you thinking about getting one to eat you? It's difficult, but a few traits they tend to have are things like vorish fantasies, large appetites, an apparent inability to gain weight, and... strange tastes. Of course, if anypony directly related to them is an Active NCD sufferer that's a dead give away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighs. \"So, as far as I can tell, you just eat other ponies and are built in such a way that you HAVE to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.

Waiting in the confined living space was that pony, staring daggers at her. \"Shut the door. I don't want anyone hearing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie will do so once you have a seat.

All it takes is her say-so, and you could have an entire town-wide riot on your hooves! Plus she's proven to be a bit... unstable... when upset. Can't give you any real advice, she's just too unpredictable.\"<br>\r\n</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And then there's <i>her</i>.\" Rainbow finally pointed to the last pony, Twilight. Trixie considered saying that they've met already, but was curious as to what Rainbow had to say about her. \"Twilight. Freaking. Sparkle. You better get to kissing her flanks right away, because she can <i>end</i> you!\" Trixie began to regret her decision. \"The magic she has? Wicked powerful stuff. The only ponies I've seen do better are the Princesses!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hmph. She has to be exaggerating.\"</i>, Trixie thought to herself. <i>\"Ponies that specialize in general magic can only do so much...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which reminds me. Twilight has... connections. Powerful ones. Connections that can make sure <i>you</i>,\" she emphasized with a poke to the chest, \"never even existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding. Some small-town bookworm has government connections!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her brother's captain of the royal guard. The rest?\" Rainbow chuckled, \"More powerful than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if Trixie heard you right, then between these four ponies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're ten-thousand times screwed over. You really know how to pick 'em, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She was the one who challenged me!\"</i> ...Is what Trixie wanted to say. But her confidence was beginning to waver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here's the catch, the six of us? We were the ones who stopped that Summer Sun fiasco a while back. So once word of this spreads, you'll be dealing with Celestia and Luna too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie was about to call her out, only to realize that the ponies in the photo did seem to match the descriptions of the heroes she had heard a few months ago. The full weight of her deed began to set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So here's the deal,\" Rainbow said with a certain sting, \"You can let me be your shadow for a while. You will behave yourself around my friends, and in turn, I'll try to keep everyone from completely mauling you. <i>Also</i>, you'll be doing me favors until I feel you've made up for Applejack's death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you say no,\" she quickly added, \"Then I'll just tell the medical court a little story.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Twilight finished casting the spell, Applejack noticed her surroundings turning whiter and whiter, slowly illuminating the whole belly and showing her the surroundings she was immersed into for some time. The pool acids, the stomach walls, anything that was within the fleshy prison was revealed to Applejack. Before she realised it, she was engulfed by a bright white light as her surroundings bleached, as if she is being teleported to another location\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Twilight noticed that her spell was a success. Trixie\u2019s distended belly is slowly shrinking down to normal size without any noticeable effects, showing that at least Applejack is no longer under the threat of being digested in the \u2018Great and Powerful\u2019 pony\u2019s belly. While she was delighted on the success of the spell and a better chance of her friend surviving the ordeal, she understood that this is not the end, and that she has a lot of explaining to do\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Applejack readied her senses, she realised that the bright light has started fading away\u2026 and realised she still encountered the same darkness as before, with the wet walls and all. She is still in a pony\u2019s belly! Infuriated, she yelled, \u201c What in tarnations, Twi?! I thought you would get me out of here! Now I am... \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh\u2026.\u201d Twilight\u2019s voice appeared in Applejack\u2019s head. As AJ registered the voice, she felt a bit confused. Clearly, she did not hear anything besides the heartbeat in her surroundings and the gurgling of the belly she is trapped in now. So where could this voice come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took further voices to realised that Twilight is communicating with her through telepathy. After all, she is one of Ponyville\u2019s best magic practioners, so this spell should have been expected of her to use when vocal communication is not a feasible option, as shown when she nearly awakened Trixie just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAJ, I\u2019ll explain more about what I did later when the coast is clear\u2026 But I can tell you for certain that you are definitely not in Trixie\u2019s belly anymore. So please be at ease.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs AJ interpreted this message and felt around her surroundings, she knew Twilight is telling the truth. There is no pool of acids to be found, the walls are definitely more smooth, and she did even feel a tingle from the thin layer of acids on the wall. Also, her prison is more active in motion than the previous one, so she knew that this pony is awake and on the move. And since this cart is located in a relatively secluded area with few ponies in the area, with Twilight definitely in the area as the only pony, other than Trixie and herself, she then arrived to a weird conclusion: She is inside Twilight\u2019s belly. While she knew she is safe for as long as Trixie continues her slumber in Dream Land, the thought of her being inside the belly of a close friend was definitely something she did not consider before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh hope that the explanation is a good one.\u201d AJ lamented in a very soft tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Twilight saw the results of her spell. Her midsection is more distended and just trying to stand up became a bit of a task, which only eased after she applied a spell to lighten her belly load by shrinking AJ to the point whereby her belly is relatively normal in size. Nonetheless, she felt a lot of pleasure with AJ in her belly, as she felt a sense of enjoyment when AJ moved herself around to adjust to her new environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight also knew that in her current condition, she cannot hope to disable Trixie in any form, with the spell having sapped the energy out of her. So her only option now which will benefit her and AJ is to get out of the cart to a place of safety, where Trixie may not find them so easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight then decided to move out slowly, in the hope that Trixie will not awaken by any sounds\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As long as no loud sound is emitted closer to her, she can easily sleep for a long time without being stirred too much. Whether it is because she dreamed of being a 'Great and Powerful' pony, or because she spent a lot of energy for the consumption of Applejack, it is without doubt that when Twilight tried to leave, Trixie is not stirred at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Twilight made her way out of the carriage, she considered about where she will let AJ out. Clearly, as a common pony who has links to royalty, Twilight cannot just let AJ out in public as it will create a paparazzi which will harm Twilight's image to the point where it will take years of goodwill to clean up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight then decided on a location to let AJ out, preferably with a shower nearby as AJ needed to clean herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then narrowed down her options to three locations: Her private room in the library, Applejack's barn and Fluttershy's cottage. Clearly, Rainbow Dash's house is too far for Twilight to reach in the sky, while Rarity will certainly rant about the mess created by AJ as she is released from Twilight's belly.As for Pinkie Pie, wherever she lives, it is like a public space in its own right! Pinkie will hold parties almost every day if she is not attending to the SugarCube Corner business and other ponies will definitely be invited! At times, even she considers the SugarCube corner her home. It is simply too risky to try and get AJ out at that location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the barn, the library's private room and Fluttershy's cottage...Where would Twilight go?</span></div></div>",

Her room in the library and Fluttershy's cottage, both of which are near to where she is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the library is a public space, it is hardly crowded with ponies today, mainly because it is a normal working day for most ponies and hence, most ponies do not have the time to stay for long in the library.

Coupled with her shy nature, the location of the cottage makes it ideal for solitary living, and hence, a spot which is safe from prying eyes.

The purple mare had no practical experience but she read many books about biology. She first lapped at the already wet pussy lips before sticking her tongue inside. The happy moans of her eater encouraged her, told her that she was doing well. She kneaded Trixie's tits with her hooves to improve the experience for her mistress and moved her tongue towards the clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie's moans grew louder and louder, Twilight couldn't wait until Trixie came and would finally send her to her true destiny. Yes, she has realized her true purpose in life, to become food for the great and powerful Trixie. A wet sensation pulled her out of her thoughts, Trixie finally came with a loud scream of pleasure. The blue mare sat there, panting while Twilight dutifully licked her pussy clean. As she looked down Trixie saw the hopeful expression on Twilight's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done meat,\" She said with a smile. \"you have earned the privilege of becoming one with the great and powerful Trixie. But..\"</span></div></div>",

Twilight couldn't bear it any longer, she waited for an opportunity like this for years and now the pony that would eat her keeps laying it off. She gave the great and powerful Trixie a pleading, desperate look. \"Please mistress, I did everything you wanted, please eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie laughed at the pathetic unicorn in front of her, never has she experienced a meal so desperate before, at least not desperate to BE eaten. \"Don't worry meat, I am hungry myself but still, you don't believe I would put a sick freak like you into my mouth do you?\" Twilight didn't care that Trixie just insulted her like that, it was not like she was a pony anymore, now she was just a piece of meat waiting to be gobbled up. Still there was the question how Trixie was going to eat her if she didn't put her in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie saw the confusion in her meats face. \"There is still the back door you can use. The great and powerful Trixie has done this before so do not worry about her safety.\" With a sudden push she threw Twilight back and stood up. While the purple unicorn stood up again she turned around and presented her hungry rump. \"Do not leave us waiting, climb in so we can digest you in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight couldn't stop smiling. \"Oh thank you my great and powerful mistress, this is a dream come true!\" Eagerly but still with great care she put her front hooves into the blue magicians ass and was surprised how easily they slipped in. She continued to work and wriggle her way inside until her nose was right in front of the entrance. Twilight took the view in carefully, her front hooves were now completely inside of Trixie and the rest of her body would soon follow. The thought made her giddy, what would digestion feel like? Would she lose consciousness before it starts? Would it burn or would she go numb? Suddenly she felt a magical push on the back of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch, I told you to get inside, don't tell me you're getting cold hooves because there is no escape for you!\" Trixie has gotten impatient and was now using her magic to push Twilight in faster. Twilight's body was being turned and twisted as she moved through the intestines and it didn't take long before her belly, flanks and hind legs were pushed into the hungry buttocks. Trixie moaned in pleasure at the internal massage provided by her willing meal, she really needed to do this more often, in fact she might be able to taunt one of Twilight's friends into trying to get revenge for her. Trixie trotted back to her bed and laid on the side as Twilight finished her journey and was dropped into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie gave her belly a slap. \"Hey meat, are you still awake?\" She felt her meal wriggle inside of her and moaned at the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes mistress, thank you for doing this for me.\" Twilight was eagerly rolling around in the juices, a tingling sensation spread across her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are very welcome but there is one more thing I'd like you to do, as repayment for eating you I would like you to put on a little show for me.\"</span></div></div>",

A few ponies that hadn't been at her show gave her odd looks when she walked in. After acquiring herself a glass, she sat away from everypony else. She quietly sipped her drink. \"So... Rainbow Dash, while you're still conscious, Trixie has to ask... Why didn't you just give up?

Her digestive tract choooooooooorgle!ed in response, churning about Dash with a longing need to hang onto the pegasus within it. And not only that, but the pegasus had been so well behaved within her, far better than some of the ungrateful meals who had so irritatingly fought their chance to become a part of the Great and Powerful Trixie. \"Alright. But Trixie would like to discuss certain things with her food once it's ready to pass her lips again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie wondered if her passenger was what it was like to be... pregnant.

Why eve-huuurk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie clutched her stomach, feeling Dash headbutt her stomach sphincter once more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TRIXIE! Are you awake? C'mon, please don't fall asleep and digest me... p-p.... please...\" Dash sounded desperate within her, stirring up the need for her stomach to vacate itself, or calm it's occupant in the only way it knew. The pegasus was turning over and struggling to move within her as she grew desperate, visibly writhing beneath Trixie's skin as the unicorn calmed herself, and began a spell to reverse her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the lining of Trixie's stomach convulsed, and then pushed against Dash, mashing her face against that sphincter with a great deal of force. The used and abused pegasus found herself slowly sliming upwards through Trixie's esophagus, soon gasping as her face pushed out between Trixie's lips. And on the ground before the slowly heaving showmare laid a note, outlining Trixie's... unusual request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Dash, while you are being unengulped, The Great and Powerful Trixie has realized that she has a potential business opportunity to offer. If Miss Dash does not accept, she will be allowed to go to the tryout and attempt to become a Wonderbolt. When she succeeds, the previously agreed upon terms shall come back into effect, and one way or another the Great and Powerful Trixie shall make her a part of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, The Great and Powerful Trixie has discovered that Miss Dash's internment has stirred up maternal feelings within Trixie. If Dash accepts, the Great and Powerful Trixie will NOT digest her, but Miss Dash shall remain a part of her all the same. Trixie will allow Miss Dash to be a part of the Wonderbolts, but whenever Miss Dash is not on duty, she will report back to Trixie in order to fulfill her wishes. When Miss Dash reports back, she will be interred within The Great and Powerful Trixie's womb, and used as a pregnancy-feeling surrogate, and possibly a show prop to demonstrate Trixie's prowress. Miss Dash will remain in Trixie's care until such time as the Great and Powerful Trixie either releases her from bondage, or digests her at a later date. Trixie will allow Miss Dash to remain in contact with her friends to show her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Miss Dash accepts, all she must do is bite her tongue enough to draw blood, and press it to the bottom of this page, which has been enchanted with a magically binding contract against both parties.\"</span></div></div>",

Finally, she took a bite of her younger, not enough to bleed out, but enough to generate a weak flow, and smeared it onto the sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie blinked at this. Honestly, she hadn't expected her to accept the offer. But all the same she nodded before biting her own gouge and smearing her blood on the sheet as well. \"There.

And don't try the excuse that you forgot; the contract will make sure you remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash gulped nervously. \"Th-thank you ...

She sighed again. \"I really am going soft.\" She turned and walked back into her wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Trixie stood by her cart.

We may not be seeing them for a while, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash nodded, zooming off to the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sniffled a little as she turned the page of her book. Not that she actually cared about what she was reading. She had to get over the fact her friend had been eaten and that she would never see her again. The rest of the Mane 6 (or Mane 5 now) were there as well, all sleeping. They had all decided to sleep over to comfort one another. Twilight heard a knock on the door. She wiped the tears out of her eyes and walked over to the door and opened it ... And almost fainted when she saw Rainbow Dash. \"Rainbow Dash! You're OK!  But ... I watched Trixie eat you!\" At this point, the others were awake now and swarming around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash chuckled. \"Yeah, she did. But I convinced her to let me out ... There's kind of a catch, though ... I have to travel with her now ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's smile faded. \"You mean ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash nodded. \"I came to say goodbye, since I don't know when I'll see you guys again ... I hope it's not too long. Trixie did promise to allow me to visit you guys every now and then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy teared up. \"You're really going through with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash nodded. \"I don't have much of a choice. I signed a magic contract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven AJ sounded choked up as she spoke. \"Can't you just say no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity shook her head. \"Unfortunately not. A magic contract creates a magic link between the two signing it. She has to choice but to follow the terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash nodded, starting to tear up as well. \"I'm really sorry you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie burst out in her comical waterfall of tears, running up and hugging Dash tightly. \"We'll miss you, Dashie!\" The other 4 soon joined Pinkie in a group hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, Dash pulled away. \"I gotta go. Trixie's waiting on me.\" With that, she waved and walked away, knowing there is a chance his may be the last time she sees them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie looked up as Rainbow Dash returned. \"I'm ready to go now, Great &amp; Powerful Trixie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie smiled. \"Please ... Just call me Trixie. We don't have to be formal with each other.\" She opened the door to the wagon. \"Get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash nodded and got in, Trixie following behind. \"So, what happens now?\"</span></div></div>",

She spread so she could just fit the lips of her nether around Dash's muzzle. She began to attempt to suck her inside quickly ( to respect Dash's wish to \"get it over with\"). She soon had her whole head inside the tube to her womb. She sucked in more, pulling in her shoulders. As she got in her upper barrel, she finally ran into the biggest challenge: getting her past her cervix. She decided she had to make do with what she had. She positioned Dash's rear against the wall of the wagon and pushed with great for, forcing her face against the incredibly tight pucker. After 5 minutes of pushing, Trixie finally forced her head through, pushing her flanks into her own rear, her legs all that remained outside. She took a break to catch her breath, since the rest should be easy. She looked down at her belly, which already had a decently sized bulge in it. After a couple minutes, she stood up and, with one powerful contraction, sucked in Dash's legs and tail, panting in relief as she slowly felt her body work her into her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Dashie's end, the experience was none to pleasant. The tube was much tighter than the throat and there was a point where Trixie was trying to force her head through a really tight part that Dash thought was a dead end at first. Eventually, though, the rainbow mare settled in the unicorn's womb. It was a little more spacious than her stomach, oddly, and actually much softer. She relaxed inside of what would become her new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie smiled as she felt Dash relax in her uterus. She gave her belly a complementary par before walking over to the navigation wheel the drove the wagon. As she started it, she chuckled to herself. \"Trixie, you big old softy.\" She chuckled and began humming a song as the wagon began to move. She turned the wheel with one hoof, dedicating the other to rubbing her Dash filled belly. And that's what she did the whole trip as the wagon passed the limits of Ponyville and began moving towards its next destination.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been 5 years Rainbow Dash had left Ponyville. By this time, the duo of The Great &amp; Powerful Trixie, the greatest unicorn alive, and Rainbow Dash, daring captain of the Wonderbolts, was known all over Equestria. Every pegasi and unicorn wanted to be exactly like them. The duo was especially famous for their grand show stopper, which Trixie had appropriately named \"The Great &amp; Powerful Devour\". So it was a big deal when the small town of Ponyville heard the sound of Trixie's wagon approaching the town. Snips and Snails, who were fully grown stallions now, both made sure that everypony knew about their impending arrival, though really they didn't need to do much reminding, since a town getting a visit from Trixie and Dash was like your boring human town being visited by the Shriner's Circus. Soon enough, the wagon arrived in town, settling in the town square. The wagon was bigger than since it had last been in Ponyville of course; Trixie had gotten the money to replace it a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Trixie turned off the engine and sat down on her bed. Like most of the ponies, Trixie's physical appearance had changed too. Her hair was still the brilliant silver color it was last time, but it was longer now, extending almost to the ground when she stood. Her costume had also received the addition of a baggy button up and a vest, like the ones worn in Victorian England. She patted her belly; she still always kept Dash in her womb during the trips to new towns. \"Rainbow Dash. We've stopped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Rainbow Dash woke up and yawned. She'd changed physically as well. He hair was longer and even messier than it had been 5 years ago, but the colors in her mane were still as vivid as one would remember, since Trixie's assistant could afford good hair products. Her build was also ever so slightly bulkier, due to the demanding physical ability of a Wonderbolt. She stirred in the womb, which Dash had grown used to and actually liked being in now. \"Oh? Where are we now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie chuckled. \"Somewhere we haven't been in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash thought for a second. \"Hmm ... Manehattan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie giggled a little and patted her belly. \"No silly. Your hometown, Ponyville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash's face. \"Ponyville! Aww man, it's been ages since I've been here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie smiled. \"Five years, I think it's been. If memory serves, your friends are still well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash nodded. \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie patted her belly. \"Well, my show doesn't start until tomorrow. I suppose I can let you out so you can go visit your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rainbow mare beamed. \"Really!? Oh thank you, Trixie!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magician smiled before laying back in the bed, laying on her back. She began pushing Dash towards the birth canal. The two had done this so often that she had no difficulty pushing her out or pulling her in now. Withing a minute (two tops), Trixie forced the mare out of her nether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash got off the bed and shook off the vaginal fluids. \"Thanks, Trixie! I'll be back later so we can rehearse.\" She grabbed her Wonderbolts jacket that she wore when she was off duty and opened the door to the wagon running outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie chuckled as she watched her assistant run off. \"Still as soft as you were then, Trixie.\"</span></div></div>",

They said I-... that I was too desperate of a flier, that I took too many risks.\" Dash tumbled into the ground as she landed, tumbling to rest against Trixie's form. The prismatic pegasus's wild mane raggedly spread around her head and her breathing came shallowly as Dash blankly gazed up into the skies that had so betrayed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie found herself surprisingly taken aback. Dash was a showmare just as she was, after a fashion. More than once Trixie had failed as well, but always in the small stuff, not the big shot dreams that had led her to this point. She couldn't even imagine what was going through Dash's head right about-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just eat me and digest me and get it over with. I'm a screwup failure...\" Dash leaned up, trying to push her hoof into Trixie's maw. The showmare spat it out immediately, unwilling to just let Dash renege on her deal like that. She had bound herself, so by Celestia she was going to get use out of Dash one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Miss Dash. Trixie will not digest her. And she will not swallow you into her loins just yet. Go to your unicorn friend, the purple one. Trixie will meet you there. Gather your friends so you can say goodbye to them. Our next stop is Canterlot.\" Trixie patted Dash on the head as she spoke, straightening out the pegasus's mane with her hoof. Buck it, Dash was going to be her partner in showbusiness. The least she could do was show her good side to counteract the whole 'We got into business together because you ATE ME' problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash looked up at Trixie, tears glistening in her eyes as she slowly got to her hooves. Why was she making herself so hard to hate? Trixie wasn't being nice, but she was going seemingly way out of her normal habits trying to play neutral as far as Dash could tell. \"Could you take my house to Fluttershy? It's in my will that she gets it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. Go to your friends. Explain Trixie, and then we'll see about making you into a proper toy for Trixie.\" The showmare pointed towards town, putting her hoof down on the matter.<br>\r\nDash nodded, glumly taking off and heading for town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sniffled as she looked over her letter, still trying to figure out how to explain to Princess Celestia that she had allowed Dash to be eaten and had done nothing. There was still hope for the pegasus, of course. the princess didn't like it getting out, but she too could devour ponies whole, and had on several occasions, even in front of Twilight.  But she had far more power than Trixie, and the ability to recreate the bodies of those whom she felt deserved a longer life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's magic crumpled up her letter, fusing it's edges so it became a solid lump of paper in the grip of her magic. Why couldn't she write a bucking letter without sounding like she wanted to clop off to Rainbow Dash's death!?! it was bad enough that she HAD clopped off to it, and was still leaking from down below onto her stool! She had sent Spike to stay with Sweetie Belle because she couldn't help herself! The abused ball of paper shot towards the window, Twilight uncaring of what it might hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuill clattered to the desk as Twilight's heart stopped for the familiar voice. Trembling, she turned to the window, seeing a red and teary-eyed Rainbow Dash, her fur bleached from acid and raggedy. The mare stiffly eased out of a cloud she had been hiding within, stepping from it into the window of the library tree that her friend called home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Celestia... RAINBOW DASH!\" Twilight pounced tearfully, slamming the itching, aching pegasus to the floor with all her might as she kissed and nuzzled and hugged as much as she could. \"Oh Dash... I- I thought we lost you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did, Twi.\" Dash squirmed as she felt a dripping sensation on her belly, knowing it's identity from the feel alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no... Please tell me you're not back from Tartarus just to say goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie... kind of spared my life. But, i have to explain once everypony gets-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, the doorbell rang loudly and Pinkie Pie knocked up a storm. Dash looked downstairs sadly, her ears wilting as she thought of having to explain her humiliating new life to them. \"Trixie is getting Fluttershy. But we should explain to everypony else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain what, sugarcube? And gosh-golly am Ah glad to see you.\" Applejack stood on the steps, having let herself and the other two in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... Trixie's slave now.  To spare my life, she wants me inside of her... womb, staying there. Apparently I feel a lot like a pregnancy, and she wants to experience that.  It was either that, or let you guys down by being digested.\" Dash struggled to get up as her friends came over with tears in their eyes at the revelation of Dash's new fate.  Well, all except for Twilight.<br>\r\nDash gasped, looking down at the puddle spreading over her soft and lithe belly from Twilight's own nethers. Looking into Twilight's eyes showed the lusty need in the unicorn's face as she came just from the thought. Twilight's breath hitched and whistled through her lips in little gasps of pleasure as she slowly came down from her high, slumping onto the now soaked Dash as she trilled almost inaudibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twi, sugarcube? Yer scaring me. Ya can't possibly be turned on by-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight swallowed back her self-revulsion, fighting back the fantasies of disappearing into Celestia's vulva that danced in her head. \"Kind of...\" The unicorn blushed at her words, laying down atop Dash. \"Princess Celestia can do the same thing as Trixie.  Better, even. And she can bring back her meals. Unbirthing, what Trixie is going to do to Dash, is pretty safe. But, I think I could beat her to the punch, and free you from whatever compulsion she has you under, Dash.  But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gulped, as Dash filled in the blanks for herself. \"But in order to do it, you'd have to copy magic from Princess Celestia and... digest me. And hopefully I'll come back from it.\" Twilight nodded, giving Dash the choice even as she whimpered in place at the thought.</span></div></div>",

She then paid the horrified looking barkeeper before starting to leave. Rainbow Dash was left heartbroken in her stomach. The pegasus started to sob inside, sad about her impending death and that she never made it to the Wonderbolts. Worst of all, it was her own fault for agreeing to this competition. Slowly the pegasus ran out of air and lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash hasn't given an answer yet. Trixie began walking back to her cart, listening for any sign that her meal might still be conscious. \"Rainbow Dash, if you are still awake you better tell me now because I will start digesting you.\" She waited a little longer for any sort of movement or sound. As none came she concluded that it was now time. Trixie reached her cart and went inside, where she laid down on her bed, rubbing her distended belly. Now that Rainbow Dash has passed out, she could digest her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcids started to fill the fleshy chamber, coating the unconscious pegasus inside. Loud gurgles accompanied this process as her stomach started to churn the meal inside of it. All of her hair fell off and the feathers on her wings started to dissolve until the pegasus skin laid bare. The most sensitive parts of her body, the eyes, nose, mouth, anus and pussy were already red and puffy from the aggressive juices and soon her skin started to redden too. If she was still awake she would be in pain like never before, it was fortunate for her that she has already passed out and doesn't have to feel herself getting broken down into nutrients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie saw her stomach shrink as the pegasus inside started to melt into a sludge. Digesting her flesh would be easy, but to turn the bones into jelly she would need all night. After the gurgling got a little quiter she closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep. The pegasus inside of her was no more.</span></div></div>",

She's never done it on a full stomach before.\" Trixie patted her overstuffed paunch, listening to Dash's protests as she did. As the word spread, more and more ponies looked on at her with hurt and scorn, their gazes fixed on what would likely be the tomb of one of the town heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Dash blinked back tears from the burning and itching that still tingled at her feathers and fur. Trixie had stopped her acid production again, but the mucous inside her was still slowly bleaching the helpless pegasus's fur as it tried to attack her. The sloshing from Trixie's would-be sexy sway was making her queasy and the ever-tightening stomach had long since restricted Dash from movement and all but the shallowest of breathing. The gulps of fresh air that Trixie swallowed down to her and her own tolerance for thin air were the only reasons she was still even awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie... if you're gonna go to a club... go to 'The Scratch'. If this is gonna be my final dance, I'd prefer it if it was at a place cool enough for me.\" Dash panted, holding her eyes closed still as she squeezed out her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie thought she told her food that she would accept no demands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah! It's not a demand. Please, it's the best nightclub in town. I just want the last thing I experience before I die to be that funky bass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swaying of the stomach stopped, as Trixie pondered Rainbow Dash's words.  Good enough for her. Saying nothing, she continued on, seeing the club in question down the street. She could practically feel the beat from a block or two away! She sloshed her stomach, enjoying the slow rounding out as it adjusted for it's delicious prey. She almost wished she could have tasted that stupid mare twice. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her, Dash felt herself going ever so slightly strange, bending to fit the walls of the stomach instead of being able to push against it. Probably some stupid spell Trixie cast on her to make her go down easier. Her heart raced as she imagined her end, not too far away.  It couldn't be too long before she became pegasus slush, to be wasted on Trixie's frame. Her world suddenly began vibrating as Trixie entered the club, shaken by the massive sounddeck that the club owner maintained. Faintly, Dash could feel other ponies brushing against her fleshy tomb, getting pushed aside by Trixie as the big mare moved out to the center of the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd... where were the funky moves? Where was the jolt of the hoof-toss, or the dance buck? Oh, hay, Trixie was slow-dancing in The Scratch! Oh hay... Oh HAY NO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie, is that the best you can do with dancing? C'mon, I lead you here, thinking you were going to scramble me like an egg with your moves, and here you are slow dancing!\" Rainbow Dash feebly kicked at the side of Trixie's stomach, barely able to make a dent as something continued to happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the food making demands again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time you're damn right I am! Throw your hooves out, buck that plot! Shake your tail in the air like  you just don't care! You don't slow dance here! C'mon!\" Dash raised her voice, feeling it hoarse in her throat as she tried to pry open some space in the stomach, feeling her head being mushed down into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, does the food have some dance moves to demonstrate? Oh, wait. It can't, because it's in Trixie's stomach getting ready to digest VERY shortly.\"Trixie shook herself violently, letting Dash feel her irritation. Trixie didn't care about the nearly murderous looks that she was getting from all sides. The ponies on the dance floor knew that Trixie had made a meal of their favorite VIP barfly, and if she even thought about finishing Dash off onstage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash writhed as the burning increased for a moment, the acid rubbing into her fur as she desperately sought to find wherever it was coming from and plug the flow. \"No! NO! Listen to me, please! I want to talk you through my dance routine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie concentrated, using a spell to deconcentrate the acidity  of her stomach once more. Patting her obscene bulge with a hoof, she audibly hummed, as if making up her mind whether to digest or listen. She watched Dash squirm uncomfortably once more, her ample flank rippling as Dash moved within her. \"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time flat, Trixie had a good space cleared around her, as she danced about her massive, pegasus-filled belly, boogying down to the beat as Dash had explained to her. Trixie bounced her belly against the floor, feeling the softening pegasus within her getting pressed between a flank and a hard place as she did. \"Trixie must compliment her food, it has shown her some very useful moves. Why, Trixie is almost tempted to spare her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlowers increased from a slow burn to fury once more at the mention that Rainbow Dash would soon be fat and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost? What would it take to convince you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beg, food. Beg. Trixie knows of the legendary pegasus pride, of their unwillingness to bend to any master. Beg Trixie to become your master in body and flesh, and she shall spare her Food to become her Toy, and will use her food in her act and life, for her pleasure and profit.\" Trixie smugly listened to the sudden silence and stillness within her stomach as Dash fought to contain whatever instinct she might have. It was so wonderfully humiliating. For the pegasus in her, that is.   To betray her race, to surrender to Trixie and forfeit her rights as a citizen of Equestria to become a toy? Mmmm.  Trixie just loved the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if she didn't, well, there was always plan B. \"Of course, if Food would rather remain silent, Trixie knows more than a few spells to extract all the potential from her Food, and to steal her Food's soul, thoughts, and powers.  Trixie wonders what new title she would have to come up with in order to deal with her new wings.  Stupendeous Trixie? Unstoppable Trixie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter. Resist your fate, and become Trixie's servant. Or give in, and become just parts of Trixie, a wellspring of knowledge for her to become even more Great and Powerful, trapped behind her eyes by arcane arts that not even the Princesses know. Either works for Trixie.\"</span></div></div>",

She quickly cast it hoping it would protect Trixie. \"...What was that?\" came Trixie's voice from inside of Twilight.

They will create a let's call it a 'dummy body' for the prey and transfer the preys mind into it. In the dummy body you only feel a slight tingle during digestion and your mind automatically goes back to the real body as soon as the dummy's life functions cease. Everything here is perfectly legal of course so don't worry about getting thrown into the dungeon, in fact let me tell you a secret, princess Luna herself owns every single vorno this studio has ever produced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie gasped, one of the princesses a voreraphile?

Maybe she secretly liked it but didn't realize it until now. It didn't matter, the slaves hind legs were now gone and now her lower body followed. Trixie could feel something wet along the way, this mare must be as turned on by this as she was. It became a little painful as the slaves belly started to disappear as well but the pleasure also grew. Soon she was up to her neck inside of Trixie's rump.

Trixie found the entire scene very bizzare, here she was digesting a mare while a team of ponies stood around her, filming the entire thing and watching it on the monitor. The director signalled for everypony to be quiet, the only sounds that could be heard were the churning of Trixie's stomach and the cries of the digesting mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie admitted that she felt a little uneasy as she saw the pink skin of her prey slowly turn red as the skin started to dissolve but still: her body was doing this, Trixie had the power to turn a whole pony into nothing but mush. She could feel a tinge of arousal as she watched the digestion scene until her prey gave her stomach wall one overdramatized push before sinking into the acids for good. After leaving the endoscope in for one more minute the crew removed the pipe from Trixie's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And cut, thank you Trixie this was an amazing shot, you can use the bedroom down the hallway to sleep this meal off.\" Said the director as the crew started to leave the set. Trixie took his advice and went down the hallway. The beds looked luxurious, as if the princess herself ordered them. Trixie heaved her heavy gut onto the bed and pondered her day while she laid there. Today she has eaten another mare, whole and alive, and those ponies filmed the whole thing and right now she was sleeping said mare off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the whole situation still seemed more than just strange to her, Trixie had to admit that it actually felt really good. Could she perhaps seek a more, permanent career in this business? These thoughts slowly drifted away as the blue unicorn drifted to sleep. Tomorrow would be her next day as a vorno star.</span></div></div>",

Regularly they would send Spike to a sleepover with the cutie mark crusaders so they could watch a vorno together. Tonight it was Pinkie Pie's turn to bring the movie and everypony was excited for the movie she would bring. Pinkie Pie always brings the more interesting ones. Said mare held the DVD case behind her back and had a huge grin on her face. \"Girls, you're never gonna believe this.\" Without giving anypony a chance to take a look at the case she inserted the DVD into the player and sat down next to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey have already prepared quiet a lot of tissues for this evening and Fluttershy already had a wingboner. As the movie started though, their expressions changed from lewd anticipation to slack.jawed surprise. \"IS THAT TRIXIE?!\" Yelled Twilight while pointing at the screen that showed said showmare, sitting on a throne. They couldn't believe that the bragging magician they met some time ago would ever be a star in a vore porn. Applejack first wanted to take a sip from the cider she brought to calm herself down but she immediately spat it out as another familiar face appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that the pony you worked for when you couldn't win the rodeo?\" Asked Rainbow Dash her choking friend. Normally they would start clopping by now but this time only Pinkie Pie masturbated to the pre-vore sex. \"What's wrong girls? This one is super hot so why don't you enjoy yourself?\" It was only too normal for Pinkie to disregard the fact that they all knew the ponies that participated in this film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the others watched they grew more and more aroused after the initial shock died down. Seeing Trixie dominate and humiliate Cherry Jubilee like this triggered a deep lust within all mares and they started to clop off as well. As Cherry's hind legs disappeared into Trixie's anus, Twilight was already close to coming, as the digestion scene played out she couldn't hold back her screams of pleasure anymore. Her friends were also close to their own climaxes, all of them were surprised how well Trixie's arrogance worked with a vorno. This scene was different from others they saw, Trixie was not just playing, she was living her role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them have already climaxed as Cherry sank into the stomach acids and started to clean themselves up, panting heavily. Suddenly one of them spoke up.</span></div></div>",

I'm sure Twilight knows the right spell so the acids won't hurt or kill us so where's the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way Pinkie's plan was sound, but the others weren't sure if they liked the implications. All of them were terribly annoyed by Trixie's attitude when she first showed up, it sounded kinda wrong to submit to her and become vore slaves to her after that. \"Come on girls, or else I'm going to do it by myself and you'll miss out on all the vory fun.\" Said Pinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be a big decision, all mares looked very uncomfortable as they tried to choose between their pride and their lust.

Pinkie Pie meanwhile was happy that at least one of her friends would join in, they're going to have so much fun inside of Trixie's tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up came Rarity, said mare twiddled nervously with her hooves. \"I do have to admit, seeing that video made me feel exquisitely aroused. If she can act like that I am willing to at least give her a try.\" Said Rarity, trying to sound dignified. At least as dignified as you could agree to become a vore slave to an arrogant magician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack and Rainbow Dash just looked at each other. It was like neither of them wanted to admit it before the other and so they just looked at the box, that showed Trixie, with longing in their eyes. \"Fine,\" They said in unison. \"we're coming too.\" It was hard for both to swallow their pride like that but remembering the scene they both were sure that this just might be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one in the room was Fluttershy. The pegasus mare scrapped her hooves across the ground nervously. After a minute of awkward silence she started to whisper. \"I want her to dominate me like she did with Cherry.\" She flinched as the others gasped in surprise. \"It's just... you know that I have a very submissive personality, it's actually... my fetish. I want to be dominated, I want to be treated like a worthless slave.\" She admitted, almost crying near the end as she finally got her deepest secret off of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity went over to her friend and put a hoof over her shoulder. \"Darling, don't be nervous. We all share our vore fetish and we won't think less of you for having another fetish.\" Then she suddenly pulled Fluttershy tighter. \"If you want to I can fulfill your dreams tonight and give you a taste of being a worthless slave.\" Fluttershy became beet red and tried to stutter some kind of answer as she heard this.</span></div></div>",

A strange feeling of excitement spread through them as they went off to give up their freedom in the name of lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie meanwhile was enjoying the studio spa. All actors had an extensive wellness program to look forward to in between movies. Trixie really started to enjoy working for the vorno industry. After the huge success of her first vorno they planned an entire series of \"Empress Trixie: The hungry ruler.\" and she could live out all of her dominant fantasies. Yes, life was good and. Suddenly she felt a shadow  cast upon her as she sat in the hot tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is...\" Trixie wanted to ask first but she was too shocked as she saw the familiar face of a particular purple unicorn. \"Uhm, hi Trixie.\" Greeted Twilight, all of her friends behind her. Trixie panicked, why was SHE here? DId she know what this was? Before Trixie could vocalize any of theses questions Twilight continued. \"Me and my friends saw your video.\" At this point Trixie wanted to drown herself in the hot tub, off all the ponies in Equestria THEY had to watch her participate in a vore porno. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is it to you? Maybe I did it because I enjoy it.\" Trixie tried to be tough but her voice was already cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want to become your vore harem.\" Blurted Pinkie Pie out. Trixie was stunned as she heard this, they want to become her WHAT? \"We thought it would be super duper fun. You could eat us over and over and over...\" Pinkie continued with this while Trixie was thinking. What if this was some sort of trick? They could expose her and humiliate her again.

It was a clean, well kept kitchen and the opening of the fridge revealed many ingredients they would need to turn Twilight into a pony roast. \"Get to it, I want a Twilight roast to be served to me.\" Trixie's horn glowed again and Twilight lost consciousness. In a bright flash of light another Twilight appeared right next to the unconscious body. After realizing what happened the clone Twilight went into the kitchen and laid down on the table, waiting for her friends to start cooking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly the other mares went into the kitchen and started to distribute duties. Fluttershy cut up some vegetables to stuff Twilight while the rest used some razors that conveniently laid around to shave Twilights hair off. After about half an hour Twilight was completely naked and Fluttershy was moving on to the sauce with the help of Applejack. Rarity washed Twilight throughoutly with a sponge and as she was finished the sauce and the stuffing were ready. Pinkie eagerly spread Twilights buttcheeks apart and called for Rainbow Dash to start stuffing. The rainbow maned pegasus scooped up the cut vegetables and shoved them up Twilights plothole while Rarity started to cover Twilight in the sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie licked her lips as she watched them prepare Twilight for her and couldn't help but to giggle as Applejack gave her a finishing touch by stuffing an apple into her mouth. With her magic she picked up Twilights lifeless real body and moved it like a puppet. \"Aw looky here Twi Twi, you're being cooked up nicely, just for me. With combined effort Rainbow Dash and Applejack heaved Twilight into the oven where she was being roasted. The ovens in this studio were set so that ponies, placed inside of them, would only be cooked, not killed. It would take a while until Twilight was finished so Trixie called the others back to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes?\" Asked Rainbow Dash nervously, barely able to hold back her wingboner. The only response was a magical slap from Trixie. \"You will address me as Great and Powerful Trixie, is that clear?\" Scolded the magician. Trixie smirked as Rainbow Dash apologized to her. If this brash pegasus was acting like this the others MUST be serious. \"While Twilight is cooking I want you to do something good for my hooves, and you will be my pillow and feed me some grapes.\" Ordered Trixie while pointing at Rarity for the last bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about an hour Trixie was fed with graped by her pillow while the other mares licked and massaged her hooves. All of them were strangely quiet as they did so. They sill had to get used to the thought of becoming vore slaves and couldn't think of anything to say to their new mistress. Suddenly a loud *ding* came from the kitchen, Twilight was done. Rainbow Dash and Applejack went into the kitchen and came back with the cooked, steaming, barely conscious Twilight, served on a platter. \"Well done my slaves.\" Praised Trixie her new servants.</span></div></div>",

The best thing about it was that the mare before her even volunteered and climbed on the table to be prepared herself. Twilights hooves hung limply in the air as she was lifted from the plate, sauce dripping from her body. Trixie did not care much for the mess this made, this was all about her enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other slaves resumed massaging her hooves as she levitated her meal above her. Trixie decided to eat Twilight hooves first, she wanted her to see how her body was slowly devoured. Opening her mouth widely, she took in the hind hooves and slowly started to gulp them down. It was unclear if Twilight was really such a willing meal or if she was just too tired to resist after being cooked but either way, the purple mare stayed perfectly still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached Twilights haunches, Trixie couldn't resist giving Twilights pussy a little lick. The reaction was almost nonexistent, just a little shudder. but Trixie was still satisfied. While the filling was primarily roleplay in this case, the sauce gave the cooked unicorn a delicious taste as Trixie worked on the belly. Twilight still did not protest as Trixie reached her neck, instead she gathered all her strenght and craned her neck up to allow Trixie easier swallowing. After the head and horn disappeared between Trixie's lips, the rest was just slurping up the front hooves. With a mighty gulp, Trixie sent Twilight into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a contented sigh she motioned to her new servants to come closer. \"To celebrate this moment you may place your heads on my beautiful belly and listen to your friend digesting.\" The others looked reluctant at first but quickly became pretty eager to press their ears against the gurgling stomach. It was almost hypnotic to them, hearing the stomach of their mistress churning the body of their friends into paste. After a few minutes, Twilights real body shot up as if awaking from a nightmare. The disoriented unicorn looked around until she spotted the pony that ate her temporary body. Twilight went over to Trixie and kneeled down. \"I hope I tasted good enough for you, mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie laughed as she saw the pony that humiliated her kneel down, hoping she tasted good enough for her. \"Of course my little pet. This was the best meal I've eaten in my entire life.\"</span></div></div>",

I really enjoyed that feeling and wanted more. Of course there was little opportunity to indulge, at least without dying in the end so my attempts were mostly fruitless. Then I discovered vornos and a whole new world was opened up to me. I left the cherry orchard I used to run and looked for Big Belly. I've got the job and loved every single minute of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie listened to her explanation sceptically. \"Well, maybe you like being eaten but Trixie has humiliated you severely, aren't you upset about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherry blushed and started to shiver, \"That was my first time shooting such a scene, at first I really didn't like it but as you continued...\" Without warning she threw herself to Trixie's feet. \"You have opened my eyes, to be used and abused like that is what I really want, what I was made for. I struggled for the sake of the film but really I just wanted to submit to my great and powerful mistress, please mistress, take me and make me your property!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie gasped as she heard this, was this mare serious?

Ha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie rolls her eyes, she wasn't in the mood to be mocked, especially about that faithful night. \"If you would excuse me, I'm kind of busy right now... I have a job to get to...\" She mumbled while gritting her teeth. This was the very reason why she hadn't wanted to return to Ponyville, but she was very short on bits and she couldn't afford to go anywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Job eh? Who in their right mind would hire you?\" Rainbow Dash asked as she looked over Trixie's weary body.

Bwhahaha!\" She falls to the ground in a storm of laughter, rolling about like a pig in the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the ex-magician rolls her eyes. \"Very funny...\" She hisses, manoeuvring past the laughing pegasus and down the alley. Rainbow Dash quickly gets up and flys in front of her, blocking her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, if you wanna earn a few bits I got a job for ya...\" She says, holding back a laugh. She was just enjoying this thing way to much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What should I do? I can't possibly offer my body to her, she'd humiliate me more then I already am!

Now let's go to my house so we can start...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads Trixie throughout the town and into the countryside. After about ten minutes of walking a house in the clouds comes into view, a beautiful rainbow waterfall gushing down one side. \"Hey, do you know that spell so you can walk on clouds?\" Rainbow Dash asks, wiping around to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the third time, Trixie rolls her eyes. \"Of course I do, that's such rudimentary magic! How could you think a magician like me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean ex-magician!\" Rainbow snickers, much to Trixie's annoyance. She sighed then concentrated for a moment. A flash filled the air, but the unicorn seemed unaffected. She watched as the pegasus flew up the house, and Trixie followed via a teleportation spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ponies walked into the cloud house, Trixie's jaw dropping after a look on the inside. It was absolutely gorgeous, with a huge living room/kitchen on the main floor, and a spiral staircase leading to the next floor. Several beautiful couches made of clouds sat on the living room side, and in the kitchen were a variety of common cooking appliances. She could hardly believe that the pegasus lived in such luxury, <i>Being captain of the weather team must pay well...</i> She commented silently to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you like my crib?\" Rainbow Dash asks as she flops down on the couch, quickly relaxing into the fluffy, soft material. Trixie only nodded in response. \"Alright, then let's get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus flew back over to her, her grin wider then ever. \"So, I'm going to give you fifteen bits now...\" At this Rainbow Dash pulled some money from under her wing and threw it at the cheap whore standing in front of her. \"And another fifteen when your done, but only if you do exactly as I say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie gulped loudly as she scavenged the bits from the floor. She had absolutely no idea what the pegasus had planned for her, but she knew it was going to be humiliating, painful and above all, demeaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From this point on your new name is bitch, and you do exactly what I say.\" Rainbow says firmly, slapping the blue unicorn across the face.

They almost had an entire apple orchard they could convert to cider that would have made them the richest ponies in Equestria. It was supposed to be an easy contest, their Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 would make ten barrels of cider for every barrel that hick family could produce and then they would win the farm. Then the friends of that mare interfered, forcing them to speed up the production by deactivating quality control. They have won the competition but the cider that resulted from this contest was so bad that nopony would drink it, not even for free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid this loss discourage the unicorn twins? No, they were currently scouting the everfree forest in hopes they could find some new ingredients they could add. Something exotic that would make their cider stand out above everything else. For days they have camped out in the forest despite the danger of becoming a manticores or timberwolves snack. They almost gave up their search as they came across a singular tree on a clearing, right in the middle of the forest. It was an apple tree and it bore the most delicious apples the two of them have ever seen. They were such a bright red that they could be mistaken for rubies and much bigger than normal apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlim looked at his brother and grinned. \"Flam my dear brother, when these apples taste half as good as they look then they could beat every other apple in Equestria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed Flim, let's pick a few and see if they really taste so good, prepare the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000.\" While his brother got the machine ready for production, Flam got a basket and picked a few of these apples. Just looking at them made his mouth water. By the time the basket was full their cider machine was ready. He filled the apples in while his brother powered the machine with his magic. All of these apples were of the highest quality, after the machine was done they looked at the cider made from theses apples. It was a magnificent sight, this cider was shimmering as if they had a barrel of liquid gold. Not being able to wait any longer they procured two mugs and gave the cider a taste test. As the two brothers emptied their mugs they started to feel strange.</span></div></div>",

He plucked another apples from the tree and ate it. The taste of the whole apple was a little strange, good but unfamiliar to him. The more he ate of this apple the hungrier he got. \"I can't believe it Flam, these apples make you hungry!\" An idea formed in Flims head. \"If we sell these apples our customers would get hungry and then we could sell them even more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlam laughed loudly at his brothers plan. \"Brilliant as usual Flim, those apples will make us rich.\" Then a growl broke them out of their scheming. \"But first let's eat something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got out their last rations, a few daisy sandwiches. As they ate they noticed that the sandwiches were not as tasty or filling as usual. After finishing all six of them they were still hungry and decided to eat the grass around them. It took almost an hour before their hunger was sated for now and the grass was not fresh and juicy just bland. Now they were slightly worried, did the apples cause this?

Finally Flams arms stretched out to a fine line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for accepting your fate and not making me feel any guiltier about this than I already do Flam, goodbye.\" He thought as he tasted his brothers mane on his tongue. Most of his twin brother was already inside of his stomach as he pulled down the arms and closed his mouth again. With a happy sigh he stayed on his belly, soon his brother would be digested but this experience was just worth it.

Judging from his brothers moans it must feel great, great that means he can't expect any help from him.

She managed a feeble flailing of her hooves as her devourer tilted her head back and opened her mouth wider, letting more of her prey slide down her gullet.

She touched it with her horn and a burst of electricity went through the cocoon, causing Celestia to scream in pain and become still once again. The princess was still awake though. Chrysalis flashed her an evil grin before opening a small hole where Celestias horn was. \"Thank your niece and your student for this. I would have been happy with turning you into a changeling and maybe even making you a sex slave for myself but they weren't cooperative so I will have to eat you to break their spirits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia was still paralyzed from the shock, so she couldn't do anything as the changelings lips engulfed her horn. The other ponies also gasped in horror as the white horn was slowly taken in. \"Wait no, I'll do whatever you want!\" Cried Cadence, hoping to at least save the princess life. Chrysalis however ignored her and the twitches of her prey and continued to swallow. Soon the horn was down the queens throat and Celestia could feel the saliva dripping onto her face. Weakly she tried to pull herself out but she only got another but smaller shock from the changeling queen. Soon her world became dark and wet as her face was engulfed by queen Chrysalis mouth, her crown has already fallen to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop, take me instead.\" Begged Twilight, not wanting to see her teacher being eaten alive right in front of her eyes. While Chrysalis considered the offer, she still decided against it and slurped up the princess neck before continuing with the shoulders. The ponies still tried to make any kind of offer to save their princess life but their pleas fell on deaf ears as Chrysalis pushed the princess wings together and shoved them down her throat too. Celestia could barely twitch with her legs now but even if she could struggle, her flanks were already being slowly engulfed by the chitinous lips. Queen Chrysalis belly was already distending with the large alicorn inside and it did not take long until the changeling queen slurped up her rear legs and tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was done with her large meal, Chrysalis sighed happily and hovered towards the throne where she sat down. She looked at her prisoners, which were horrified at what they witnessed just now. \"Guards, get Twiligth Sparkle and ex princess Cadence here and press their heads against my belly.

It was time, digestion has begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia was still weak from the earlier battle and the shocks, still she thrashed around, hoping that her struggles force the changeling queen to throw up. Her struggles did not have any effect though, as she was constricted by the fleshy walls too tightly to really move. Suddenly she could feel something else. Some sort of liquid entered the stomach and the walls were rubbing against her. Fear gripped the princess as she knew what this meant and her terrible suspicion was confirmed as she felt an odd sensation, at first a tingle, then an itch and finally, a horrible burning sensation all across her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Twilight and Cadence could also feel how the stomach started to churn the princess up.

Her most sensitive parts felt as if they were on fire as the gastric juices attacked them and she could actually feel herself getting lighter as her body was being broken down.

The changeling focused her power again to return to her natural form and lit her horn using her magic to close and lock the door as well as gently lift the covers off the lower bed reavealing Luna's lower body, from her hind hooves to her crescent Cutie mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe Queen's stomach growled loweder in anticipation of its new victim. Chrysalis slowly took the two hind hooves in her mouth and licked them over as she slowly pulled Luna in, she took a few gulps as she worked half of the princess's hind hooves down her through. this pony tasted delicious! Alicorns are more than rare and to have the chance to actually eat one whole let alone the mare after her is truly a treat. as she worked more and more of the sleeping pony down her through the young princess started to groan and move in her sleep. as soon as Luna's Cutie mark vanished into the queen's mouth, the princess finally started to wake up and looked down to see her body being devoured by a strange creature in the middle of the day. she began to squirm and yell. \"AHH!! LET GO OF ME! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?! SPIT ME OUT!!\" she screamed but her demands meant nothing to the hungry queen as her midsection and wings were pulled into her mouth and licked over. Luna didnt notice this earlier but this actually felt nice. The wet, warm maw of this predictor as well as her playful and smooth tongue going over her blue furr. the sensation started to calm Luna slightly. the princess looked to Chrysalis with a slight blush and swallowed in fear, she tried to focus her magic but it was quickly countered by that of the queen's. little by little the Princesses body was pulled into the changling's mouth till she eventually lifted up her head and allowed gravity to aid in Luna's decent into her final destination. the queen's stomach. The Princess slid down the through even faster now and was eventualy let back down slightly when only her head remained, being given a few momens to speak before being finished off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"please spare me..ill do anything you ask.. just please.. let me go..\" Luna said terrified of her imanent death. Chrysilas paused for a moment bringing a hoof to her chen taking in the offer. have Luna become a slave? or a meal?</span></div></div>",

They weren't expecting what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight heard the door open, and looking up she found herself face to face with a being she had never expected to see again. \"Hello there Sparkle...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TWILIGHT LOOK OUT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Twilight could respond she was given a swift blow to the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came to, Twilight found herself outside, or rather inside the Everfree. Chrysalis stood over her. \"Good, your awake.\" Twilight immediately began to flare up her horn but was immediately struck by the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahah~ I wouldn't do that if I were you. After all, there's no telling what will happen to your little dragon friend if you attack me or try to escape.\" Chrysalis motioned to a couple of the changelings with her, who wer currently standing next to a restrained purple dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare touch him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't... as long as you behave. I need you Sparkle...\" Chrysalis softly placed a hoof on Twilight's cheek. \"You're brave, smart, kind... a good leader. ...A good queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis sighed and looked at her children. \"Twilight, I'm certain you remember our... departure from Canterlot? My children... were not fortunate. You are looking at the last changelings in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? It was your own fault f-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fault?! Is it my fault my people have to hide their true selves so they won't be attacked as monsters? My fault my people suffer and starve while yours have everything just given to them? Life isn't all black and white, good and evil. I had no choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked Twilight in the eyes. \"You think I caused you to suffer Sparkle? Caused your brother to suffer? You know NOTHING of suffering. We are left to starve because we are different. I had to watch thousands of my children DIE because of what your brother and his bride did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long uncomfortable silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even know, do you? Of course not. You, Sparkle, are looking at the last of our kind. And when we die we will be gone forever... Not that you care. What's another species disappearing as long as Equestria remains perfect, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain silence. This time however it was broken by a much more disturbing sound. One of the changelings began to make a horrible choking noise, collapsing to the ground as he gripped his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Chrysalis, much to Twilight's surprise, ran to the Changeling's side, leaving her completely unguarded. Chrysalis held the suffering changeling in her forehooves holding it close to her and began to comfort it, softly rocking it back and forth as she sang a soft somber song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush now, my baby, be still love don't cry...<br>\r\nSleep as you're rocked by the stream.<br>\r\nSleep and remember my last lullaby...<br>\r\nSo I'll be with you as you dream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the song ended the changeling slowly stopped moving. Chrysalis lowered her face and, again surprising Twilight, began to cry. After a few moments she raised her head and looked back at Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now do you see? We suffer and die, and for what? I could not save my children, but at least I can save my people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked at Chrysalis, and after a few seconds she found words. \"What do you need me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis gave  a small sincere smile and looked over at her remaining children. \"I... I am dying Twilight Sparkle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery face in the clearing showed shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am without an heir and without a queen to guide them, my last remaining children will die. I need you to become the new changeling queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was again shocked. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will give you the last 'gift' I can give. You will be... corrupted in a sense, taking a form more suitable. And... you will gain my power as well. The hivemind will be yours... All you need to do is build one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stared at the dying race before her. How could she possibly accept this? To become... like Chrysalis? Her eyes trailed over to the other changelings as she was lost in thought. But could she at the same time, let them just die?</span></div></div>",

As they held it, Twilight's body suddenly became cold, as if she'd been dipped in ice, but that sensation was quickly replaced with a warm tingling sensation. Soon after Chrysalis released the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what was that?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave you my gift... and my curse. You will... change over time.

He immediately ran to Twilight's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh a couple last things before you return to your home my queen. If you ever need help, for anything, just call. We will hear you.

This day is probably a happy day, or at least a normal day, for so many... but for us, it is a sad one...\" The dying monarch gave a shuddering sigh, \"I would have liked to have stayed longer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke ten figures approached the group, disposing of their disguises as they saw their previous leader's state. The children would be with their mother as she left this world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight... I just realized... Despite what's happened between us, you don't even know my name. I am Chrysalis, I aspired for greatness for my people... and got none. I wonder what awaits for me in the next life... Will I see my children again?\" Chrysalis coughed painfully. \"...I guess I'll find out soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight didn't know what to do, the only one who could teach her what to do was dying before her very eyes. \"Please, don't leave... we could get help. It might not be too late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No pony would treat me. I doubt they even could regardless. Take care of my... no <i>your</i> children while I'm gone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears of desperation began to flow from Twilight's eyes. Chrysalis gave her a soft smile, and with great effort, lifted a hoof to dry Twilight's tears she began to weakly sing one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush now my baby, be still now don't cry...<br>\r\nSleep as you're rocked by the stream.<br>\r\nSleep and remember my last lullaby <br>\r\nso I'll be with you while you dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis looked to the sky as she continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"River, oh river flow gently for me.<br>\r\nSuch precious cargo you bare.<br>\r\nDo you know somewhere where she can be free?<br>\r\nRiver... deliver her... there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last words words passed Chrysalis's lips her eyes closed and her hoof fell limply to the ground. Chrysalis, queen of the changelings, invader of Canterlot, was dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changelings and Twilight cried, the changelings had lost their mother, and Twilight had lost the only one who could teach her what she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It figures the last thing she'd do would be to sing about herself.\" Rainbow scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack removed her hat and placed it against her chest, a sign of respect to their fallen adversary. \"Ah dun think she was Rainbow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't you tell? She was singing about Twilight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis's funeral was short, they couldn't do anything fancy. Just a hole behind the library to bury her in. Twilight marked it with a stone, and with the help of the remaining changelings carved the following words into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here lies Chrysalis<br>\r\nMother and Leader of many<br>\r\nLet her name never be forgotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, she and her friends returned to the library while the changelings disappeared back into town, disguised once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what are you going to do Twilight?\" Fluttershy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know... I feel so tired...\" Twilight replied, \"I... I'll see you all tomorrow, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her friends left, Twilight went upstairs to her room, laying on her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did she have to die... I can't do this alone...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly drifted to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Twilight could see some Changelings gathering around her. They were disguised as townsponies but somehow Twilight knew that they were changelings. As she was underneath Rainbow Dash's home, she cast a cloudwalking spell on herself and wanted her new subjects to lift her up. Before she even said the order, two changelings that were disguised as pegasi lifted her up and placed her in front of the cloudhouse. Twilight guessed that this was some sort of telepathic link with the swarm, soon she would become a full fledged changeling queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, Twilight crept into the home of her soon to be meal, careful to avoid any noises, despite the fact that she walked on clouds. Slowly she made her way to the bedroom, where she heard loud snoring. Peeking her head around the corner she saw her target, sleeping on a bed made of clouds. With nervousness and sadness in her heart, she went to the bed and took a good look at her friend, possibly the last look she would ever get of her. Then suddenly a thought came to her, the mouth was not the only way the prey could be eaten.</span></div></div>",

If she would do this to one of her friends, the least she could do was leave her some dignity. Rainbow Dash turned on her belly and exposed her hind legs to Twilight. With shaking hooves, Twilight grabbed Rainbow Dash's hind hooves and led them to her mouth. She opened widely and put the hooves into her mouth. The first thing she noticed that Rainbow was... delicious. For one moment she almost forgot who it was she was tasting. Her stomach growled, urging her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash woke up to something wet on her legs. \"Wha? What is that?\" For one moment she panicked, did she wet her cloud? That was impossible, she was a grown pony and she has been to the bathroom before she went to sleep. She quickly looked down at herself and gasped at what she saw. Twilight Sparkle was currently sucking her legs down, almost reaching her hips. \"Twilight, what are you doing?\" She asked, only getting an apologetic and sad look in return. \"Twi, let me go, please.\" Rainbow Dash was getting scared, was this because Twilight was a changeling queen now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight feared this moment, the moment one of her friends would beg for her life and she couldn't stop. The hunger was overwhelming now, it felt like she would go crazy if she didn't eat Rainbow Dash right now. Twilight continued to suck the scared pegasus down her esophagus. Rainbow Dash meanwhile continued to beg as she watched herself getting eaten. \"No, don't do this. I don't wanna die, not like this.\" Rainbow Dash was crying by the time Twilight moved to her chest. \"I wanted to become a Wonderbolt at least before I die. I thought we were friends.\" Twilight was heartbroken by this, but had no choice but to finish what she started. \"I'll do whatever you want, just please have mercy.\" Rainbow Dash could no longer beg afterwards as he head was also engulfed by Twilights lips. The new queen of changelings gulped a few times, sending Rainbow Dash into her stomach where she would be digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash was curled up, unable to move at all. From all sides the digestive juices coated her body but Rainbow Dash didn't struggle, she knew that this was the end for her. A strange, numb feeling spread across her body as she could feel herself becoming soft. Her hooves were starting to turn into goo, which was quickly absorbed by Twilights stomach. Luckily for Rainbow Dash, her nerves seemed to have been damaged already so she won't be in pain, that was at least some comfort for her. Slowly she was becoming liquid as piece of piece of Rainbow Dash's body started to drift off, leaving her almost an amorphous blob. Soon she passed away, nothing remaining of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight meanwhile cried for her friend, she hoped that this was the only time she ever had to do this. Rainbow Dash left her with a little layer of fat and Twilight could swear she felt some sort of pressure in her back but she didn't care about that for now.</span></div></div>",

I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changelings look at each other. They speak amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't seem well...

Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, but we desperately need a full fledged queen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" Twilight interjected, \"But don't I get some say in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of... of course your majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you... explain the reasoning behind speeding up this transformation you mentioned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. You see, your body is changing to adapt to new powers it has been given. If we speed up the process you could get all of your powers in a matter of days instead of weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the risks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... there's a... non-zero chance that, among other side effects, you won't be quite... yourself afterword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I'll just need to think about this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she did.

As she approached it, she noticed a lone, robed figure resting by the river. \"Hello?

She was taller, rivaling Chrysalis in height. A pair of insect like wings stuck out of her back. Her mane and tail had faded to white. Her purple fur was all but gone, replaced by a dark black carapace although there were a pair of tufts on her shoulders, having become a mere decoration. Her eyes were still purple, but the pupils were now bestial slits. Her horn was long and crooked. And her teeth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have FANGS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis laughed. \"What did you expect, you're a changeling now.

Grabbing hold of one cupcake he imnediately popped it into his mouth and swallowed. One became two quickly, followed by three until eventually he gulped down the last one. Nightmare Moon was giddy watching his gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat next to the door and sighed with content, oblivious to the magic field covering his tail. In an instant he was whisked into the room, before he had time to scream Nightmare forced another cupcake in his mouth as a makeshift gag. His eyes were wide as he stared the drooling villain, and before he could run she forced his head deep into her maw. His legs kicked as hard as they could and he tried to scream or breathe fire but the gag prevented both. nightmare Moon's tongue rubbed over the pudgy dragon, collecting his flavor before she swallowed, two short gulps and he fell into.the princess' gullet, right beside Pinkie Pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffed and satisfied Nightmare Moon locked the bedroom's door and retired to the bed, lying down. Listening to the gurgling of her stomach, she gently drfited into slumber. Inside her dank stomach Pinkie held Spike close to hwler. Both were shaking and scared, Pinkie's fur had already started to fall out. Underneath his scales Spike felt a tingle, his underdeveloped scales weren't strong enough to protect him for too long.

Far, far back in the rear of the town hall, the lavender unicorn followed Celestia's trail into a side room. \"Princess, Princess wait!\" The unicorn called after her, following her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two for the price of one, lovely.\" Nightmare thought to herself, before flitting through the cracks in the doorway. Inside was her glorious sister, the room was well lit, seemingly specifically to avoid her interference. It would not stop her, she slipped to the few shadows before Celestia even had time to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How have you fared, my student?\" Celestia asked, gently nuzzling the unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" She nearly shouted. \"But last night! The mare in the moo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn was cut off, as a Celestia suddenly put a hoof to her mouth, looking into the shadows intently. \"I know Twilight... and she's here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare Moon growled, so much for the element of surprise... With a cloak of stars she revealed herself, her dark form filling the darkest corner of the room as she stepped out of the nothingness. \"It has been a long time, sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are <i>not</i> my sister Nightmare Moon, you are keeping her from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe what you wish, but it matter not. I will have my vengeance on you and any pony that stands in my way. Starting with that student of yours. Twilight you said her name was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare Moon shifted, her face suddenly inches from Twilight's face. \"I think she would make a fine addition to my glorious form, don't you, sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Don't touch her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darker alicorn actually took pause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No? No?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned growling at her sister, who stood her ground. Not many ponies would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just what can you possibly do to stop me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia looked at Twilight and then back to Nightmare Moon. \"...Take me instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, no, you can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry about me Twilight. I know what I'm doing.\" She looked Nightmare Moon in her draconic eyes. \"Do we have a deal, spectre? My life for hers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare Moon walked around Celestia, examining her. This was surely a trap, and yet... nothing signifying a trap was visible. There was nothing at all here... Just herself and Celestia... Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's your game, then? Pass the torch a thousand years forward, to do what you couldn't? Sorry to disappoint sister, but I'd much rather save you for the main course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lavender unicorn didn't need to be told twice, her horn flared and she fled the room, her magic flinging the door open wide. Nightmare snapped after her, catching her tail, but her sharp fangs couldn't get a grip, and instead tore straight through, clipping a small bit off the fleeing mare's tail. She roared at being denied her snack, turning and glaring at her sister. \"I'll be back for you Celestia, just you wait. We sisters shall spend all eternity together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia shuddered as Nightmare Moon turned into a dark mist and fled back into the hallway. \"Luna... Please... Stop this.\"</span></div></div>",

You little-!\" Nightmare groaned, sitting down and leaning against a tree. \"This is a gift you foal! You'll be able to die warmed by your precious sun and my glorious form!\" Another sudden strike. The unicorn was casting offensive spells of some kind. It wasn't excessively powerful, but Nightmare had never had such a fight within her stomach before.

Preempted by a burst of foul-smelling air, a deluge of bile flooded from Nightmare Moon's maw, followed shortly by the lavender unicorn that she'd devoured in the first place. Twilight landed in the pool of bile with a wet thud, then shakily pulling herself to her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment the two just stared at each other, both panting for breath, before Twilight turned tail and fled, Nightmare Moon once again barely missing with her snapping jaws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn that unicorn!\" She shouted, her voice echoing in the forest around her. \"If I had recovered just a bit more strength...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare Moon paused and grinned. \"Just a little bit more...

While sleeping in his icy tomb, he dreamed of the old days, when he visited by far his favorite place in the whole world, the crystal arena. He murred deeply in his sleep at the memory, of all those ponies that fought and were eaten in that arena. Often he would force random slaves to fight each other, at a chance to earn freedom but the winner had to eat the loser whole and alive. He also liked to pit them against superior predators, equipped with armor and weapons that would make the fight difficult even for an experienced veteran. Right now, he dreamed of one of those fights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The arena was eerily quiet, as the show the audience witnessed, was not something they would normally cheer at. A young stallion was equipped with a spear, that was basically just a sharpened stick and he fought an alligator. Piercing an eye of the beast might have saved him but in his panic he desperately poked at the scaly hide. This only made the reptile more angry, causing it to snap at him and fling the makeshift spear away, giving the poor stallion even less of a chance. He tried to run after it but the alligator had good reflexes and bit him in the rear legs as he attempted to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Sombra sat in his box seat, pushing his cock deep down into the throat of a mare. He often brought one of his more personal slaves with him to a fight. His excitement and arousal grew, as he watched the stallion trying to get himself out of the predators jaws. The stallion pleaded for mercy, although none have ever received any from the tyrant. Instead, Sombra just watched as the specially trained alligator snapped forward again and again, eating the crystal pony whole and alive. Despite his reputation as bloodthirsty, Sombra did not like it when the process was messy, he preferred the meals of his pets to be eaten cleanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire arena watched in horror, as the stallion became nothing but a squirming bulge in the belly of the beast, struggling to escape. Sombra used his hoof to push his mare slaves head against his crotch. He watched as the struggles soon died down as the fighter was finally digested. At that same moment, he climaxed deep into the mares throat, causing her to gag in disgust. This he did not like, so he made a mental notice to have her fight in the arena next, maybe against his pet snake. Unfortunately for him, he would not be able to see that fight, as that evening the princesses of Equestria would vanquish him and banish him into the ice.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSombra felt the crack in his icy prison, as the time for his escape has finally come. He also felt the spell, that caused his empire to disappear for all those years fade away. Soon he would have all his crystal slaves back. That begged for a huge festival in the arena. He chuckled darkly, as he made his way to....</span></div></div>",

The baby dragon had been traveling with with Twilight on one of her usual visits to Zecora's house, but had been seperated from the studious unicorn. The dragon twisted his tail nervously. He'd been trying to find the path back to Ponyville, but sadly couldn't find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he bumped into something large and warm, and quite possibly alive. He looked up and his heart sunk when he found himself face-to-face with King Sombra. The purple dragon was so terrified he couldn't even speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSombra stared at the dragon. He remembered him. This was the one who had returned the Crystal Heart to Princess Cadence, ensuring his defeat. As he looked a him more, he noticed how decently sized he was. And how delicious he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon slowly scooted away. \"D-don't hurt me! I'm sorry about what happened at the Crystal Empire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark king glared at him, then chuckled. \"The Crystal Empire? No. That's water under the bridge.\" He grinned a wicked smiled. Spike could feel the seating hate in his voice. \"This is personal~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon tried to run, but he was quickly caught in the unicorn's magical aura. He was lifted up into the air above the ebony stallion. Confused and afraid, he looked down ... And his eyes widened in horror as he saw himself hovering over the king's open mouth.</span></div></div>",

The size difference proved to be a harsh mistress, as the one swallow had already pulled the dragon in halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSombra smirked. This was too easy. He gave another swallow, pulling the dragon all the way into his mouth. By this point , Spike's struggling had been reduced to pitiful squirming that pleased his predator more than helped him escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of enjoying the squirming, Sombra tilted his head back and gave one last swallow, rubbing the bulge in his throat as it disappeared into his chest before rounding out his belly.

He recognized it almost immediately as that infernal purple unicorn who'd thwarted his plans. He looked down. The dragon had been filling, but not entirely satisfying. He needed more. \"Perfect~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight burst around the corner, freezing in place when he saw the dark king. \"S-sombra ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSombra smirked. \"Hello.\" His eyes raised in interest when he saw her new wings. \"Oh? So you're a Princess now? Congratulations.\" He gave a mocking bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight glared at Sombra. \"Where's Spike!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSombra smiled. \"That dragon? Don't worry. You'll catch up with him soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight glared and flared her magic. Sombra merely smirked before flaring his own. There was a flash and. Twilight 's magic disappeared. The Alicorn tried to start it up again, but a sharp pain shot through her forehead, preventing her from focusing. She looked up. Her horn was coated with grey crystals, just like her brother when he'd had his magic sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Twilight found herself being lifted off the ground. She tried to flap her wings, but Sombra's magic held them against her body. She let out a scream, but it was quickly silenced when Sombra shoved her head into his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis mare was bigger than the dragon, so this wouldn't go as smoothly. Sombra gave a swallow, pulling in Twilight's neck, enjoying her fruitless struggles. \"Like master, like servant\" Sombra thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSombra swallowed again and again, getting more of the Princess into his mouth with each gulp. He moaned with the feeling of the helpless pony going deeper into his body. This was far more pleasurous than the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all good things had to come to an end. With a tilt of the head, Sombra swallowed the mare, sending her onto her trip into his stomach. His stomach bulged out, almost touching the ground.

Spotting a cave, the stallion lugged his way over, too distracted by the feeling of bliss from his large gut to focus on a proper teleportation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering Sombra sat on his haunches and leaned against the wall, rubbing his swollen gut. His prey had stopped struggling by now, whether from fatigue or learned helplessness, he neither knew not cared. He actually like the feeling of the two accepting their fate to become nothing more than nutritious slurry for the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat there, he thought more about how much he'd enjoyed his actions. He'd been a king of an empire and ruled with an iron hoof, but that paled in comparison to the feeling of a live pony in his gut. It gave him an idea. Why try to take over again. He could become a hunter of ponies, gobbling them up for his own pleasure. And he could be as elusive as he wanted, as opposed to having to stay in public to be a king. He could do this for years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his belly as it let out a gurgle, already starting to shrink. Eating crystals had given the stallion a powerful stomach. It wouldn't be long before they would be reduced to goo. He looked at his naked form. It wasn't quite charming enough. But he wasn't a king anymore, so his previous duds wouldn't really fit, would they? Something a little more humble was necessary. His magic flared as he focused, creating himself some clothes. What he came up with was the long red scarf he used to wear before he became emperor and some steel horseshoes; perfect for knocking out unsuspecting ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe prodded his belly again. It had already become soft, like a marshmallow. He smirked and closed his eyes to get some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSombra awoke the next morning. He stretched and yawned. He looked down. His gut was back to normal size. His fast metabolism prevented him from retaining much fat. Not that he minded. He liked his build the way it was. He smirked and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Day 1 as a hunter~\"</span></div></div>",

This would be an exotic meal, something that would come only on very rare occasions. He could not possibly pass up this chance, she seemed to be alone too. Through the shadows of the trees he got closer to his intended target, until she seemed to notice something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora lived in this forest for a while now. Doing that without ending up in the belly of some predator required her to be very perceptive, so she noticed when something was sneaking around nearby. \"I know what you want but there is no deal, I won't end up as a meal.\" She muttered into the darkness, as she sped up her pace. She knew the way well enough, so she knew how to outmaneuver the predators of the forest. Jumping over some roots, she hoped that the hungry predator would trip, giving her more time to run away. What she didn't expect was a living shadow, materializing a gaping maw right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSombra chuckled a bit, as the panicked zebra jumped away, thinking him to be a timberwolf or something equally mundane. It was almost as delicious as she was, to have her jump right into his mouth. Sombra now held the struggling mare in his jaws. Through her jump, she was already halfway down his throat and couldn't move her front legs anymore. All she could do was kick in vain, as the evil king decided to really enjoy her and take his time. With slow, gradual gulps he made more and more of her stripy flanks go past his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rear legs almost came dangerously close, as he decided to crane his neck backwards and shaking her around a bit, making her dizzy. Now that her resistance was broken for the moment, he let her slowly slide down into his waiting gut. As the dizzyness faded, a horrid stench hit Zecoras nostrils. With horror she realized, that her head was already inside the stomach and now brushed against the slimy walls. She screamed, as she tried to push herself out. The insides were too slick however, even after she got control of her front limbs back. With a few, last gulps, she was completely curled up inside of the stomach of her predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Sombra was pleased with his meal. This zebra tasted amazing. If he ever got back into power, he would invade their homeland and get some more. She was also very strong but not so strong, that her struggles were more than a massage for him. Now that he was fed, he could go back to his hiding place and digest her in peace.</span></div></div>",

The soil was getting damp and soft once more, and the scent of life and fresh air once again slipped into the tunnels from the holes leading to the surface. Good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter had been tough on the Diamond Dogs. Food had been scarce and the soil had frozen too hard, making it difficult to head to the surface to find anything. Rover himself had gone without food the last couple days just to make sure the rest of the pack could eat. But with spring maybe that could change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis rare chance to think was interrupted by a loud crashing and the a small stream of water slipping past his paws. He knew what that meant, one of the dig dogs got overzealous in adding tunnels and hit a reservoir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for crying out loud!\" He turned toward the main tunnels and shouted. \"FIDO! SPOT! GET TO THE NEW TUNNEL! NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed in the direction of the tunnels himself and was soon joined by his fellows. Sure enough, water was spilling into the tunnel at an alarming rate... from a single hole. \"...Are you KIDDING?\" He gave the nearest dig dogs a glare as Fido slammed a large rock into the hole to block the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... IDIOTS! Did you forget to check the ssssoil?! We AVOID water!\" Rover had had enough he pointed to his larger companion. \"Fido!

Maybe even NO gems!\" Fido declared, following the two as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRover winced. They made a point. Gems were practically their life... but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I've made up my mind!\" He arrived at the hole and jumped up, grabbing onto the wall and beginning to climb. \"I'm tired of worrying about thissss disaster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fellows could only watch helplessly as he ascended and climbed up and out. Once above ground Rover dusted himself off and looked around. He hadn't been above ground in months, and everything seemed... different. But he could see something to use as a landmark at least. Not far, there was a small pony town. Rover's stomach growled hungrily reminding him of his plight. Perhaps he could find food in town one way or the other...</span></div></div>",

He pushed back, and immediately the soft, empty chamber of his rectum swallowed in her head. She yipped with surprise, not expecting that thick, little ring to suddenly gobble her up like that. She blinked, unable to see at all inside the dark, stuffy, pheromone laden interior with her blindfold on. The muscles around her convulsed and pulled in her neck, leaving her shoulders as the only obstruction. His butt-cheeks had her little shoulder\u2019s held tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRover smirked and drooled a little as he took his cock in his paws and started to work his cock up and down.

Her shoulders slipped inside, causing her back legs to get smooshed between his cheeks, with his empty balls resting on her belly.

Her shoulders popped on soon, and the slimy walls slipped around her, smearing slippery, strange smelling lubricant into her fur. It didn\u2019t smell like waste in here, but it did smell like butt, and smelled an awful-lot like sex in a confined space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Twilight felt her butt slip in past his anus, and she seethed with pleasure. She sighed with relief after the ring finished with it, dumping her entire bust into the soft, somewhat spacious rectum. Outside, Rover called out in pleasure as he felt his bottom fill up with pillowy-prepubescent rump. He rubbed at his pelvis, feeling it inside his body. Amber felt his paws trail over her from inside, before he resumed consuming the pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat back a little bit more, her tummy filing into him. His tail swatted at her hooves as each little inch of her vanished. Twilight began to feel a little claustrophobic inside the dark, tight tunnel. Her rump became compressed again as they slipped into the colon after her. She kept her eyes tight. Her breath felt hot on her own face as it mixed with the growing internal heat of the dog\u2019s core. It was so stuffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRover got down on his knees, forcing his ass down and forcing the pony's hooves against the rock. He smiled, and then slammed his hips down. Twilight yelped as she felt her legs shoot up into the sweltering ass. She wiggled, trying to find more space for herself. Her ass only had a brief stay inside his rectum, which Rover no doubt enjoyed, but his body knew it was eating. A consistent tug from his intestines was pulling Twilight up deeper and deeper into his digestive tract. Her knees slipped into his rectum as her hooves started to disappear between his butt-cheeks. Chester stood back up and held his stomach in his paws, grinning. There was a lot of meat inside his guts now. He patted it as he felt his anus close around her hooves, sealing her inside completely.</span></div></div>",

She felt like she couldn't support it anymore and she lifted a hoof to her ears. She wasn't very surprised when her hoof touched where her ear should be, and instead knocked over a loose pile of something squishy. She tried to sit up, before realizing she couldn't sit up. She couldn't feel the lower half of her body! She giggle and touched her hoof down to her marehood, clopping off her final moments before she was nothing but goo. Her agitating movements, though, caused herself to melt down more quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin about four hours since passing through the diamond dog, Rover's belly had shrunken to almost half the size it was before he devoured the pony. Inside his gurgling gut all that remained of the young unicorn was a thick bubbly sludge. The pool of nutritious soup that used to be Twilight, after having been pressed and broken down to it's current state, began flowing into Rover's hungry intestines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick slurry oozed and flowed through the rough and tight confines of his digestive track, where it was greedily slurped useful bits here or there, causing the soup to begin to solidify into a dense sludge as his insides forced it on through. With each passing second, Twilight's remains were being soaked up and dispersed across Rover's body, invigorating him, while sadly, the parts that could not be used, continued to plod towards his large intestine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goop had nearly had all of the nutrients soaked up, resembling that of a thick greasy sludge at this point, his small intestine pressed the mass into her large intestine for further processing. In the last leg of claiming everything of Twilight, Rover's large intestine began soaking up every bit of moisture it could, compacting the sludge into lumpier clumps now, due to lack of water, finally lumps began to pile up within the dog's rectum.</span></div></div>",

It had shrunken a large amount but he still had a basketball sized bulge which he knew was the poop from his meal. \"Well pony, it is time to come out the way you came!\" He chuckled. Rover walked over to his waste hole and squatted there over the hole and started to push. A large turd about 4 inches in diameter started to ooze out of his anus. \"Oh pony, there is a lot of you left in here! This is the largest poop I've ever taken!\" he cried out as the turd inched its way out. After a minute the turd lands with a plop in the hole and like a cork had been removed poop just started to flood out of his tailhole. \"Oh diamonds and rubies! It feels so good to let you out!\" Rover grinned as the pile of waste behind him built up. After 3 solid minutes of poop falling out of him Rover let out a long, and loud fart splattering the rest of his meal in the hole. A golden stream of urine started to flow from his cock on top of the pile of poop. When he finished peeing he turned and looked at the pile of poop he had just produced from his two meals. He was in awe as there was a pile of waste nearly as high as he was in the pit. \"Well ponies, you sure did leave a lot behind and you gave my anus a good stretch!\" He starts to rub his belly which is noticeably bigger. \"And you have given me a belly bulge! But it was all worth it! I got a wonderful meal!\" he said to the pile of poop. \"Well as much as I'd love to savor you again, I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave and get more ponies to join you.\" he said with a hint of excitement. With that he turned away from the pit and began to walk away.</span></div></div>",

Nnormally, teleporting to somewhere you couldn't see was dangerous, but, twilight reflected, not much was more dangerous than the inside of a stomach, so it was worth the risk.  Charging up her horn, she released the spell, disappearing from the dog's stomach and crashing to the ground a few feet away.  She got up and started trying to run, but stumbled and almost fell- teleporting had taken a lot out of her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNow class, please turn to page 53 of your biology textbook\u201d. Cheerilee instructed the class as she slowly turned to the board to put up a detailed map of the digestive system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slowly went through the basic organs and their order in the digestive system, starting from the mouth, to the gullet and then to the stomach, followed by the small and large intestines, Cheerilee made direct references to her own body by using a metal pointer and pointed to the rough location of the organ.  Sticky papers stuck are to her body to provide students with a more accurate location. For the stomach, however, the location is very obvious as she pointed to a Scootaloo-shaped bulge in her midsection. Hopefully, she thought, the addition of a sizeable bulge will at least allow the students to identify the stomach in the correct location and hence, will at least have 1 less mark to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was doing the organ identifications and her description of their basic functions, her students were trying their best to focus on her lesson. Some, like Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle, were so shocked and scared by their teacher\u2019s actions that they are trying very hard to be attentive, so that they are not next on Cheerilee\u2019s menu\u2026 err, detention list  (if she had one.) Others, like Featherweight and Twist, gave the occasional look of awe and curiosity at Cheerilee\u2019s bulging belly, and the occasional movements which indicated Scootaloo\u2019s attempt to get out of this wet, dark and pungent holding location. Regardless, none of the foal students ever entertained the thought of challenging the teacher for they know the result is an unpleasant one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Scootaloo, however, there could not possibly be a worse situation to be in. To begin with, she is stuck in this dark, fleshy prison which is filled with pungent smells and decreasing amounts of air. As she tried to follow the lesson, she does not have anything of reference or any stationery to jot down the crucial details. Worse still, she also has to compete with Cheerilee\u2019s heartbeat to get as much information as she can. As she is not being an excellent audio learner, this has dented her learning ability greatly. She also had to contend with the uncomfortable position she is in. However, she can only make minute adjustments to her pose due to the stomach\u2019s restrictive environment, which came in the form of moving bulges noticeable to the class. It showed that she is still alive, but she is clearly in an uncomfortable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Cheerilee herself, she is only glad is that the class is giving their best effort to pay attention. She does not seem to mind that she now has a very distended midsection, as it is not causing her discomfort. In fact, she is gaining small levels of pleasure from this experience, as she did after gorging down large volumes of food in her youth, without much fear of gaining weight. Her only concern now is that Scootaloo stays alive and she occasionally takes in large amounts of air to replenish any loss of oxygen, while using a paper bag nearby to release any burps of carbon dioxide, which, luckily for her, is very quiet, such that the students do not pick up the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowards the end of the lesson, Cheerilee managed to complete the topic. She then informed the class, \u201cThank you for being so cooperative today. I apologise that I may have used something drastic today, and I hope not to use it again in the future, unless class order has been disrupted greatly again.\u201d She then told the class, \u201c For homework, I am going to give slightly less as a result of your good behaviour. Finish pages 20 \u2013 22 on your Biology workbook, that is the pages on the naming of digestive system organs and their functions, and read up the next chapter on the skeletal system, from pages 56 to page 64. You are dismissed.\u201d As soon as she finished, the ringing of the school bell is heard throughout the school, meaning that the curriculum has ended for the day. For Scootaloo and the class, this is a silent \u2018sigh of relief\u2019.  Scootaloo thought, \u201cFinally\u2026 At least this ordeal can end, now I need to find Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle to catch up on what I have missed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foal students then prepared to pack up their belongings and leave the schoolhouse for home. A few foals stayed behind to consult Cheerilee and clarify concepts on the digestive system, which Cheerilee is willing and delighted to answer, though not in the manner in which she punished Scootaloo.  As these foals left, Cheerilee decided to let Scootaloo out, but not in this classroom, for it will make a noticeable mess. Being the caring teacher she is, she then decided to pack up Scootaloo\u2019s lightweight kit for her, before taking it for Scootaloo and moving onto a more secluded location to let Scootaloo out, with Scootaloo struggling to maintain her posture inside her fleshy prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cheerilee moved around the school halls and grounds, she finally came across a location whereby the mess can be cleaned up easily. \u201cAhh\u2026 This will be a decent spot, now it is time to let Scootaloo out\u201d. Cheerilee thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will this location be?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her students are not as attentive as they used to be and their test scores are starting to veer towards the F grades. Normally, the Headpony would be an understanding dean of this school, as she would leave Cheerilee to use whatever methods she needed to coach her students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with the recurrence of horrible grades for the last 2 to 3 tests, the Headpony is starting to express concern towards Cheerilee, more because she wants the students to succeed in their future. She did not make any threats, but told Cheerilee that she may need to intervene if things continue to worsen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, Cheerilee knows that she needs to turn this around\u2026 Biology is one of her most passionate subjects, but it is also one which is difficult for her to teach and maintain her students\u2019 interest.

She decides that establishing a conversation with a close friend will provide her with decent suggestions to carry out an improved version of the lesson. At this point, she has a short plan next to her concerning her new lesson plan on the digestive system, but she wants it to be discussed so that it can be refined or backed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter scouting through her whole list of friends, she narrowed it down to two close friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them is a Biology \u2018Poni\u2019fessor who is previously a bright classmate of Cheerilee\u2019s. He is a well-respected and popular lecturer of the Canterlot University who, like Cheerilee, adores Biology. Surely, the \u2018Poni\u2019fessor will entertain her call for assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other is one of Cheerilee\u2019s best friends, a stunt double who specialises in dangerous situations.

With most other ponies in a state of slumber, she knows that, as a tutor, she must lead by example and not be impolite to the fellow town inhabitants. Luckily, she is also a very creative tutor, willing to consider all possibilities, even controversial ones. It is the reason why the Headpony trusted her so much: she knows her options well and she can implement them well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she poured through her previous lesson plans, she came across a rather interesting idea for her new lesson on digestion. Initially, she would put it as the last resort, being concerned about the potential implications it may bring to her young students. But after mulling over the idea, she realised that the students are likely to be old enough to understand what is going on and that she has a number of safeguards to ensure her students and her own safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea is this. In the secret privacy of the Biology room, two ponies would be involved in the demonstration. One pony will be the predator (who must not eat anything beforehand to reduce the muck) and the other pony will be the prey. The predator will then swallow up the prey pony, who has previously and thoroughly applied an anti-acid potion, just in case protection is needed.  The prey pony will also be hooked up to a location sensor and a first-pony camera to give students an interactive perspective of the prey pony as the pony is ingested. In this way, the student ponies can have a more holistic learning style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee also knows that ponies cannot digest each other, particularly because their stomach acids are only strong enough to digest plant matter, not animal fibre. Futhermore, in case things get a little tricky, she has three other potions. The first, a lubricant which makes the swallowing much easier to do. The second, a potion similar to the Syrup of Ipecac, which motivates the ponies to throw up their prey if they are unable to do so. And the third, a potion which forces the prey pony up if the predator chokes on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result: A flawless plan\u2026 The ponies involved will not be severely harmed and everypony should be able to continue normally, with the exception of the prey needing to take a shower to clean off the acids\u2026 and the pungent smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is only one missing detail: Which ponies will be involved?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cheerilee thought intensely over this idea, she finally came to a resolution\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fact that she had the tiny components needed for her experiment was not any indication that she'd planned this out well in advance, but rather Cheerilee was friend's with Nurse Redheart and was able to get a discount price on medical equipment that was being replaced--such as cameras that could go into the stomach with Cheerilee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her devices and her potions at the ready, Cheerilee was complacent that, with a few careful chosen words, the school day would go as planned. She was sure she'd thought of all the pertinent details. So she strolled into class with her saddlebags carefully packed with her equipment and began setting up a tv monitor with some old vcr equipment and a somewhat aged computer. The class were filing into the room and pestering Cheerilee about what she was doing, some hoping that they would be watching a movie today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but we do have an exciting day ahead of us!\" she said and stepped away to look at her connections.

This is most effective on starch, which is why crackers change to a sweeter flavor the longer they stay in your mouth.

She set out the two bottles for Sweetie and herself. \"This red one is for you Sweetie Belle. It stimulates saliva production, although it doesn't seem like you need that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie grinned and in doing so a trail of drool poured out between her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will also relax and numb your throat muscles, allowing the esophagus to stretch easily. When you drink it, it will also coat your esophagus and act as a lubricant, allowing me to be swallowed easier, since your esophagus won't be strong enough to pull me down on its own. This other potion is for me. When I consume it, it will make my body sweat a counter-enzyme that prevents me from being digested.

Sweetie Belle's mouth was already wide enough to take in her head and shoulders. Putting that kind of strain on the jaw would normally push the tongue up over the start of the esophagus, but the relaxed muscles were wide and gaping and she could easily see a few inches straight down into the gloomy, mucus-covered throat. The thick, slimy lubricant from her potion glistened. Cheerilee gulped and turned on the light for her camera, which shined down into Sweetie Belle and illuminated her throat further. Cheerilee thought she could see all the way down to the sphincter that separated the esophagus from the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, children...\" began Cheerilee nervously. With another careful poke from her hoof her camera let out a little laser pointer. \"Here is, um... the tonsils, which are a non-essential part of your body's immune system. Some of you might have had these removed. And here is the uvula. Its function is to help seal your nasal cavity from food and liquid. And... there is the epiglottis. Write that word down please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to get her confidence back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now children the epiglottis is a very important part of your body. It seals your windpipe and keeps water, food, and other contaminants from entering your lungs when you are eating and drinking. Like a lot of your body's internal muscles, it acts on its own without you having to think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHH!!\" Sweetie Belle sounded and stuck her mouth forward. Cheerilee took a step back and realized that Sweetie Belle was getting impatient. Her stomach growled. The teacher could see Sweetie's saliva running right down her esophagus, the epiglottis closing occasionally and demonstrating well Cheerilee's lesson on it. The saliva pooled against the ring of muscle separating esophagus from stomach, only for that muscle to open up and let the liquid drain in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... stomach growls children are... rather simple to understand... They're actually caused by your digestive tract reshaping itself to eliminate excess space, which is why it growls then you are hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle's stomach growled again and the filly began to stomp her hooves. She was apparently <i>very</i> hungry. The potion was stimulating her appetite and making her desperate for Cheerilee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay fine!\" Cheerilee yelled and stuffed her hooves into Sweetie Belle's mouth, and instantly the filly gulped them into her throat. The class gasped loudly. They had maintained a certain disbelief for their lesson until now. Sweetie Belle swallowed again, and Cheerilee stumbled forward. Sweetie Belle's throat was so slippery on the inside, like olive oil on a slip-and-slide (an event that had occurred on school grounds and had been rather messy to clean up). In her stumble, Cheerilee's face fell into Sweetie Belle's maw, and with her momentum and shifted center of gravity, she slipped easily into those relaxed muscles and wedged her entire head into Sweetie Belle's esophagus. The filly's bulging throat had a startling amount of detail of Cheerilee's face. The teacher was just big enough inside the small filly that, despite lubrication, there was enough friction to momentarily slow her descent, but Sweetie Belle began to gulp as fast as she could, and inch by inch, Cheerilee was disappearing into marshmallow-white unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle was being very noisy, hmming and licking over Cheerilee's belly while she ate. Apparently Cheerilee was indeed very tasty. The filly was beginning to drool more and more, but with the big meal in her mouth obstructing her saliva from flowing down into her stomach, it poured out onto the floor and was forming a large puddle that rapidly spread towards the desks. Half the class still stared in horror at the scene in front of them, some other ponies, such as Apple Bloom and Twist, were still trying to write down notes and kept switching their vision from the television screen and the cannibalistic act occurring in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscle leading into the stomach opened up. Cheerilee and the class stared into it, and the light showed the pink muscle interior well. Cheerilee's faced pressed inside, and then into the stomach wall. Her entire head was more than enough to fill Sweetie Belle's stomach far beyond the volume it had ever contained before, and yet the muscle gave way elastically to the school teacher. Sweetie's eager slips closed around Cheerilee's cutie marks as her tongue curled up around Cheerilee's rump and gave a push. The slimy throat allowed Cheerilee's lower body to slip into Sweetie Belle with ease, and with so much weight and gravity to assist it, not even the tiny throat's constriction applied enough friction to stop Cheerilee from falling straight into that tummy in an instant. Cheerilee was forced to curl into a ball; the act of doing so pulled her own hooves down Sweetie Belle's throat without the filly even having to do anything. Sweetie Belle was so shocked that she hadn't closed her mouth, or her throat muscles, even after her stomach's entrance closed tight and purse to contain its meal. Sweetie Belle turned her face downward and saw her stomach was so full that she was unable to reach the ground with her own legs. Cheerilee was resting on the small of her back, and a slight twitch from her caused Sweetie Belle to suddenly fall down onto her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stunned silence fell over the room. Some of the ponies began to grasp for air, having held it while watching the scene unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you had it in you,\" Scootaloo laughed, breaking the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help! I can't get UUUUUURRP!\" Sweetie burped. The class began to giggle and a few, Sweetie's friends included, got from their desks to go check on Sweetie Belle and listen to her tummy, poking Cheerilee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee found herself in an even more cramped space without the extra air, but her uneven, non-homogenized shape maintained some air in her space, both good for air, and of course for talking. \"Children? Can you hear me?\" she asked. Her voice was muffled through Sweetie Belle's stomach, but she came over clear on the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ms. Cheerilee!\" they chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, good,\" she heard. So many voices speaking unison was easy to hear even through the padding of flesh surrounding her. \"Then we'll continue with our lesson.\"</span></div></div>",

She showed how the flesh secreted acids and enzymes to digest her, with the sweat she was making acting as a base to counter the acid. She explained the concept of an enzyme, that it could act as a catalyst that triggered chemical reactions to separate compounds from one another, dissolving food. Acid alone would take hundreds of years to do to a chocolate bar what  these enzymes could do in a few hours. The class listened, taking notes, but still were uneasy as they feared for Cheerilee's safety amidst those time-defying enzymes. Cheerilee's explanation that ponies could not digest meat didn't seem to fully relax the young ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee showed them how the stomach kept pushing on her, and explained how this would tumble around the chewed up food normally, eliminating space while still exposing the entirety of the stomach's contents to acids and enzymes. Then she began to explain what happened to food after that, as it entered the small intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Apple Bloom opened her big mouth. \"Ms. Cheerilee, if our lesson is on the digestive tract an all, then why did ya just show us the stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee's eyes went wide. \"Oh my, you're right Apple Bloom. I completely ignored that fact.\" Apparently she had made at least one little mistake. She was not able to observe her class, but she was beginning to suspect that she was losing their attention. Staring at nothing but pink on a TV or just a big white ball of a pony that talked at them was surely losing their interest by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwist then made the situation worse. \"Oh yeah! And the sth-mall intethtine ithz thuppothed to sthoak up the nutrienthsth! How can we sthtudy that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee slapped her hoof to her head, making the camera shake a little. <i>I don't know,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell there were a few things she thought of right away, although they only had just sprung into her head and she hadn't yet really given them a thought outside of that. They were:<br>\r\n1) Get coughed up and leave the camera behind.<br>\r\n2) Conduct a full-tour of the digestive tract and explain what <i>would</i> happen as best she can.<br>\r\n3) <i>Get digested.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought this last one sarcastically. It would take awhile just for the protection potion to wear off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee then began to think of her three options.</span></div></div>",

The worry that she was messing up her lesson, that she hadn't really thought any of this out, was beginning to poison her. She began to think about this more emotionally. She couldn't fail her students. She had to consider the drastic options as well, not for her sakes, but theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee had, after all, only <i>said</i> ponies cannot digest meat. That wasn't entirely true. Even the study of this fact was taboo, but there were accounts of ponies who had eaten meat to become stronger for races, and ponies who had turned to meat out of desperation. It was more accurate to say that ponies really, really shouldn't be <i>eating</i> meat, rather than could not. She had taken precautions against digestion for this very reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she should wait for her potion to wear off afterall...

She was sure Diamond Tiara or Silver Spoon had something to do with it. Filthy Rich had a lot to do with the members and was a part of their circles. Silver Spoon's mother and father were both on the actual board itself. She'd been having all kinds of nightmares about it all--nightmares of losing her job, nightmares of the more obvious things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee made herself a pot of coffee and made some toast. She was still nibbling on a piece when she went out to her mailbox and gathered her mail. A bad feeling welled up inside her as she saw that a letter from the school board was included. She went back inside and cautiously opened the letter up with a knife. She was shaking as she pulled the paper out of it and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jaw tightened. She'd been canned.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ponies can eat ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s just a simple fact of life. Of course, outside of warfare, being devoured really isn\u2019t anything anypony usually needs to worry about. It\u2019s typically only legally allowed if you are explicitly willing to be eaten by your predators. Unless you are under the age of 18, in which case, it\u2019s actually up to your legal guardians to make that decision for you. At their discretion, they can freely eat you themselves, or even grant permission for someone else to devour you. As a point of fact, only one of your guardians is required to make that decision, and they don\u2019t have to consult with your other guardians first. This was an important factor in a legal case that was popularly discussed a few years back, in which a stallion sued his wife for devouring their foals during a drunken blackout without consulting him first. The judge ended up ruling in the wife\u2019s favor, and for the rest of the year after that trial, foals all across Equestria became just a little more well-behaved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut parents aren\u2019t the only legal guardians a foal can have. The definitions of a guardian vary from narrow to broad from region to region, and in many regions, it even includes the foal\u2019s teachers! Such a policy is considered an antiquated holdover from times when Equestria was struggling with overpopulation; it\u2019s been abolished in some places, but maintained in others, typically in the fancier cities that pride themselves on having a high caliber of citizenry, and thus have a vested interest in \u2018thinning the herd\u2019 of unpromising students. No town has ever gone and adopted new legislature of that sort in the past few centuries, and most ponies were convinced they never would. Even in the fancier cities, there was mounting political pressure to put an end to the practice of teachers eating their students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHence why Ponyville\u2019s latest announcement came as such a shock; Princess Twilight Sparkle herself had intervened in the city council to get a law passed that adds teachers to the list of legal guardians to foals in Ponyville! Twilight\u2019s speech had assured everypony this would merely support the functioning of the school board on a clerical, administrative level, but everypony knew the choice had much deeper implications than that. And since Cheerilee was the only teacher in town, all eyes were on her! All of a sudden, she was known as the mare who was allowed to swallow anybody\u2019s foals whenever she wanted with legal impunity! But of course, poor Cheerilee was more baffled and bewildered by this than anyone else! If there was one thing she could be certain of, it was that this weekend\u2019s parent-teacher conferences were going to be VERY interesting\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually nopony showed up to these conferences, but Cheerilee was stunned to see a whole line of ponies leading up to her office this time! Applejack was the first in line; some say she had camped outside the school just to make sure she\u2019d be first. She stomped into the teacher\u2019s office at the first opportunity. \u201cNow, ah don\u2019t mean ta be rude, Miss Cheerilee, but I gotta make one thing VERY clear. Ah don\u2019t care what kinda confangled legal jargon Twilight\u2019s got jostlin\u2019 about in her noggin nowadays, Applebloom AIN\u2019T on the menu!\u201d The mare passionately insisted. \u201cAh know we call ourselves the \u2018apple\u2019 family, but that don\u2019t mean we take kindly to gettin\u2019 eaten! And us Apples helped fund your schoolhouse, don\u2019t you forget!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApplejack, please, calm down,\u201d Cheerilee replied. \u201cI assure you, I have no interest in eating your sister\u2026\u201d Applejack seemed to become more apologetic and embarrassed as Cheerilee explained herself, before soon trotting out of the office, satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext one in was Rarity. The posh mare was all business. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s just get down to brass tacks. How much will I have to pay you, week by week, to make sure my sister stays off your menu?\u201d She said simply, unfolding a sack of shiny, golden bits. \u201cShe\u2019s a straight-A student, or so she tells me. That usually means I get a sizeable discount, no?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at those bits, Cheerilee actually felt a little tempted. She did need some more bits to afford school supplies and such\u2026 but no, she couldn\u2019t possibly bring herself to extort the mare like that! \u201cMiss Rarity, I appreciate the offer, but I really have no plans to be eating any foals, anyway,\u201d Cheerilee said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity blinked. \u201cOoh. Well, that does make things easier, then,\u201d she nodded. \u201cMy apologies! I had just assumed\u2026 well, in Baltimare, the teachers always asked for a bit of kickback to make it clear certain foals are off-limits.\u201d Rarity soon trotted off as well, but not before giving Cheerilee a 20-bit tip, which she appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few visits proceeded much the same: parents and siblings of her students stopping by and trying to beg or bargain enough to make sure she doesn\u2019t eat her kids. It was kind of demoralizing to have everybody treat her like some kind of glutton who was going to devour her students at the first possible opportunity. Eventually, seeing the writing on the wall, Cheerilee figured she could save time by grabbing a megaphone and walking out of her office to address the line directly. \u201cPlease, to everypony here worried that I might devour their child, do not fear. I have no plans to eat anybody\u2019s foals. I just want the rest of this school year to proceed as usual.\u201d That announcement seemed to satisfy the rest of the ponies, and the line dispersed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee hoped that that would be the end of that\u2026 but the following monday, she once again noticed ponies acting differently. \u201cGood morning, Miss Cheerilee!\u201d Button Mash said as he walked in, in the most uncharacteristically polite possible tone. He happily plopped down a sizeable chocolate bar on her desk. \u201cI got you a chocolate bar! Mrs. Cocoa Skips, your favorite kind! Just cause you\u2019re the best teacher in the whole world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuh\u2026 thank you, Button. That\u2019s very kind of you,\u201d Cheerilee nodded, as he rushed over to his desk, sitting down with perfect posture, his forehooves folded politely on his desk, paying her full attention as if excited to learn. Indeed, every other foal in her class came with a gift of their own today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Miss Cheerilee. I just wanted to give you this poem I wrote about how I appreciate all the things you\u2019ve done for us, and how much you\u2019ve changed the lives of everyone around you. You really are an inspiration!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Miss Cheerilee! Look, I wrote a comic book around you! \u2018The Adventures of the Super-Teacher!\u2019 People say the elements of harmony are heroes, but I think teachers like you are the REAL heroes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Miss Cheerilee! I brought you a hundred bits! Happy late birthday!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time all the foals had taken their seats, Cheerilee\u2019s desk had been covered with a veritable mountain of gifts and knick-knacks! Most of them involved food, notably, as if they were trying to fill her up to keep her from getting hungry during class. And that wasn\u2019t all; the class was usually quite rambunctious and hard to control, but today, they were all like little angels! They were perfectly attentive, asked lots of good questions, and actually studied dutifully during the scheduled study breaks instead of pulling pranks on eachother. It was the best day of teaching that Cheerilee had ever had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course\u2026 she felt kind of guilty. After all, she knew that they were only behaving this well because they were afraid she might eat them if they didn\u2019t. She would never do such a thing! But on the other hoof\u2026 maybe if she told a few little white lies, and implied that she <i>would</i>, maybe she could keep them this well-behaved and make this the most productive school year of all time!</span></div></div>",

He tried to ignore it at first, and why wouldn't he? But that turned out to be a very bad idea as the hunger became more and more painful until he could no longer bear it and indulged. Big Macintosh sighed as he waited for his next victim in the barn. He felt guilty about what he had to do but there was no other way. If he didn't do it the pain would overwhelm him and then there was no telling what he would do to stop it, in the worst case he may take one of his sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunger was by far not the normal kind of hunger a few apples could satisfy.

As a desirable and single stallion about town, but one famed for his shy nature and reserved manner of speech, mares always expressed eagerness to try and date him, or better yet get into an immediate one-night stand. It was so easy. Big Mac was shy and nervous around mares, and this off-put many would-be suitors, so it was like a bit of a dream to those Big Mac recognized as vulnerable, when he approached them and invited them to a secluded place at a specific time, and not to tell anyone. Most ponies were trusting and reliable, and Big Mac never approached anyone who might blab to their friends before their meeting. He was smart about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for all his experience he couldn't help but feel a nervous jolt as the door creaked. He bit down on his wheat, snapping it, and spat it out. \"Sorry miss Carrot Top,\" he whispered to himself as braced himself for what he was about to do. But finding prey was more important than his morality, as he had to make sure he didn't become too ravenous and engulf his own blood with his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned up and looked through a knothole in the wall, but gasped as he saw that it was not Carrot Top, but Applejack, who had come through the door. He gulped, checking his engorged sheath to make sure he wasn't too aroused, then ducked out of hiding. \"Applejack!\" he said with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack frowned at him. \"Big Mac! What in the hay are you doin?\" she snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh,\" he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fixin' yourself a date when we got work to do!\" Applejack finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... that. Uh, guess Ah forgot about it... Eeeyup, that's it. Just blum forgot. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack rolled her eyes. \"Well nothin' to it now, Ah asked Carrot Top to come by sometime later this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Later this week? As in... days like, right?\" He shifted uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course!\" Applejack said and trotted up to him, pushing against his rear with her head and scooting him forward. This elicited a terrified thought in Big Mac. She was, well, in a rather fragile position.</span></div></div>",

His loins burned with rage and he knew he couldn't wait even a few days longer before the strain would be too much. It might not even be possible to make it to the evening. He would have to sneak away from work somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it, westfields?\" he asked. \"Ah'll head on over right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good; Ah'm comin' too,\" Applejack commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac stopped. \"Say again over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along brother we've got to keep ourselves busy!\" she said and gestured again to follow. Big Mac looked around worriedly, hoping some solution would come out of the blue to save him. He followed after her after seeing none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis, ya know Ah'm as hard workin' as they get, but ah... Ah'd really appreciate it if'n Ah could just. Step off the farm fer the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh now don't be getting grouchy just cuz Ah sent away yer filly,\" said Applejack. \"Ya'll ferget all 'bout it once we're good and sweaty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig McIntosh blushed. \"Good and sweaty. Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got to work applebucking. Applejack stuck close to him. It was making Big Mac angry, although he kept his temper. What was up? She usually split up from him to cover more ground, but instead they were taking trees in pairs of two. He asked and Applejack said that Twilight suggested it might speed up their bucking if they coordinated well for it, and Applejack figured they might as well give it a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac couldn't care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally filled up two large carts of apples after dumping the last of their collecting bins into the carts and stepped back to look at it. Big Mac was shifting from one leg to another as he was uncomfortably aware of the weight and size of his balls, and this strange feeling of how empty they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, let's sift through them fer bad'uns,\" said Applejack from the other side of the first wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\" he muttered worriedly, but Applejack was already leaning over the side of her end and looking over the apples for bad ones. Big Mac gritted his teeth and did the same, and this position that was so similar to what he would use to mount a mare started getting his swollen shaft to become fully erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Celestia. Pardon my saying but please send some kind of sign to tell my sister to buck off.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breathing became heavy has he found himself unable to fully concentrate on the apples. He nosed them around, each pair of two he saw reminding him of his balls and how Carrot Top should have been fully converted into genetic goo inside his nuts already, if it hadn't been for Applejack and her good work ethic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya okay brother?\" Applejack asked, but Big Mac noticed she hadn't even looked away from her work and was still shifting apples around to toss away bad ones from the upper layers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac ignored her, feeling his shaft pressing up against the side of the wagon and oozing pre over it. He whimpered a little and tried to focus on his work, but Carrot Top's body bulging in his hefty dick kept surfacing... He wasn't even aware of what Applejack was saying anymore. She started talking about other business related matters while his mind wandered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his mind replaced Carrot Top with Applejack. His eyes widened suddenly as the mere thought had sent a pleasurable wave down his shaft. Dammit, that was exactly the sort of thing he wanted to avoid at all costs! Now his hungry dick was making him want it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother?\" he heard Applejack say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeyup?\" he asked, staring at the apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yer cock is outta the barn. Just sayin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and then to his left, seeing that Applejack had moved around the cart on some whim and could now see his erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" he shouted and turned his rear toward her and sat down, hiding his shaft. \"AJ! Gosh! Ah need to be left alone, can Ah please just go do mah thing? Ah'll help ya later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack giggled. \"Well gee brother were you seriously that itchin' for a fling that you can't even get it outta yer head when yer lil' sis is around? Ah've never even seen ya this mixed up. What did Carrot Top do or say to get ya all ruffled up so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the thing is...\" he began to say, but then he lurched forward. Very abruptly, his cock spasmed in pain, like pulling a muscle, and he cried out. His balls were suddenly very sore, like having blue balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother?\" Applejack asked with concern. She took a few steps forward. \"Something wrong there Big McIntosh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gahh all hell, its my cock, it hurts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack blanched. \"Wait, ya mean yer gettin' blue balls?

There was still a sign of unease in her face as she started to jack off her brother, but to Big Mac's surprise the sudden pleasure he felt was alleviating his hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh by Celestia AJ,\" Big Mac moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that huh?\" she asked and grinned uneasily. \"Don't tell me ya thought of this before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even once,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" she replied, a little put off. \"Well that's good... Ah guess.\" A brief moment passed with just Applejack's hooves moving up and down his cock and the big stallion grunting. She decided to kick things up more. She was getting a little light-headed from the musk coming off his member, and she was a little curious as to its taste. More than that, she was just beginning to relax and get into this. She opened her mouth and dragged her tongue lengthwise, firm and hard. Big Mac swore loudly, arching his back. Was it just because he was so hard? Was it because the taboo of his sister made it better? Why was this feeling so good?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister's behavior showed her inexperience, but as she started to experiment more her daring was driving Big Mac wild. She worked her tongue up to his tip and licked lightly just under the flattened head. His tip's shape became vaguely reminiscient of a mushroom as he flared up; Applejack began to nibble on the rim overhanging the rest of his shaft. Big Mac seethed. She didn't bite hard enough to hurt, just enough to add a new sort of feeling. She lowered his member and began to lick around the tip, gradually allowing more of the broadside of her tongue to rub along his engorged tip, closer and closer to his leaking, and ravenous cumslit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please don't eat her please don't eat her. Celestia this feels too good to end now!</i> His eyes watered as he considered that as this went on, his concerns turned away from her well-being and more towards his pleasure, but the tear streaming down his face was one borne from the increasing pleasure. Her tongue felt like fire on his tip, licking his nerve endings raw and making him want more. She engulfed the head, sucking it deep into her humid maw. She hummed around it, the vibration from her throat eliciting more pleasure from him. Her tongue worked the cum shaft, pressing his shaft into her soft and hard pallets. She experimented with her teeth, biting down on him lightly, experimenting with the resilience of his flesh. Big Mac seethed from pleasure, the deliberate and controlled use of her teeth adding contrasts that excited his nerves. But her teeth pulled away as she opened her jaw up a little more. She began to bob her head up and down the length of his dick she could fit into her mouth. The cooler outside air touched his meat with each slow movement of her head, only to return into the warmth and wetness of his sister's maw. She continued to hum around it in satisfaction of his flavor, each rumbling of her throat vibrating his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly thought how good this would be if he could experience more of it, more often. He knew she wasn't one for dating and yet she was sucking him off better than any of the mare's he'd tricked down his shaft yet. Sister or no, he could see himself falling for any mare who could blow like this. The problem was that he had resigned himself to never finding a mate, in the fear that he'd be unable to send her to his nuts someday. But damn, if he could get satisfied from this, maybe it would buy him an hour or two to find a proper meal and reconsider his morals...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or maybe I'll just go to hell</i> he thought bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closer he got to orgasm, the more his balls seemed to grumble in disatisfaction. It seemed like they didn't want to part with what little semen seemed to keep their hunger at bay. He was edging now. The pressure inside his loins was heavy and strong. He knew he wasn't going to last long, but didn't want to cum, in fear that feeling his semen gush into her might trigger his instincts to take over and devour her. He began to swear repeatedly, over and over, as his cock grew hotter and the flared tip grew fatter in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she pulled off of his dick and frowned, panting heavily for air. \"Jeez Big Mac this thing just doesn't wanna give in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac was panting furiously as well, half out of relief. \"Don't know what to tell ya,\" he said, in absence of anything else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll just have to get inventive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, Applejack had turned herself around and had lodged his thick shaft between her thick, bulging, toned buttocks. She was locking over her shoulders as she gave her rump a little wiggle, shaking his dick. She clenched her legs, tightening her hold of his cock between her buns and elicited a hump from Big McIntosh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no blowjob, but the mental feel of being between Applejack's buttcheeks overwhelmed him. He pressed his hooves on her cutie marks and began to ride her rump. Applejack laughed from his sudden enthusiasm. \"Yee haww big guy...!\" she said huskily and stuck her rump up a little higher so that he could hot-dog her more effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her voice set him off. \"AJaaaay!\" he howled and bucked faster, his rod filling with semen that erupted quickly from his tip and sprayed all over his sister, coating her back and hair and splashing into thick trails on the ground ahead of her. It lasted a lengthy thirty seconds before finally tapering off, the messiest orgasm he'd ever had pre-ingestion. Applejack was soaked with it, gobs of cum flowing over her shoulders to coat her flanks, both of the thigh and the true-flanks that were her ribs, and streams of it coated her legs as well. Applejack was breathing hard as well, and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well gosh Big Mac, Ah'd say that was a rousin' success, huh?\" She turned around and flipped her mane, gobs of semen flying off of it as she looked at him closely, head just inches above the still-erect member. \"Course, this will be our little secret right?\"</span></div></div>",

She looked at it, confused, but Big Mac didn't give enough time to see any sort of look of horror before thrusting once more and engulfing the entirety of his sisters head. His huge cock was not sufficiently big enough to hide the well-defined bulge of her head within his shaft. She was working her jaw, trying to talk, but couldn't. Big Mac closed his eyes, his primal urge to eat taking precidence, and yet, the second most thing that was driving him now was suddenly this knowledge that he was eating his sister, and <i>liking it!</i> He leaned his head back, enjoying the pleasure of the intense pressure on the inside of his cum shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah fuck AJ yer gonna be the best,\" he grunted as his flared tip suckled in an inch of her neck. He moved his hooves up to her ribs and braced her, now humping his sister rhythmically. Applejack's flesh entered his cock a fraction of an inch at a time. He could eat her faster than this, but he wanted to take his time. It was his sister--he should at least enjoy his last moments with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAir never seemed to be an issue with this process for some reason. Nonsense like that was beyond Big McIntosh's kenning, but he did know that with air not an issue his prey would have started struggling something fierce before this point. And his sister was fiercely strong herself. It might even be impossible to eat her, just plain impossible. Yet she was holding still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac stared at her head, wondering what was going through her head as his flared tip pressed against her shoulders and began to squeeze its hole over her shoulders. That seemed to call her to attention as she raised her hooves up to his dick and pressed them on his meat, attempting to pull herself out. Big Mac grunted in discomfort as this created a weird sucking sensation just head of her muzzle within his cock. He didn't like it very much. But she only tugged four times before she gave it up and let her hooves rest on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig McIntosh licked his lips, huffing. \"What's the matter? Getting eaten not a big problem for you?\" he asked. He guessed not. Her hips were beginning to wave back and forth, her tail twitching. If sucking him and grinding him hadn't gotten her wet, it smelled like she was becoming aroused now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mix of ambivalent emotions swirled in him, but the arousing knowledge that he was having the easiest meal of his life from the sister who had gotten him off so wonderfully was frothing ontop of those emotions. \"Yeah, let me take my time with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly got onto all four hooves, now straddling over his sister. He was still humping, but slowly and very weakly, letting the little flexes of his pleasured cock encourage a slow, but sure, eating. Applejack's forelegs were pressed against her ribs as his tip began to work over her legs and chest. Her back legs were bracing against the ground, giving him an easy time at finding purchase. Big McIntosh's eyes lowered and he dropped his head down to his sister's dock, kissing and licking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer sweet, Applejack. Ah really love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack's legs suddenly spread further apart and she pushed herself in slightly of her own accord. It really did seem that each and every possible inhibition imaginable had disappeared from his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup, thatta girl, let's make this one to never forget!\" he said excitedly. He smiled brightly and lifted his chin up skyward beginning to thrust much harder into his sister. Inch after inch rapidly disappeared into his tight shaft, her head reaching the base of his shaft and entering his body. His flared tip was now trying to work its way over her hips and haunches. Her hindlegs were lifted off the ground and Big Mac knew a change of position was necessary. He sat down, his cock sticking up. Applejack's cum-soaked tail slapped wetly against her rear and down the length of Big McIntosh's shaft as his pre added to the mess running down his sister. Her legs were wiggling and kicking as if something was tickling her. He nibbled and bit her rump as it disappeared down his cum slit, adding a tremendous bulge to his cock. Big Mac began to jerk himself off, focusing on the bulge of Applejack's rump. The motions of his hooves helped to ease Applejack down, and gravity didn't hurt either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going down rapidly, taking less than a minute for her legs to pass through his gaping cumslit. His swollen tip began to reduce to its original size while Applejack's hips, aided by the clopping Big Mac, were sucked into the base of his shaft. He could feel Applejack's face pressing against the inside of his left nut. She'd be completely covered in semen now, likely getting it in her mouth and nose. He felt her tongue rubbing along the inside of his ball, and Big McIntosh swore loudly from the pleasure of it. He fell onto his back and let the rest of his sister get pulled by the flexings of his dick, drawing out his meal's final descent a minute more than need be, before she finally was fully curled up inside his testicle. Her light motions and the satisfaction of having such an incredible meal caused his dick to erupt once more, splashing his chest and face in what semen still remained in his balls, which would soon be replenished as his starving scrotum spent the next few hours working Applejack painlessly down into thick, creamy horse semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh AJ Ah can't take it, Ah can't take it, that was too good, too good!\" he pines.</span></div></div>",

Even after succumbing to the one thing he wanted to prevent, all it did was do the opposite of what he usually intended it to do. Big Mac was hungry for more. He couldn't do the same to Apple Bloom. He needed to head for town and do a little hunting on the outskirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped and rubbed his testicle. \"Sorry AJ... I hope ya enjoy what happens next, 'cuz Ah need ya to break down fast.\" He slowly massaged his engorged nut, working in his semen into Applejack's fur. She was rubbing herself against the walls of her prison, and he could feel her shape becoming gradually homogeneous. \"That's right... That's right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac's dick throbbed. He still felt horny. Working his sister down into semen was getting him going again. Applejack's movements were beginning to lessen inside his nutsac. By Celestia, he could feel how creamy and smooth that jizz was going to be already. She was just about halfway gone now, hardly able to move inside her pool of cream. His balls were already beginning to exchange semen to balance each other out. Big Mac watched his nuts return to even shapes over the next several minutes. He rubbed both of them and leaned down as far as he could to pantomime a kiss for his sister. He wanted to save her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac got up and started off towards town. His engorged nuts swung and bounced off his legs as he walked. They were very large still, so he wasn't sure he could just walk around in the thick of Ponyville, at least, not while it was still so bright out. What was the best way to get a pony by itself this time of day, without going into town? Applejack's friends Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash didn't exactly live in the center of town. Or he could go eat a stranger he bumps into. Who knows, he might even run into Carrot Top.</span></div></div>",

While it seemed like a perfect idea to get Applejack and her friend Rainbow together, the more he thought about it, the more it seemed like it wouldn't work out.

That also didn't change the fact she was a fighter, and strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was just going to work out for the best. Big Mac gulped. He didn't want to do this. She was a really shy, dainty thing and he kinda had a soft spot for her. He didn't want to make her cry and scare her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trotted slowly to Fluttershy's cabin. He thought morbidly about how he was going to, for lack of a better word, kill Fluttershy in her own home. The thought made him hesitate, but then the burning in his loins, a twitch in his sheath, and a weird, gurgly feeling in his balls that felt like encouragement from Applejack herself, pushed his hooves forward again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knocked on the door. He waited, as he knew that Fluttershy was going to take her time opening the door.

She kept her eyes off of him only most of the time, always trying to sneak peaks at him at the slightest twitch of his head. They both had a lot to be nervous about, but he could tell, from experience with other mares, that this little pegasus was not altogether unhappy to see him. It was in the shift of her hip and in her legs. It was in the rise and fall of her chest. Her hair cupped around her face, obscuring her right eye partly. She was adorable and vulnerable. It made him desire her, both for sex and food, and it made him want her less. But the tingling in his loins could not be ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how the hell was he going to do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind Ms Shy,\" began Big Mac. \"Ah'd like to be invited inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're here to v-visit me?\" she gasped, taking a few steps back. \"But... um... eep!\" She hesitated, looking out of the corners of her eye for something. She mouthed something, but it contained two syllables with an emphasis on vowels, and he was pretty sure it was an okay. He stepped inside and shut the door with his rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac didn't want to resort to anything violent if he didn't have to, at least, not without the element of surprise. He decided to try and break the ice with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are yer animals doin'?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy scraped her hoof along the ground. \"... They're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't looking good. Big Mac wasn't a talker. Most of the time he let his prey open up to <i>him</i>. Two shy people had the danger of just not talking, at all, and build no trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yer not needin' any help?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind ran a blank. Now what? Fluttershy was beginning to give him a look like she was expecting him to say something. He couldn't think of anything good. \"Ah hope Ah'm not interruptin',\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not makin' ya uncomfortable in her own home am Ah?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked scared for a moment and shook her head faster. \"No...\" They were both quiet again.

Big Mac, would... would you like some tea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'd fancy that quite a bit, Ms Fluttershy,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy didn't move or change her face for a moment, but then a scant smile crept her face. It was gone in an instant as she turned, her large mane hiding her face. She went into the kitchen and set on a pot of water. She came back out and sat down on a floor mat. She looked at Big Mac and then gestured with her nose to an opposing mat. Big Mac walked over and sat down. Fluttershy was blushing much harder now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what brings you here?

Applejack wants me to get out more.\" Bic Mac closed his eyes, feeling the weight of his hefty balls. Fluttershy had not seen them yet despite their size. They were sitting slightly underneath Big Mac's large butt, and his hooves and legs kept his scrotum out of view. Big Mac concentrated on all the cum in them, and thought about that sensation that Applejack was still with him. How would she put this...? What would Applejack tell him to say, so that he could keep Fluttershy in the dark without outright lying to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe imagined it wasn't too far from the truth to say this, as it was something he was sure Applejack would have wanted eventually. \"Applejack wants me to have a dinner date with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy squeaked and covered her mouth with her hooves. \"Oh my!\" she said, and went quiet again. Then all at once she fidgeted and looked around wildly. \"But but, I don't know how to date other ponies, I don't even have anything here that would make a good dinner with, I was just going to have rice and turn in early... oh...\" She blushed and then settled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hope yer not too embarrassed,\" said Big Mac. \"Ah really didn't know how to come and do this all proper.

But he stopped at a bad time. That last sentence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy blushed very hard. \"She expects us to...?\" She squirmed uncomfortably. \"I'm sorry... Big McIntosh... I... I just can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac suddenly realized what was on her mind. \"Oh, no Ah didn't mean that specifically. She's expectin' us to have the dinner date no matter what is what Ah was gettin' at, but Ah'm havin' trouble figurin' out just what exactly mah sister wants. She's not exactly all there right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong with her?\" asked Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Suppose so but the way Ah see it, she's pretty content with herself,\" he said. \"But ye'll see later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um... okay,\" said Fluttershy. \"But why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps she's lookin' out for the both of us?\" said Bic McIntosh. \"Applejack talked a few times about how shy yer were, no offense. Ah like to think she wants what is best for both of us. Ah think Applejack worries you might have problems findin' romance by yerself even if she says yer the prettiest pony in the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was too bashful to take a compliment like that from his lips. But it seemed saying it from Applejack's perspective helped loosen the pegasus up. She smiled. \"Oh, wow, Applejack really said that? She really thinks I'm... a pretty pony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBic Mac nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Big McIntosh, do you think I'm a pretty pony too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"Probably would be a little less nervous myself if ye weren't gorgeous. Also nervous that Ah might make ya too nervous by being so forward, sister or no sister.  But Ah suppose she has her reasons fer wantin' me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tea whistled. Fluttershy went and fixed their cups, bringing them back along with the pot, all on a nice, wooden tray. She set the tray down between them and nosed Big Mac's cup  close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank ya kindly,\" he said. \"Err. Fluttershy. This was all kinda sudden and we're both embarrassed here, no use pretendin' neither of us are feelin' a little vulnerable here. For what it is worth, Ah think yer a lovely lady and a good filly whose feelings matter. What are yer feelings about having a little date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy took a sip of her tea and blushed. \"I know you're trying to not make me too scared... You're talking very, um, cautiously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac felt a nervous lump go into him. Fluttershy was a little more perceptive than he was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be really awkward for you too. And I think I know why Applejack wants you to date me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig McIntosh stared. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I can't believe I'm going to say this...\" she looked at him nervously. \"I... Kind of... like you. Already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac hesitated. \"Oh...\" Fluttershy flinched at his response. He tried to recover. \"Just surprised is all. Thought you'd be too busy to take a shine to anypony. Applejack is too busy to go lookin' fer dates, matter of fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy smiled. Big Mac smiled back. \"I'm sorry I'm not so interesting to talk to,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy shook her head. \"It's okay. You just don't want to upset me, and you don't know what to say. I don't really know what to say either. Rarity once tried to get me to go on a blind date, and it was just horrible! I guess this must sort of seem like the same thing for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" he said. \"Ah figure the number one thing to make a good date is fer one pony in the party to know how to not make things awkward. Ah dunno what you think, but as far as Ah'm concerned you've been pleasant and Ah'm just talkin' too much, probably cuz Ah don't do it enough to know when to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy giggled. \"Oh I know what you mean... well, not by experience, but there are sooo many times I just want to speak my mind and never, ever stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere. The ice was broken. There was still one problem, though.</span></div></div>",

I think... I think she knows that you were going to want to eat me. And she knew I like you. I get so scared and nervous around ponies I don't know, and I can only... only function around them if I don't think they're too interested in me. I just about want to die and disappear when a colt talks to me and... starts trying to sweet talk me. But I've always thought you were a good pony. Applejack talked about you, and I've never seen you do anything wrong. I just... assumed... that I could trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his body shiver. Oh Celestia, hearing that made him feel so sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I guess that is what a fantasy is,\" she said. \"The less you know about a pony, the more you can play pretend... I... really like fairy tales. So since you don't talk, I pretended that you were a really great and kind stallion. And the way Applejack talked about you, it just... made you seem that much more trustworthy. Somepony who wouldn't hurt me. Somepony I could invite in my house... somepony who could like me, without making me want to run away.\" She blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never ever wanted to talk to you,\" she said. \"Because... because... ... Applejack asked me why. And I said... that if Big Mac got to know... me deep inside... you'd not like me. I've got a lot of problems. I don't understand some of them. I can be really selfish sometimes, and sometimes I get really, really angry. I bottle it up a lot, but in my dreams I get angry and beat up ponies that I knew as a filly. I had these dreams when I was a filly too, so it was more personal back then. And I felt awful for it. So I started fantasizing of things that I deserved as punishment... I know that sounds really bad; it did not last long... That's... because one of the things I thought of in the first two weeks of punishing myself in my mind... was being swallowed whole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath. \"And it didn't work. I... ended up liking it. Bad Fluttershy, you can't hurt other ponies, into the dragon's tummy you go! And I liked it! It's a big reason I'm afraid of dragons... I can't think of those big, scary dragons with their big mouths and not think about how they could eat me, and that somehow makes them just as bad as a stallion who wants to date me. And then it got worse as I got older, and learned about... s-s-s-sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac stared. \"Then you thought about being eaten by a cock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" gasped Fluttershy. \"It rushed at me all at once. I was reading my textbook, and there was this little, not very detailed picture of a stallion's cock... and it looks like a snake... and then... and then...\" She hung her head. \"And it just got me so hard. I've... almost been addicted to it ever since. Sometimes I couldn't even go a single day without thinking about it. And I told all of this to Applejack. And that was why, I thought, Big McIntosh, the pony I thought who could be my... little private knight in shining armor... would never, ever, like a disgusting little pony like me. Applejack tried to make me feel better. She said that the fantasy didn't sound too horrible. She said it sounded almost kind of fun. Oh but I didn't believe her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig McIntosh bit his lip, blood starting to rush into his cock. <i>Holy shit. Is that why AJ let me eat her with my cock? Was she already into it?</i> The thought was distracting him from Fluttershy. It just made the fact he devoured Applejack and fulfilled his sister's own little fantasy that much hotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy looked up. \"So Applejack is trying to get me to live my fantasy. Both of them at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't ya horrified that Ah've been eatin' ponies before now though?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy bit her lip. \"Yes, but... there's that... meanie Fluttershy who is... is... mad at the world and is glad you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah see,\" he said. \"So... how do you feel about me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know,\" said Fluttershy. \"You still seem really sweet. And I believe you when you said you have to do this. Um... why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... begins to really hurt...\" he said. \"If'n Ah get hungry, and ignore it, the pain gets intolerable. And then Ah stop thinkin'. And if Ah choose who to eat, then mah cock won't choose fer me, and choose somepony like Apple Bloom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy smiled. \"Oh Big Mac I knew you were a good pony at heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm not convinced,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am...\" said Fluttershy. She blushed and folded her wings around herself, turning her face while still staring at him. \"And I'd... be so happy, to let you get what you need from me. Even if it only satisfies you for a little while... Even if so many other ponies disappear into you after me... I want to know I helped you protect Apple Bloom.\" She stepped forward on her hooves. \"And I want to know that I... was adored by such a big, handsome stallion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffled and started blinking a lot, a few tears dribbling from her eyes. Big McIntosh was sure Fluttershy was right and there was inherently something wrong with her, but since there was something wrong with him too, it probably wasn't that strange for her to like him... and for him to really like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeyup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy gave a little squeak and whispered, \"Yay,\" under her breath. \"Big Mac...

It would be Fluttershy's first and last time so he should play it safe to make sure they both enjoy it. He leaned in to Fluttershy for a passionate kiss, slipping his tongue into her mouth. Despite her shyness, Fluttershy eagerly let her own tongue dance with Big Macintosh's, letting him explore her mouth. After a few minutes they broke the kiss and stared in each others eyes. Big Macintosh looked for hints of doubt and fear in her eyes but Fluttershy was absolutely sure about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Macintosh now went behind Fluttershy, who lowered her forelegs and spread her legs more. As Big Macintosh was now behind her, he got a very good view of her glistening pussy, which was slightly parted. Even his cock seemed to sense what they both wanted and stopped it's snapping motions, instead getting ready to penetrate this mare. Carefully, Big Macintosh guided his cock towards the wet vulva, also standing with spread legs now and letting his weighty balls dangle underneath him. Fluttershy gasped in surprise as he reared up on his hind legs and mounted her but she was also excited about what's to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Big Macintosh inserted his ravenous cock into the mare below him. A few tears escaped her eyes as she never had something this big inside of her. Still, despite the pain she was feeling overwhelming pleasure as the stallion pushed himself inside until his large, distended balls touched her thighs. After he pushed his entire lenght into her he remained in this position to give Fluttershy time to adjust. The pegasus mare was breathing harder and faster now, after a while she turned her head to him and nodded, giving Big Macintosh the signal to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly at first, he started to pull out and pump in again, steadily becoming faster. With every thrust, Fluttershy started to moan and gasp louder, lost in the feeling of pleasure. After building up a good rhythm, Big Macintosh now plunged his cock into Fluttershy's vagina fast and hard with every buck of his hips. It was difficult for him to keep so much seed contained within himself, he knew he couldn't hold back much longer. Luckily, Fluttershy's labia started to clench the invading cock tightly, indicating that she was close to her own orgasm. \"Mac, so close, I want your seed!\" With a final yell, she came and covered Big Macintosh's loins in her honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Fluttershy's orgasm came, Big Macintosh no longer held back. With great pressure, gallons of cum started to shoot out of his cock, filling Fluttershy to the brim. The mare gasped as she felt her womb distending from the huge amounts of cum, a large puddle already forming underneath them from the overflow. She almost cried as her belly distended with Big Macintoshs seed but the thought that all of this once used to be Applejack aroused her. Finally the torrent subsided and Big Macintoshs orgasm ended. Completely exhausted, Big Macintosh pulled his cock out of Fluttershy's vagina and let himself plop down on his haunches while she fell to her side, panting while more cum flowed out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they recovered, Big Macintoshs cock continued with it's snapping motions, indicating that it was time to get another pony inside. Fluttershy looked back and nodded to him. \"It's okay, that's what I agreed to anyway, you can make me a meal for your cock anytime.\" To reassure him, she gave a small smile. </span></div></div>",

He let go and whispered into her ear; \"Ah want to do everything we can think of to you, Fluttershy. You're my cock food now, but Ah love ya. Ah wanna use ye like a sex toy, and make love to you like my sweetheart. Ah want to take you totally, and then take you in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy's cheeks became wet with tears, and the smell from her loins intensified. It made the strong stallion snort in her face, and she pushed her face into his breath and shivered. \"Big Maaac!\" she whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig McIntosh side stepped over the little pegasus, his engorged cock lay against Fluttershy's back, soaking its warmth into her spine. She started to pant hard. He stepped forward and pushed his balls against her snatch. It was hot and wet... she was already penetrable. He snorted, his cock hardening swiftly. He shuffled off of her a little, pulling back, lifting his hips up to point his dick at her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is as good a place to start as any,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please...\" gasped Fluttershy. \"I just... hope you'll have the energy to try me in more ways...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer rump?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned. He pressed his tip to her snatch, the hungry cock's snapping motions nipped at her clitoris and pinched it before soaking it in pre. Fluttershy stuck her ass up and cried out, the pleasure blinding her from the strange sensation and the question of how it happened. He pulled his biting slit away from her clit and pushed the engorged, flared tip against her vulva. He wiggled it around playfully, smearing her own honey along her body. He loved the warmth he was already feeling from her. Fluttershy's thighs were twitching. She was desperate for him, and she felt so empty. Her tight tunnel clenched on itself and even squeezing on air was pleasurable for the desperate filly. Big Mac snorted onto her head and neck, his breath shocking her. Finally, he entered her. The fattened tip connected with her sensitive flesh, pushing it in. The flesh funneled around her small vaginal hole, forcing it to slowly open, stretching it wider and wider. Fluttershy's mouth hung open, the pain she was feeling was a part of her pleasure, and she couldn't begin to imagine willing it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she panted. \"Please...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac didn't want to hurt her, but it didn't seem like he really was despite his size, and then pushed hard. His fat, broad tip forced her vaginal entrance wide enough to slip over him, burying him in heat and tightness and making his eyes clench. Fluttershy seethed, the stinging in her loins mixed with this ineffable sense of fullness. The pleasure shot through her and made her ears hot, her clitoris sensitive to even the slightest nudge of the wind, and the little nipples tucked neatly between her thighs tingle. There was pain and pleasure, and it made her want to <i>fuck</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy humped. Big Mac met it and slipped four inches of the nearly leg-thick appendage into her. Her vagina bit down on it, unwilling to let even a centimeter go. Big Mac seethed, the tightness and heat filling his rod. He tried to pull out, and met fierce resistance. He tried to push in, and the muscles relaxed, but only slightly. Even pushing hard, Fluttershy was too tight to slip into very fast. The panting pegasus then thrust backwards, and suddenly it felt like she was a lot wetter, slicker. He slipped another four inches into her easily before she clenched again and it returned to that baking hot vice grip that was so hard to move inside of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh consarn it let me go,\" he panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being assertive...\" Fluttershy whispered. He almost didn't even catch it. She held her breath and thrust her hip back, like she was trying to knock him off of her completely. Her thick butt slammed into his thighs as her cock swallowed him to the hilt. She let out a loud \"Hmph!\" during the motion, and Big Mac arched his back and rolled his eyes as he felt all of that pegasus's pussy on his stallionhood at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh Celestia...\" he swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was squeezing him, panting with each little clench. It was like she was chewing his dick, playfully experimenting with the resilience of his large cock. And for all its size... the shy, socially awkward, inexperienced pony was using it like a chew toy within her own virgin pussy. It was like an insulting loss of control, and it both turned him on and made him all the more eager to eventually shove that pink and yellow filly straight down his cum shaft to bucking drown in thick horse semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do me, do me!\" Fluttershy panted, spreading her legs further. The butterflies on her thigh trembled as her muscles spasmed with desperation. The size in her alone was not enough. \"I want Applejack inside me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig McIntosh clenched his eyes and began to ride her hard and fast. The pussy was now eagerly allowing motion within itself. He pulled his hips as far back as they could go before slamming back into Fluttershy's body. The muscles within gave little squeezes with each thrust. HIs cock glistened every time it pulled out of her. Every thrust into her brought his engorged balls against her legs, threatening to knock her off balance. More than just a few times, their love making caused the tiny mare to scoot forward, with the stallion following behind her, constantly pistoning out of her. They slowly scooted around the room from this, leaving a thick trail of pre mixed with honey as it leaked out of Fluttershy's snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was feeling so much, her mind like cotton. Her nipples felt like bullets. Her stomach hurt and her insides felt so sore from the large shaft ramming into her. It was making her need to pee. She would have to hold it. In these wild, last moments of her life there was a lot she'd be open to, but she needed to pace herself, no matter what would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held on. Big Mac held onto her. He licked her neck, his tongue feeling like bliss on her sensitive flesh. She gave high pitched, breathy pants as he worked her pussy. Both of them were feeling a large pressure in their loins. Big Mac reached a high point a little while ago and was edging on it. Fluttershy's was still mounting, but she knew she wouldn't be able to resist it for long before her dams broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to come...\" Fluttershy sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'll try and be a gentlecolt and let you out first,\" he huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drooled and nodded her head up and down. He bit into her ear again, picking up his tempo. Fluttershy's insides felt sore, but right on the walls of her pussy the pleasure was too much for her to bear. \"Big Mac,\" she whispered, and then shouted it, loudly, enough to startle Big Mac and make him stop mid-thrust. But before he could move again, the desperate Fluttershy's walls crushed down over him with numbing tightness. The muscle at the back oozed with hot, sticky femme-cum, filling the rest of the chamber and pushing it against Big Mac's tip. The slit began to swallow up Fluttershy's cum, sucking it down and lubricating his urethra. Fluttershy's muscles relaxed just a little bit to let the pressurized honey flood down, covering his dick in hot and wet. That was too much for the stallion and he reared up as he felt the first long, thick rope of cum rocket up his shaft and shoot deeply into Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus pony had been unable to even think, all her mind a white noise as the intense orgasm she felt took all her body and made the skin as sensitive as her clit, her joints feeling light. All the physical tension in her was gone and she felt like nothing but cloud, cloud with a hot dick inside it that just pushed a rope of cum inside the cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a mental flag went off in her. <i>You're being cummed into</i>, read the flag and a sensation that was not quite in equine language rammed through her instincts, and the best her waking mind could translate the subconscious thought was <i>FUCK YES</i>. An intense satisfaction washed over her. Hot, sticky semen sprayed hard against her cervix, washing over her g-spot that was tucked just a little lower where the straight equine cock could have only rubbed over it with its flared shape. And then the second sticky rope hit, and Fluttershy clenched her eyes up tight and wailed with ecstasy. It immediately made her orgasm drag itself out, every intense feeling living on so long as Big McIntosh was cumming inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he had so much cum to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion thrust forward, slipping easily on their mixed juices and hitting her cervix hard. The muscle gave way, which should have been extraordinarily painful, but in her bliss her body was somehow numb. He gushed his semen directly into her womb, and it began to fill and fill. Emptying his balls was slow going, but her womb was bloated fast, and began to push down between her thighs in a few moments. The bulge made her look like she was entering her second trimester before his orgasm finally tapered off. He gave a few extra squirts into her, and then pulled his shaft out, carrying with it a flood of semen that had been trapped between their two sexes, and as her cervix took a moment to close off. Panting and licking his lips, Big McIntosh rubbed his still hard cock between her buns, hot dogging her. His slimy penis coated her cheeks and anus in semen, lubricating them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Big Mac sat down, making Fluttershy sit with him, wresting her thighs on his still engorged testicles. His cock was firmly nestled between her buttcheeks. She looked over her shoulders at him, drooling. \"Big Mac?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These buns are so hot...\" he said and closed his eyes. He loved Fluttershy, but that moment with his sister was still too fresh for him to let up. He pictured the thick, strong orange cheeks again and planted the apple cutie mark on each one, and began to push his meet between her buns. He was distracted by Fluttershy's super soft tail hair. It felt so silky as his moving cock brushed against it. It felt amazing. Finally he settled on seeing AJ's ass cradling his member with Fluttershy's tail planted on her butt. He huffed as he rode those cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really love them...!\" Fluttershy gasped. Her libido wouldn't surrender after one orgasm, and finding Big Mac lusting for the ass cheeks that he planned on turning into semen made her buns own sensitivity inflate on just her will. It suddenly felt incredible. She had no idea having something between her cheeks without any other stimulation could be so... stimulating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh AJ, sister your ass is so tight.</i> He thought, pre pouring from his tip. He opened his eyes and stared at the reality of Fluttershy's rump, and then smiled. He was going to need to do this again someday to another girl, and pretend it was Fluttershy's ass as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis pony was not nearly as in shape as AJ had been. Her ass wasn't as tight and strong, but it was bigger, and so damn soft. It squeezed around his dick so well that he could barely see his cock between the crack while his hooves pressed the cheeks together. Her rump was so warm. He rode her ass a little while longer, until his pre had completely soaked her tail and made it mat against his dick. He licked his lips and pulled out of her cheeks, pushing her rump up. He used a hoof to press his dick into the direction of her anus, positioning Fluttershy into a sitting position with her pucker pressing against his tip. Her tail was still matted against his dick as he started to sit her down, his throbbing shaft pushing her own silky soft tail into her body. He arched his back, the hotness of her core and the entirely different texture of the less-tight, but soft rectum and colon pleasured him--and it mixed well with the silky feeling of her tail. He was going to be able to thrust in and out of her ass while feeling that soft hair on his member all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy coughed as she felt the large member intrude on her colon. It was a lot to take in and she felt so full, in an entirely different way. There was a different sort of satisfaction to it. It felt painful and intrusive, but once Big Mac was half way in, he paused to let her get used to it. That feeling of fullness and wanting to gently push it out set in, and that feeling began to become pleasurable as well. She made an mmm and wiggled her rump, squeezing on his length with her anus. Her insides felt nervous, a kind of paranoia for their own wellbeing getting in the way of her pleasure, but she forced it aside... she knew that Big Mac would be as gentle as needed... and as rough as she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat herself down after that, her ass swallowing up his cock until her butt cheeks got in the way. Big Mac trembled from feeling so much pony ass undulating around his meat. It was right there, his eyes looking down at the pony rump that had devoured his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww Celestia Fluttershy,\" he gasped to her. Her face turned and smiled sweetly, face half obscured by a curtain of pink. She closed her eyes and lifted herself up. Her ass descended down over him. He squirted pre into her, the little squirt sending a shiver through Fluttershy. He placed his hooves on her rump and helped her ride his shaft. The feeling of fucking her rump was not as intense as her pussy, but the contrast felt so great. He secretly wished he could have felt this close to Applejack before having devoured her, but he'd never forget the feel of her mouth and the tightness of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued the anal at a slow and steady pace for a while longer, but then Fluttershy started leaning forward more and more, and Big McIntosh followed after her, returning to a more traditional position, save for the huge pony dick lodged up Fluttershy's rump. She shook it for him, and then he continued to pound into her. His excessive pre began to back up over his dick and dribble through her anus, lubricating the hole so that he could start screwing her ass harder. Fluttershy felt so little discomfort now, her anus accepting its role as a mere sex toy for her stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so full,\" she whimpered, a little drool coming out of her mouth. \"Your pre is filling me up like a balloon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save room for Applejack,\" said Big Mac, snorting into the pegasus's ear and making her shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your cock swallowed up your own sister...\" she panted. \"It ate my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup, and she's going to get squirted up your ass, right before this cock eats you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuck Big Mac!\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't think he'd have to wait long. His cock felt really sensitive and his under belly was growing tight again. He bared his teeth and snorted, thrusting into her as hard as he could. He pushed through her thick cheeks, hilting himself. His shaft was engorged with semen, the cum shaft stretching out the bottom of Fluttershy's anus into a slightly oval shape. Thick spunk poured out of him, filling Fluttershy's insides. She moaned as she felt Applejack's digested body shoot up into her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm going to become that, I'm going to become cum!</i> she thought passionately. Big Mac sensed her needs, and wrapped his foreleg around her chest and nipped at her cheek with his lips. Her face turned to meet his as their lips touched, sealed, and opened. Big Mac's tongue invaded hers first, and her tentatively moved in to play with the underside of his broad tongue. He bucked roughly into her ass randomly, pausing for a few moments before slamming into her again, cumming all the while. Even after he finished filling Fluttershy up with Applejack semen and was ready to pull out, he kept kissing the pegasus and robbing her of her breath. Her sex-ravaged body was desperate for air, and she kept gasping through the kiss as Big Mac fought against her for her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he broke away and pulled his dick out of her, most of her tail coming out with it and only slipping away from his member as he walked around to her front. Some of Fluttershy's tail was still stuck inside her gaping, well-pleasured hole, dripping a slightly orange tinted semen out of it. Fluttershy was still trying to catch her breath. Big Mac licked her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" he asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she settled down, the trauma that had been applied to her began to catch up with her, and all the shaking around had irritated her bladder. Oh she needed to pee now, and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Mac...\" she sighed. \"I... need to go... pee I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nibbled her neck. \"Need a break huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... yes, maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her and considered this. \"You don't want to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... do,\" she muttered, but there was still something about her hesitation that hinted more than she was letting on. He didn't think it was just she wanted to hold it to keep playing around either. He chuckled and stepped over her body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So having sex makes you need to pee?\" he taunted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes!\" she squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac backed up again and pressed his cock against her loins. He placed the tip on her urethra and pressed. Fluttershy groaned and whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Mac stop...!\" she huffed with an unconvincing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll stop,\" he said. \"With that anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slipped the head lower and inserted himself into her still cum drenched pussy. He slided into her, stretching her out all over again, then pushed down on his dick, created an incline. He pushed her pussy down on her urethra. \"How's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no please...!\" she moaned, tongue hanging out. \"Big Maaac...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cried as she felt her bladder release. This was something she'd never practiced save as a child, peeing in an inappropriate place while letting it slash onto her hoof. Her mom would get so angry to find Fluttershy doing something so naughty in the sink or on the table... Big Mac felt her pee splashing against his testicles, washing over them with its warmth and dripping onto the floor in copious amounts. She suddenly grew tighter and wetter, and her breathing was harder. She was enjoying it. He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started rocking into her again, pushing down with every thrust going into her, slightly pinching off her stream before letting it continue as he pulled his dick upwards while pulling out. In and out, up and down, he pleasured her pussy while her pee spread a puddle onto the floor. Fluttershy ducked her head between her legs to watch her own golden stream pouring on the floor. It twinkled slightly, and was only faintly yellow. She had been well hydrated that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhnnng!\" she huffed and felt her bladder start to give a little bit more, encouraged by Big Mac's dick and her own release of inhibitions. Her poor floor was getting filty, but she wouldn't need her floor soon once she was tucked away in Big Mac's balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare's bladder was fuller than she thought, and her equine nature necessitated long releases, but even so it could not last forever, and after the pool had spread quite far around the two of them, with Fluttershy able to see her own reflection as the pool spread ahead of her, she finally started to run dry, just a few drops pouring out of her and dripping off of her loins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac started up again, slamming hard and fast into her body. Fluttershy shut her eyes, feeling his pee soaked balls hitting her legs. The physical and mental satisfaction of her inappropriate behavior spurted her quickly into an orgasm and Big Mac once again felt that crushing weight on his penis and the hot rush of mare cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you're a dirty mare aren't you?\" he huffed in her ear, and Fluttershy nodded her head feverishly. \"You should clean me up...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac figured what she meant and that she wanted a little more of that same play, but from him.</span></div></div>",

She watched his dick sway as he walked around ahead of hers. Her eyes watched his balls excitedly, anticipating her end inside them. He sat down and tucked his large orbs between his legs, his dick pointed at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it hungry?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup, but first we gotta clean ya off, like ya said,\" he grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gaped, disbelief and excitement washing over her. She caught the sudden increase in size of his urethra just in time to shut her mouth and face. A very thick stream of amber poured from his shaft and splashed onto her face. A musky, thick scent filled the air, so unlike her own pee and more masculine, but just as strong was the unexpected scent of apples. She lifted her chin over the stream and opened her dripping eyes, looking at the spraying shaft. His pee frothed up as it struck her, creating a foam that washed over the floor like beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Maaac...\" she sighed and walked forward, pressing her head against his chest while he peed on her chest and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wash up,\" he said and gently nudged her with his hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes...\" she huffed and shifted around, pointing her ass at his gushing cock and let the cider colored pee splash against her. It continued to foam on her, thick suds falling off of her rump and dripping down what of her tail was still not stuck in her pucker. She swayed her hips, feeling a little of it trickle in between her labia. She turned to both sides, getting her flanks and spreading each wing in front of the stream before turning to let it spray over her face. She was still not so adventurous as to dare a taste, unsure if the flavor would be like cider, beer, or something less appetizing. She was not very fond of the taste of beer either, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the floor in this room was covered in thick foam now. Big Mac had helped Fluttershy to make quite a mess of things, and his large stallion bladder was only now trickling off. However, his erection still had to twitch and gush out a few more squirts into the filthy-minded pegasus's face and hair. He sighed as he finally felt satisfied, and despite this never being a thing he'd considered before, he had rather enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soaking wet Fluttershy batted her wet eye lashes at him. \"Am I all better now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look pretty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty as a princess,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I ready to be cock food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cock slit snapped at her hair, making her eep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah think yer long due to get devoured whole and kicking by my shaft,\" he said. \"Now come feed yer beautiful, pee-soaked pegasus ass to my bucking cock!\"</span></div></div>",

It snapped at her, Fluttershy pulling her face away from it, then moving in closer. She gave it a firm lick around the tip skirting around Big Mac's cum slit. He groaned from the pleasure. His balls grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cock slit opened up on its own, oozing a large bead of pre. Fluttershy stared into it with a half-lidded, loving expression. Lust and desire was on her face as her mouth hung open wide, her tongue lolling and drooling as her eyes searched for every little detail she could see as she stared down the stallion's dick. She leaned in, dragging her tongue slowly over the hole, and just as she was about to leave the slit snapped forward and bit onto her tongue. Fluttershy eeped and shivered. She pushed her muzzle into the slit and felt Big McIntosh's salty pre push up over her muzzle and glisten in front of her eyes. She gave Big McIntosh one last look into her eyes before the cock pulled tight and lurched forward with another snapping motion, closing tightly over the pegasus's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasure roared through Big Mac. That beautiful mare whom he had connected with so well in just the last two hours was now going to disappear from his life and become just a near-useless wad of cum... near useless because there was very little chance it was going to be put towards seeding a mare with foals. If he didn't jerk off and cum the pegasus he'd fallen in love with and spraying her over the walls (or maybe even down her own plumbing if he got into an interesting mood), then the next mare he pumped Fluttershy into would certainly be his next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doubted any of the above would upset Fluttershy. With her secret but perverted mind, having her body wasted for his sexual satisfaction for just a brief instant would likely excite her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah can't wait to make you into cum,\" he said to her. She shivered in her prison. He laughed and licked her neck. \"In ya go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe humped forward, her neck vanishing into his cock and engorging it. His balls grumbled again, begging for horse flesh. Fluttershy flapped her wings, lifting herself up and pushing her own shoulders into the slit. Big Mac moaned out in pleasure. He swore loudly as he got up onto his hooves. He inched forward as he humped against the pegasus, soon pinning her forelegs and her wings against her body. His cock slurped loudly over her as the pegasus fought for room inside his dick, her competitor being the pre going in the opposite direction. His shaft neared the small of her back while her nose poked into Big Mac's hips. The well-defined bulge in his cock was disappearing into his nutsack, her head pushing his crotch out while it slipped from his cock to his scrotum. His flared tip was working over her sexy cutie marks while Fluttershy got a mouthful of Applejack as her face budged its way into his testicle. His cock slurped on Fluttershy, dragging her legs off the ground. He continued to hump, bouncing up and down and making his cock slam against his belly. Inch by inch, the cock pulled Fluttershy's legs into itself. Her cutie marks were long since gone, and then at last her hooves slipped into the cum slit with a pop, followed by a steady ooze of pre. Big Mac looked down and watched as the beautiful pegasus's well-fucked rear made its way down his shaft and then into his nuts, soon followed by her hind legs. She was fully sequestered into a tightly fitted ball, her fur saturated with the last of the semen that had been his sister, apple bucking with Big McIntosh during lunch time and sifting apples with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked his lips. It was an amazing day. And now he had a new pony to cherish as she became semen for him to use recklessly. Beautiful, lovely Fluttershy, sweet and kind and good with animals, soon to be semen that would be put to less practical worth than chicken feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, unbelieving of how hot this was to him, the cruelty. \"Fluttershy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Ah turn you to come...\" And then he explained all the things he could think to do with her, to waste her sacrifice of life just to jerk off. He told her how he could spray her onto this piss-soaked floor, or onto the walls, or into the yard with the trees she loved... or he could take a bath in her tub, jerk off into the water, and watch her go down the drains. He could get off into her toilet and flush her away... or find one of her friends and have an affair with them and fill their body with his cream before taking them the same way she disappeared. And he felt her touching herself as he told her. She was rubbing her hoof against her crotch while he spoke of this perversion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Mac I love you...!\" she wailed, and Big Mac could only figure she was cumming. A surge of affection flooded through him. This mare, who would love for him to cum her down a toilet...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh hay, why did he have to fall that much in love with her after she had already slipped inside?! His massive hooves gently cradled her tightly packed form, feeling her up. He could feel her squirming in there, nuzzling into his touch as he continued to slowly clop off. He- he couldn't do this to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, Big Macintosh, cum me! Paint me on my walls!\" Already, he could feel her softening at his touch, shrinking a little.  He had to act if he wanted to see her as more than a white smear again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farm stallion grunted, huffing as he began to roughly jerk his member, stimulating himself back to the absolute stiffest that he could manage. He could feel Fluttershy getting compressed, squishing and getting turned around in his nut as he clopped hard enough to slap his massive sack against his legs. Every grunt was a struggle, every slip of his hooves against his cum and piss slicked member was a fight to squeeze the mare he had so unexpectedly fallen in love with out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Macintosh! Stop! I want to be cum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Ah NEED YOU!\" Big Macintosh kept at it, feeling his dick rubbing raw as a pulse ran down his member. It was happening, come on! A spray of pre painted his chest once more as he squeezed it out, a lump developed at the base of his shaft as he felt his prize move. Vibrations ran down his uthera, the sound of Fluttershy's squeaks shaking his flesh and hastening her ejection.  Macintosh closed his eyes as he rolled onto his back, thinking of his sister, thinking of all the mares he downed, trying to keep hard and cumming to give Fluttershy a fighting chance to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uncomfortable bulge moved higher, the bulge of her head passing the medial ring on his dick as she was squeezed out. Big Macintosh built lewd fantasies in his mind to keep it up. He thought of Fluttershy knocked up with his sister, of the mare taking baths in oozing bathtubfulls of his cum that he sprayed just for her, rising up covered in thick white coats of it. He thought of being tender with her, taking her out to the forest for mad kinky sex in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA keen squeal filled his ears, and he clenched with his dick harder, squeezing upwards trying to press the mare in it out. His lewd little pegasus's gasp for air filled the air as her head pushed free, her features indistinct under the clinging layer of cum that covered it. He couldn't stop, he had to keep pressing her out. Ripples of muscle movements rolled down his uthera as she was pressed free; the faint feel of something thick and wet brushing across his chest and neck distracting him as he concentrated on filling Fluttershy up with converted mares over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Macintosh! Push me back! I don't want to waa--aaahh!\" Fluttershy's wet and sticky form splattered across his face as he finally properly came, spraying her up in a heap to lay stickily over his face in a throbbing, aching, jerkng rush of motion. The stallion could feel what felt like smooth skin, her fur long since ate away by his transformitive cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft and partially transformed mare scrambled back to her hooves, trying to lick his dick as it shrank from having spent it's energy in Macintosh's final climax. The farmstallion opened his eyes once more, seeing Fluttershy's completely coated form glistening in the light, still covered with cum straight from the depths of his balls. Oh buck! He had to wash her off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mere! Yer gonna need another bath!\" Macintosh nickered and nipped at Fluttershy's neck, grabbing her by the scruff of skin there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Macintosh, take me back! I'm just a dirty little pegasus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah need you as more than cum, and if Ah don't get ya washed off right now, yer gonna melt just like if ya had been in mah sack. Ah need ya! Yer such a sweet, dirty little pegasus. Ah wish Ah had found this side of ya earlier, so willing to accept mahself, flaws, cock and all. Ah NEED YOU, not a load.\"</span></div></div>",

To be honest, I think if we both weren't the way we are, Ah would've been glad to be the shining stallion ya dreamed Ah was,\" Big Macintosh admitted, though he couldn't keep from blushing a bit. He wasn't used to feeling like this after all, and he was more than a bit shy when it came to being himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Big Mac, you're such a sweet stallion,\" Fluttershy said tenderly from within his nuts, and it sounded like she might be getting teary-eyed in there, \"I wish things had been different too...though I think this is just as good. I know we both enjoyed our little \"date\" earlier, and I'm loving it in here...so warm and tight, but soft too...\" Fluttershy trailed off there, and Big Mac could feel her working herself toward another orgasm. He could picture her rubbing at her burning pussy, her hoof maybe flicking at her engorged clitoris. The mental image of Fluttershy masturbating again, and the fact she was <i>inside</i> him while doing it, made him snort with arousal and his hard cock gave a sharp jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly grinned as he decided to \"help\" Fluttershy with that orgasm, putting on a teasing tone as he spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer such a dirty little pegasus, wanting to be nothing but a cumstain,\" Big Mac said, finding the bulge of what he hoped was Fluttershy's head in his balls and resting his hoof on it, \"Yer gettin' off on the fact that you'll just be a big hot and sticky load for me to shoot out 'a' my cock soon, and that the cum yer sittin' in used to be yer friend Applejack?\" He asked rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...YES...<i>YEEESS</i>!!\" Fluttershy screamed out, the sound loud enough to make Big Mac's nerves vibrate, while she returned Big Mac's touch by rubbing her head against his hoof through his balls. \"I'm just a naughty and angry little pegasus, who's now nothing but <i>cockfood</i>! Just like Applejack was before you <i>fucked</i> her into me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed his \"help\" had worked like a charm, because he felt Fluttershy tense hard inside him and then relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling, Big Mac found himself staring out the window and pondering the day's events again. He had had his newest cockmeal yanked away from him by his sister, all due to her ignorance of his real problem. Then his sister had thought he was getting blue balls when the inevitable hunger had reared up and had gotten him off better than he'd ever been before, only for him lose control of himself and eat her instead. Yet to his surprise the both of them had enjoyed it more than he <i>ever</i> could've imagined. Then, that had led to him <i>choosing</i> to hunt down and eat one of her best friends when she for some reason hadn't quelled his balls relentless hunger, and it had even been the one out of them all he thought would be the <i>most</i> against it, yet to his further surprise she had been having fantasies of him being some kind of perfect stallion <i>and</i> of being eaten by a cock for most of her life (and possibly had given a bit of those fantasies to his sister...). Big Mac shook his head in disbelief, what a strange yet enjoyable day it had been. Everything that he would've thought would be the worst and most awful way for his cock's needs to go had ended up so strangely right. He had shared a strange but admittedly emotionally intimate moment with his beloved little sis, and now he had a pegasus who had loved him from afar and instead of being repulsed by his dark secret had welcomed it with open hooves in his ballsack, soon to be turned into cum for him to shoot out where he pleased. All of this might've been crazy and honestly unbelievable, but it almost made him...feel better about himself, pony-eating cock and all. Part of him still felt terribly guilty and conflicted, after all, everypony else he had eaten before had been just as scared and upset as he had expected, but part of him (which he <i>hoped</i> wasn't just his hungry cock and balls) was starting to see himself a bit more...charitably. It wasn't like he had asked to be this way after all, and he had never had it in him to just, well, <i>end</i> it all. Maybe he should stop being so hard on himself, he was only a simple pony after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac's thoughts were interrupted by a grumble from his balls, signaling digestion was about to begin. Since they seemed satisfied with Fluttershy now, he had no reason to hurry it along like he had with Applejack, so he supposed he still had time to say a couple things to Fluttershy before she became spunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo no surprise, Fluttershy had heard  that, and he was sure she could feel his nuts beginning to gently knead and churn his pony-melting cum into her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Mac? Is it starting? Am I becoming your cum?\" Fluttershy asked breathlessly, a mix of anxiety and eagerness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup, and before yer gone, Ah got some things to say...\" Big Macintosh said seriously, moving back to the mat he had sat on earlier and sitting so that his Fluttershy-filled balls rested comfortably between his legs. He was glad that their urine-play had been in a spot further away from the mats, sitting on a wet mat would not have been pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what is it?\" Fluttershy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, I might be unsure of what you said about me being a good pony, 'cause of Apple Bloom and all, but I jest want ya to know that I think yer a good pony too Fluttershy,\" Big Macintosh said, trying to put as much honesty in his words as possible. To keep his throat wet he drank some of the tea that Fluttershy had made. It had cooled to lukewarm but that wasn't a problem for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Big Mac I-\" Fluttershy started to protest, but Big Macintosh interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah know, Ah remember what ya said, about bein' mad at the world and bein' kinda...nasty on the inside, but y'all are still the Element of Kindness, and a very caring and sweet pony despite all that. Ah jest want one of the last things ya hear to be that not only do Ah accept that side of ya, Ah believe y'all are a good pony where it counts, even if you don't...\" Big Macintosh affirmed, taking another sip of tea. It was quite good he had to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Big Mac, that's so sweet. I...I guess I can take your word for it that I'm not all bad...if you can take mine that is...\" Fluttershy said mildly, then went on, \"I mean, it isn't fair that you feel so bad about yourself, it's just your nature, like any predator,\" Big Macintosh felt her shiver in his sack,  \"And it wouldn't be fair for you or anypony else to blame you for that. You have a right to at least <i>try</i> to live after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac set down his tea as his face burned hot, Fluttershy's words were hitting his newer thoughts on his \"problem\" right on the head. Still, he gave her the best answer he could at the moment, he still was <i>killing</i> innocent ponies after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep all of that in mind Fluttershy, and Ah think y'all <i>have</i> gotten me thinkin' differently about this...\" Big Macintosh said to his now burbling and shifting nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Big Mac, that's fair enough. I'm just glad I could make you happy, and not just in a well...sexual way. Is there anything else? Because I think I'm starting to lose feeling in a few places...\" Fluttershy asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing Fluttershy...all those...<i>ideas</i> I had on what to do with ya after yer a pool of jizz. Ya got any preference for one in particular?\" Big Macintosh asked, while watching his balls start shift and squeeze at the vague shape of Fluttershy, working harder to break her down into his next load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat answer does Big Macintosh get?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean, once you and your cock feel up to it that is...\" Fluttershy said, a note of excitement in her voice at what she was essentially condemning one (and possibly more) of her best friends to. She felt so wonderfully free now that she was going to be cum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Fluttershy, if yer sure...Ah'll do mah best to have Rarity be the mare Ah nut you into an' then send her screaming down mah cock...\" Big Macintosh said as evenly as he could, though his cock twitched eagerly at the images in his mind, of Rarity shrieking and squirming in his shaft, her screams muffled as she disappeared into his testicles. The sick thrill of it all was getting to him, from Applejack to Fluttershy, and now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good...I guess she probably won't enjoy it like I am though...\" Fluttershy said, even as she could feel her fur beginning to soften and drip like wax. Despite how hot the cruelty of it was, she still did feel bad. \"But I guess you'll have to eat a pony sooner or later anyway, and I really would like to be close to my best friend Rarity one last time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Ah'd wager two of ya feelin' that way about bein' eaten by a cock is about as much as we can hope for Fluttershy...\" Big Mac said, thinking about his sister again, and what he suspected about her thanks to Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...what do you mean? I'm confused...\" Fluttershy said, while the testicle she was in began churning against her again, rubbing in more of Big Mac's semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, we didn't get to that,\" Big Mac said aloud to his bulging nut, embarrassed at his apparent non-sequitur. \"Well, to make a long story short since ya don't have much time, when Ah was eatin' AJ, she didn't resist anywhere near as much as she could've, and she started gettin' wet as she went down and helpin' me, and when ya talked about her thinkin' bein' eaten by a penis sounded fun it got me thinkin' that maybe she wasn't jest tryin' to make ya feel better...never will know fer sure now that she's cockfood but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Oh My! I hadn't even thought of that...from what you said I assumed, well...that you had just gobbled her down...\" Fluttershy said, shuffled nervously inside his now sloshing sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, it [i]started[/i] that way...but AJ sorta seemed to like it once she stopped fightin'. Makes me wish Ah hadn't had to hurry along her digestion to go huntin' so soon...she seemed unsure of herself, and what she wanted...to stay outta mah cock or be eaten...\" Big Mac said, unable to deny how arousing the countless mysteries of what his sister had really thought earlier today were to him. As much as he missed her, and was sure he'd miss Fluttershy, something about his fun with Fluttershy and how she had accepted him had made it feel almost...[i]special[/i] rather than horrible, what he had done. Like he had made both of them happy and made his cock happy, which for once made him feel less guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, I wish I had believed her and asked her about it when she said that. We could've talked about it together, and maybe we could've connected more through that...Applejack and I didn't talk much, not like with Rarity or Rainbow Dash. Oh well, at least she made our fun today better, and we could both have our fantasies fulfilled...that's so [i]hot[/i]...\" Fluttershy said with a squeal, though she sounded a bit uncomfortable still, maybe because she was talking about his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'alright Fluttershy, Ah understand. Ah can't say Ah didn't enjoy it too, sister or not. Ah think things might be changin' now...or at least Ah hope so...\" Big Mac said to comfort the both of them, his ears drooping as the future tried to shove into his brain, but he waved it off. As a humble farmer he was used to that when he had other concerns, which was often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, Ah think Ah'll head home to get some rest, day's almost done...\" Big Macintosh decided, seeing Celestia's sun sink even lower through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Big Mac, I think maybe I'll just think about what it might've been like if Applejack had shown she was into this too, and we had [i]both[/i] had some fun with you before being eaten by your amazing and hungry cock, while I digest into just cum for Rarity...\" Fluttershy said in a breathless tone, and Big Mac felt her settle inside his shifting sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac stood up slowly, feeling the cum that he was sure now contained both Applejack and Fluttershy slosh in his distended ballsack, while simultaneously feeling the familiar weight of the pony inside. He had never walked with a pony in his balls before, and he had no idea what he was going to do if Granny or Apple Bloom asked questions like: Where were you today Big Mac? Where's AJ? Or even better-Why are your balls as big as your head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac wasn't going to let that stop him though. He had hesitated before about eating Fluttershy and he had nearly missed out on one of the best moments in his entire life because of it. If this caused trouble he'd deal with it however he had to (aside from sending anymore kin down into his nuts that is, he was still firm on that rule...when it came to Granny Smith and Apple Bloom anyway, he wasn't [i]that[/i] sick-minded, he was sure of it). He had gotten good at handling ponies, and he realized he had to at least [i]try[/i] to trust himself now that things had gone as weird as they had, it was his only hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac then began to walk towards the door of the cottage, but was interrupted just as his hoof touched the doorknob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Mac!...\" Fluttershy said, her voice a bit softer now, like he guessed her body was too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did the melting pegasus want to say?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could swear he could almost <i>see</i> the apologetic look on her face with how his balls were tightening up on her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...ya got a point Fluttershy...it might be gettin' on in the day, but there's still daylight enough left to come up with somethin' proper.

Then a soft whistle came from his balls. Less than a minute later, a flock of birds flew in and circled around him, apparently looking for Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in here little ones, and me and Big Mac need your help, that is if that's okay...\" Fluttershy said from within his sack, causing the birds to twitter in confusion but land on Big Mac anyway, a cardinal on his head, a robin on his rear, and a few finches on his back. \"I need you to tell the other animals that things have changed, and they probably won't see me anymore. Things will be alright though, and I still love you all, but I needed to leave...I also need you to take some messages to some ponies, if you don't mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac couldn't really think of anything to contribute as the birds twittered back at his nuts and their occupant, and then showed him where the quills and paper were. Quickly writing an explanation to Granny and Apple Bloom about how he and AJ were taking a break because of a \"problem\" and that he would be back soon while AJ would be out longer, he then gave it to the robin who flew off with it to Sweet Apple Acres. It wasn't much of an explanation, but he knew his kin would see through anything better that he didn't have time to work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Fluttershy's request, he then wrote out an explanation from Fluttershy about her absence and that Dr. Fauna (the local vet) could have access to her house to take care of her animals for her, and that Big Mac would be the unofficial owner of her house as she had something important to deal with indefinitely. All the while he tried and failed to ignore the feeling of his balls digesting Fluttershy. He could feel the cum rising higher as Fluttershy's fur and hair were steadily digested even while she dictated to him, as that was always the first thing to go when he didn't rush the process. He guessed her soft and wonderful pink tail and mane, as well as her creamy yellow fur, were turning yellow-white now, the new jizz oozing off her and down her body into the growing pool of it around her, though he didn't here a peep from her about it. The thought though made his cock throb and his face flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the letter was done, he sent it off with the cardinal, sweating and huffing a bit as his monstrous cock had grown hard again, tapping at his underbelly. He watched the cardinal depart along with the finches, then turned back to his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That all Fluttershy? Anythin' else Ah could do before yer gone?\" Big Macintosh asked kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's it Big Mac. I'll leave the rest to you, and thank you for everything...\" Fluttershy said, finality evident in her voice as she gave her final words to another pony... \"And thank <i>you</i> Applejack, for helping Big Mac make me cock-food like you...I'm so jealous you got to be eaten by your big brother's cock first...but that doesn't matter now, since you helped get me into these big sexy balls with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion himself wasn't sure whether Fluttershy meant that seriously or not, and if she did whether she was talking to the cum that remained of Applejack or something more spiritual. The whole thing with AJ had been confusing, but he was almost entirely sure something about her had been retained, for whatever reason. He guessed she really was gone now though, as he hadn't felt any of those strange urges from within his balls since he and Fluttershy had started fucking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also couldn't help but snicker a little at Fluttershy's harsher side slipping through again. It really was a shame he hadn't gotten to spend more time with her...they could've made quite the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out the window, he noted the position of the sun. It had moved a bit, as he had thought, but like Fluttershy said he would probably have the whole afternoon and early evening of daylight, then nightfall. With Fluttershy's offer and his letter, he could stay here to wait for nightfall in order to hunt Rarity down as well as plan out everything here, or go out as soon as Fluttershy digested and he'd thought some things through. He knew he'd likely be questioned as he went through town if he went out in the day but he was sure he'd be able to manage with a bit of thinkin'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, which does Big Mac choose?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He'd expected when he woke up this morning that he'd eat Carrot Top and be satisfied for however long he could, then do his chores and try to keep it out of his mind. Now though, so much had changed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping down on Fluttershy's couch, Big Mac let his balls spread out between his legs in front of him as he lay back against the pillows on the armrest, leaving him staring at his own bulging nut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp Fluttershy, guess this is the end for ya, time fer ya to be turned into mah cum...\" Big Macintosh said as he rested his hooves on his gurgling balls. He felt Fluttershy shiver with pleasure again at his gentle yet direct words. He also could feel how little of her fur and hair was left, as he felt no thick smoothness when he pressed the inside of his balls against her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Big Macintosh...this is the best day of my life...I can't believe I got to be the mare who you chose to gush your own sister into...and Applejack was so lucky to be the first to melt in your nuts, yet I'm also so happy it's my turn now...I can't wait to be just boy-jizz that you'll spurt into Rarity...\" Fluttershy panted out, unable to resist answering a final time, her voice a bit lower from the intensity of having cum now being rubbed into her exposed skin like lotion, making it loosen and melt into the creamy layers of it that were once her fur, tail, and mane. It almost felt like a rough but still well-done spa treatment...she wondered if Rarity would agree with that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Macintosh couldn't but give the beginnings of a devilish grin as he felt Fluttershy nuzzle up to his hoof again, it filling him with more sinful delight at her bringing up both her own imminent fate and the fact his own sister had already suffered the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more was said between the two of them then, the ponies who had connected so quickly and deeply over their shared oddities only falling into the depths of fantasy as Big Mac digested Fluttershy away into Earth pony spunk. Hours passed in relative silence but for the low and heavy breathing of Big Mac and the wet sounds of his busy nuts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Macintosh shut his eyes as he let his mind simultaneously narrow in on the feeling of Fluttershy and his own testicles under his hooves, as well as think back to the memory of the previous hour, when he had turned AJ into another load for his cock to shoot out. Said cock throbbed pleasantly as his mind turned over the mind-blowing blowjob from his own flesh-and-blood, the inventiveness and wonder he had gotten from her talented mouth, followed by the firmness of her sculpted and well-worked ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If only Ah hadn't been so hungry, or maybe knew she was probably into being cockfood...Ah could've given her a nice fucking first, and gotten a chance to fill up her sexy rear...</i>\" Big Macintosh thought shamelessly, his broiling arousal from the earlier sex and current digestion leaving any lingering guilt or shame far from his mind. He could almost <i>feel</i> how tight he imagined her virgin pussy and tail-hole would've been, probably a lot like Fluttershy's had felt, but with a hard-working Earth pony's solidness just perfect for pounding away at...he would've <b>loved</b> to be able to compare the two most amazing mares he'd ever had the blessing of knowing both emotionally and sexually. Both Fluttershy's butterfly-clad and soft-as-a-cloud (at least, from what pegasi like Rainbow Dash <i>said</i> anyway...) buns and his little sis's strong and bulging rump swam in the darkness of his closed eyelids, both well-worshiped and loved, and <i>both</i> having been a magnificent meal for his cock and soon digested in his nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for what he could feel in said nuts, he could feel Fluttershy squirming and moaning something, though she didn't seem to be using words anymore than he was, as his balls rubbed and massaged more and more of the pony-dissolving cum in his sack into her, wearing down more and more of her sexy and sweet body. He felt the liquid in his balls increase while Fluttershy's shape became softer and less defined and her moaning become quieter and quieter to his ears as she melted down steadily into just a pool of his creamy load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist, Big Macintosh opened his eyes, breaking up his fantasy of both Fluttershy and Applejack pressing their buttocks together to encase his meat in a mind-blowing mix of firmness and softness, to see what Fluttershy looked like after the past...two and a half hours if the clock on the wall was right. He'd be surprised if it wasn't, as it usually took this long the times he'd snagged a cock-meal when he had time to relax with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was well on her way to being a load of jizz, her shape in his ball silent and much softer. She was barely a pony now, just a melting lump that was only vaguely distorting the shape of his nut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ah bet she'd be real happy to see herself like this...</i>\" Big Macintosh thought, grinning at the thought of her sweet smile, and began lovingly stroking his balls, his large and heavy hooves making gentle circles on the semi-solid mass that was all that was left of the kind and sweet animal keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the remaining 30 minutes, Big Macintosh felt and watched as the larger of his testicles reduced in size and the other beside it grew, each changing like water balloons gaining and losing water. As the lump of Fluttershy broke down completely into cum his testicles wobbled as they shifted more of her between his nuts until they both were of equal size. For the <i>second</i> time that day his balls were a pair of rounded and swollen melons between his legs, full of what was once a pony (that he <i>knew</i>!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Feels like she'll be as smooth and creamy as AJ was...hope Rarity appreciates that...</i>\" Big Mac thought, his grin still prominently on his face. He even chuckled as he gave his nuts a playful tap, making them wobble and slosh where they lay between his spread legs. His cock twitched in response to his fun. His smile turned more gentle as he said his next words though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah promise Fluttershy, Ah'll make good use of ya, like ya helped me do with Applejack...Rarity will have the best time of her life before's she's a meal for mah cock...\" Big Macintosh said with honest care, his deep voice lending gravitas to his words. He even put his hoof over his heart as he spoke to his balls and the pony within them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he relaxed back into the couch though, something occurred to him. After AJ had melted away, he had had that odd feeling that she was still with him...was this something to do with the Elements of Harmony? Well, only one way to find out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fluttershy?...Fluttershy, ya still there?\" Big Macintosh called softly to his nuts, trying to \"feel her out\" like he had with AJ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Fluttershy going to be along for the ride to Rarity? Or is Big Mac's theory involving the Elements unfounded?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a weird feeling, to be both guilty and excited by the idea. \"AJ you'll get the best company soon,\" he mumbled to himself and started walking off towards where he remembered Rainbow's home to be from AJ's descriptions of the place. On the way he thought what he had done to AJ, and what he planned to do to her best friend, but despite his guilt, the more he thought about it the more aroused he began. He snorted almost every breath, his mind filled with dirty thoughts and expectations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived to Rainbow's home and looked up, suddenly feeling silly that he had no idea if she was even there, nor how to get up there. He couldn't walk on clouds. He couldn't even get up there to see if she <i>was</i> home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was just his luck, a fortunate sort, that he saw Rainbow peek her head out of one of her windows and then hell something. He listened and realized she was singing to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" he shouted from down below, and did so again until he got her attention. She waved at him and then he called to her one more time before she winged her way a down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Big Mac!\" she said. \"What are you doing here? It isn't like you to leave the farm and visit people!\" She didn't meant this as an insult, and Big Mac could tell, so he faked a smile, but had nothing to say. \"So what brings you over? AJ need something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, maybe,\" he said, looking away and blushing a little. He was a good hunter when he wanted to be, but, Rainbow was a different story.

As long as those balls of yours aren't swollen shut and have plenty to offer, I can... think of a few things you and I could do.\" Her face changed to a look of horror, \"Oh crap I'm not being too fast for you am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Good,\" she said. \"So um, were you just asking for a date? I was just teasing you, I don't REALLY expecting anything to happen on the first date. Like, I've been on a few dates and talked like that... It helps me decide if someone just wants me for sex or they're really into me for real, but sometimes it kinda backfires and they think I'm way too easy for them and the date broke-down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" he said. He actually had no opinion on that comment. There was a pause as she expected an answer from him, then he said, \"Um to be honest Miss Dash I'd be up for whatever you have planned but um...\" He smiled and lifted his rear leg to help show off his balls again, thinking that would speak for itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showed him her teeth. \"Oh yeah, sure, as long as this isn't just going to be a sex-only thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've want more than that,\" he said honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal...\" she said. \"What say you and I go up to Winsome Falls and see what happens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup, sounds good to me,\" he said. \"Dash, uh, thank ya. I was a little...\" He trailed off in mumbles but she held her hoof up to silence him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. I'll go pack, do you need to go get anything from the farm?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she said and smirked, although he wasn't sure why. She flew back into her house and returned with a ruckstack upon her back. She shook her ass and gave him a half-lidded seductive look. \"Ready you are Mac.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig McIntosh tried a smile on her and wasn't sure how effective it was. He let Rainbow lead him off towards their destination, as he wasn't actually sure where the they were going. They made small chit-chat on the way, in which Rainbow confessed that she'd been a little curious about Big Mac, not in a sexual way, but in the same way that most other ponies hand been interested in him. Big Mac didn't talk much and so he attracted attention just from that, although he doubted that would have even happened if it weren't for his attractive figure. Rainbow's interest in him was mostly founded on the fact that Big Mac himself was related to Applejack, whom Rainbow had a rivaly with. She didn't say it but Big Mac got the impression that her and his relation was just the thing to make her curious about their compatibility. It was probably a very ponyish response to feel that way about potential mates. He began to feel guilty about what he really wanted to do to Rainbow, turn her into a huge load of semen. His balls still wobbled with his previous meal, his own flesh and blood, and yet he still couldn't contain his guilt. His overwhelming pleasure from turning AJ into a wad of cum circumvented all the rest of his emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow began to get impatient from the journey. Big Mac wasn't slow but he was still an Earth pony. Rainbow exhibited an impressive amount of strength as she, without warning, landed on his back and picked him straight off the ground and flew the two of them over to Winsome falls. He was impressed with her strength and speed. He carried him and his balls full of Applejack semen all the way to Winsome falls all by herself. He wondered if this was going to be possible. She could probably kick his ass if he wasn't careful about how he ate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey landed and then Rainbow, being a little unconsciously selfish, asked Big Mac to set up camp while she bathed in the rainbow hued waters. He agrreed, if nothing else because he could watch her bathe while he did so. The camp was made up quickly, then Rainbow came over and stared into their fire. It was still light out, but the warmth was comforting for both ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why exactly are your balls so big?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac hesitated. After a few minutes he said, \"Um, they're full of semen. Err, pardon my sayin'. They're not just inflammed, they're... REALLY that full of semen.\" He blushed and made a grimace to try imply that it wasn't his ideal situation, but his grimace turned into a smile Rainbow's way as his emotions on what he did to AJ mixed in. Yes he missed his sister, but he couldn't think of a better pony to have eaten now that he thought about it, or a better way for her to disappear than into his nuts. Guilt existed, but so did pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow stared in shock. \"Those... those things are completely full of semen. What... what the buck!\" she shouted. He worried for a moment. Was she beginning to be disturbed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't seem that way; in fact she started to grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So you PROMISE me, that... that you're not joking, you really did that to your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated, grimaced, but nodded. He gasped as she suddenly threw her front legs around him and straddled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate your own sister?\" she said and gave him a lick on the nose. \"You bastard that's my best friend you have in your body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig McIntosh thought she was still assuming he was joking. He shook his head. \"Rainbow you should get away from me right now, Ah ain't lyin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe planted her lips on his and dug her tongue into his mouth. She started bouncing her hips upon his crotch, as he lay on his back. The force of her hug from earlier had sent him over the log he hand bee perched upon, and now as he lay flat on his back, his entire world was upside down. Not just literally but in the metaphorical sense as well. He spent a lot of his life hunting after ponies and trying to eat them before they became too scared to horrify his sense of right and wrong, but here was a pony more or less dominating him even after he'd confessed more than he ever had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AJ was your sister and my best friend and my rival!\" she said and bit him on the neck. \"Oh gosh, AJ can't really be in here can she?' Her butt bounced on his balls, making his cum slosh inside. She huffed over his face, her hot breath teasing him. \"I can't let her beat me to everything. Oh fuck....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still wasn't sure if she believed him or not, so he asked the question, \"Rainbow, will... will you let me eat you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer she gave was a yes, but---</span></div></div>",

She pressed chest against his and flapped her wings, shivering. \"You bet, if you show me everything you got to show me first...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac gave her a smile. \"If Ah understand ya right Miss Dash, was that an invitation for...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" she said and bucked her hips down on the base of his sheath. \"Take me with your cock and then you can take me into it!\" She snorted on him and then rolled over, using her impressive strength to hoist him ontop of her, then squirmed underneath his body to get onto her belly while he rested on her back. She flapped her wings and rose them both up into the air before settling down on her hooves. She swatted his large thick ass with her colorful tail, making him yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose her butt up, and Big McIntosh straddled her as his erection poked against her ass. He humped into her cheeks and oozed pre lazily against her tailhole before his length was extending far enough that he could get a good angle at her pussy. Rainbow's position under him made things a bit tight. He wasn't sure if he'd have to scoot back off of her a few inches to do this. His penis nipped at the flesh surrounding her moist entrance before he pressed his swollen tip up against it. He grunted as he felt Rainbow's heat on him. His cock grew harder and longer, and his extending erection began to force its way into her body by this alone. Rainbow turned her face towards him and stuck her tongue out, closing her eyes and panting. She seemed quite pleased so far!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac humped forward, and dislodged himself as all he did was push his sheath between her butt. He started to scoot back to get himself back into her, but Dash scooted back with him and kept him in this awkward position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm Dash Ah'm a little too far up,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored him. He tried to scoot back again but she played the same game. He grunted in frustration and then carefully tried to work his tip back into her pussy, and then relaxed, letting his erection grow into her body instead. His legs shook as he tried to control the urge to try bucking into her. Her pussy suckled and gripped onto him, helping his growing length reach into her. They both began to sigh and pant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"McIntosh,\" she huffed, squeezing him tightly. \"Gosh, your dick is just going <i>into</i> me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow shook her hips, teasing his still semi-flaccid meat. He grunted and felt his cock twitch, growing another half-inch into her, causing her pussy to squish its velvet muscles down onto him and suckle it in. He felt his tip press against the back. He wasn't even half-erect yet, and he'd already filled her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dash Ah'm still workin' it up,\" he mumbled. \"That gonna be a problem for ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding me?\" she said breathily. \"Keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. He closed his eyes and tried to picture in his mind what was going on between their hips, focusing on trying to get fully erect. Their two bodies were already sweating despite having done almost nothing up to this point. Eventually, though, he felt a pain in his cock as his erection began to stiffen and tried to straighten. His cock was not going to like getting hard when plunging downward and then suddenly into the mare at such an angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels like you're ready!\" she said. He felt her tail swing up and swat his butt again before she began flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac yelled with surprise as they were lifted off the ground. She tilted him off of her. He scrambled to stay on with his hooves. Her small body didn't give him much to try and grab between his legs before he fell off of her. He yelped as he felt a pain in the base of his cock, and a firm tightness on his penis. Dazed, confused, and looking around his upside world, he realized he was still in the air. He looked up and saw that he was hanging from Rainbow Dash by his dick. Her pussy was so tight that the much smaller mare was able to carry him into the air with just that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow was clenching her teeth and trying to concentrate. Big McIntosh was heavy. She felt her pussy tremble, realizing her muscles wanted to give out, not from fatigue but from an intolerance to hold this kind of pleasure for too long a period. She settled down onto the ground, putting Big Mac on his back with Rainbow in the cowgirl position. She pressed her hips down against his groin and swallowed the rest of his member into her body, and then let out a heavenly sigh as her pussy was allowed to relax and snuggle up with the stallion's member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh consarn it,\" grunted Big Mac, rubbing Rainbow's ass with his hooves, trying to get at the base of his member. It felt sore after Rainbow's stunt. \"Show off... Ya coulda really hurt me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you could take it!\" said Rainbow. \"Ha, now just think about how much pleasure that strong pussy of mine is going to give ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig McIntosh's jaw trembled. He almost didn't want to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow lifted herself up along his member and wiggled her butt at him, showing him her cute, clean pucker. With another squeeze that made her eyes roll into her head for a second, Big Mac felt his dick happily expand the rest of the way, pushing up into her cervix and forcing her pussy to stretch as far as it could to accommodate him. His member throbbed, fully alive and as hard as he'd ever felt it, and then Rainbow went to work on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shut her eyes tight as she worked her legs up and down, pushing with her muscles as she went down, and then tightened her pussy as she pulled back up. Big McIntosh couldn't help but think of getting a blowjob as he watched Dash's pussy and felt what she was doing to him. His medial ring made a little popping noise each time it penetrated Rainbow, and his entire crotch was glistening and wet with her honey. She'd push herself onto him until his sheath was buried into the very bottom of her buttcheeks, and then pull up until her legs were nearly straight, leaving a few inches and his inflamed tip inside her. Then down she went again. She started flapping her wings, making Big Mac panic for a moment before he felt a gentle breeze wash over his sweaty body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh by the Princess,\" he swore, body trembling. His hot, sweaty body was being fanned by the mare that was fucking him. The refreshing breeze she generated created a wonderful contrast with what his cock was feeling inside her oven-hot tunnel. Rainbow hilted him inside her and then bent her back, grunting cutely as she started to squeeze him as tight as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow trembled. Her tightened stomach muscles relaxed and her pussy lit hot and alive with pleasure as the sensation of squeezing that much invasive flesh sent her over the edge, and her pussy bathed the stallion in her juices. Her orgasm helped her squeeze even tighter, giving her more pleasure. She began to tear up and went into a deep, loud moan as her entire body began to tingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac swore loudly as her muscles gripped tighter and tighter, pleasuring him at first before beginning to sting and finally make his cock go numb. She gripped harder, and he noticed she started to buck her hip against his groin. <i>Oh no no don't make me ride this out!</i> he thought to himself, realizing that Rainbow's orgasm might last awhile, and what if she didn't let go after that? What if she continued to squeeze him this tight during her afterglow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow sighed happily, her lips trembling and drool pouring down her chin as she felt her body relax all at once, making her feel like she was made out of cloud. Her pussy relaxed for Big Mac, and even though she was still very tight, the change made the stallion feel like he was only inside something loose now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted. He stared at her toned ass and started to think about what he really wanted Dash for, to turn that slice of pony bacon into jizz. After what she put him through, he had a ravenous desire to just fuck her and get this over with so he could wolf her down and make her cock chow. He pushed on her ass with his hooves and took advantage of her relaxed pussy and began to buck up into her. He rolled up onto the small of his back and then onto his back hooves, mounting her and forcing her onto her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Mac?\" she said and looked up, smiling. A flurry of excitement ran through her as she realized he was now taking charge. She had her fun, so she was okay with that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac began to snort and grunt, losing any train of thought outside of what he wanted for himself, and started to drill into her. Finally in a good position for bucking his hips into her, he was now pistoning more than a foot of cock steadily in and out of Rainbow's snatch. She closed her eyes and stuck her tongue out onto the grass, sighing with each buck, riding her afterglow as he was riding her, adding to her already heavenly pleasure. Her tail came up to swat his ass again as he began to sweat anew right onto her back. His swaying balls glistened with sweat as did his strong bulbous ass. His features tightened with every thrust, showing off the muscle under his fur before becoming softer again when he pulled out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind flooded with the desire to devour her, and he felt his balls tighten as he hilted himself into her, burying his sheath in her folds. He snorted loudly, blowing his hot breath down over Dash's sweaty neck, making her tremble. He gushed into her, his semen spurting back out of her tight pussy and onto his balls with just the first squirt of cum. Rainbow's eyes rolled into her head as she felt the semen splash into her, and her body trembled as it quickly sent her into another blissful moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Maaac!\" she shouted, flapping her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gripped his thighs tighter over her butt as he continued to push rope after rope of his semen into her. He mentally thanked Applejack for her sacrifice again. Her pussy was flooded with semen and the backwash of it flowed down their legs. Rainbow twitched as she felt the force of his semen and the strength of his flared tip suddenly open her cervix, allowing him to flood her womb.</span></div></div>",

He was still hungry though... His hind-hooves twitched instinctively as he thought about getting to use this cock on somepony else. His fully digested sister shouldn't go to waste... He owed her that much for what he did to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Big McIntosh headed off towards the village to try and find some new prey, someone he could maybe use this semen on, and then turn that wonderful little piece of meat into even more semen for him to take back home, assuming he was satisfied. He was thinking about his original date plan with Carrot Top and started looking for her, trying to remain on the outskirts of town so that he didn't attract too much attention with the sac of his that held seed equal in weight to his own sister. He didn't wanna talk about such a drastic change to anyone who wasn't going to help change it more drastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe easiest solution he could think of was to keep is date with Carrot Top. If he could find her and let her know that Applejack had changed her mind about him dating her for the day, she'd be in his ball lickety split. So he looked for her from secretive places, moving quickly from street to street and lying to everypony who chanced upon him about why his balls were so big. \"Inflammation, accidentally hurt mah'self,\" he lied every time the trotted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though he bumped into someone who wasn't content to just let him walk away.</span></div></div>",

To put it simply, Ah reckon ya can call me a... serial killer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack's face straightened up. \"Say... what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac felt his insides become icy. \"There's no nice way of putting it... Just gonna have to say it the worst way my imagination can make it. Ah kill other ponies for sexual pleasure... and... and Ah can't help myself. Like, really, Ah can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack blanched, turning her head up and away. \"Yer... joking... No that... that isn't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't know what is worse, the cold truth of it, or how Ah have to do it,\" he confessed. \"Its... not like I can't get off unless Am stabbin' somepony or anything.

Ah never had the courage to do the right thing. Ever. Never will. Not on mah own. I want to protect you and Apple Bloom, so Ah kept feeding myself. If Ah ignore it, my cock hurts and hurts until Ah can't bear it anymore, and the more Ah can't bear it... the more its like this thing has a life of its own. It even snaps at food when... Ah mean snaps at ponies when Ah'm feeding. So, between that an' everything, Ah know Ah should just toss myself into Ghastly Gorge. Would be for the best, so if it makes ya feel better to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac was suddenly staring in the opposite direction. He blinked, a tear forming in his eye as the stinging encouraged it to form. Mostly he was just shocked, though, and turned to look at his angry sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If yer tellin me to kill you, shut the fuck up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat tone of voice.... \"Yes ma'am,\" he mumbled, unbelieving that his serious talk was suddenly becoming a submissive streak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay let's just start this slow. Have you even made an attempt to figure out what is wrong with ya'll and solve it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... been to the library... read some history. Sorta crops up in drafts a lot, still rare don't get me wrong... Guess there was a kind of study done, but, nothing conclusive. Didn't say what happened to their test subjects...\" Big Mac had a few ideas himself. Hell, had one just a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shoot, so we're stuck with ya like this huh?\" Applejack said. \"Hmm... Hmm hmm hmm... Well... guess we just gotta find ya somepony to eat afterall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dick thickened instantly, and his ears poised up. His heart raced with excitement.

With a faked smirk he stood up and threw Carrot Top on a hay bale. She yelped in surprise as she was thrown down and blushed as she saw Big Macintosh towering above her. First she tried to say something but she was stopped by Big Macintosh, pulling her into a deep kiss. After a few minutes of making out they broke apart and looked each other in the eyes. If Carrot Top still had the capacity to care she would have seen a shred of regret in Big Macintosh's eyes but she was already in a state of bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red stallion stepped forward and revealed his erection to the mare below him. Carrot Top gasped at the sight, every rumor about the size of Big Macintosh's stallionhood was true and his cock wasn't even fully erect yet. The strong, musky smell intoxicated her as a single drop of his pre cum dripped from the tip onto her nose. Carefully she started to lick him across his manhood, coaxing more of it out of the sheath. After a few licks she opened her mouth widely. She closed her eyes as the tip slid into her mouth, filling her nose with that irresistible smell. Then her eyes shot open as Big Macintosh rammed his cock deep into her throat. She managed to control her gag reflex and started to suck and wrapped her tongue around the huge cock in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Macintosh's eyes rolled up in pleasure as the mare below him started to work her tongue on his manhood. He had to remind himself that these were Carrot Tops last moments and that he should concentrate on her pleasure instead of his own. He pulled his cock out of her mouth and stepped back again with his cock lubricated by the mares saliva. He gave her a quick kiss as he carefully placed the tip of his cock against her labia. She gasped in pleasure as Big Macintosh slowly slid his lenght into her wet pussy. Tears formed around Carrot Tops eyes, this hurt but it felt so incredible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was completely inside of her Big Macintosh remained in that position for a while so she could get used to his size. They made out for a few more minutes until Carrot Top broke the kiss and nodded, giving him the signal to start. Slowly he started to pump in and out of her, building up a rhythm. He held himself back as Carrot Top already started to scream in pleasure. \"Oh Big Macintosh, take me! Make me yours! Oh Big MaaAAAHHH!\" With a loud scream Carrot Top came, spilling her juices on the ground. Big Macintosh was almost at his peak too, in the last moment he pulled out and whinnied loudly as he too came. His load came out and covered Carrot Tops face, chest and belly with his sticky seed. Carrot Top laid there, panting happily after this GREAT sex. \"Oh Big Mac, this was the greatest moment of my life.\" He certainly hoped so because he felt that it was time, if he waited any longer the pain will set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm glad ya'll liked it and.... Ah am sorry.\" Carrot Top was confused, what did he apologize for? Big Macintosh turned around and held his still erect cock in front of her face. For a moment she wondered if he wanted another go but then she saw the strange snapping motion of his opening. She wanted to ask him what he was doing but her nose and mouth slid into his cock as he pushed forward. Carrot Top panicked and flailed around as she was engulfed by Big Macintosh's stallionhood. Like a snake it stretched impossibly wide to swallow the mare. The process looked like it should be incredibly painful for the stallion but instead he felt even greater pleasure than he did moments ago. He felt a little guilty at the sheer pleasure he felt from pulling this mare down to his sac where she would be converted into more semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrot Top tried her best to escape the ravenous cock, she couldn't understand how this was even possible to begin with. Desperately she scraped her hooves across the ground, trying to get some leverage to push against it. Her shoulders were now inside and she almost drowned in the massive amounts of pre cum that lined the inner walls. She felt that she was being lifted up, is Big Macintosh lying down? She no longer had any kind of connection to the ground and her struggles now only accelerated her descent. She felt her head being dropped into a pool filled with a sticky liquid and realized that she was now inside of his balls. Her hind legs and tail were now sliding down the shaft and in mere moments the entire mare was inside of Big Macintosh's sac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large stallion was sitting on the hay bale, panting after this ordeal. His sac was now weighed down by the struggling mare inside and already touched the ground. \"Why did you do this Big Macintosh? Please let me out.\" Came the muffled screams from inside. This was the part he hated the most, his victims pleas and cries.. \"Ah am so sorry Carrot Top but if ah don't do this the pain just becomes too much.\" His excuse must have sounded so flimsy to the poor mare. The sound of gurgling reached his ear, at least the whole process was over quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrot Top felt it, she was turning into cum. Her entire body was feeling soft and her movements started to wobble. \"Please, let me out. I'll do anything!\" She continued to beg until the cum reached her neck. She knew that her entire lower body must be gone by now, this was it. Carrot Top stopped her struggles and protests and closed her eyes for the last time before she sank down into the liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Macintosh wandered through the orchard to one of his private spots with his heavy balls dragging behind him. He was ashamed of what he would do next but he couldn't just run around dragging his testicles behind him like that. The struggles have long since died, as did Carrot Top, as he reached the far end of his part of the orchard. He sat down against a tree and spit into his hooves before rubbing them together. He almost came right away as he started to stroke his shaft. After converting another pony like this it took mere seconds of masturbating until he came. This load was almost enough to fill a small bathtub and was tinted orange. Big Macintosh held a moment of silence for Carrot Top.</span></div></div>",

The only justification that he could muster was that, technically, he wasn\u2019t harming these ponies - it was his big, powerful stomach. He was merely gobbling them down, which, in and of itself, was harmless. Whatever his body opted to do to ponies once they were inside him, well, that was just a matter of nature. If his stomach ends up deciding that Lyra should be gurgled up, that\u2019s just the natural way of things, and not his fault in particular. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt helped that he had grown reliant on his bulky stature. Growing up as the only stallion in a farm - no less, a town - almost entirely populated by mares was tough, and lacking a sense of fitting in, Big Mac just wanted to prove himself useful. And when he ate ponies, they made him big and powerful\u2026 powerful enough to knock the apples from dozens of trees with a single stomp on the ground, and strong enough to carry massive, heavy wagons. His sisters appreciated all the hard work he put in. He couldn\u2019t let them down, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lyra could make a sound, he moved his rump back - now he wasn\u2019t so much sitting on her torso, as much as her face. He shivered as he felt the mare\u2019s head slip between those huge, heavy cheeks of his as they settle around her, her snout squishing up against his puffy tailhole. \u201cAhm sorry about this. Really, ah am,\u201d he huffed, offering whatever meager condolences he could. \u201cBut sometimes things just have to be done.\u201d That last part was whispered, said more for his sake than hers. She\u2019s already crying out and squirming, her protests muffled by cheeks bigger than her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time. He had disappeared his fair share of mares up his big, powerful rump, and at this point, it was no big deal. A sad way to say goodbye to Lyra, for sure\u2026 she seemed like a nice enough pony. Though for some reason, the fact that somepony he knew was now just food for his butt was\u2026 sort of appealing, in a way Big Mac didn\u2019t even want to consider. He just grit his teeth as that puffy donut hole of his slowly stretched around her snout, further muffling her cries as her head was slowly plunged into that unbelievable darkness and warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ass practically felt like a sweltering sauna on the inside! And she could already tell how tight it was going to be. He couldn\u2019t really mean he was going to eat her like this, right? Hopefully this all had to be some sort of sick prank! But if he was joking, the stallion was giving no indication of it, instead completely serious as he gasped and panted, letting that huge booty of his accept her head into its tight, sweltering confines. He positioned himself, standing up a bit so that she was sat up, before plopping himself down so that her forehooves slide right into him! He had to stuffle a loud moan himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon\u2026 yer goin\u2019 up mah butt either way\u2026 just let it happen\u2026\u201d He practically begged Lyra, though he knew this never worked. If she was anything like his other pony meals, Lyra was going to be struggling until the bitter end. He suppose it made sense, considering what his stomach does to smaller ponies like her. Regardless, there was no going back now. That rump of his was her only destiny. So, he flipped over on the bed, gasping as he started tensing and clenching so that his behind started to slowly suck her torso into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more of her body slid into Big Macintosh, the more miserable it was. She\u2019d always thought that rump of his was cute\u2026 on the outside! But on the inside, it felt like she was practically baking in an oven, further disoriented by the sheer darkness and the fact that she couldn\u2019t move a single muscle. His walls tensed and squeezed around her more than she thought possible, and she was sure her butt would just crush her at any minute. But no\u2026 instead, it just kept drawing her further and further inbetween those firm cheeks, until her much smaller rump disappeared into his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce only her hind legs stuck out from between his cheeks, he stood up with a pause, flustered and overwhelmed as can be, as he plopped his butt down on the bed, shoving those legs into his tight confines with a single movement! \u201cOoooh\u2026!\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but moan, finally having sealed the mare away inside his sweltering rump!

She blushed even harder, as her magical aura started to engulf his balls. As embarassing as it was for him, Big Macintosh felt his erection growing, as the tingling aura touched his private spot. A bright flash later, the spell was done. \"Alright you two, this should do it. Now, I can imagine you two want to get home now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ponies blushed at Twilights words, although Big Macintosh still felt strange.

It does not feel very full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was slightly confused at this. Shouldn't the spell have increased his fertility tenfold? \"That is strange. Do you mind if I... test it?\" Big Macintosh felt really uncomfortable now, but it was probably better to be safe, so he nodded and let Twilight feel his testicles to see, if there really was anything wrong with it. Indeed, when she felt him up, his sperm count seemed to be very low, almost empty. \"That is strange, I will take another look at the spell and see what could have gone wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy and Big Macintosh were a little nervous as they watched Twilight read the pages again, even more so as their friend suddenly became very pale. \"I'm sorry...

It says the effect cannot be reversed and that you can only control it, once you have done that at least once.\" Said Twilight, deeply distressed at the horrible mistake she made. \"If Fluttershy gets to close to you sexually, you might accidentally ingest her and turn her into sperm.\" The three ponies were horrified at the idea.

The cock was working over her upper thighs, and she knew it wouldn't be long before her ample rump became nothing more than a lump. Slime began to well up between her disappearing legs, precum oozing up from the prostate. The hotness glided up a little higher and the tide of ooze pressed against her still sensitive slit. Twilight found that she couldn't resist, and her forehooves slipped to her crotch to nurse at her folds even though she knew that if she did, she would lose them to the cock's insatiable appetite.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd so she did as Big Mac groaned out his pleasure and pawed at the flooring of the room, grunting every few seconds as her now bulging cock swallowed up the purple mare. The giant thing squished and pressed against the slit, needing streamlining to get in. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nTwilight sheepishly looked back, feeling the cumslit trying to work over her rump still. She wriggled about, hoping to push herself in over the base of her tail, and past the soft mire of flesh that the cock was trapped in. A tingle spread against Twilight's legs suddenly, making her look back once more just in time to see her purple tail get pinned against her rump as the cock glowed magenta with a spell. The widely stretched cum slit slowly yawned open further with elastic stretchiness, sliding up over the dense and purple fur of Twilight's rump, pausing as it halfway reached over her cutie marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBid Mac craned his neck down, watching Twilight as she bobbed upside down within the shaft containing her. Half of her body was in the already churning sack at Bid Mac's rump, swelling it and thickening it as lewd gurgles of a special digestive liquid thickly pouring in and sticking to Twilight as she sank rumbled out. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nTwilight tried to bend her head back to look at the ground, and couldn't, feeling the pillowy hotness of Mac's flare pressing up against the back of her head. Big Mac reached down, nuzzling Twilight as she sank deeper yet. The bulges in her cock were slowly vanishing as Twilight disappeared down into the sack where she would become cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gurgles grew louder, like a tub of jello swallowing a pony up as her sack began to swell and smooth by the floor as Twilight began to immediately change within. His cock grew harder as he imagined what Twilight must look like, already coated in at least a thin layer of cum transformed from her flesh. Inside, he could feel how Twilight's horn had already melted to cum, and her body was homogenizing as his new semen worked into him. </span></div></div>",

Fluttershy blushed and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Macintosh now went behind Fluttershy, who lowered her forelegs and spread her legs more. As Big Macintosh was now behind her, he got a very good view of her glistening pussy, which was slightly parted. Even his cock seemed to sense what they both wanted and stopped it's snapping motions, instead getting ready to penetrate this mare. Carefully, Big Macintosh guided his cock towards the wet vulva, also standing with spread legs now and letting his weighty balls dangle underneath him. Fluttershy gasped in surprise as he reared up on his hind legs and mounted her but she was also excited about what's to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Big Macintosh inserted his ravenous cock into the mare below him. A few tears escaped her eyes as she never had something this big inside of her. Still, despite the pain she was feeling overwhelming pleasure as the stallion pushed himself inside until his large, distended balls touched her thighs. After he pushed his entire length into her he remained in this position to give Fluttershy time to adjust. The pegasus mare was breathing harder and faster now, after a while she turned her head to him and nodded, giving Big Macintosh the signal to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly at first, he started to pull out and pump in again, steadily becoming faster. With every thrust, Fluttershy started to moan and gasp louder, lost in the feeling of pleasure. After building up a good rhythm, Big Macintosh now plunged his cock into Fluttershy's vagina fast and hard with every buck of his hips. It was difficult for him to keep so much seed contained within himself, he knew he couldn't hold back much longer. Luckily, Fluttershy's labia started to clench the invading cock tightly, indicating that she was close to her own orgasm. \"Mac, so close, I want your seed!\" With a final yell, she came and covered Big Macintosh's loins in her honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Fluttershy's orgasm came, Big Macintosh no longer held back. With great pressure, gallons of cum started to shoot out of his cock, filling Fluttershy to the brim. The mare gasped as she felt her womb distending from the huge amounts of cum, a large puddle already forming underneath them from the overflow. She almost cried as her belly distended with Big Macintosh's seed but the thought that all of this once used to be Twilight aroused her. Finally the torrent subsided and Big Macintosh's orgasm ended. Completely exhausted, Big Macintosh pulled his cock out of Fluttershy's vagina and let himself plop down on his haunches while she fell to her side, panting while more cum flowed out of her.</span></div></div>",

To be honest I am intrigued and would like to learn more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well madame mayor if you this you condone,<br>\r\nthere are several ways how this can be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe culprit gets cooked for the judge or eaten whole and alive,<br>\r\nwhich often snuffs out the populations criminal drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this the judge uses the potion of the snakes maw,<br>\r\nwith which I could even eat Big Macintosh raw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some villages especially far in the east,<br>\r\nThe culprit is cooked for the next village feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor was intrigued by the ideas and wondered which one to choose.</span></div></div>",

If she really wanted to eat a foal she deserved any punishment she could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Zecora, would you do us the honor?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly the zebra took a small vial out of her saddlebag. She opened the vial and gulped down the content, immediately getting a strange, rubberlike feeling in her throat. Gilda struggled even harde, knowing they were serious about this but the well trained police officers dragged her closer to Zecora who already licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the beak of the gryphon came close Zecora noticed a faint glow on it. A unicorn must be keeping her beak shut to prevent her from turning the tables. The gryphons eyes widened as Zecora opened her mouth impossibly wide and took her beak in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd watched in silent horror as the beak, the entire head and the shoulders disappeared inside the zebra whose neck stretched like a snakes. The police officers removed the rope around the forelegs and Zecora continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile swallowing the large gryphon Zecora couldn't resist exploring that body with her tongue. She has never seen or tasted a gryphon before. This strange mix of two different tastes was quite enjoyable Zecora thought as the weakly twitching arms and wings were slowly taken in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dashs mouth was agape, 'they are seriously doing this!' she thought while watching the spectacle.

She ducked into a nearby alley, which was easy since the crowd was distracted. As she ducked into the shadows only the hindquarters of the gryphon were still outside of Zecora's mouth. Rainbow Dash put a shaking hoof between her hindlegs and started clopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda's legs shuddered as Zecora swallowed her hindquarters and she felt the Zebras tongue invading her most private parts. Zecoras belly meanwhile was touching the ground and soon she would remain immobile for a while as the rest of the large gryphon slowly fell into her stomach. With several smaller swallows and slurps the gryphons legs and tail were taking in and with one final slurp the gryphon was completely inside Zecora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilda tried to struggle but nothing she did seemed to have any effect on the Zebra. She curled up as Zecora sent the rest of her into the stomach with a mighty gulp and then rested on her large distended belly as if she was lying on a beanbag chair. The crowd outside was stunned and even Rainbow Dash stopped pleasing herself until a gurgling sound came from Zecora. Gilda panicked as she felt herself being churned by the stomach, as she felt around looking for a way out she grabbed a strange clump. The gryphon gasped as she realized that these were her own fur and feathers, this Zebra was digesting her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor looked very pleased as she pressed her ear against the large belly. One less troublemaker to worry about. Smugly she grinned at the crowd. \"You see everypony, if you commit a crime this is what awaits you.\" For further emphasis she held the megaphones mouthpiece against Zecoras belly so that everypony could hear the sounds of the digesting gryphon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese sounds drove Rainbow Dash completely over the edge. She continued to masturbate and even fantasized what was going on in there. She gritted her teeth to stop herself from screaming as she finally came. Motionless she remained there in the afterglow as the mayor dismissed the crowd and ordered for a wheelbarrow to help Zecora on her way home. As Rainbow Dash went to her own home in the clouds she began thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I really just clop off to my best ex friend being eaten and digested alive?\"</span></div></div>",

To be honest she kinda enjoyed the large wriggling gryphon as she made a few final attempts to escape but in the end Gilda ran out of air and was now motionless and most likely already gone for good. The two ponies carting her back home looked nervous and fearful, Zecora couldn't blame them, she too was scared after witnessing this kind of punishment for the first time. The mayor however seemed to be very cheery after this, in fact Zecora wondered if maybe the older mare liked what she saw back there and praised Zecora for being able to swallow an entire gryphon as she accompanied her. The ponies pushing her cart rolled over a bump and Zecora almost fell out of the wheelbarrow. Both ponies were almost cowering, afraid to have offended the Zebra that could possibly swallow them whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can put your unreasonable fears to rest,<br>\r\nthose who follow the law I will not digest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to put them at ease a little, shortly thereafter they reached Zecora's hut and with some pushing Zecora even managed to squeeze herself through the doorframe.

Zecora also noticed that the mayor was looking down at her slowly shrinking belly suspiciously often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Ms. Zecora, such a beautiful mare such as yourself must have many admirers.\" While saying that the smile on the mayors face became downright seducing.

It felt nice to have somepony fall for her but she wasn't too sure about the implications of the mayors last sentence. Even in her home countries there were those that enjoyed watching someone swallowed alive but Zecora wasn't sure if that was the way to handle this.

The two of them continued for a few minutes, exploring each others mouths. The mayor then broke the kiss before turning around and walking towards the bed, swinging her hips seductively all the while. As she plopped down she threw her glasses aside and undid her collar. After discarding the collar she laid on her side and patted her flank, inviting the pudgy Zebra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora did not need to be told twice. She was still waddling slightly but stalked ever closer to the bed, almost like a predator stalking it's prey. If that was this mares fetish then she shall get what she wants. With a surprisingly quick pounce she jumped on top of the mayor. Both the mayor and her bed groaned in protest as she fat zebra landed but the mayor quickly turned to moan in pleasure as she felt Zecora on top of her. \"Oh please Zecora take me.\" She pleaded and the zebra was more than happy to oblige. She took the mayor in for another kiss but this time she dominated her. Her thick flabs were now enveloping the mare beneath her like a blanket and the thought that all of that fat used to be a living breathing gryphon only turned the mayor on even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora enjoyed this domination play and intended to go all the way with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you little bitch, lick me good and hard,<br>\r\nthen maybe you will get a reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up and pressed her marehood into the mayors face.

After sharing a passionate kiss, Zecora let her lips engulf those of the mayors and she grabbed her shoulders to pull her in easier. Mayor Mare gasped in shock first, but that gasp was quickly replaced by a loud moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose moans motivated Zecora further and she swallowed faster, taking the shoulders in too and continuing to suck the mayors belly down too. The older mare was in a state of bliss as she slid down the warm, wet tube, down into the zebras esophagus. The mayor gasped again as Zecoras tongue slipped between her haunches and licked across her nether regions. She barely noticed as she passed a fleshy ring and was slowly dropped into the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zecora started to slurp down the mayors legs, the older mare noticed something inside of the stomach with her.

Until then she could enjoy the massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHooves were rubbing against soft flesh, both mares were ecstatic. This was most likely the most sensual and intimate experience the two of them had and they enjoyed every second of it, sending spasms of lust through their bodies with each stroke. Zecora loved to feel the mayor move within her and the mayor in turn loved how the stomach walls pressed down on her and churned her from all sides. With a final moan, they came, spraying their juices over the bed and the insides of the zebra, before collapsing in their respective positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes though, a gurgle was heard.

She could be gurgled and churned and turned into mush. The thought of becoming a layer of fat on the Zebra aroused the mayor, who started to pleasure herself, rubbing her marehood with her hoof. While she masturbated, her survival instinct and her lust were in battle over wether she would let herself be digested or get out of the stomach. In the end, her mind was too clouded by her own arousal. \"Ms. Zecora, don't let me out, digest me and turn me into body fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora couldn't believe what she heard, did the mayor just ask her to digest her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Madame Mayor I hope you realize,<br>\r\nwhat you ask is your own demise.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor however was sure about this, she wanted nothing more than to be broken apart and turned into nutrients. \"Please Zecora, the mere thought arouses me, just break me down and absorb me.\" Mayor Mare remembered that Zecora might get into trouble but remembered something. \"To be honest, I haven't been entirely honest with Ponyville. I have impeached money before and the documents are hidden away in a secret compartment under my desk. Tell the others how I confessed this to you, show them the evidence and tell them you punished me according to the new law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora was shocked, according to the law she had to digest the mayor now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I hope you have no regret,<br>\r\nnow you will become body fat.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese words sent another shiver of pleasure down the mayors spine, it was a strange but arousing feeling to know that she just sealed her fate. Loud gurgles echoed around her as the stomach acids started to seep in. This was the moment the mayor was waiting for, a itching sensation spread across her body as the acids covered it and her cunt, which she still stroked was burning from the acids. Mayor Mare did not mind the pain, in fact she liked it because it told her that she was being slowly converted into fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burning now spread across her entire body as her fur fell off and exposed her already reddening skin to the brutal acids. The doomed mare screamed in pain and pleasure as she was close to the last orgasm of her life. Mayor Mare had no regrets, she lived long and successful so she could go out with a bang. A wave of pleasure surged through her body as the mayor spilled her love juices one last time before succumbing to the acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Zecora watched as her belly became still before slowly shrinking down. It was strange that a pony would so willingly choose such a fate but apparently it brought the mayor great pleasure. Now that she had another layer of fat on her body she decided to sleep some of it off first before making her way to Ponyville. If she went out now, the creatures of the everfree would only have an easy snack. Zecora laid down on her bed again and slept while the rest of the mayors body was broken down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The zebras that devoured ponies actually NEEDED meat to survive.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora raised an eyebrow. \"But we are not like that now, few true tribes remain and none on ponies chow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded. \"About fifty or so years after the ponies and zebra tribes met, a few of the tribes banded together and conquered most of the other tribes, setting up a central government. Though your people are still nomadic, they are one people. However, among the co-alligned tribes were two of the carnivorous tribes.

Something about this was arousing to Twilight and made her want to be eaten. Zecora seemed to be equally surprised, even though the zebra considered the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit this is a surprise, that you would choose your own demise, if I eat you you'll be sludge, to be absorbed and turned to pudge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight became red in the face at those words and she felt something wet between her legs.

Twilight wanted to be eaten, wanted to give up her very existence to feed the zebra and to experience this special pleasure. \"Yes Zecora, I want you to eat me, digest me and turn me into body fat.\" Twilights voice was shaking with both fear and pleasure.

The last thing the zebra saw on the unicorns face was a look of complete submission, telling her that Twilight has now accepted her fate and would  let herself be swallowed like good little food. Indeed, Twilight not only didn't fight, she even pushed herself in further as Zecoras lips engulfed her shoulders. The outline of Twilights face clearly showed on Zecoras neck as she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight had her eyes closed and focused entirely on the feeling. The warm, fleshy walls pressed down on her head and chest, covering her in saliva. It was hot and the air was stale and Twilight was aroused like never before. The feeling of being rubbed across the zebras tongue and throat was amazing as every gulp sent her closer to the stomach, and her doom. That thought did not even horrify Twilight anymore, the sooner she was in the belly, the sooner she'll be digested and the sooner she would make Zecora wonderfully fat and plump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora was already past Twilights belly and her lips went around the unicorns flanks. Zecora could now clearly taste something, the juices flowing out of Twilights pussy. A mischievous grin spread across her face as she worked her tongue and licked across the wet slit, causing Twilight to moan from inside of her. Twilights legs kicked wildly as Zecora continued to invade her private parts with her tongue and the zebra actually had to push her out a little before she would be too far inside for her tongue to reach. Her tongue was buried deep inside of Twilights slit as she felt an explosion of the slightly salty taste inside her mouth and a loud moan came from inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gasped and fell limp after her orgasm. Zecora has now completely conquered her, she was hers in every sense of the word. She now felt her hind legs loosing contact with the air as Zecora closed her mouth around them and gulped her down. Twilight felt that she was being pushed through a tight ring of flesh and dropped into a small chamber. Twilight has reached her final destination, the stomach that would soon digest her. \"Oh thank you Zecora. If you want to, you can use my bed to sleep me off... I am not gonna need it anymore.\" She offered as she waited for the final gurgles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora pondered this offer, she could use a nap or go back home. Since she was doing something perfectly legal, nopony could touch her if she went home with Twilight in her belly.</span></div></div>",

Normally Zecora would be nervous but since what she did was legal, she had nothing to worry about as she displayed her catch. Soon she reached the edge of the forest and left the town behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the inside, Twilight rubbed the walls of Zecoras belly. During their walk through Ponyville, her arousal only grew. 'Yes Zecora, show them what a strong, powerful predator you are. Show off your meal.' She though while rubbing her own slit. She now laid there on her back, her legs drawn to her face and she shivered as she felt drops of acid drip on her wet pussy. The stinging was not something she minded, it meant she would soon become part of Zecora. Soon she could hear a door open and close again two seconds later, they must be inside of Zecoras hut now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you are well rested, soon you are gonna be digested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she announced this, Zecora laid down on her bed and rubbed her filled belly. Now that the finality of the situation really struck her, a battle was taking place inside of Twilights mind. Her fetish driven side, which wanted to be digested wanted her to just relax and accept her fate but her survival instincts were not snuffed out completely and told her to get out of there. Twilight still enjoyed the situation but she was kinda unsure if she really wanted to sacrifice her life for it.</span></div></div>",

Even now that her pussy and anus were already itching horribly, knowing that she was currently being turned into nutrients washed the pain away with a wave of pleasure. Zecoras stomach acids continued to flood the chamber, covering the unicorn from horn to hoof. Twilight could feel a strange itch on all of her body. Out of curiosity, she cast a light spell to illuminate the inside. She gasped as she saw that most of her fur was already gone and that her slit was red and puffy from the assault of the gastric juices. Now the stomach started to move, churning Twilight up to help turn her into a paste. Twilight closed her eyes and cancelled the light spell, accepting her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora listened to the loud gurgles as her stomach really started to work. She was pleasantly surprised that Twilight still continued to squirm inside but didn't thrash around wildly. After a few minutes the squirming stopped though and her churning stomach was the only movement from inside. Zecora guessed that her meal has passed out by now and she would not open her eyes again. Zecora decided that now would be a good time for a nap to let her digest the unicorn in peace. After a loud yawn, the zebra closed her eyes and dozed off to the sound of her gurgling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few hours Zecora slept while her stomach continued to work. The unicorn inside got softer and softer from all the churning and the stomach acids, until finally she started to melt away. Gradually the black and white striped belly became smaller again while Twilights body disappeared, slowly turning into a nutritious sludge. After her body was turned into paste, said paste was pushed into Zecoras intestine where it was absorbed to become body fat for the zebra. Soon Twilight was completely gone and no trace she ever existed was left, except for a layer of fat on Zecoras body and some waste resting in the zebras intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Zecora wakes up with a loud yawn and pats her belly, which has shrunk down again.</span></div></div>",

Her belly began to undulate in and out like it was \"chewing\" it meal, the pred put her hooves on the now beach ball sized womb and began to knead it. She proceeded with the churning with deep moans and murmurs for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nuzzled against the walls, getting herself comfortable. She knew it was only a matter of time before it would begin. Soon enough, her chamber\u2019s walls started to secret gooey, sticky fem-cum, and soon she was covered in the gooey white stuff. It tingled against her skin, and she couldn\u2019t help but wiggle and squirm as the soft tingling grew into a pleasurable throbbing all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer coat was slowly changing into a white hue, and her lovely purple mane was oozing into the pool of cum that was growing around her. She pressed her hooves together, and was amazed when they literally slipped into each other, causing hooves to become nothing more than a big gloppy ball of cum. She blushed and delved that glob of cum between her back legs, giggling as she squished it between her thighs. The puddle of cum was growing more and more, and Twilight realized that she was slowly losing feeling in most of her body. Her limbs were entirely gone, swelling and churning within that pool of goo, and about half way through the night her head finally sank below the surface of the cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora continued her churning and massaging, until the wriggling stopped and her womb seemed to \"relax\" and sag down a little to represent the unicorn was fully digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora began to clopped furiously. Her juices splashed out onto her hooves and she groaned. Her nether lips puckered and she shuddered to life. Faster and faster went her hooves, pressure building, until she actually came twice in a row. She'd never felt sensations that intense in all her life. Sticky liquid shot out from between her legs, and she made a sharp, quick cry out to the orgasmic heavens. Twilight's remains coats her belly and bed as she continued to cry out in pleasure.</span></div></div>",

Today she was visiting Zecora for some tea and because she wanted some help with her research on medical herbs. After helping Zecora pick the ingredients for a simple wound salve and a \"surprise potion\" the two of them relaxed with a nice hot cup of tea. Things were really looking up after the rumors about Zecora being a cannibalistic witch were dispelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, you have the best tea I've ever had Zecora.\" Said Twilight as she pured herself another cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An I must say it's quite lovely,<br>\r\nto finally have some company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight still felt a little guilty because she started to believe those rumors too while the real culprit responsible for their \"curses\" was the poison joke. \"Yeah, I still can't believe that I actually thought you wanted to eat Applebloom for a moment.\" She almost regretted bringing that up but Zecora didn't seem to be offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those rumors were accurate and without real ground,<br>\r\nI actually prefer it the other way around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stopped mid sip, what did Zecora just say? \"Uhm, what did you just say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora looked shocked for a moment, she clearly just revealed something she wanted to keep secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it is true that eating others is my fetish as they used to say,<br>\r\nbut as a voreraphile I rather want to be somepony's prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora looked clearly uncomfortable as she revealed her fetish to Twilight Spakle. Said unicorn stared at the zebra in disbelief, she heard of fetishes and voreraphilia before but never expected to meet somepony with this particular fetish. Twilight had to admit that she was curious, she wanted to know what was so enticing about this and how they satisfy their fetish. This proved to be an unique chance to study voreraphilie and Twilight couldn't resist a chance to study. \"Well Zecora, I know a bit about voreraphilia and I admit I am a little curious. How exactly do you... do it? Being eaten is generally not an experience that you can survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For that I have the special potion I mentioned before,<br>\r\nit protects you from the gastric juices during vore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's the secret, a potion that protects the prey from digestion.

Up to now she has been content wrapping herself into wet sheets and pretend she was in a stomach. She had the potion against digestive juices, but she knew that it did not last forever and that the creatures of the Everfree would not let her out. While she loved the idea of being devoured and the miscellaneous predators made good fantasies, she was not so keen on ending her life. However, this may be her big chance to finally fulfill this fantasy properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear Twilight I don't know what to say,<br>\r\nother than I would love to be your prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Zecora closed her eyes and imagined how this would go. Herself on the table, as Twilights hungry mouth came closer and closer. Then the look deep down into the unicorns throat. She imagined Twilights throat to be of such a beautiful, wet smoothness. It would surely feel heavenly to have it clamp down on her, while she slowly slid into Twilights stomach. She would definately make this moment special. Zecora stood up and gave Twilight a deep, passionate kiss before slowly turning around, brushing her tail against the unicorns face. Swaying her hips seductively, she climbed on top of the table before laying down and winking at her predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blushed and nervously got up. She was still completely new to this, so she did not know for sure how to start. Would she even be able to fit an entire zebra into her mouth? After quickly inspecting her \"meal\" she decided to start with the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If she started with the hooves, Zecora could still give her some advice on the way down. If she swallowed head-first, any advice or pointers would be heavily muffled. Twilight moved towards the rear end of her zebra friend and grabbed her hooves with her magic. While Twilight did that, Zecora rolled into her belly and swayed her tail in anticipation. Twilight blushed, as this action got her a good look at Zecoras ass. While the zebra was not fat, her buttocks were very supple, providing a nice little cushion. Between those cheeks, Twilight could also spot the wet glistening of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping for the best, Twilight lead the hooves of the other mare to her mouth and slowly slid them inside. The unicorn was pleasantly surprised at how good Zecora tasted. She never thought of eating another intelligent being but now she had a zebras rear hooves, sliding down her throat as she licked them on the way down. Her prey moaned loudly in pleasure, as she felt her rear legs disappearing inside of the unicorn. This was a dream come true for Zecora, soon she would be inside of Twilights belly. The mere thought sent waves of pleasure through the zebra, as a fresh load of pre dripped on the other mares tongue, as her lips went past Zecoras wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose hips were the part where Twilight was worried she might not make it. This was the first time she ate something this large and she felt that her mouth and throat capacity was at its limits. She did not want to disappoint Zecora though, so she mustered all her willpower and pushed her down. It became hard to breathe, Twilight needed to hurry up. The taste and scent of Zecoras juices were starting to arouse her as well, as she licked over the zebras belly. The shoulders were the next, big challenge. They were not as wide as the hips but Twilight was getting exhausted. Her windpipe was free again though, now that Zecoras hips were on the verge of joining the rear hooves in her belly. She took her time, catching her breath and licking the shoulders wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Twilight you mighty, hungry pred,<br>\r\nbeing eaten by you makes me so wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora murred, as she too gasped for breath in this brief pause. While it was still a little embarassing, Twilight was kinda proud she did this so well. Vore was a strange fetish but she believed, she could get into it too. Now she regained her breath and continued to swallow. Soon Zecoras head was pushed down her throat and Twilight could finally close her mouth again. Her jaw hurt a little, after having been pried open like that for a while now but Twilight didn't care. Only a few more gulps and Zecora was inside of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last gulp and a content sigh, Twilight looked down at her belly, which was now full with zebra. She was not even this full when she first met Applejack but this time it felt great, having Zecora squirm around inside of her. Twilight looked around a little, as her gaze fell upon a small phial. \"Zecora, you forgot to take the potion!\" She exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, please swallow the phial and hurry up,<br>\r\nbefore your stomach starts to melt my butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight quickly grabbed the phial and opened her mouth again, letting it hover over it. For a moment the image of Zecora, getting dissolved inside her stomach flashed through Twilights mind as she held the phial.</span></div></div>",

Eventually she found the phial, quickly opened it and drank the contents. She breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that she was out of danger now. Still, somehow the thought excited her, being trapped in Twilights stomach as it digested her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZecora was awfully quiet, as she was deep in thought, not squirming anymore as she did a moment ago. Twilight was a little worried, did everything work? \"Zecora, are you alright?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At ease my purple friend,<br>\r\nmy life today will not end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis assured Twilight, who also now let out a sigh of relief. She did not really want to accidentally kill Zecora, just because she was curious. \"Alright then Zecora, just tell me when you're ready to come out again.\" Feeling too heavy to move, Twilight carefully laid down on her side, watching her full belly with awe. It felt incredible, being so big and having somepony inside of her, she didn't imagine something like this would feel so amazing. It already started with the swallowing itself. The unicorn greatly enjoyed the feeling, as Zecora stretched out her throat and slowly slid down into her stomach. The taste was delicious too, something she never expected either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long while, during which the two enjoyed each other, it was finally time to let Zecora out again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It has been quite a while since their marriage. Ever since the birth of the two twins, it has been harder for the couple to find interest in sex. Lately, they've tried several kinks only known to ponies outside of Ponyville, such as latex-laden role play, strange and exotic toys of various shapes and sizes, and other few kinks. Nothing that was tried improved the Cakes' sex lives. That is, until one day the couple decided to visit the friendly potions-maker zebra, Zecora. They visited her and explained that their marriage could use some spicing up. She handed them a book of fetishes, all strange and varying in intensity. More than several seemed unappealing to the Cakes at first glance, but they felt they weren't willing to try some of the more extreme ones. They settled for stuffing and intense feeding, and considering that they owned a bakery, it was rather fitting and convenient. Zecora had a special potion which would allow the two to eat larger amounts of food while also inducing a bigger appetite. She gave out one warning to the couple:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never drink more than one a day, or else trouble makes way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple took several vials of the pink potion Zecora detailed and thanked her for her assistance, both ponies leaving the zebra's abode eager to try the potion out and hopefully have something that may better their intimacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, the Cakes closed up shop for the day and sent Pinkie Pie away with the kids. All day, Mr. and Mrs. Cake baked pastries of all sorts. Cakes, muffins, ice cream and shakes being only some of the large amount of sweets they've made for themselves. It was already in the afternoon when all their food was ready and splayed over a large table in the center of the shop. Mrs. Cake was the first to try the potion. It was bitter-sweet and tasted of berries. Right after drinking one whole bottle, she started to perspire and hunger for food. Right then, she brought an entire cake to her face and ate it much like Pinkie would, in one bite. Right after, Mrs. Cake proceeded to eat a platter of apple muffins, and, in less than a minute, she had eaten sixteen large muffins the size half her head. Mr. Cakes watched his wife's ravenous display with interest. His wife's belly rapidly expanded to the rapidly increasing amount of food being eaten by her. It seems that, in addition to a bigger appetite, an attribute of stretchiness similar to that of Pinkie's was also an intended side effect as to allow the increased capacity size of practically any part of the pony's body. This became apparent to Mr. Cake as his wife continued to gobble down platefuls of pastries at a time. Mountains of donuts and other goodies were downed in such short time, that it far surpassed their apprentice's abilities of consuming. Before he even had a chance to eat, all the pastries they had taken the day to make had all been shoved inside of Mrs. Cake's bloated belly. Mr. Cake took a look at his wife. She seemed now satisfied, but her belly sagged all the way to the floor, as if she herself had eaten an entire pony. The very thought of this and having watched his wife eat all of the day's work had turned on the left out stallion. Mrs. Cakes apologized for her behavior and for not giving Mr. Cake a chance to eat. Mr. Cake approached his wife and hugged her. \"It's alright, honey. I don't care I didn't get a chance to eat. Seeing you eat all that made me feel happy.\" Mrs. Cake felt a little relieved. After exerting so much energy and being unused to eating so much, she waddled into the bedroom and onto the mattress and fell asleep from exhaustion. Mr. Cake simply watched her belly rise and fall as his wife slept before going back to the shop to clean up the mess that was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Cake felt as if the potion may indeed solve the boredom in their marriage, but perhaps do a little something more than just that.</span></div></div>",

Mr. Cake was currently taking a shower and could not get yesterdays activities out of his head. Seeing his wife stuffing herself was already enticing but it was something else that really haunted his mind. \"She could eat an entire pony.\" He whispered while his penis hardened at the thought of it. Yesterday when he noticed that his wife looked like she has eaten an entire pony, the fantasy began to cloud form. Instead of gobbling up large amounts of pastries, he imagined his wife eating a scared and struggling pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his cock in his hooves and began to stroke his shaft. His mind went back to the night when he snuggled against his wife. The gentle rumbles of sweets as they were being digested were mentally replaced by the desperate pleas of a pony as it was broken down to become fat, the plain imagination that the additional pounds could have been a pony sent shivers of excitement down his spine. With this fantasy in mind he came in no time at all, staining the wall of the bathroom with his seed. As Mr. Cake cleaned his cum off the wall he made a decision, he would get his wife to eat a living pony.</span></div></div>",

He observes her intently, looking over her curvier form as she takes care of the kids. Her belly does not sag as much as it had the other day when it was full with the pastries, but it is significantly larger than what it used to be. Her new-found ability to digest and metabolize food effectively was apparent due to her new added poundage. Her belly, stretching her apron and being one of the more prominent parts, had grown in volume besides her much larger hips and thighs. Above all, her behind had increased in size the most, now almost the size of two medium-sized beach balls. Mr. Cake intently eyes his wife's belly and ass back and forth, fantasizing yet again, before Mrs. Cake turned to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Dearie, hello there. I was just finishing feeding the foals.\" She turns her body around to talk to Mr. Cake, stepping away from the babies' crib while they drank from their milk bottles, while he gawks with an slightly-opened jaw at her gently-swaying curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, hello Sugarplum. I was just wondering how much you enjoyed last night and all that *gulp* eating?\" Mr. Cake inquired nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake replied with a smile,\"It was wonderful, Dearie. I've never felt so good eating all that much! I can't wait to do it again sometime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Cake said,\"Oh, well good! I'm happy you liked it as much as I liked watching you eat.\" He fidgeted a little with his hooves, wanting to ask her what he had on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dearie, did you want to give the potion a try? I suppose I was a bit too rash to eat everything we made for ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that. I was just also wondering if, well, you'd like to try something similar to last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dearie?\" Mrs. Cake inquires, hoping to ease her husband's vexation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you enjoyed eating so much, and since I loved seeing you eat, I was wondering if you'd be interested in eating...\" Mr. Cake lowers his voice,\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">another pony?</font>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake stares and blinks. Mr. Cake flinches and turns waiting for a response. She turns to her beloved children and thinks about it, about the thought of having another living being inside her again, just like she had when she was pregnant with the twins, only this time the being inside her will return to her body, feed it, instead of releasing it. The thought of another pony inside her, like a child who gives itself to her instead of the other way around. The thought of another becoming a part of her body. The more she thought about eating another pony, the more she liked the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dearie,\" she rubs her nose against his cheek,\"I'd love to eat another pony. With the potion from Zecora, anything is possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Cake beams with joy,\" Really? I know it sounds like a crazy idea, in fact, it very well may be, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, dearie, I understand how you think me eating somepony may sound so... good.\" Mr. Cake sighs with relief, happy to hear his wife is going to enjoy the activity they will spend time planning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the cost Pumpkin and Pound Cake's playmate, and perhaps losing an apprentice, having Pinkie Pie get eaten by his wife didn't sound too costly. Since they were responsible for Pinkie's stay in Ponyville, they figured they could easily play off her sudden disappearance. Also maybe being consumed by somepony would teach her not to eat everything in plain sight, like the many times she's eaten the hard work him and his wife put into. And perhaps she'd be a sweet treat being a pony who's pink and bubbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Sugerplum, I think Pinkie would make a great meal for you,\" Mr. Cake stated rather excitedly, already salivating slightly at the thought of his wife eating the pink pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sent Pinkie out to get some baking ingredients, so she should be back later today. I'll go drop off the foals at her friend's house so we don't upset them when we start having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea, we wouldn't want to have them hear Pinkie get gulped. I'll close up shop for the day and wait for Pinkie to come back. You should go relax and have some fun after you drop the twins off.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Dearie, I'll be back later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, Mrs. Cake thanked Twilight Sparkle for watching the baby Cakes and she turned her healthy form and walked away from the town library. She knows that the two will miss their playmate, but her desires were just too overwhelming. \"I'm sure they'll make friends with somepony else,\" Mrs. Cake thought as she hummed on the way to the spa to relax for a bit while also getting some stares from several ponies noticing her sudden gain in weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helloooooo. Is anypony home?\" Pinkie just came back and cheerfully put down her saddlebags which contained the day's errands. She peered into the empty and dark store and wondered where everypony went. \"Oh well, I'll go make some cupcakes for Mr. and Mrs. Cake for when they come back, that'll bring some smiles around!\" She smiled as she walked into the kitchen as the shadowy figure of Mr. Cake slowly creeped up behind the unaware happy pink mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake had arrived at the store later that day after having a relaxing time at the spa. She was now much less relaxed and filled with great anticipation, not waiting any longer to have her pony meal. Excitedly, she opened the door to see her husband smiling. \"Hello, Sugarplum, I've got Pinkie waiting for you,\" he declared while handing her a vial of potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Cake swung the door fully open to allow Mrs. Cake to see a bound Pinkie Pie, all four legs tied behind her back with ropes of red licorice kneeling on a large silver platter. In addition to red licorice binding her, whipped cream was sprayed all over her midsection and shoulders. Muffled with a plastic apple gag from their adult toy collection, all Pinkie did was yell and squeal for help as best she could when she saw Mrs. Cake. Mrs. Cake first drank some of Zecora's hunger-inducing potion before entering the shop. Tossing aside the empty vial, she turned toward the tied pony. The pink filly looked up and put on a pleading look, hoping Mrs. Cake would do something as she stared at her, but Pinkie's face turned to shock when the smiling Mrs. Cake walked up to her, tongue out and salivating, and said,\"Oh Dearie, you look so delicious!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've fed her a plate of muffins and a cake, then topped her off with some whipped cream, Sweetums,\" Mr. Cake explained as he closed and locked the door, causing Pinkie to struggle and yell more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake put her face right up to the scared tied up pony's, now more hungry than ever, and licked her cheek. \"Mmm, she tastes delicious, Carrot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nmmmmph! Plffff!\" cried Pinkie as the couple stripped themselves of their work clothes, being completely naked for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's all yours, honey. Dig in!\" cackled the giddy Mr. Cake. Pinkie's eyes widened and realized what they were planning to do to her,  Mrs. Cup Cake and Mr. Carrot Cake were planning have her be eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow pony watched intently as the chubby light blue one smirked hungrily at Pinkie. Drooling now and a with a painfully hungry look in her eyes, Mrs. Cake proclaimed,\"Pinkie, thank you for all the work you've done. We appreciate all your help and we thank you for becoming a part of my body today.\" All Pinkie did was look down and cry, bracing for what's to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Mrs. Cake's pink pony meal began.</span></div></div>",

With that, she opened her mouth incredibly wide, wider than any other pony, besides Pinkie herself, could. Carrot Cake simply watched and smiled as his erection twitched with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie simply stared at the gaping maw as it approached her. Her pupils shrank as the sets of teeth moved over her head and brushed her poofy mane. Mrs. Cake's tongue lightly licked Pinkie's chin while she cried in fear staring at the pink throat and uvula in front of her. Now with her teeth at Pinkie's neck, Mrs. Cake closed her mouth, effectively leaving the pink pony in darkness for the rest of her abruptly cut-short life. Cup Cake smiled and rolled her eyes up in bliss because of the delicious sugary taste. As she stood up on all fours, Cup Cake waved her husband over to help her lift Pinkie. Carrot Cake walked behind Pinkie and grabbed her flanks, meanwhile noticing her privates, and lifted her plush rump high into the air to assist Cup Cake's gulping of the unfortunate pony. Mr. Cake shoved Pinkie downward, at the same time, his wife widened her mouth to take in Pinkie's bound shoulders. Pinkie's head started to make a bulge going down Cup Cake's throat, also making muffled screams as it moved down disappearing past Mrs. Cake's shoulders. Slowly, Pinkie's torso was pushed in until her head breached the stomach's entrance. The scent of Cup Cake's acid stung her eyes and lungs, and, at this point, she started to struggle more than ever against the licorice ropes restraining her. Mr. Cake only smiled as the pink pony struggled for her life, easily suppressing her efforts with his strong form. Eventually, Mrs. Cake reached Pinkie's stomach, her throat now stretched with the upper torso. Pausing for only a second to breathe through her nose, she continued her gulping as Mr. Cake brought Pinkie's ass closer and closer to his wife's maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the couple reached Pinkie's large hips, Mr. Cake lowered her behind, causing Pinkie to kneel with the rest of her inside of Mrs. Cake. Pinkie, with half of her body inside of Mrs. Cake, made a noticeable protrusion in Cup Cake's belly. Carrot Cake rested his front hooves after carrying Pinkie's butt in the air for so long. He stood in front of Mrs. Cake, watching her dreamy stare at him with Pinkie's rump in her mouth. That vision was just too much for Mr. Cake to handle, so he stood on hind legs, put one hoof on Pinkie's butt cheeks as he guided his stone-hard dick with the other to Pinkie's vagina. Pinkie felt the intrusion on her lower half from inside Mrs. Cake's stomach, and started to yell. Carrot's wife only shot him one glance of approval before he thrust his long penis straight into Pinkie's tight hole. Finally, Pinkie's resistance was broken, as was her spirit, as she simply stared with tears in her wide-eyes into her dark confines. Carrot Cake grunted with every pump, feeling the tightness of the younger pony and enjoying it, since he hadn't felt a pussy like that in a long while. Over and over, Mr. Cake shoved his entire girth to the very hilt and slide it back all the way out before bringing himself fully inside again. With every hump, Pinkie's rump inched closer into Cup Cake's mouth as Carrot Cake came close to his limit. Pinkie's fluids steadily dripped out of her snatch, covering her legs and making them slick for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Carrot Cake began to quicken his pumping, and began to hump steadily faster, gripping Cup Cake's head as he fucked Pinkie's sex with all his strength. Cup Cake only moaned as more and more of Pinkie's backside was fucked inside. Then finally, Carrot forcefully shoved his entire length inside one last time before releasing his load, effectively pushing Pinkie's hips and ass in all the way into his wife's mouth. Carrot Cake pulled his length out of his wife's mouth, still dripping with cum, and lied back panting, looking at what was left of Pinkie, her hind legs and poofy tail. Mrs. Cake licked at the pink mare's pussy lips while her husband's cum flowed out, savoring the salty taste of the cream-filled pony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Mr. Cake stood up and gripped Pinkie's hooves with his own, and quickly and easily started to push the rest of the pink pony inside. The lubricated legs went down as Mrs. Cake gulped repeatedly, slurping them down as if they were noodles, while Pinkie's tail flowed in with the rest. Only Pinkie's hooves protruded from Mrs. Cake's mouth. They moved only slightly, because Pinkie was only then just recovering from the surprise bout of sex. Cup cake looked down at the hooves and then raised her head, closing her lips around the hooves and then swallowing them entirely. Carrot Cake saw the hooves go down his wife's gullet before disappearing past her torso and making the bulge in his wife's stomach expand the largest it's ever been. She brought her head down and belched quietly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake's licked her lips and smiled at Mr. Cake after having gulped Pinkie Pie entirely. She looked at the worn out pony in front of her and walked up to him all the while swinging her enormous belly to and fro, causing Mr. Cake to beam and harden another time. She lied down next to Carrot Cake, and let him feel her pony-filled belly. Just then, Pinkie awoke once more from her stupor to find that she had been fully consumed. The ropes of licorice had broken apart from the stomach acids, and now she was allowed to move more freely. She took off her ball-gag and started to shout with new-found strength, \"LET ME OUT, PLEASE OH PLEASE. DON'T DIGEST ME! HELP ME!\", all the while stretching and pushing at her confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Cake smiled as Cup Cake's belly started stretching and moving and yelling barely intelligible muffled screams. He hugged the struggling pony through his wife's stomach, loving the feel of Pinkie squirming. Mrs. Cake noticed Mr. Cake fully erect, began sucking on him while he embraced her huge belly. Eventually, he came a second time, and by now, Pinkie's struggles had died down. Cup Cake fully cleaned up her husband, enjoying his taste. She turned around and lied down with her husband. \"Thank you for the treat, Dearie.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mr. Cake was getting more aroused as the moment drew closer, his wife was now in front of the bound Pinkie Pie, who would soon be eaten and digested by Cup Cake. Just before her head was in biting distance, Cup Cake stopped all of the sudden. Carrot Cake was worried, did she have second thoughts about it now that her prey was in front of her? Pinkie Pie stared at them with pleading eyes, scared of what was to come. His wife though just flashed a smile. \"I have a better idea my dear, let's do something more... kinky.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrot Cake was confused at first as she turned around and went down, still keeping her rump raised. She reached behind her with her front hooves and spread her ass cheeks apart, presenting her anus to her meal for today. \"Get behind her and push her in through the backdoor.\" She instructed her husband. Carrot Cake was surprised at this. He was the one who suggested that his wife would eat somepony but he never thought she would be so kinky. The suggestion was effective though, as he went behind her his cock was getting rock hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got into position he had a clear view of his wifes anus, which was slightly opened. He grabbed Pinkie by her head and lifted it, which was difficult since the frightened mare squirmed and struggled. Those struggle though only made this more exciting. Mr. Cake managed to get a good grip and held her head still as he slowly placed the pink pony's muzzle against his wifes pucker. Pinkie tried to scream as her head was pushed into Cup Cakes intestine but she still couldn't do anything to save herself.  Mr. Cake was a little surprised, as Pinkies shoulders slipped in he could feel some sort of suction, pulling Pinkie in without his help. A sly grin crossed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake was lost in bliss as she felt the large pony inserted into her rectum. She too was a little surprised when her rear started to suck Pinkie in by itself but decided that it was probably because of the potion. Then she saw that her husband was in front of her again, his cock rock hard in directly in front of her face as he stood over her and sat down on his haunches. Mrs. Cake took the cue and started to suck his dick. Even though she already did this many times in their relationship, this time it was much better. Having Pinkie almost to her flanks inside of her rectum made the whole situation even more exciting and naughty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pinkies legs disappeared down Mrs. Cakes anus, her husband came and shot a salty, sticky load into her mouth. Somehow the potion made it taste even better and the fact that she almost finished Pinkie up added to the excitement. Cup Cake let her now heavy rump slump down on the ground and cleaned her husbands cum of his cock while Pinkie travelled towards her stomach. After a while she reached her destination, on the way the red licorice must have come off since she could feel her struggles now. At first she expected it to hurt, but it was more like the massage she had at the spa earlier. She laid on her back to show off her squirming belly to her husband, who began to drool at the sight of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrot Cake placed his head on his wifes stomach. At first he only heard muffled protests, but as a gurgling noise indicated that digestion has begun the sound was replaced by muffled screaming. Sadistic pleasure overtook the couple as Pinkie was being digested whole and alive. Mr. Cake had to hold his wifes stomach tightly as Pinkie thrashed around in it. After a few minutes if was over, Pinkie Pie stopped moving. Both of them were tired as Mr. Cake fell down next to his wife. This whole thing was so exciting, ending a life for the sake of their pleasure. Cup Cake looked at her husband and flashed him a sly grin.</span></div></div>",

Soon enough he disappeared completely into her, and with one last GULP he was just a nice big bulge in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Braaaaaaaap~ Ahhh~ Thank you dear~\" Mrs Cake rubbed her squirming stomach contently. \"We should have done this soooo long ago...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside, Mr Cake found himself struggling in the soft, warm, organic chamber that was his wife's stomach.

He could feel his eyelids slowly drooping as his wife's stomach noisily gurgled around him. </span></div></div>",

Nervously, the lanky unicorn made his way to her cart and stood in front of the door. He raised a shaking hoof, wondering if he was ready for such magnificence but finally he decided to knock. He heard the clopping of hooves on wooden floor from behind the door, they came closer until the top half of the door creaked open and revealed the most amazing unicorn of all times. \"What is it? Didn't I say I needed my beauty sleep?\" She looked down at the green maned unicorn, who gulped heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails tried to find the right words but could only stutter nervously. The presence of this great unicorn made him feel tiny, he wished he could be as amazing as her, he wished he could be her apprentice. \"What did you just ask?\" Apparently he accidentally said the last part out loud. \"You think you have what it takes to be the great and powerful Trixie's apprentice?\" Not knowing any better answer he simply nodded his head. Trixie scoffed but didn't seem to angry at him. \"You certainly have the confidence, let me tell you something, I will give you a test and if you pass I will make you my apprentice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails jaw hung open, did the great and powerful Trixie really just give him a chance to become her apprentice? \"That would be awesome, what is the test?\" He asked eagerly, a glimmer of excitement in his eyes. Trixie gave him a devious smile. \"You will prove that you are at least more powerful than one unicorn and that you are absolutely loyal to me. That other colt you were with earlier, find and eat him, come to me with a full and squirming belly as proof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails was shocked, did she just demand that he ate his friend? \"What are you waiting for? Go and get him.\" She demanded and Snails ran off immediately. While he ran, he thought about the test. Was it really worth eating Snips to become Trixies apprentice?</span></div></div>",

Psyc looked saddened \"S..Shining Armor... I believed in you!\" He said out loud but was interupted by Shining Armor forcing the red maned unicorn's head into his mouth Now only letting out a \"MMMMPH\" a muffled scream Psyc struggled against the powerful Shining Armor as he lifted him via telekenesis upward and held his front legs to his sides, leaving his back legs to kick in vein as he swallowed up past his shoulders... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPsyc couldnt believe he was being eaten like this... by the pony that was his lifelong idol... he wanted so badly to get out, to see his sister Trixie again, to see Rainbow Dash again, but Shining's barrier around his horn was unbreakable to him so all he could do is kick as he felt the slimy walls of Shining's throat envelop him and now his upper body. soon Shining swallowed past Psyc's Cutie Mark leaving only his legs frantically kicking and his tail waving back and forth, trying to find a way out... however soon those too slipped into the maw of Shining Armor and were swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPsyc was soon deposited into the stomach of his rolemodel and kicked against the walls, still unable to use magic. \"Now now, settle down, at least you'll be part of your idol\" Shining taunted as the acidic fluids filled his stomach, throwing a nausiating smell into Psyc's nose as he felt it burn his stallion anus, testacles, and cock. he struggled to avoid the urge to scream or cry as pain shot through his body, trying to maintain some dignity but he failed, screaming out in agony as his groin was mutilated by the acid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhis fur from his legs began to burn off as his flesh blistered and burned. His Cutie mark, his identity as a shield that protected, also burned away, leaving behind a pony that was covered in red blisters... soon his blue eyes melted from his skull as he was unfortuante to still be alive, his struggling slowed down. the acid licked at his brain as well as his internal organs pulverizing them and giving Psyc death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, you sure lasted a while\" Shining taunted... then decided to call in.</span></div></div>",

It was a Pegasi with white fur and a black mane with turquoise streaks and a wide grin on his face, though what really made him stand out was the garish multi-colored patchwork overcoat he wore. Shining Armor wanted to call him over right away, but then something caught his attention: the goggles on his forehead. The were distinctly the ones worn by the Wonderbolts. He felt a little nervous. If a Wonderbolt disappeared, somepony was sure to notice. He contemplated calling him in, deciding to do so. He could just ask him, after all and just give him an autograph if he turned out to be one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the stallion heard his name called, his face instantly lit up. He let out a squeal of delight and zoomed over to Shining's room at a speed that would suggest him bein a Wonderbolt. He burst through the door and almost fainted upon seeing the captain. \"Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh! It's Captain Shining Armor! I heard you'd be here, but I never thought I'd actually get to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining let out a chuckle. \"Well, today's your lucky day, I guess.\" He pointed at the goggles. \"If you don't mind me asking, where'd you get those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion blinked and looked up at them. \"Oh! Those were my dad's. He was captain of the Wonderbolts in his day.\" He smiled. \"My name's EC, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining mentally sighed in relief, though part of him actually felt bad for what he was about to do to the poor pony. \"Well, EC. You seem like a big fan, so I have something special for you.\" He used his magic to lock the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEC looked visibly nervous as the door was locked. \"What do you mean? ... I'm straight, sir ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining chuckled a little. \"You misunderstand. I'm not going to buck you. I just need to eat ponies occasionally to keep up my magic power. And you just look so tasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only a second for EC to put two and two together. But instead of panicking, he started laughing. \"If you want to eat me, all you have to do is ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining was confused at this point. \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEC blushed. \"Oh. Sorry. I should probably explain myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining nodded. \"Please do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEC chuckled. \"Well, other than my dad being a former Wonderbolt, there's another interesting thing about me. I'm a huge vorephile. My mom was too. She was also a gifted unicorn. She made me this coat and put a spell in it. Whoever wears it can regenerate those they eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis jogged something in Shining's head. \"Does that mean?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEC nodded. \"Yep. I've eaten a few ponies myself.\" He took off his coat revealing a gear Cutie Mark. \"If you want, you can borrow this so you can eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining breathed a sigh of relief. \"And I thouht I was going to have to kill somepony.\" He took the coat and slipped it on. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now naked stallion beamed. \"Yes sir! This is even better than an autograph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining chuckled. He liked his pony's enthusiasm. He'd have to put in a good word to Spitfire if he decided to follow in his father's footsteps. He cast the spell to alter his body to fit ponies in it, the opened his mouth and covered his head with his mouth. He decided since he was willing to be slow and gentle. He gradually worked himself up to the smaller pony's neck, the lifted him up in the air with his magic. He swallowed, taking in his shoulder and began to swallow his upper barrel. He swallowed again, taking in the rest of the barrel. He got a mischievous smile and playfully licked his stallionhood. He faintly heard EC protest this, but he just chuckled and swallowed his haunch, his legs and tail all that remained outside. He sat down and tilted his head back and allowed the rest of the pony to slide into his mouth. He closed his mouth around his feet and swallowed, giggleing as he felt him slide down his throat and into his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEC just enjoyed himself the whole way down. He didn't particularly like it when Shining licked his stallionhood, tryin to say. \"Hey, don't do that!\" Though the throat muscles being pressed in his face made it hard. Soon enough though, he was fully pulled inside and felt the powerful muscles squeeze him down into the stomach. He giggled and curled up in the large sack. \"So, how'd I taste?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining moaned and rubbed his gut. \"Simply divine. By the way, how do I regenerate you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEC smiled. \"After I digest, you just imagine what I look like and I'll regenerate at your hooves.\" He yawned and curled up tighter. \"I'm gonna nap while I digest, if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining smiled and rubbed. \"OK. Sleep tight.\" He giggled at the joke. After that, he sat there, rubbin the sleeping pony as he slowly began to softer like butter. After a few hours, the pony fully finished digesting, becoming nothing more than minerals in the captain's powerful stomach. Shining rembered what he was told and closed his eyes, imagining the pony in front of him. When he opened his eyes, the stallion was laying at his hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEC smiled up at Shining. \"That was fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining laughed. \"I may have to borrow this coat again in the future.\" He took off the coat and handed it to EC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEC smiled and put the coat on again. \"Be sure to call me during your next autograph session.\" He turned. \"So, can I leave? Or should I stick around?\"</span></div></div>",

As a new sun rose, Shining Armor followed his guardsman to the North side of the cliff. Night Wish handed him a telescope and pointed him to a small clearing in a dense forest below, thought the griffon encampment was so close that it was visible to the naked eye. Shining Armor began to count the enemy but Night Wish saved him the trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only twelve, sir,\" said the guardsman. \"We outnumber them three to one. We should attack, sir, while we have the element of surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor wasn't so sure. The reports had indicated a much greater number, and the ponies had lost the last few battle, so the enemy couldn't have suffered very many casualties. So if the griffon camp was only a detachment, where was the rest of the platoon? It seemed too convenient to Shining Armor. The griffons had no reason to split their forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, they have a prisoner,\" Night Wish pointed to gold pony being led to the enemy captain by three griffons. \"Sir, it's one of our scouts. It's Sun Shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun Shower had bruises and bloody claw marks all over his body. Stripped of his armor and beaten into submission, Sun Shower followed his griffon captors without resistance. Through the telescope, Shining Armor saw terror in his scouts eyes as threw him at the feet of their captain. The blood drained from Shining Armor's face and his stomach turned with disturbed realization as the griffin captain licked her lips. Sun Shower wasn't a prisoner, he was breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, we have to attack now. They're going to eat him!\" Night Wish was frantic. \"Oh dear Celestia, he's just a kid! HE'S JUST A KID!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Shining Armor had to keep his cool. The griffon encampment was an obvious ploy. There was probably a hundred griffon's laying in wait within the surrounding forest. For all Shining Armor knew, Sun Shower was just the griffon's attempt to draw the ponies in. Shining Armor had to thoroughly scout the area before he even considered attack. But, by the time the area could be thoroughly scouted, the scout would be thoroughly digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be eaten by the enemy was the most humiliating death for soldier. To die only to serve the enemies hunger was profound violation, and to be reduced until there was nothing substantial or dignified left to return home was even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor had to choose, and quickly. Was to follow his heart and save his soldier, or was he to follow his mind and hold back.</span></div></div>",

He called his squad together and shouted orders. \"Pegasi and alicorns; attack from above! Earth ponies; attack through the mountain pass! And unicorns; follow the earth ponies, keep them shielded with magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ponies charged, and reached the griffon camp in the nick of time. Sun Shower was halfway down the enemy captain's throat, but she quickly spit him out when she spotted the oncoming attack. The stallions fought bravely, and it looked like victory was at hand, but Shining Armor's suspicions proved to be well founded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than a hundred griffon soldier sprung from the forest and surround the ponies. The pegasi and alicorns were quickly knocked out of the sky and devoured before they had a chance to recover from the impact; many of the earth ponies were able to land a few good hits but they all eventually suffered a similar fate; the unicorns shielded themselves but the griffons swallowed them anyway. Magic would protect the unicorns for a little while but it was only a matter of time before their captor's stomachs won out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armour fought desperately when, suddenly, his combatants stepped back to form a wide circle around him. Looking around, the pony captain searched for his troops but, after a few final gulps, nothing remained of his squad but the bulges in griffon bellies. Shining Armor could only watch in horror, as his stallions squirmed as they were slowly digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enemy captain stepped forward with a cruel smile on her face. She was holding Sun Shower by the leg like a great hunk of meat. The saliva soaked scout struggled in the griffon's powerful grip, but to no avail. \"All this, your entire squad, just for one measly pony,\" she said with contempt. \"It appears that ponies are less intelligent than we suspected. It seems like food is the only thing you are really good for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as if to demonstrate her point, the griffon captain threw Sun Shower in the air and caught him in her beak. The poor pony squired in her mouth but, after a few quick snaps of her beak, Sun Shower was eaten alive. Sun Shower continued to struggle in the griffin's stomach, but his efforts were only rewarded with a condescending pat from his predator before the griffin returned her attention to Shining Armor. To add insult to injury, the satisfied griffon let out a rancid belch directly into Shining Armor's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a message for your princess. Tell her that we griffon's are not unreasonable. We only ask for a few hundred ponies.\" The griffin licked her lips, savoring Sun Shower's flavor. \"Give us enough ponies to farm as livestock and we will have no reason to attack your villages any more. I'm sure the ponies of Canterlot will gladly trade a few low born ponies to keep themselves safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor shook with anger. The idea of breeding ponies only to be eaten was the most disgusting thing he had ever heard. But what disturbed Shining Armor even more was the thought that the Canterlot ponies would sacrificing others to save their own skins. It disturbed Shining Armor so much because he knew that a lot of the Canterlot ponies WERE that callous. But, there was little Shining Armor could do but deliver the message. He slowly withdrew from the camp and the sated griffons let him past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and please don't send for reinforcements,\" the griffon captain said before Shining Armor left. \"Your armies are making my soldiers fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor wanted to snap her neck for that, but he couldn't let himself die before he made his report to Celestia. When he returned to his deserted camp, Shining Armor wrote his report and considered whether or not he should request for reinforcements. It would take at least three weeks for them to arrive so there was no saving his lost soldiers, but that didn't mean he should give up the fight just yet. However, after such a devastating defeat, it might be best to return to Canterlot and regroup. Tactics needed to be discussed before rushing into battle, and a discussion wasn't really possible when communicating via carrier pigeon.</span></div></div>",

He was never the sort to leave things unfinished, no matter how bleak things got. Besides, if he left for home now, the Griffons would be able to pass through the shortest route to Canterlot. But there was still the matter of his crushing, humiliating defeat at the proverbial hands of an enemy committing an amateur prank. Although it shamed him to do so, Shining Armor knew that he'd never get the troops he needed unless he lied to his princesses. Victims became Prisoners of War, reinforcements meant to avenge the fallen were instead coming to liberate the captives, the Griffon captain's \"offer\" was omitted &amp; other details were changed to ensure he'd get the help he needed to beat back the enemy here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tying the letter to the pigeon's leg, he sent it off towards its destination. \"I hope this works...forgive me, men, but I can't retreat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shall I take this to mean that you truly think you can win, sir Armor?\" The unicorn felt a chill run up his spine as he heard the Griffon captain's voice, and as he turned his head, his face became flush with anger again. There stood the enemy commander, flanked by two foot-soldiers. \"Perhaps he thinks to feed us so many of his soldiers that we get sick of eating them?\" One of them said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<b>Yoouu!</b>\" Shining Armor hissed past gritted teeth, preparing a barrier spell in case one of the loathsome curs rushed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<b>Mee!</b>\" The Griffon leader mirrored his countenance in a mocking fashion. \"I hope you aren't foolish enough to try and fight all three of us at once. Even if you are my equal in battle, I've given my soldiers strict orders to send for help if they see I'm in the slightest hint of danger, and I am honor-bound to do the same for them. And unlike you ponies, it doesn't get us beaten.\" The insult caused Shining Armor to snort angrily. \"But I forget myself, We did not come here to rub salt in the wound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that, one of the soldiers stepped forward and addressed Shining Armor directly, without regard to ceremony or protocol. \"The captain thought that she was hasty in demanding such steep terms in her offer, and would like to invite you to stay at our camp while the two of you discuss things more thoroughly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Buck you, buck your captain and buck! her! offer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We understand your reluctance, but I assure you on the captain's behalf that no harm would come to you during your stay. You'd be treated as an honored guest; three hot meals a day, your own private tent, not to mention, you'd have someone to talk to while you wait for your reinforcements.\" The soldier continued. \"A camp full of unwelcome company is always better than a camp filled with no company at all, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining Armor took a moment to consider this. This could be just another obvious trap, but he always did his best to avoid being lonely and having nothing to do. If the Griffons were sincere, however, this could be a chance to talk them down from ever enacting their brutal plan for his people, but on the other hoof, now that they knew where he was, what was to stop them from dragging him away in the night, leaving a completely deserted camp for soldiers there under false pretenses to find?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And if I refuse your offer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The captain stepped forward to answer. \"Then we shall leave you alone. Neither I or my soldiers will inform anyone of your whereabouts. But should any wild animals or, say, a scouting party happen upon here, then you will have to fend for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining Armor did not like either of the choices offered to him. Wait here, alone, for the better part of a month completely at the mercy of the Griffons' sense of honesty, or spend that same amount of time sleeping among the enemy, listening to their snide comments about how enjoyable it is to devour his kinsman - while also at the mercy of the Griffons' sense of honesty...</span></div></div>",

It was pointless to ask for reinforcements, they would share the fate of his last platoon and he did not want to lead more good soldiers to their deaths. Shining Armor shuddered as he sent the pigeon off, imagining the how horrible it is. His soldiers were now in the enemies guts, slowly and painfully dissolved by their stomach acids. With an empty feeling in his mind he made his way back towards Canterlot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later he was back in Canterlot. The princesses wanted to speak to him in court. Shining Armor felt bad, completely and utterly bad, as he walked towards them. Shame, guilt, anger and sadness surged through his mind. The princesses seemed to share his feelings, judging from the look on their faces as he approached. At the side, the nobles displayed various emotions. Some seemed disappointed, some showed pity and Shining Armor cringed as he saw a mixture of fury and sorrow, no doubt from parents of some of the soldiers that were under his command. Finally he reached the throne and bowed down to Celestia and Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older princess started to speak. \"Shining Armor, we have received your troubling report on the battle. It is a very dark day that so many good soldiers lost their lifes.\" Losing their lifes was maybe one of the dangers that came natural with this profession but Celestia still had to cringe when she thought about how those poor stallions were eaten whole and alive. \"We have also received the gryphons demands, to have hundreds of ponies given to them for...livestock.\" At these words, the room exploded into a cacophony of voices, two of them standing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is great, we just give them some of the lowly peasants and those beasts will leave us alone.\" Said prince Blueblood with a smug, self satisfied smile. Shining Armor wanted to ram this prince down a gryphons throat but the worst part was that some other nobles were agreeing with him. Others however didn't. \"I dearly hope that that was just one of your many bad jokes. We should fight to the last pony before surrendering only one pony to them. I'd rather volunteer myself and die than live, knowing that hundreds of ponies are suffering a fate worse than death because of that.\" Scolded Fancy Pants, some nobles agreeing with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia and Luna watched the chaos for a few moments before princess Luna took a deep breath and used her royal Canterlot voice. \"BE STILL!\" Immediately the entire room went quiet. Celestia also took a deep breath but not to shout, but to think. If they agreed to the gryphons terms, hundreds of ponies would suffer unimaginably. They would wake each day, fearing that it would be their last before a nearby gryphon wanted a snack. Mares would be impregnated over and over again, knowing their foals were nothing but food for their captors. Still, it did not look good for their armies... Celestia finally decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We'll give them what they want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor and Fancy Pant's were horror-struck, but the majority were relieved. Shining Armor could only stare in disbelief as the council discussed which settlement they would give up to the griffon's. \"Ponyville is the most obvious choice,\" said Prince Blueblood. \"It is of no tactical advantage, and the ponies who live there are of no importance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Shining Armor shouted with rage. Ponyville was his sister's home. \"You callous brute, you'll take Ponyville over my dead body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" snapped Luna. \"Blueblood is right. If we must sacrifice a village, Ponyville is the wisest choice. The loss of any other town would compromise our defenses. Ponyville is the only settlement we can afford to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, Shining Armor stared daggers at Blueblood, but the prince did not return his anger. In fact, the expression on Prince Blueblood's face was something very close to sympathy. \"If you are worried about your sister, then there is no reason for concern,\" the prince said in a reassuring tone. \"Twilight Sparkle is a citizen of Canterlot. We'll have her escorted home before we hand the village over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't enough. Twilight may be saved, but she would never forgive Shining Armor if he let her friends become livestock. \"But, Your Majesty,\" Shining Armor turned to Celestia. \"We can't do this to our people. We have a responsibility. You can't just hand over your subjects as if they were property.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The decision is already made, Shining Armor,\" a flash of anger crossed Celestia's face. \"Your inability to separate your heart and mind has already cost many ponies their lives. You will be silent for the remainder of this council.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia's words struck like a blade of ice through Shining Armor's heart. Many hate filled glares were directed at the pony captain as arrangements were made. Guilt ridden, Shining Armor shrank away and held his tongue, as Celestia had commanded. When the details of the hand over were all worked, the council was adjourned, but Celestia asked Shining Armor to remain. In private, Celestia told him, \"I'm stripping you of your rank, Shining Armor. You failed to recognize and obvious trap, and your entire squad paid the price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were going to eat one of my stations,\" Shining Armor weakly protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have let them. Instead, you let forty six ponies share his fate,\" said Celestia coldly. \"I can't risk placing anypony else under your command, so from now on you work alone. I want you to be a spy, Shining Armor. The griffon's will need help to secure Ponyville, so they will tolerate the presence of a few royal guards. They may even let them stay if our guards can prove themselves useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to help trap ponies so that griffon's can eat them at their leisure,\" Shining Armor was horrified by the idea. \"Just to prove myself useful to the enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what a spy must do,\" said Celestia. \"You are a valuable soldier, but if you can't stomach these kinds of things, then I will be forced to dismiss you from the royal guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia didn't give Shining Armor much choice, but if he accepted he would have to watch ponies being devoured without lifting a hoof to intervene. However, the only alternative was to lay down his armor and do nothing at all.</span></div></div>",

And, of course, the griffons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded.  \"At this time, the griffons had been on our side against Discord, their air corps flew wing to wing with our own pegasi warriors.  Our first ambassador to the Griffons was a pegasus named... Silver Tornado.  Brash, young, a veteran of the war who had fought side by side with griffons, and could speak to them as a comrade.  And we knew the griffons ate meat even then, but it did not occur to us that they would have no food suitable for a pony at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know, my little ponies, we cannot truly eat meat.  Those adventurous few who have tried it merely became ill.  Silver Tornado bore her hunger with dignity and pride, but was aware that her refusal to dine with our then-allies was becoming an insult to them.  Then, the Zebra ambassador to the Griffons arrived.  And to Silver Tornado's astonishment, the Zebra gladly dined with the Griffons, although she did not swallow her meals live as they did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia continued.  \"Zebras are very distant cousins of ours.  Most of you probably have never even registered having seen one.  They resemble an earth pony with a black and white striped coat.  And they, like ponies, do not eat meat as a rule, although their digestive systems are a bit more hearty than ours, as their homelands are harsher than Equestria.  But, where we have learned the magical arts, the Zebras have mastered the art of the potion, used both for magical and medical purposes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna took up the tale again.  \"The Zebra ambassador noticed Silver Tornado's discomfort, and shared with her a potion.  In Zebras, the potion merely allowed them to digest small animals, such as rodents and fish, and therefore a greater chance to survive famine.  But in an Equestrian pony, the potion had an unexpected side effect.  Silver Tornado's entire digestive system adapted to be able to eat in the Griffon fashion, larger meals.  Living meals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, there is a very high price,\" Celestia pointed out.  \"Silver Tornado was so changed by the potion, as to require meat for the rest of her life.  She could eat pony foods, but she could not survive on it alone.  After she returned from her duty as Ambassador, we did our best to help cure her, and failed.  We then did our best to find... acceptable foods for her.  Her diet horrified other ponies, especially when they learned she was physically capable - although certainly not capable emotionally - of swallowing a full sized pony.  Ultimately, she left Equestria, and was never heard from again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna pulled a book from a shelf.  \"Knowledge of the potion is banned.  Even the Zebras have, in the long years since, mostly forgotten the recipes and rituals for it.  But, we are aware of one master Zebra potionmaker who has the ability to brew this formula.  And, the Zebras gave us the recipe when we asked for it, in our efforts to cure Silver Tornado.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If any of you takes this potion, you will gain the ability to eat the gryphons.  But it is as much a potion as a curse.  You will not merely be able to eat them.  You will enjoy it.  And you may need to eat a very large amount of meat for the rest of your life.  There are also physical changes.  You may grow slightly taller.  You will almost certainly grow rounder as you eat, and the larger you grow, the larger your appetite will become.  In light of our emergency, I will unseal the knowledge of the potion, and summon the potionmaker to brew it.  But, I cannot and will not order anyone to drink it - doing so will virtually end your life as a normal pony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Braeburn blinked in horror as he stepped out of the darkness of the night, entering the apple orchard. Each tree was now of dark wood and had leaves as dark green as cucumbers, with little red veins in them. The apples were large, luscious red, and full of vitamins... But not for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the darkness were glowing eyes. Braeburn dared not look at them as they shuffled off into the night. It was the tribe of total darkness, a strange herd of buffalo that lived underground. The local tribe  of buffalo that Braeburn and his town had once feuded with didn't even like to discuss the tribe of total darkness. This tribe, they had heard, had strange eating habits. They did not have to eat. At all. Ever. They <i>chose</i> to eat. And they did not eat with their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Braeburn had known, other than the fact that the buffalo had magical powers despite not having magical horns like the unicorns of his race. A drought was on, and the ponies were finding themselves unable to keep the trees alive. Even if the ponies let themselves die of thirst and gave all the water to the trees, the trees too would perish quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like the town was finished, until Braeburn had dared to go find the subterranean buffalo. He ventured for over a week into the desert, crossing painfully homogenous hardpan until hitting a single mountain jutting out of the otherwise utterly flat landscape. It's shape was too triangular, like such a child might draw. He'd climbed the mountain's foothills, only having to go up about twenty percent of the way before finding a cave, the entrance of which was shaped like a gash. He'd entered and wandered down a path that continuously sloped into the earth. He wasn't sure how many hours he had walked before discovering that he was in a large antechamber--impossibly large and so dark that even with a lantern he hadn't realized he'd entered and been trapped in such empty space for a long time... that... or there was something else at work in that place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the buffalo came. They offered him food and asked were hospitable to him. They had been terrifying, with their glowing pure white eyes and strange fur. Their fur had been brown at the start, and an almost luminescent blue at the tips, and green on the rest of the hair. But they listened ot his plight, and offered him a solution. All he had to do was drink from their fountain, and then wish for his orchard to partake upon the water from the fountain as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had done so... and that was when his cock became larger. He was a modest pony before, and like most colts their cocks weren't really noticeable until they were aroused, but he suddenly found himself with a cock so large that he couldn't even dream of being arrogant about it, it only terrified him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will eat with your penis as we do,\" said the buffalo in unison. \"And use your semen to feed your orchard. No other sustenance can now sustain it--nothing. But to produce the semen you need, you will have to eat those of your own species, and upon doing so, produce more semen than their individual body mass a hundred fold, magically contained within your testicles so that you remain mobile even after consecutive meals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken no less than seven reiterations of this fact to make Braeburn understand and accept his predicament... and then, all of a sudden, he was top ground, walking into the orchard without realizing how he'd gotten moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he heard a voice... someone else, someone from the village was in the orchard with him now... either by dumb luck, some form of providence, or because the orchard or tribe of total darkness had willed it to be so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA test run...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraeburn approached the sound of the voice, his heart hammering in his chest.

It was hard not to have feelings for Miss Afternoons, she had such a pretty voice. He didn't have an analogy for it, because he did not want to compare it to a bird or something like a flute, because her voice was so richly <i>pony</i>. It was so organic and genuine that it made a hard-working stallion happy to walk on four hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Afternoons?\" he asked, trotting up to her. He took off his hat, trying to be polite, but also balanced the stetson on his hoof and let it hang over his crotch to cover his newly engorged member. \"What are you doing out this late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare turned her gaze to him and smiled. \"Braeburn? I'm sorry, I hope you don't think I was stealin'. I fancied a walk--isn't it a beautiful night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up. Yes, he could see them now as he paid attention--he could see the stars, but only while looking directly at him. Now that he thought about it, it seemed like a darkness lurked over his vision, shadowing out his peripheral and making him only look straight ahead... Perhaps a part of the curse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at her, the shadow over his vision enhancing his focus on her... He felt his cock twinge. He gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very pretty,\" he said. \"Why, about as pretty as yerself, if you don't mind me saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed and made a small, calmly smile. She batted her eyes. \"What a kind thing of you to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, but grimaced as he felt his cock throb. During the course of the conversation he had become aroused and felt his cock poke his hat out of the way. He looked quickly, gasped in horror, and tried to recover it with his hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFair Afternoons had a look of shock on her face after having seen the stallion sporting an erection in her midst, particularly one so large.</span></div></div>",

Although, I'm glad yer not making a strong effort to get away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clenched his teeth as he felt his cock give a mighty tug, suckling up the mare to her shoulders. He backed up, his cock pulling her onto her knees, then he proceeded to buck his hips. Her shoulders were wedged into him without too much effort, but getting her knees and front hooves in took some doing as the mare kept stumbling on her back legs. They were like jelly! He had to work his way over to a tree and push her ass against the bark, bracing himself against the tree as well. With his forelegs on the tree and his back legs spread wide, he continued to hump against the mare and feed her to his shaft. He was able to make stronger thrusts now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Celestia fuck me, this shouldn't feel nearly this good!\" he growled, watching his tip approaching her dock. \"Darn buffalo... darn curse. If I get to like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and tipped his head back. His cock suckled in her hips, making her cutie marks vanish, followed by her thighs. The weight of the pony submerged in his throbbing shaft weighed him down, but by this time there was enough pony in there that the cock was able to start eating on its own. Fair Afternoon's head and shoulders were already tucked into his balls by the time her shins were vanishing into him. Braeburn held his breath, feeling her get pulled along until her form no longer bulged out his cock. His nutsack was huge now, large enough to sit on. He sat down on the testicle occupied with the mare, who was wiggling inside her prison weakly. He didn't think she was enjoying herself, but she seemed to accept her fate eerily well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraeburn let out his breath and panted, his light orange hair sticking to the sweat on his neck. He wondered if it would be safe for him to take a nap while his balls churned over her, and how long that would take for that matter... as long as no one caught him before he had a chance to, quite literally, sow his seeds in the grove.</span></div></div>",

Even after all the hard work the ponies of Appleoosa put into it, the orchard was still a failure, there was no food anywhere. Most ponies, including sherrif Silverstar had up and left. The horrid dry season was torturing him as he watched his jard work wither and die. With a groan he picked himself up off the ground and looked around his modest home, no food, even the furniture had bite marks out of desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing his hat by the door he made his way outside and across the street to the saloon, at least he could get something to drink there. Nudging open the swinging doors he saw only another remaining resident of Appleoosa; a miss Peach Pit, standing byehind the counter, looking as lovely as ever. Although everyone believed he were more into Stallions, Braeburn actually quite enjoyed the company of mares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why good mornin' to ya Mister Braeburn\" she said to him with a sultry glance. He blushed, tipping his hat to her as he walked forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good t'see ya Miss Peach,\" as he got closer he noticed the sweet aroma of Golden Delicious apples coming from the onlooking mare, the corners of his mouth moistened with drool \"you smell... Delicious today\". She blushed nodding softly at the unorthodox compliment, leaning over the bar's countertop to let him get a better smell. It was almost intoxicating, he felt as the scent washed over him. Without thinking he leaned closer and gave the mare a soft lick, and to his surprise she tasted delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moments were near instantaneous, as if working on instinct Breaburn lauched forward spreading his maw wide and too the surprised Peach Pit's head into his mouth. She tried to scream but she was too restricted by the confines of his hot mouth to do anything. Braeburn ran his tongue under her chin shuddering at the taste before swallowing and moving himself forward. He quickly sucked down the mare's front hooves and torso, rolling onto his back to allow his slowly growing stimach room to stretch. The back legs he had dangling from his mouth were easily gulped down despite their kicking and with a long slurp of the leftover tail Peach Pit was tucked inside Braeburn's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Golly... That sure was surprising\" he said out loud as his hooves gently massaged his churning gut, \"But Ah must say y'all sure were tasty and fillin MIss Pit, I wonder how other ponies taste...\" He let that idea stew in hid brain while his meal stewed in his belly.

Pretty much everybody in Appleloosa was here\u2026 but the atmosphere wasn\u2019t exactly celebratory. It was all quite serious! The sheriff of Appleloosa, Silverstar, had called for a town meeting to discuss a grave problem facing the town\u2026 bandits! A whole pack of bandits right outside of town, no doubt plotting Appleloosa\u2019s downfall! Now, lesser towns would probably call the princesses to deal with this\u2026 but the proud Appleloosas weren\u2019t the type to turn to the \u2018gubmint\u2019 for help! Once everypony\u2019d settle in, they were hushed by the sight of their venerable sheriff hopping onto a table to deliver his speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, listen up, folk, and listen up good!\u201d The sheriff's voice pierced through the salon, as the townsponies look on in reverence. \u201cRight outside these walls, we are dealing with\u2026 miscreants! Rascals! Outlaws! And these ponies think they can just trot all over us Appleloosans!\u201d Just the thought of that seemed to cause a stir in the crowd, with some ponies shouting, \u2018no way!\u2019. \u201cYer darn tootin! Appleloosans ain\u2019t never gonna jus\u2019 roll over to get stepped on! We form mobs\u2026 burn stuff\u2026 knock stuff over, like Celestia intended! Now, mah finest deputies are already right on these ne\u2019er-do-well\u2019s trail\u2026 but I say we oughtta send more ponies out to help em! Snuff out this bandit problem quick and easy! What do y\u2019all say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd somewhere in the crowd of ponies, starstruck, was probably one of the most proud Appleloosans there ever was\u2026 Braeburn! He immediately started hopping up and down, trying to catch the sheriff's attention as everypony volunteered at once! \u201cOooo! Oooo! Me! Over here! Over here!\u201d He said, raising his hoof. Everybody else was eager, but he was almost uncomfortably eager even among them, even hip checking another stallion out of the way in his eagerness to be noticed. \u201cMememe! Pick me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheriff frowned, knowing that he\u2019d have to choose Braeburn just out ot fear of how he might react if he didn\u2019t. \u201cAh! Braeburn! You\u2019ve always been an upstanding stallion\u2026 I think. Here, I hereby-\u201c He says, uncertainly, as he slaps a big, shiny deputy badge on Braeburn\u2019s vest. What he didn\u2019t expect was for Braeburn to gasp loudly\u2026 and rush forward, squeezing him into a hug! \u201cOof! Oh, uh\u2026 settle down there, sonny! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know that Braeburn had dreamed of becoming deputized like this! \u201cI won\u2019t let you down, sheriff!\u201d He said, as he finally stepped back to give the uncomfortable sheriff some space. He didn\u2019t even pay attention as Silverstar set about deputizing various other towns ponies, as he was preoccupied with daydreaming about what his new deputy adventures would be like\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Next Day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, these ain\u2019t some two-bit purch snatchers. These are real deal bandits! So we\u2019re gonna hafta be smart about this\u2026 put our natural Appleloosan intellect to the test!\u201d The sheriff said to all the deputies waiting behind him. They were perched on a cliff, with their sheriff looking through binoculars at the valley below. \u201cI can see their encampment right down there! About 15 heads!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo, can I see? Lemme see?\u201d Overexcitable as always, Braeburn snatches the binoculars the moment it seemed Silverstar wasn\u2019t using them anymore, eagerly staring through them hoping to get a glimpse of the bandits below. \u201cOooh, yeah, they look tough. But we can take em!\u201d The sheriff seemed a little perturbed by this new interrupted, but he coughed it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway\u2026 I\u2019m gonna need everypony to split into pairs! Pick off the bandits on the outskirts of the camp, before we make our move!\u201d The sheriff declares, and Braeburn instantly scans around, looking through the crowd for the perfect partner. He can choose one of the sheriff\u2019s full-time deputies\u2026 or he can choose one of his fellow deputized stallions from the crowd\u2026 or even a mare...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Apple Bloom had found the best book on cutie marks yet! ... The only problem was that it was impossible to read. It was a very complex book with lots of big words, and she had a dictionary and thesaurus on hoof just so she could translate it, sentence by sentence. Even then it was slow going and pretty complicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd tried just about everything she could think of to try and get a cutie mark, so once again she had turned to outside experience to try and inspire her. It was hard to ignore a title like \"History of the Understand and Interpretation of Cutie Marks--Evolution of the Modern Theory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was just hard to understand. There was so much that didn't make sense. Since it was also a history book she skipped most of the history part and got to the theory part, but it kept covering things she didn't care about, like how ponies names given to them at birth often have something to do with the cutie mark they get. She thought that part would be helpful for sure, but then it, in so many words, basically said \"What a coincidence!\" cuz it spent a whole section on listing ponies whose names and marks were completely unrelated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was just the stuff on pigments and other weird stuff, basically on how and why a cutie mark forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom sighed and hit her head on the library table. \"Okay lemme just look at mah notes again...\" She pulled it over and started looking at the bullet points of what she could make sense of.<br>\r\nPonies names and marks aren't always related.<br>\r\nA pony's special talent can be one thing, or it can be many things that are similar to one another.<br>\r\nA pony's special talent can be simple, or it can be abstract (new word!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbstract. Apple Bloom figured that was like Cheerilee's cutie mark. It was flowers, but it really meant teaching, \"helping her students bloom\". Apple Bloom was beginning to think her cutie mark was abstract. Doing a bunch of things probably wasn't going to help if it was abstract, and was why she hadn't gotten it yet. Remembering that getting one's cutie mark last ran in the family, she figured Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle would get their cutie marks before she got hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny Smith... apple pie, but really good at making zap apple jam... Applejack... apples. Good at a lot of things involvin' apples... like baking. Ah can't cook though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at the list.<br>\r\nPonies sometimes know ahead what their passion is, but do not get their cutie marks right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one bugged her. It reminded her that Sweetie Belle's sister was already trying to do fashion before she got her cutie mark. So that probably meant that Apple Bloom could figure out what her cutie mark will be, but still not get it. It made her want to kick something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom wasn't completely stupid. She could admit to herself when she was a bone head, but she took Twilight's advice and practiced, in private, anything she'd ever been good at. She rebuilt Winowa's dog house, helped fix a piano, made bird houses with Fluttershy and did even better than the animal keeper herself... The book said that even if you figure out what your talent is, you won't get your mark until you understand all aspects of it. Apple Bloom already knew that she was good at building and fixing things, but what else was there to understand if that wasn't enough to understand her cutie mark? If it isn't just building, and is more abstract than that, what else could it mean?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The library was pretty empty today. Twilight and Rarity were working on something in her lab, and the loud noises had deterred the two other ponies who'd come in since this morning, other than Apple Bloom herself. She was growing bored and figured it was time to take a break, so she went downstairs to go bother them. She headed into the basement, where a great waft of scents was in the air. She snuck up behind the two unicorns focusing on a beaker and a tray of various herbs obtained from Zecora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi girls!\" she said, and made the two unicorns jump. Some of their ingredients, hovered in the air, fell onto the table. A single technicolored berry fell into a brown sludge on the burner and disappeared from sight, but went unnoticed. The two unicorns looked back at Apple Bloom angrily and then started scrounging up their ingredients, including more of the technicolored berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything here?\" asked Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think so,\" said Rarity, looking around. \"Disaster averted! Apple Bloom, shouldn't you be with my sister, or your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! Sweetie Belle is doin' somethin' with yer mom and dad, Scootaloo is practicin' flyin' with Rainbow, and Applejack's makin' applejack and Ah'm not allowed to be around that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go back upstairs and study some more?\" asked Twilight, keeping her eyes on her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah need some fresh air!\" said Apple Bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a basement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smells good though,\" said Apple Bloom. \"What are ya'll doin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two unicorns hesitated, then sighed in unison. \"Rarity asked if I knew a spell that would make her irresistible to stallions, but then we decided we'd take a more scientific approach and make it a perfume that she could just put on and wash off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm!\" noised Rarity, reveling in how much more freedom such a thing would offer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irresistible?\" asked Apple Bloom. \"Like... Zap Apple jam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not like Zap Apple jam,\" said Rarity, frowning. \"More like... <i>a perfect swan</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't like swans,\" said Apple Bloom. \"Sure you wanna be like a swan? They're kinda mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two unicorns tried to ignore her while studying their brown sludge in the large beaker. Twilight and Rarity added a few flower petals and a powdered chemical, stirred, and suddenly the sludge turned an attractive shade of green, like fresh grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh!\" Rarity said with delight and leaned closer. She took a sniff. \"Mmmm... it smells, heavenly. Like... Oh like creme brulee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it smells like donuts!\" said Twilight. Rarity looked at her incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom looked closer at the green sludge and frowned. Somehow... she could just sense that something was wrong with it. It wasn't what its supposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't think it worked. That's supposed to be perfume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're going to have to water it down, this is the concentrated form of our scent,\" said Rarity. \"Then we bottle it up and I'll have enough to last me forever! All I need is a few drops in a single bottle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom thought about it, then shook her head. \"Naw that's not what Ah mean. Its just... Its just wrong, Ah can tell.\" Though Apple Bloom hadn't forgotten the time she made a love potion that almost ruined her brother's life, she had made the potion correctly, just underestimated its purpose. Since then, she'd studied a little with Zecora on potions, and the zebra had commended Apple Bloom for having an usually sharp mind for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Apple Bloom but...\" began Rarity. \"But this is a complicated art, not something a filly would understand. Isn't that right Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was smelling it. \"Mmmm... I could just eat it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity blinked. \"Still I'm sure nothing is wrong with my perfume. Now, be a dear and run along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom huffed up. \"Hey now, just cuz Ah'm a filly doesn't mean Ah'm not smart! Yer little jar of sludge is just off. Ah'm good at makin' all kinds of things, so why can't Ah be able to tell when they weren't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight, still smelling the sludge, suddenly backed away. \"Oh heaven's she's right. It should be a light pink. Its supposed to play off a pony's pheromones and make a pony smell like how another pony thinks is really attractive. This is just playing off of what sweet things we like to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom smiled. \"Yeah! Cuz its smells like apple treacle tart to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?' whined Rarity, looking at the sludge again. \"Oh, foo. And I was planning on going out tonight... I guess we should dump it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we can just eat it, its nontoxic!\" said Twilight greedily, sniffing the formula again. She ahhed and backed away. \"We followed the recipe closely, we just might have overcooked something and weakened it. So it won't have any negative repercussions whatsoever. I'll go get a spoon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you're really going to eat that mess,\" said Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey can't Ah have some, you were gonna spray that stuff on yerself if Ah hadn't stopped you...\" said Apple Bloom, whose tummy was beginning to growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blinked, then blushed. \"Well I guess you're right, you did help Apple Bloom. Would you like to try some too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure Twi! If'n it's safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it is,\" she said and levitated the beaker and started upstairs. Apple Bloom and Rarity followed her but once upstairs Rarity said goodbye and left, not wanting to try the green sludge that smelled like sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went into the kitchen and sat down, with Twilight getting Apple Bloom a nice big spoon and bowl. They split the beaker evenly between each other. Apple Bloom sniffed the green sludge, which kind of looked like a pudding now that she thought about it, and gave it a big sniff. Her tummy growled eagerly. \"Hmmm! My stars, this smells incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it does!\" Twilight said eagerly, and the two ponies began to stuff their faces with the green pudding. It tasted amazing, and both of them were getting it all over their faces, murring and licking their lips between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mm good... Um Apple Bloom, that was nice work, how did you tell the formula was wrong?\" Twilight asked around her spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom lifted her face from her bowl and grinned. \"Ah dunno! It just didn't seem right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight giggled and took another bite of her pudding. \"Well it seems like your special talent might be a little more complicated than I gave credit for. I thought you just needed to realize that trying a little bit of everything, instead of what you were good at, was not going to get you anywhere. I thought I knew what your talent was already, but I guess I was wrong. You're good at a lot of things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom frowned as she started swallowing the last few dollops of her green sludge. \"You thought? And you didn't tell me? Well that was mean of ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" said Twilight. She started scraping up the last of her pudding and licking it off the spoon, before lifting her bowl up with her magic and beginning to lick it clean, just as Apple Bloom was. Neither were in the mood for manners it seemed. \"It sounds like your talent has to do with anything regarding structure and order. I wouldn't know what a cutie mark for structural integrity would be, but I guess you just need to keep making and fixing things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how do Ah do that,\" said Apple Bloom, putting her bowl down and burping. \"Keeping things whole and right? That's really mah talent? Each of your friends and yerself had like, some big moment that got you your cutie mark. But that book Ah read said most ponies just sort of... wake up and have it a lot of the time. Ah don't know what to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I said you just need to wait! Even if you know your talent, you just need to be patient,\" said Twilight. Apple Bloom frowned. \"Well Ah guess A'll just be headin' off now. Maybe Ah will just wake up with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom went home, did a few chores, and went to bed. She had a strange dream that she was made of candy, and that she ate herself, but then she grew back because she was so good at remaining whole. It was a weird dream, and when she woke up she had to bite herself just to make sure she wasn't made out of candy, because the smell of apple treacle tart was just so heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped out of bed and smelled herself again. \"Gosh Ah must need a bath or somethin'. What in the hay is wrong with me?\" She wondered if it was like garlic. You ate too much of it and you could stink for hours. At least she smelled delicious, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trotted up to her window and looked out of it, contemplating the rest of her day.</span></div></div>",

She lifted her best foot forward, but Applejack lifted hers as well, and curls it around Apple Bloom's chest and pulls her tight against herself, hugging her sister. Apple Bloom struggled and looked up, seeing Applejack's now cavernous maw looming over her. Applejack's lips were not even an inch away from Apple Bloom, giving her a full stare right down her sister's gullet. For a brief moment she was allowed to see the streamers of saliva connecting her teeth and soft pallet to her tongue, as well as individual droplets of the sticky, pre-digestive slime. A split second of her sister's breath washed over her before the cavern descended down on Apple Bloom, closing tight around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom still had her eyes open, just in shock and disbelief that this was happening to her, and from her own sister! She blinked, still staring down into her sister's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this really how it was going to end for her? Food for her own sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack stop yer eating me!\" Apple Bloom shouted, but all she got was a murr and a sudden gulp, as she was pressed into Applejack's tight but powerful throat. It squeezed around her head and clamped her muzzle shut, and Apple Bloom was silenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aww this is just peachy, I'm getting eaten by my sister and I can't even do anything about it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom struggled against her sister. Applejack's saliva increased and she wiggled against Apple Bloom, both keeping her tight against her body and embracing her sister's attempts at prying out of her mouth. Applejack was enjoying her struggles, finding them playful. Apple Bloom gave up and began to shiver. Applejack continued to wiggle as she gulped down her meal, really enjoying herself as her tongue tasted all her favorite treats in her sister's fur and skin. Apple Bloom's body began to shake harder as her chest and forelegs descended into Applejack's throat. The hot and wet was creating a contrast to the cool air outside, and inspite of herself Apple Bloom's body wanted that warmth on her, her shivering an attempt to heat itself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack lifted her head up, the strong pony balancing herself momentarily on her back legs while her forelegs cupped Apple Bloom's blank flanks and pushed hard. The ravenous pony gulped and easily sent those hips into her gullet, with the momentum carrying the rest of the filly and pushed Apple Bloom's face through the groping ring of muscle that accepted her graciously into the steaming, tight hot core of her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom curled up into a little ball, coughing as she tried to adjust to the scent of her sister's stomach. It was both pleasant and unpleasant, the mixture of scents somewhat ineffable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth and called out, \"Darn it Applejack Ah'm yer little sister, what you go and eat me fer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack licked her lips and burped, giggling. \"Well sorry Apple Bloom... Ah don't know what came over me. Ah don't even rightly think Ah'm sorry! Frankly, yer the tastiest thing Ah ever sent down the hatch, bar none!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well glad to know Ah was good fer something before Ah died,\" she grumbled. She thought for a moment.

Apple Bloom kept trying to talk to her, but Applejack didn't seem interested in talking anymore and started whistling while she did the work of two ponies. Apple Bloom started to get worried. Her skin was tingling and she was thoroughly coated in her sister's digestive slime. A puddle of it surrounded her. She wondered how long it would take for her to digest. She didn't think ponies could digest meat that well, especially if it wasn't chewed. Probably would take a long time. But she was sure it was going to do it all the same. She'd learned from Cheerilee that some deer would, very rarely, eat small creatures to get protein. More often than that they'd eat the skin that sheds off their horns that grow in every year. So the stomach probably was universal at digesting most things, just better at some things than others. Such as fruit and veggies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom kept entertaining the thought that her situation was getting worse, but every time she rubbed on her back and sides that sat in her sister's juices, she found that her body and fur were still intact. At the very least her skin should be getting raw, or the fur should be coming out. But she seemed to be holding together unnaturally well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack yawned. \"There... all done... guess it\u2019s time for a nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom felt Applejack go into the house and into her bed, and Apple Bloom couldn't help but get a little sleepy too, surrounded by all this warmth. She fell asleep eventually as well, and together they slept through the night. In the next morning Apple Bloom was the first to wake up and realize that she was still thoroughly intact, even though the stomach acids still raged against her, trying in vain to break her down. She couldn't believe it! The stomach wasn't able to digest her! Surely it wasn't because ponies didn't eat meat regularly! It must have been a part of her abstract talent, the ability to make and keep things whole! It must work on all kinds of things! In the gloom of her sister's stomach, which took hours to get used to, she looked at her flank.</span></div></div>",

She hopped onto the wheel--Apple Bloom coughed as the wheel struck her with Applejack's landing--and began to spin with the wheel. Before she knew it, her body had been submerged in the water and then carried back out, only to be repeated again. She was being dunked several times a second, and a horrible nausea overcame her. She began to bitterly think that this was a really damn stupid plan, and begrudged what she would do for her sister that she secretly was going to just try and eat again some other time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually was flung off of the wheel and hit the ground down stream. She got to her hooves and stammered around, the world spinning around Applejack as her eyes did cartwheels in their sockets. All the weight and pressure in her stomach only upset her more, and then she felt herself heave, coughing Apple Bloom up and causing the filly to roll across the grass. Apple Bloom too was severely nauseated, but with her tummy empty all she could do was lay her head down and try to relax while the world swam around her. Gosh it was bright out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejaaack Ah hate youuu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer welcome,\" said Applejack before her eyes rolled up into her head and the farm pony passed out right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom wasn't sure if she slept or not. For a brief moment she completely lost her sense of time. She realized that she had, at some point, closed her eyes and was now opening them again to the snores of her sister. She got up on her hooves shakily and shook her head. She still felt terrible, but she was okay to walk. Course, she was hungry too now. She gave herself a sniff to see if she needed to wash up. She did smell a little sickly, but mostly, she still smelled of apple treacle tart. Like, enough to make her queazy stomach say <i>'Yeah, I could go for that.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured she needed to go see Twilight and see if she could sort out this smell of hers.</span></div></div>",

She thought she recognized most of them. She felt a little nervous. \"Ah'd best just get outta the way,\" she mumbled and stepped off the road and stood behind a bush. She peered through to watch the ponies go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the group was a sort of minty-green pony that she thought was named Ms. Heartstrings. Next to her was the pony she'd tried to swindle once and forced Applejack to lose two whole bags of apples to, Bon Bon. There was also the black pegasus Thunderlane whom Scootaloo said was \"almost half as good as Rainbow Dash\", and the pegasus Blossomforth that was said to be \"disgustingly bendy.\" Then there was the pony who stumbled around a lot in the afternoon's and evenings--Berry Punch. Applejack said she was a good customer. Last, there was a brown Earth pony with a hourglass on his flank. Apple Bloom had definitely swindled him before! Apple Bloom wasn't sure what his name was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking passed, she heard Heartstrings start sniffing. \"What's that smell?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step in something Lyra?\" joked Thunderlane, but Blossomforth began sniffing the air too. \"Hmm flowers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean those flowers?\" asked Bon Bon, pointing the ones Apple Bloom had been smelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, candied rose petals,\" said Blossomforth. \"They're my favorite. Is someone holding out on me? Bon Bon do you have any candied rose petals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I smell cheesecake!\" Lyra said with a little growl and licked her lips. \"Oh gosh, I had no idea I was this hungry for cheesecake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I smell bread pudding with rum,\" said Berry Punch. \"Do you think Sugarcube Corner has a little stand nearby or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ponies began to discuss their favorite desserts and sniffing, milling about while looking for the source. Apple Bloom's heart was pounding against her chest. This was bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I got to get out of here!</i> she thought. She started thinking of what was the best option for sneaking away when she sensed movement nearby. She looked up and saw that one of the ponies had walked over to her bush and spread the branches, revealing the filly. Lyra stared down at her, smiling and drooling. She sniffed the filly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh it's you I was smelling!\" She levitated Apple Bloom up and set her down on the road side as the other ponies approached, sniffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does she smell so good?\" asked Berry Punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Apple Bloom struggled to think of something to tell them that could keep this from escalating into a... situation. \"Ah smelled this way after Ah visited Twilight Sparkle at the library. Ah was just headin' over there again.\"</span></div></div>",

Apple Bloom turned her head and stared with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now c'mon get off of me!\" she said and started kicking water at Berry Punch... The adult pony didn't care though, and gulped. Her lips closed around the base of Apple Bloom's tail, and then widened up over Apple Bloom's rump, her tongue curling up under the filly and pushing on her stomach, lifting her up into a sitting position right on the back of Berry Punch's throat, which held tight onto Apple Bloom's tail. The filly wiggled, trying to keep her balance ontop of the entrance to Berry Punch's digestive system. The Earth pony gulped, Apple Bloom's rump disappearing into the gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh darn it Ah'm not food!\" she shouted and started pushing on Berry Punch's jaw. \"Quit bein' a cannibal long enough fer you to get yer head on straight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerry Punch gulped and Apple Bloom's legs were stuffed against her belly. \"Yer not gunna stop are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulp. Apple Bloom's neck was now level with Berry's lips. Apple Bloom grimaced and closed her eyes, waiting for it to be over. Berry Punch mmm'ed around the filly who tasted so great, curling her tongue over Apple Bloom's head and gulping hard, the tongue helping to make sure this was the last swallow. The thick bulge in her neck soon disappeared and the oddly satisfying strain on her sternum gave way to a satisfying relief as it returned to normalcy. Her stomach gurgled in joy as the filly slipped butt first into its gastric juices. Apple Bloom oofed as she slipped into the hot sac, curling up into a ball. The filly groaned, embarrassed that she had found herself in a stomach once again, so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerry Punch burped and then sighed, staring blankly ahead. \"Ooooooo mmmm~ that was so much fun. I haven't had that much fun eating myself sick since... Well I guess the last time Pinkie Pie had a party...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom had a pouty expression as she sat in the gloom of Berry Punch's gut. \"Well Ah'm glad yer satisfied...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well that's sweet of you!\" Berry Punch said. \"You were so tasty! Really! I doubt the Cake's could make a better bread pudding than you were!\" Berry Punch suddenly gasped, a bright expression appearing on her face. \"Oh that's a great idea! Wanna go get some bread pudding?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom made a look of disgust. \"Are you losin' her mind? How can you think of eatin' when Ah'm already in here? Plus ain't ya full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerry Punch shook her head, although Apple Bloom barely felt it from her position. \"Oh don't worry, I'll be fine, and you'll get to have some too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... ... Ewwww!\" Apple Bloom shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerry Punch was already on her way. \"I am going to get it with some rum. Have you ever had rum? Well I guess not, since you're just a filly. But you're kind of food now so I don't think it would anything to let you have some rum, seeing as you'll be...

A single bead of drool was perched on the tip of Lyra's tongue, slowly running down onto the bottom of that slimy appendage. \"Ahhh!\" Lyra sighed as she slowly started to bring Apple Bloom's head toward her maw. Apple Bloom looked on nervously as the tongue wiggled started to curl backwards before straightening out again--it was beckoning her forward. Soon Apple Bloom's chin was above that tongue, which cupped around the filly's neck as Apple Bloom's face sunk in past Lyra's cheeks. Apple Bloom's muzzle pressed into Lyra's squishy throat, and then the lips closed down around her head. Lyra mmm'ed as she suckled Apple Bloom's head like a lollipop. Her teeth worked Apple Bloom for a moment, as if trying to chew out more of her flavor while still recognizing that Apple Bloom didn't deserve anything painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra swallowed, her eyes rolling up in her head as the rich taste of a creamy, perfectly baked cheese cake flooded her mouth. The taste of the crust was so intense that Lyra could practically feel herself biting into it, the crunch and flavor mixing with the soft, creamy heaviness of the cake itself. But Apple Bloom's flesh was fine as Lyra's experience was purely mental and the teeth only pressed into Apple Bloom gently. Another gulp brought Apple Bloom's shoulders into Lyra's mouth, the filly's head bulging out the unicorn's throat. The squishy esophagus squeezed Apple Bloom's head and matted her fur and mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohhh not again!\" Apple Bloom whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra lifted her head up and gave a push with her magic, staring at Apple Bloom's dock as it disappeared behind Lyra's view of her own nose. Apple Bloom began to giggle as she felt Lyra's tongue start working her tummy. A growl from Lyra's own tummy dampened Apple Bloom's laughter, and seconds later Lyra swallowed again and pulled Apple Bloom's flanks and thighs into her mouth. Lyra's drool made a seething sound as she took a moment to breathe around her meal, a chilly wave of hair moving down Apple Bloom's dampened belly as the air flowed in and out of Lyra's lungs. Lyra made a tiny swallow, and Apple Bloom felt the unicorn's excess saliva slip past her and get sucked away into the stomach just an inch ahead of her. Lyra lapped over Apple Bloom's legs a few moments longer, her mind filled with cheese cakes, and then she gave a final gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom eeked as she pushed on through the stomach's entrance, the esophagus quickly squirreling away the rest of her tiny body and stashing it in Lyra's voracious stomach. Apple Bloom curled into a ball, blinking in the gloom as she felt something beating on her. Lyra was patting her stomach, a look of blissful satisfaction on her face. The unicorn's eyes were half-lidded and her tongue hung out as far as it would go, dripping saliva into the water every couple of seconds. She started to walk away, head held high with pride now that she'd wolfed down a young filly. As she started up the bank of the river, she gave a satisfied burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good lunch, I need to do this again sometime,\" she said. \"I just hope the next pony is as good as you, kid. Now don't digest too quickly. I expect you to keep me satisfied until tomorrow night.\" She laughed mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh for pete's sakes it's bad enough everypony wants to eat me but why do they want to digest me too?</i> thought Apple Bloom. <i>Good thing they can't.

So what do you want, apples?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah guess...\" said Apple Bloom, and a few moments later three apples popped into the stomach, whole and unchewed.

That wasn't true but Apple Bloom would have been in a lot worse shape if they'd 'shared' her. \"Yeah I'm making your favorite. I thought you deserved it since I got the filly....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom felt Lyra sit back and then something pressed against her. \"Hello filly!\" said Bon Bon through the stomach. Apple Bloom frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh why are ya tryin' to talk to me? Yer all tryin' to eat me, what the heck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"So I'm not allowed to say hello?\" asked Bon Bon. There was a pause. \"You know, I think I recognized you... you're the little brat that made me buy all those apples awhile back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey we gave ya those fer free jus' so you wouldn' be upset!\" shouted Apple Bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" laughed Bon Bon. \"Do you even know how long it took us to eat all those apples? The nerve of you! I can't wait to hear you howling with despair as you melt away in my happy lover's tummy! Ooh its going to be wonderful feeling your struggles through this wonderful tummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom hit her hoof on her head. \"Alright geniuses, will you STOP actin' all creepy fer a moment? Ah can't be digested! Ah got eaten yesterday and nothin' happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's a lie!\" said Bon Bon. \"You're just trying to convince us to let you out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh all Ah said was Ah can't be digested,\" said Apple Bloom. \"Ah'll figure out a way out mahself... But in the meantime yer not gonna get a single holler outta me, Ah'm going to be stuck in her all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence from the other two ponies.</span></div></div>",

Apple Bloom kept sighing to herself. A few hours passed until the two of them got up to have dinner, whatever they had been making coming to a finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly she felt herself get heaved up, pressed into the esophagus and blinded with spit as she came tumbling out into the sink. She was so surprised by the sudden change that she felt disorientated, but then a splash of water poured down her. She blinked her eyes and looked around, realizing she was now in their sink, with the faucet running over her to wash her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can already smell her, I can't believe it!\" Bon Bon said.</span></div></div>",

The water still poured through the magic field to wash her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh filly!\" said Lyra, leaning in to give Apple Bloom a lick on the cheek. Lyra washed Apple Bloom quite thoroughly, using the spray attachment of the sink to get at Apple Bloom's 'corners', before lifting the dripping pony up and levitating her to a big pot of soup that was on the table. Apple Bloom's legs flailed as she approached the lightly amber vegetable broth, so sure that it would be hot enough to scald her. She was dumped in, and was very relieved to find that it was already cool enough to drink, and cool enough to not burn her. Her head broke the surface, Apple Bloom coughing as she tried to swim in the soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!\" she cried, trying to find purchase on the vegetables  in the soup, but having no such luck. She was becoming quite tangled in nappa cabbage. Bon Bon's face appeared in front of her, the Earth pony licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she looks absolutely delicious Lyra! Oh I'm sure she'll be a happy little addition to our family! Well, to the pantry anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom recoiled, huddling against the back of the pot. \"C'mon ye know this isn't right! Just let me go okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBon Bon laughed and grabbed the pot with her forelegs, tipping it. She pressed her lips to the rim and began to drink, opening her mouth wider and wider. The vegetables and broth poured down her widening throat, and Apple Bloom couldn't keep a hold of the pot with her hooves. She slipped away and clogged up Bon Bon's throat. Bon Bon began to put away the filly with swift, strong swallows. Apple Bloom yelped as she disappeared in seconds down Bon Bon's gaping gullet. Apple Bloom slid into Bon Bon's sweltering stomach, and immediately more soup began pouring down on her head and washing over her body. She was completely covered in nappa cabbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBon Bon set the pot down and burped, falling onto her butt. \"Lyra, this is why I keep you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know I'm more valuable than that!\" said Lyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom felt the two ponies press against one another again, and thought she could hear loud, inappropriate kissing. \"Ewww...\" moaned the filly. \"So gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom didn't find it particularly unnerving that it was two girls kissing, just that two ponies, period, were kissing so noisily. She would prefer it if their relationship was more like a romance in a fairy tale or something sweet and simple like that. \"Gosh please don't go to the bedroom.\" Said Apple Bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's head up to the bedroom,\" she heard Bon Bon say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom groaned and cursed her fat mouth, but it wouldn't be too much of an issue. The two ponies went up to bed and settled in, and Apple Bloom felt Lyra cuddling with Bon Bon and saying sappy things to her but Bon Bon began snoring within minutes of getting into bed. Lyra made some pouty noises and turned around in bed, her back pressed against Bon Bon's belly and squeezing Apple Bloom up against the stomach walls. There was a small bubble of air cupped around Apple Bloom's muzzle. The filly sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least there's soup for me to snack on...\" she said to herself... she wasn't sure if she was serious or not herself.</span></div></div>",

The earth pony coughed up the filly, who was then washed up by Lyra, only for the unicorn to eat her up again. Apple Bloom was no match for Lyra's magic, and this continued on for many days until Apple Bloom could no longer count the days. She'd tried many things to escape, from kicking and hollering, knocking anything over within reach whenever she was out in the open, but Lyra always was sure to keep a levitation field over Apple Bloom, never giving her the opportunity to even move. The two lovers traded eating her every supper, taking breakfast and lunch with the filly sitting in their stomachs. Apple Bloom's aroma and flavor never seemed to pass, even with all this food being poured on her and digested constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom had also tried to reason with them, but this had failed. Lyra and Bon Bon did not care, in the slightest, that Applejack would be looking for her, and they never answered her questions on how the farm was doing, or if Applejack was looking for her. She especially had no idea how her friends felt. In a way it was kind of smart. If Lyra or Bon Bon bothered to find out how her friends and family were doing, it would likely compromise their kidnapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Apple Bloom started counting the days again, marking from the day that she finally gave up and behaved herself as the two lovers continued eating her. It was day fourteen from that other, ambiguous date, and Apple Bloom was tied around a spit over cooling coals from a dead fire. The air above the coals was just hot enough to be uncomfortable. The filly was completely slathered in barbecue sauce (normally meant for roasting veggies). Lyra and Bon Bon were licking their lips, taking turns tasting the Apple Bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock at the door, and the two fillies looked nervous. They stopped up Apple Bloom's mouth with, of course, an apple, and Lyra went to go check the front door with an eerie, wide-eyed grin. Apple Bloom wondered if this would make her suspicious, but given Lyra's eccentricity, probably not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra answered the door, her eye twitching as she noticed it was Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy partner!\" said Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy... partner!\" said Lyra with gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So hey, Ah know it is dinner time an all but would ya mind letting me inside? Wanna run something by ya'll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, are you soliciting? Bon Bon hates that... sorta thing... yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't ya'll worry, Ah won't keep ya long! Just wanna have some friendly conversation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra continued grinning. \"Just oooone second!\" She slammed the door. She ran for Bon Bon, a worried look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's onto us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she isn't she's just been going door to door every day ever since we stole the main ingredient,\" said Bon Bon. \"We just need to hide the filly and wait for her to go away and she'll just keep searching every other house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think so?\" Lyra said nervously. \"But... dinner was so elaborate this time... how  do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBon Bon rolled her eyes and got out a roasting pan, slipping the sleek, saucey Apple Bloom into it and stuffing a lid on her and tossing her in the oven for hiding. She then took the spit and slapped some raw veggies on it and put it back on the rack. She gave a stern look at Lyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Was that hard? We're roasting veggies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're roasting veggies,\" said Lyra with a nod, then went back to her creepy, nutty grin and went to fetch Applejack. \"Permission to enter, Miss Applejack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank ya kindly!\" said Applejack, coming inside and looking at Bon Bon's tummy for a filly sized bulge. \"Mind if Ah check yer pantry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do, why are you trying to snoop in my house?\" asked Bon Bon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothin' just think Ah might have sold some bad apples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like apples, we don't have any here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack flinched, momentarily distracted. \"Wait... wait ye' don't like... What in tarnation is wrong with ya'll? Not liking apples!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we don't, so there's nothing to see here!\" said Lyra. \"Go look for your lost sister somewhere else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait how did ya figure Ah was lookin' fer mah sister?\" asked Applejack. \"Ah mean... If ya figured that, then ya must have a reason to think Ah'd have a reason to go door to door snoopin' in people's houses looking for my sister, and that someone has a reason for kidnappin' her instead of her just getting lost in the woods or somethin'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard from someone else that was what you were doing,\" said Bon Bon, still glaring, undaunted. Lyra looked nervous, but started nodding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, and we wish you the best of luck, but... We don't have any apples, and we don't have any fillies, just... just roasting some veggies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack looked between them and then sighed. \"Alright alright. But still... <i>how can ya not like apples?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom tries to cough out the apple and yell for Applejack. Her jaw was so jammed up by it that she couldn't get the leverage to bite down through it. She tried, but her jaw just wouldn't move in either direction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could hear Lyra picking up the pace. Looking wildly, Apple Bloom spotted a dresser along the same wall as the door and ran for it. In her fit of adrenaline, she pushed it in front of the door. That probably wouldn't last long against a unicorn, so she had to act fast. She ran for the window and looked out. It was a bit of a long drop, but she saw that someone was doing laundry next door!

Just gonna have to accept the fact that yer mah new favorite snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer sure did get used to it in a hurry...\" Apple Bloom mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, my tummy enjoyed ya, but maybe you should hurry on into my intestines so I can get some breakfast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack smiled and tried to scoot a little away from where she thought the exit was. \"On second thought, AJ, maybe you should juuust... keep me in here long enough to get the nutrients you need to start yer day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack didn't say anything and already on the move, Apple Bloom sloshing around in her sister's digestive juices. She wondered if AJ was going to take her up on her offer when she felt something open up around her hooves. \"Uh oh!\" Apple Bloom said and started trying to scoot away from that spot, but her hooves kept slipping on the inclined, wet muscle and she only made herself slip towards that hole, and into it! It took hold of her hip and sucked her through up to her neck. She struggled a moment longer, but then she entered the small intestine fully with a little pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack giggled as she felt Apple Bloom moving through her system. It tickled! She felt herself get a little more energy from Apple Bloom as her small intestine tried to sap the filly for all she was worth, which apparently was limitless, and then she was in the long intestine for the long haul. Applejack made herself a fresh breakfast in the meantime--something for her body to actually digest for the satisfaction of feeling her tummy get empty the natural way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Applejack got to work and did a few chores around the farm during the hour and a half that Apple Bloom was moving through her intestine. For Apple Bloom, it was a slightly smelly, slimy experience. It was light being in a tight, smooth tube that undulated around her. It mad her feel a little claustrophobic, and now that she was on her way she only wanted it to be over, and kept trying to remind herself that she had things to look forward to on the outside to keep her from getting too antsy. A little stinky or no, at least Applejack had been right and she hadn't run into anything along the way other than this lubricant the intestine was sweating out.</span></div></div>",

Apple Bloom felt her own rump push into a somewhat large chamber and come to a stop on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww,\" Apple Bloom whispered to herself, figuring where she probably was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Apple Bloom Ah think yer ready to get out now!\" said Applejack. She looked around for a place to do her business. She was currently out in the orchard, trimming some of the loose branches down so that the tree wouldn't waste time trying to keep them alive and would grow more apples more effectively. There didn't seem to be a soul in sight. She made a dirty little grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, Ah think this might actually turn out to be somethin' like fun...\" she said. \"Private property or no, pushin' ya out right here in the open...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squatted down. Apple Bloom frowned as she felt the gravity change slightly. \"Oh Applejack yer gross,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack's pucker relaxed and started to open up, Apple Bloom's tail flopping out. She got stuck as the rump opened as far as it could on it's own, not being used to something as large as Apple Bloom's rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, dun' worry just give me a moment Ah'll have ya out in no time,\" said Applejack, taking a deep breath and pushing a little harder. She grunted as Apple Bloom didn't move at all. The muscles pushing on Apple Bloom felt too warm, and Apple Bloom was beginning to sweat, even though she'd been in her sister's hot interior for nearly a day. Applejack gave up and panted, tightening herself and sucking Apple Bloom back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consarn it!\" Applejack grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is never gunna work at this rate,\" Apple Bloom said, and carefully used the space of the rectum to turn herself around. She pushed her hoof through Applejack's rear and then worked her other hoof through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow ow hey!\" Applejack grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom worked herself forward and freed her head, pressing her forelegs against Applejack's rump and then pushing herself out completely with a pop, rolling across the ground. She sat up and felt dizzy, her eyes swirling in their sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good yer out!\" said Applejack, walking up to Apple Bloom and giving her an experimental sniff. \"Heh, and you still smell great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Apple Bloom muttered and looked herself over. She smelled herself and still smelled like butt. Maybe not dung, as she hadn't encountered any at all, but she still smelled sweaty and... hormonal maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Ah don't Ah smell terrible,\" Apple Bloom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya'll smell like a pony who has had a hard day's work,\" said Applejack, sniffing again. \"Ya know, right before the sweat starts ta go bad and spoil. Oh, and pie and ice cream, but ye already knew that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom gave herself another sniff. Now that she was concentrating on it, the scent of her trip through Applejack's digestive tract was overwhelmingly overpowered by a fresh, delicious scent of apple treacle tart. She'd been through an entire pony's body, and this scent hadn't even weakened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now why don't ya'll go find somethin' to do,\" said Applejack. \"Unless ya wanna stick around and wait for my hunger to pick back up. Ya look pretty sparkly clean to me, Ah wouldn't hesitate.</span></div></div>",

She squirmed as the unicorn caressed her face with her slimy tongue.

With a loud gulp her head was squeezed into the hot throat at the back of Rarity's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Slowly she was pulled deeper inside by the powerful throat muscles, she heard the heartbeat of the purple maned pony as she got closer to her stomach. Outside Rarity was lost in the stunning flavor of her meal, this filly tasted of Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and tea cookies, and each taste she took was more flavorful then the last!

As the rest of filly joined her inside her friend Twilight lit up her horn to illuminate their fleshy prison. She gave wrapped her forelegs around Apple Bloom and pulled her into a tight embrace. Rarity let out a soft belch and patted the new bulge in her low hanging belly with a content sigh. \"I really am sorry about this girls, if I tasted as good as you two do I wouldn't be shocked at this kind of treatment.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scootaloo\u2019s legs wobbled under her as she tried to balance the package on her back, a package that was almost as big as she was. She was delivering it to Rarity\u2019s boutique from a fabrics store on the other side of town, the delivery being a 10 mile walk in total. She groaned in exhaustion, cursing her tiny wings. If only she could fly, she would\u2019ve been there and back in 5 minutes. But she gritted her teeth, trying to focus on her goal. She\u2019s been thinking of getting a lesson from Rainbow Dash, but she figured, being a wonderbolt now, Dash\u2019s time was probably valuable. So, for the past couple of days, Scootaloo\u2019s been doing random chores for ponies around town, trying to scrounge up enough bits to feel comfortable asking the now famous mare for lessons. But contrary to your first assumption, she doesn\u2019t want flying lessons. No, no. She wants to learn how to eat ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, ponies eating other ponies has been a part of the culture for millennia now, and though it has become somewhat less common and acceptable, the archaic laws still remain. Equestria relied on a very prominent caste system - among other things, this meant ponies were allowed to swallow any ponies of the same caste or lower, one of the only restrictions being that if their prey was able to escape their stomach, they couldn\u2019t try again. This is a massive social faux pas in most towns, but Ponyville has an interesting history. Long ago, noble ponies from Canterlot would visit Ponyville to indulge in both their lust and their gluttony, since most of Ponyville\u2019s citizens were peasants and thus weren\u2019t allowed to fight back. Eventually, this caused the citizens of Ponyville to become desensitized, and ponies swallowing other ponies became an important aspect of the town\u2019s unique culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, in Ponyville, swallowing another pony was considered a vital part of every pony\u2019s journey to adulthood. This never really concerned Scootaloo, as she was always too focused on getting her cutie mark, but now that she has her mark, it seemed like the next logical step. It\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t have enough role models to turn to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPonyville used to ship criminals up to Canterlot for the princesses to deal with, but now that Twilight Sparkle herself had become a princess, she had (hesitantly) taken up the mantle as Ponyville\u2019s \u201cexecutioner\u201d. Pretty much the punishment for every crime in Ponyville was being swallowed, usually by the one you wronged - and if you were able to escape, you were free to go. Alicorn\u2019s stomachs were inescapable, so naturally, the most heinous criminals were sent for Twilight to deal with herself. Notably, Twilight is one of the few nobles in town that the citizens respect and admire, since she doesn\u2019t swallow or enslave random peasants like most other nobles tend to do in Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack does believe in \u2018traditional justice\u2019, and thus does swallow ponies that trespass on her farm or steal from her, but nopony Scootaloo knew ate as many ponies as Pinkie Pie does. At the end of almost every one of her parties, Pinkie Pie ends up with as many as three ponies wriggling around in her belly - some of them willing prey, some of them not so willing. She also occasionally swallow random visitors at the bakery, or just random ponies around town. Scootaloo liked Pinkie\u2019s sense of humour, but she also didn\u2019t like the prospect of getting digested, so she tended to avoid the mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her idol, Rainbow Dash, eats a pony every once in awhile. Apparently, in her words, a diet that includes a pony every once in awhile is vital to maintaining a \u2018perfect physique\u2019. Whenever she feels she\u2019s getting a bit too bony, she simply snatches another pegasi out of the sky, and prides herself on the fact that nopony has ever managed to escape her powerful stomach. On the rare occasions Scootaloo does happen to meet up with Rainbow Dash right when she has a bellyful of prey, Rainbow Dash always lets her rub her belly while she takes a nap and digests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what tipped Scootaloo over the edge was when Applebloom climbed up into the treehouse with a belly three times its normal size, bragging about how she finally found something she enjoyed doing on her own - eating ponies. They spent the whole day rubbing her belly as a colt from the local dance class squirmed and yelled desperately inside. It took 5 hours for him to finally give up! Ever since then, it was all Scootaloo could think about. Her fantasies were interrupted, however, when she finally arrived at the front Rarity\u2019s boutique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cWhat? What do you already need a new dress for?\u201d</span> Scootaloo could hear Rarity yelling. She stopped suddenly, and pressed her ear against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cI was on a date with this pony, and they turned to be a real jackass, so I swallowed them, but they squirmed so much they completely tore my old dress apart!\u201d</span> Scootaloo perked up upon hearing that voice emanating from within the boutique. Rainbow Dash! How convenient. It was just the mare she was looking for. <span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cHey, it was entirely their fault. I tried to tell them not to wriggle so much.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cWell, maybe if you didn\u2019t <i>eat them</i> they wouldn\u2019t have been able to ruin your dress in the first place!\u201d</span> Scootaloo stepped softly through the door, slamming the package onto the counter. Rarity smiled at her as she walked in. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cOh, hello, Scootaloo.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201d</span> Scootaloo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cWe were talking about how hard it is to keep making clothing for Rainbow Dash when I have to retake her measurements every month!\u201d</span> Rarity scowled, as she dug through her purse for a few bits to give to Scootaloo. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cThank you, dear.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cThat does sound frustrating,\u201d</span> Scootaloo replied, picking her words slowly and carefully, trying to direct the conversation. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cIt sounds like such as hassle to eat somepony. Why do you even bother?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cBecause it\u2019s awesome,\u201d </span>Rainbow Dash laughed, simply, at the awkwardly-worded question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting and primitive, is what it is!\u201d</span> Rarity complained as she took Dash\u2019s measurements. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cThe other cities will never take Ponyville seriously if we keep eating each other.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\"Heh, live a little, won\u2019t ya? I can pay you for the dress...\u201d</span> Dash groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cWell, what\u2019s so \u2018awesome\u2019 about it?\u201d</span> Scootaloo questioned, ignoring Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cOh, it just feels great. And it\u2019s a great way to stay in shape! Plus, some ponies just have it coming to \u2018em,\u201d</span> Rainbow Dash explains, thinking back fondly on previous experiences. <span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cAnd though I\u2019ve never tried it, Fleetfoot has told me that unbirthing feels absolutely <i>perfect</i>.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018unbirthing\u2019?\u201d</span> Scootaloo asked, genuinely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cIt\u2019s something foals <i>shouldn\u2019t be hearing about</i>!\u201d</span> Rarity snapped, interrupting their conversation with a stomp of her hoof, staring daggers at Rainbow Dash. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201c<i>Ugh!</i> You\u2019re such a bad influence on the poor dear\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash rolled her eyes, before turning back to the teen. <span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cSo, you\u2019re starting to wonder what it\u2019s like to eat ponies, huh?\u201d</span> Rainbow Dash asked. <span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cI started too at about your age.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cOh, yeah! In fact, I was thinking of, uh\u2026 buying some lessons?\u201d</span> Scootaloo asked, quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cOh! You want to learn from me, huh?\u201d</span> Rainbow Dash smiled. <span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cNah, I\u2019ll teach you for free! Every mare has to learn about all this, sometime or another.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cWell, whatever you\u2019re going to do, do it outside,\u201d</span> Rarity demanded. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cI don\u2019t want drool getting all over my carpet.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cIt\u2019s not drool, it\u2019s <i>saliva</i>,\u201d</span> Rainbow Dash insisted, but walked back towards the door without skipping a beat, waving at the filly. <span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cC\u2019mon, Scoots.\u201d</span> Scootaloo\u2019s heart skipped a beat as she followed after her idol. She couldn\u2019t believe that it was that easy! Dash stopped in a place closer to the town square, with a crowd of ponies flowing around them. Rainbow Dash sized up the random civilians as they passed by. <span class=\"cpblue\">\u201cAlright! Well, I assume you can\u2019t eat anypony yet or you would\u2019ve done it by now, so we\u2019ll start with the basics...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Scootaloo\u2019s first lesson?</span></div></div>",

Either the trap was hidden very well or whoever built all the other traps was very confident, she could see no more traps. Still, she was carefully as her hoof came closer and closer to the stone, if she had paid more attention to the ruby itself she would have noticed that the eyes seemed to gleam brighter as the rest of the statue.

She opened her eyes and found herself in a valley in the jungle, a beautiful waterfall was cascading in front of her. She would have found this to be a lovely view if there wasn't the fact that she felt strange and that she was inside a temple just a moment ago. \"Daring Do.\" Daring spun around as she heard a deep voice calling her name and gasped as she saw a humongous snake. The snake had strange, ruby like scales and seemed to be big enough to swallow an entire dragon. \"Yes my child, I have indeed sampled the flesh of dragons before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaring Do was confused, could this snake read her mind? \"Yes Daring Do, I can indeed see what you are thinking.\" The snake spoke. \"You have bested all of my traps and made it to the final chamber, as a reward I will make you a serpent priestess.\" Daring Do briefly wondered what a snake priestess is as the heads of several different ponies popped out from the bushes. At first they seemed to be normal but as their lower bodies appeared, Daring Do noticed something completely different. From the waist down, all of these ponies had a long snake tail instead of flanks and hind legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaring Do had a strange gut feeling and looked down at herself. She gasped as she saw that she too was transformed into a half pony half snake. The giant serpent continued to talk. \"You have proven yourself worthy and now you are a lamia, a combination of snake and pony. You shall worship me by following your snake instincts, until the day you die and bathe in the sun of my realm with your brethren.\" The other lamias stomped their front hooves on the ground in applause but Daring Do was still confused. \"Following my snake instincts, what do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant ruby serpent chuckled and quite a few of the surrounding lamias also giggled. \"You will learn soon enough but one word of advice, be careful with it, lest you join me and your brethren sooner than you wish to.\" Before Daring Do could ask any more questions she was pulled away by a strange force. Her eyes shot open and she saw the stone ceiling of the temples treasure room. Panicked, Daring Do looked down at herself and gasped, she was now a lamia. Her upper body and wings were still normal but from the waist down she was a snake, her scales glistening in a color that matches her fur.</span></div></div>",

The urge was irresistible, slowly the lamia uncurled herself from the stone rafter until she fell down on her unsuspecting victim.</span></div></div>",

He pulled her down and out of the ropes, dragging her across the ground before raising her into the sky upside-down, the adventuring mare losing her hat in the process.

Daring Do wanted to protest, to state the thought that this should not be possible but in her confusion she could not utter a single word. The chief nodded towards one of the tribesponies, who procured a small thorn and a jar with some sort of liquid in it. The pony dipped the thorn into the liquid and walked over to Daring Do. She knew that this must be some sort of poison. Desperately she struggled against the ropes but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a stinging sensation in her neck, the poison was in her system now. After struggling for another minute or so, her movements became sluggish until her entire body felt numb and she couldn't move anymore. The chief nodded towards another tribespony, who cut the ropes, holding the adventuress. Daring Do limply fell to the ground in front of the chief. Daring Do looked up and saw that the chiefs wife was sucking at his dick, right in front of the entire village. While the chiefs wife was sucking him off, another tribespony removed her jacket and hat, leaving her naked in front of the couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the chief felt he was hard enough for what he was planning to do, he dismissed his wife, who scooted back a little and looked curiously at her husband and Daring Do, excited for what would happen next. The chief stepped forward, aiming his stallionhood straight at Daring Do's muzzle, who tried to back off but couldn't move a single muscle. The adventuress hoped that this guy was just crazy and that he would soon scream in pain as he tried to push her inside of his cock, but she quickly learned that he was very capable of backing off his thread as her muzzle was engulfed by his urethra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief of the tribe grunted as he pushed forward, slowly engulfing Daring Do's entire head with his cock. Daring Do could barely twitch as the chiefs wife started to help and pushed her rump, accelerating her descend. Daring Do couldn't breath, from all sides her head was covered in slimy pre cum. To her shame the musky smell started to arouse her. The chiefs wife saw that, with a mischievous smile she brushed her tail aside and started to lick at Darings wet cunt. Daring Do gasped in surprise as she felt the wet appendage invading her marehood. Daring Do tried to concentrate so she may be able to struggle again but the other mares licks were too distracting and so she only moaned in pleasure instead as she was eaten out while being eaten by the chiefs cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already down to her flanks inside of the ravenous shaft as she shuddered before spilling her honey right into the face of the chiefs wife. The other mare eagerly lapped up the juices as she continued to push the adventuress haunches inside of her husbands dick. Soon her legs were pressed together, as they too entered the cock. Daring Do was curling up in the cum filled testicles. Her hind legs soon lost contact with the humid jungle air and seconds later, her tail disappeared with a wet slurping sound. Daring Do could move again but it was too late, her entire body was inside of the chiefs balls and if he could really do this then maybe he could also convert her into semen.</span></div></div>",

His wife was placing her head against her husbands testicles to hear the wet gurgles inside. Around them, the tribesponies resumed their dances and a few white, slimy spots could be seen on the soil after some of them couldn't help but to clop off at the display. There was also reason to celebrate, with this intruder soon turned into cum, the chief would soon have a foal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaring Do on the other hoof was not so thrilled. Only little light came through the stretched skin, leaving her almost completely in the dark. Daring Do desperately tried to think of a way to escape but couldn't think of anything at this point. She brought her hoof to her chin to help her think but the plan backfired. With horror she noticed that her hooves were slowly turning into cum, her entire lower body was slowly turned to goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has raided ancient temples and dodged deadly traps, she faced off against her arch nemesis, Ahuitzotl over and over but never has she been this scared. She tried to kick against the walls but her hooves were now soft and gooey. Her lower body became numb and she knew that it was most likely turned into sperm by now. Defeated, she closed her eyes and laid back, trying to be comfortable in the last moments of her life. It was weird, Daring Do knew that she might die on one of her adventures but from all the numerous ways this could happen she would have never guessed that being eaten by a tribe chiefs cock and turned into cum would be the way she goes. The musky liquid now rose up to her neck and Daring Do let herself sink in, knowing that she was doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chiefs wife listened carefully and as Daring Do was completely converted into cum she smiled at her husband and nodded. He too smiled and raised his hoof, causing all of the tribesponies around to stop and be still. \"The time has come.\" He bellowed, \"Soon my mate will bear a foal for me.\" His wife wasted no time. Her husbands balls were too big, he could hurt himself if he stands up so she climbed on top of him. She carefully aimed her already aroused pussy over her husbands cock before plunging herself down. The chief of the tribe let his wife ride him, pushing her up and letting her fall down again over and over. The rest of the tribe watched them in anticipation, also wanting to see their chief with a foal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes it was time. The chief let his wife plunge down as hard as he could and held her in place. The both whinnied loudly as the chief started to fill his wife with his seed. The load was enormous, filling out the mares womb in seconds and causing her belly to stretch. A few small tears escaped her eyes as the stretching became painful, her husbands seed was already flowing out of her cunt. Finally the orgasm subsided and both the chief and his mate laid down, exhausted but satisfied. There was no way for her not to be pregnant after this. They smiled at each other before falling asleep, glad that this trespasser came and allowed them this chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaring Do was never heard of again. Everypony assumed that she was careless around some ancient traps and perished and maybe it was better for Daring Do's reputation that nopony would ever know the full truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Today had been another big show; another day of high stress. They'd left the crowd exploding, which at lead meant it wasn't for naught, but his still didn't ease the stallion's nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you, Spitfire, these crowds just keep getting more demanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare chuckled. \"Yeah, but at least it's well worth it. We've got more fans than the Princess has servants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin laughed. \"I guess so. But these humongous shows just leave me a bundle of nerves. I need to unwind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitfire rolled a fan. \"Then just grab a fan and snack on them. That oughtta loosen you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right. It was quite common for a Wonderbolt to grab a fan and eat them after a show. Most of them just did it occasionally for pleasure, but Soarin had actually been doing it therapeutically. He found that having a pony in his gut actually relaxed him. Plus, if he felt bad for them, he could just have one of their good unicorn friends regenerate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was how to do it discretely. The only pony who knew of the practice outside of the Wonderbolts were the Princesses and a few of the member's close personal friends. If the secret got out, their shows would certainly have less of an audience. Soarin contemplated how to solve this dilemma, then came up with a genius idea.</span></div></div>",

What's gonna happen now?\" Dash asked, genuinely curious how it was going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, It takes a really long time to happen, so most ponies just fall asleep. But the ones who did stay awake tell me it's like your whole body turns soupy before going to my intestines. No one can really remember what happens after that though, so I don't know.\" Soarin explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash let out a yawn. \"I can see why ponies like to sleep in here. It's so cozy. Maybe not as soft as clouds, but definitely way warmer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, feel free to take a nap. I'll see you again in a day or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash didn't reply, but Soarin felt her squirming around to get more comfortable. He gave his belly an affectionate rub, and let out a small burp. Then he grabbed his uniform, and left the supply closet. He had taken many meals home before, so he was able to return to his house without issue. After locking his door, Soarin went up to his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately laid down on his bed, and then checked on Dash. \"You still awake in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reply he received was an ominous gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He he, I'll take that as a no.\" Soarin then got himself wrapped up in his blankets, and went to sleep himself, rubbing his belly until he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the night, Soarin's stomach made quick work of Rainbow Dash. She was quickly melted into a soupy version of herself, and was then slurped up by Soarin's greedy intestines. As she traveled down the tract, Soarin took as many nutrients from her as he could, causing a nice, soft layer of pudge to begin to form on his plot and belly. after only a few hours, Soarin's stomach had gone from pony sized back to his toned flat belly, albeit with just a little bit of pudge on top.</span></div></div>",

to,\u00a0 but he didn't quite mind an easier target.\u00a0 The mare shrank in his presence, unsure of what to do.\u00a0 This must be her first time meeting a celebrity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, hello there,\" his smoldery voice rumbled \"how would you like to meet a wonderbolt\" then, leaning into her ear, he finished in a whisper \"in private.\"\u00a0 The mare's mouth was agape, but no words came out.\u00a0 She clearly was more timid than he thought she'd be.\u00a0 \"Don't worry, I know a place where we won't be bothered by my pesky fans.\"\u00a0 She shook her head, trying to put on a convincing smile.\u00a0 \"Come on, it'll be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin then picked up the mare and draped her over his back.\u00a0 \"Don't worry, my lovely fans,\" he cried out to the rest of them \"you can still find me here tomorrow!\"\u00a0 And, with that, he and the mare disappeared from the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare was kicking and flailing under his grip (what grip?\u00a0 Pony magic grip!), but by the time they reached the dimly lit locker room, the mare had nearly tired herself out and simply lay on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much of a talker, are ya?\"\u00a0 The mare didn't respond.\u00a0 Typical.\u00a0 \"Well, that's just fine by me.\u00a0 I don't need you to talk much anyway.\"\u00a0 He unceremoniously dumped the mare onto her back.\u00a0 \"Just don't struggle too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obvious thoughts ran through her mind.\u00a0 No, not 'he's gunna eat me,' ponies don't do that!\u00a0 No, she was worried about being raped (because it's a trend nowadays).\u00a0 She scooted away from him as soon as she oriented herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come one, don't be like that.\u00a0 I'm not gunna hurt you,\" he said sternly.\u00a0 The mare's back hit a wall.\u00a0 The terror in her eyes fixed her attention on the huge stallion lumbering towards her.\u00a0 She covered her eyes with her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion now loomed over her.\u00a0 She could feel his hot breath against her belly.\u00a0 A tremble rocked her body until a hoof griped the back of her head and forced her attention upwards.\u00a0 What she saw, she almost couldn't comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gaping maw of the powerful stallion hovered just inches above her face.\u00a0 A few drops of saliva dripped down onto her blue muzzle and down her cheeks.\u00a0 She was too paralyzed to react as his hot throat encroached on her head and the dim light of the locker room was blotted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin thrust his mouth around her head, tucking it in securely.\u00a0 His tongue danced along her chin and jaw bones and wet her fur with his thick saliva.\u00a0 His lips were almost around her neck at this point.\u00a0 She could feel his lips wrapped around her neck as the tip of her muzzle dipped deep into his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the stallion swallowed deeply, pulling her head down into his throat.\u00a0 The heat and tightness was absolutely unbearable, making her want to scream.\u00a0 Another swallow enveloped her shoulders in the slimy heat and brought her chest close enough to his broad tongue which immediately went to work exploring the dips and curves of her upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the loud rumble of Soarin's pleasurable moan reverberated all around her.\u00a0 She shut her eyes in the hopes of somehow bracing herself against the quakes.\u00a0 His moans grew louder as more of her body was dampened by his tongue, shaking her to her core.\u00a0 The sound only lessened when her head slipped below what she could guess was his chest.\u00a0 Only a moment later, she slid down another couple of inches, sucking her down to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure on her nose began to subside as she inched along.\u00a0 Her head escaped the fleshy tube, giving her a moment to stretch her aching neck.\u00a0 Another swallow later, and her nose was firmly pressed against another wall.\u00a0 This time, the pressure on her face grew as the rest of her was swallowed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoarin lapped at the fur on the mare's belly, trying to feel its rough texture before it got damp.\u00a0 He loved the taste of this mare and tirelessly explored her body for more places to taste.\u00a0 Another swallow brought him closer to her crotch, which he immediately began attacking with his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp might have escaped our heroine's lips when the invading tongue brushed against the folds of her ponysex.\u00a0 She gave a single wild kick to the air before stiffening up at the crotch massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his tongue only teased her, never plunging too deeply or rubbing so roughly.\u00a0 The gentle tease and the heat of his stomach dampened her pelvis as much as the saliva dampened her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother swallow, and the teasing stopped, leaving her frustrated and craving release.  She tried to snake a hoof down to her nethers, but found that the now more rhythmic motions of the Wonder Bolt's throat was too much to compensate for at the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly her legs up to the hock lay just beyond the stallion's skyward turned maw.  His tongue wrapped it self around one leg as another swallow dragged her hooves closer to his throat.  Soon, just her hooves stuck out from between his lips.  With a smooth motion, Soarin took a few small swallows, sliding his lips over the last of her as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few more loud gulps, the mare lay tightly balled up in the stallion's stretched out stomach.  Despite her state, she could still move just enough to get comfortable.  Using the newfound flexibility, she finally slipped her hooves down to her crotch to finish what the stallion started.  Her breath became much heavier as she worked her folds.  Her legs longed to buck out, causing her to twitch inside the tight chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, yes~\" Soarin moaned out \"Keep struggling like that.  I'm sure you'll get out soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping with the domination fantasy (even if at this point, it's a little more than fantasy) she repeated the words in her head, trying to imagine the cruel power being thrust upon her.  She imagined what is must have been like to see herself now and what she has become.  The thought of how disposable she was finally brought her over the edge and ceased her bucking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed as she emerged herself in the ecstasy, now trying to ignore the fact of her inevitable death for the sake of the afterglow.  For Soarin, the few minutes were actually seconds.  Without any kind of stimulation, he now sat uncomfortably in the middle of the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eheh, about what I said earlier...\"</span></div></div>",

In the griffon kingdom, the mayor would often swallow a criminal whole and alive, letting him think about his deeds inside of his stomach. If the crime was bad enough to warrant a death penalty, the culprit was even digested, also whole and alive. While she would always give criminals one more chance before implementing this part of the punishment, Mayor Mare had stored several criminals in her belly and even digested one and the crime rates really dropped, especially since she made the digestion a public execution. It was harsh but since crime has risen to a worrying degree before the new law, she saw no other option to ensure the safety of the law abiding citizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one odd thing. Mayor Mare has not thought about some of the more... kinky citizens of Ponyville. While larger crimes barely happened anymore, small crime like littering or insulting authority's have actually risen because some ponies WANTED to be inside of her. Mayor Mare blushed as she remembered one particular mare, the kinkiest of them all, who not only got into her belly by waltzing around outside with bondage gear on, she insisted on keeping those on and begged to be digested. Of course she let the mare out but decided, not to indulge her again. Currently though, Mayor Mares belly was empty but she had a feeling as if this would change very soon.</span></div></div>",

As she opened her mouth, Lyra stared into her throat as if in a trance. Lyra enjoyed looking into the mouth of her predator, seeing where she was going. The mint green unicorn could no longer hide her grin as the open maw of the mayor got closer until her muzzle was engulfed by the older mares lips. Lyra closed her eyes as her world turned dark and wet, pushing a little inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayor Mare was already used to this motion, as many of the more willing participants were very eager to get in her belly as fast as possible. The mayor held the unicorns sides as Lyra pushed her hooves past her lips and down her throat. It has become sort of a rhythm to her, swallow for swallow the unicorn sank deeper as her smiling face made an outline of Mayor Mares neck, before disappearing further down. Lyras hind legs already lost contact with the ground and dangled in the air as more of her body was snapped up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the mayors belly started to distend as Lyras head entered the stomach proper, welcoming a familiar guest. The unicorn could not be happier with where she was, so as more of her body was pushed into the chamber with her, she curled up in a comfortable position and started to snuggle against the walls of the belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a few more gulps, Mayor Mare was done eating this pony. (I still wonder if I should just turn her down next time or if that would only encourage the real criminals.) She sighed as her gut almost dragged across the ground and heaved herself back onto her chair. She had to get a new, sturdier one after it broke when she first sat down with a meal in her belly. There she rested, while the unicorn within laid on her lap. It was hard to move but the mayor still had a job to do. At least she would not have to carry Lyra around for days, as she went on with her day.</span></div></div>",

I don't want to have to worry about you pacing a hole in the floor again...\"<br>\r\n\tBlushing again, Dusk responded, \"No, it's nothing like that, just something on my mind...\"<br>\r\n\t\"<i>That's</i> what I worry about...\" Barb said with a roll of her eyes, but left nonetheless.<br>\r\n\tThe door shutting as Barb left, Dusk Shine sighed with relief.<br>\r\n\t\"I don't need her worrying about me on top of this, I was right wasn't I? This is nothing to get worked up over, right?...\" the purple unicorn said to himself.<br>\r\n\tBut even as he tried to convince himself, he found his mind going back to the evening before last, specifically the party with his friends...they had all been so drunk on cider...<br>\r\n\t<i>\"Okay, okay, what do we talk about nesht?\" Bubble Berry asked drunkenly, the pink party stallion taking a swig from the bottle by his side, emptying it. With a disappointed sigh, he set it beside the numerous empties behind him. He then looked hopefully to his friends...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat gets brought up?</span></div></div>",

The pegasus stallion then began shamelessly rubbing his cloud-gray sheath, teasing out his stallionhood from its flesh-pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Whelp, we're out of other stuff to do guys,\" Applejack said as he eyed the others, then began to rub his large hoof around his crotch, massaging the earthy-brown hill of his sheath. \"Y'all don't have to and I ain't tryin' to pressure yah, but Ah'd prefer to see more than jest Blitz's pride, we're all friends and adults here after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Sure, I'm game, let's do this!\" Bubble Berry answered, enthusiastically bouncing up onto his back hooves, revealing his flesh-rod, which was a shade darker than that of his mane and tail, was already hard. The penis and balls bounced in sync with their owner before coming to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Normally I would never do something so crude, but in light of how drunk <b>some</b> of us are and that I do find myself a mite curious, I wil make an exception,\" Elusive said, carefully levitating away his numerous empty glasses and drinking the last of the cider from the one he had left before sending it away with the others. Sitting up as elegantly as he could, Elusive displayed his indigo-colored sheath and sack. His horn lit up and a light blue pad of magic began to caress Elusive's privates. As he did this, he turned to a certain shy pegasus stallion and added kindly, \"I hope you know none of us mind if you don't feel comfortable joining in Butterscotch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"O-Oh my, th-thank you Elush-ive, but I *hic* wouldn'nn wann to *hic* be lefff out, I cann do thish...\" Butterscotch slurred, swaying slightly as he oriented himself to show his crotch, massaging his floral pink genitalia with one of his wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I guess that leaves me, and I admit I'm <b>definitely</b> curious...\" Dusk Shine said bashfully, then lay on his back and spread his legs so to start stimulating his sheath with both of his hooves.

His penis, when fully erect, was about 4 inches in length, whereas the average size was about 8 to 10. His balls were about the size of a baseball put together, while average size was <i>twice</i> that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDespite that though, Dusk wasn't ashamed of his size, nor was he hampered by it. Unlike what the cheesy sex stories he'd read as a young colt had implied, being big wasn't all there was to a stallion, and Dusk had quickly figured that out back in Canterlot. As the Prince's prize student, Dusk had actually gotten a few propositions from mares...and a couple stallions. He had accepted a few after he had gotten over his nerves and, ever the astute colt, he had learned a myriad of sexual techniques in the process. He found that one of the advantages of having a smaller stallionhood was that he could hit a mare's sensitive spots much more easily since his head wasn't buried so deep, and he had soon become very...<i>creative</i> with his magic. Another advantage was that it was easier for mares to pleasure <i>him</i>, being able to suck or massage his entire cock with ease, and as a young and horny colt that had certainly convinced him that being the size he was was A-okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut, he had found out that his size made him the smallest of his friends by a large margin, and with all the sexual stories they had shared afterwards he found himself curious what it was like to be bigger, or at least average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"<i>Alright, I guess I can't just ignore this, so I might as well try it</i>,\" Dusk thought to himself, then got down the books he would need for...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, there wasn't an exact \"genitalia-increasing\" potion, and if he wanted to get this right he would have to increase the capability of not only his external parts but his internal reproductive system as well. That meant he would need to craft a potion for it himself to take care of all of it at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm Prince Solaris' best student, and I've worked with Zicoro enough that I should be able to pull this off. Maybe this could even be something new to show Prince Solaris...I could be breaking new ground on potion-work if this ends well!!\" Dusk Shine pondered aloud with growing excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see,\" Dusk said as he poured over each tome and compared relevant concoctions, \"If I combine <i>these</i> potions and alter a few ingredients, the resultant combination should give me the results I want...and it seems I have everything I need for <i>all</i> of them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growing confidence, Dusk then trotted his way over to the basement door and stepped inside, heading down the stairs with his books levitating beside him. He had work to do...<br>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t*** <br>\r\nA few hours later, Dusk Shine came out of his laboratory with a finished potion levitating beside him, as well as a journal to record any relevant data. Light blue and glowing faintly, the potion lay in a square-shaped bottle about the size of a large tumbler-glass, with a cork in the round hole at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if my potion is anything like the ones I made it from, I'll need to apply it directly to my genitals rather than drink it...\" Dusk Shine said to himself as he eyed the potion, blushing slightly. He then levitated over a cushion and sat down, setting his journal down beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncorking the top of the container, and levitating it over himself, Dusk spread his legs and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here I go...\" Dusk said then began to tilt the bottle so that a bit of the potion trickled onto his sheath and balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! Ooohh...\" Dusk moaned out, as the potion was still warm, the heat felt pleasant on his stallionhood. Setting down the bottle and putting the cork back in, Dusk felt the warm liquid begin to sink into his sheath and down to the cock inside it. The spreading feeling, as well as the excitement of it all, quickly made Dusk aroused enough for his cock to begin to swell out of its home. First the round head of his cock slid out, then more and more of his short length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncorking the bottle again, Dusk levitated out a river of the potion inside and began applying it to his emerging cock via his magic. He moaned more loudly at the second dose of warmth on his sensitive caramel brown flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing and levitating the bottle over to a nearby table, Dusk waited with his eyes shut tight, anticipating the results of the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of nothing, Dusk was about to open his eyes a crack when a sudden intensity shot through his groin, surging from his dick and his balls down through his sheath and into the various tubes and glands of his reproductive system. Moaning from both pleasurable and painful sensations, Dusk wiggled and squirmed in his seated position as his cock and balls felt like they were shifting and molding like clay. When it finally stopped, Dusk opened his eyes to see...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dusk's face split into an adorkably happy grin, it had worked! His cock and balls had gone from much smaller to above-average, his penis still hard and throbbing, undeterred by the alteration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Wow, so <i>this</i> is what it feels like to have a sizable set of genitals...\" Dusk wondered aloud, noting the increased weight on his pelvic region, then began running his hoof around his stallion-hood and nutsack, a surge of pleasure running through his sensitive flesh as he explored his newly enlarged genitalia. Automatically, Dusk began to masturbate himself, his hoof gripping the broad head of his penis and pumping up and down it, the familiar electric pleasure of doing it strengthened by the increased amount of nerves in his larger cock. Along with that, he used his magic to attend to his balls, as he often did when pleasuring himself, his pink aura rolling and massaging his expanded orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ahhhh...Nnngh...wait, what was that?\" Dusk moaned and grunted with pleasure, only to stop when a strange sensation emerged in his ball-sack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping his massaging, he let his cock and balls come to rest between his thighs again. What he had felt seemed oddly like a...<i>hollow</i> sensation in his balls, not like they were lacking in weight or mass but more like...there was actually <i>space</i> in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk's face scrunched up in confusion, had something other than his size been altered? It almost felt like his sperm was <i>sloshing</i> in there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I definitely have to see what this is...\" Dusk said to himself, then quickly jotted down everything he'd experienced so far in his journal, then lit his horn and casting a spell on his balls, and on his cock for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe spell was a sort of x-ray, making whatever it was cast on slightly transparent for a short time. In this case, Dusk's penis and balls now became see-through, the exterior skin and flesh visibly fading out, enabling him to observe the insides of his sexual organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat he saw both surprised and confused him. The best he could tell, his potion had somehow not only increased the size of his cock and scrotum but also changed them in a myriad of <i>bizarre</i> ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe first and most obvious was that both his penis and his balls actually <i>had</i> become more spacious, his urethra having widened enough to look almost like a wide pipe of flesh than the tighter but flexible tube it was supposed to be, only the end of his urethra seemed to be similar to its former design. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis balls had changed even more than that though. What had once been a pair of testes sitting in his scrotum, was now what seemed to be a single open chamber full of what looked like a mix of both sperm and semen, pooled up to a fourth of its space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What in Solaris' name did I <i>do</i>?!\" Dusk Shine said to himself in shock, the frankly bizarre alteration blowing his mind right into the stratosphere. Shaking his head in disbelief, Dusk began writing it all down as he peered closer at his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe could see that what had apparently been his testes now sat in the back of each of his balls, shrunken down and separated from the pool of semen and sperm by a thick layer of flesh, with what he guessed was a tube for them to release sperm out of leading from each of them to the flesh-wall. Another change was that what he guessed used to be his glands responsible for semen production were now mixed together into a pair of wide and flat glands that lay between the skin of his scrotum and the central chamber. Experimentally, he jostled his sack and watched as the pooled semen and sperm sloshed around like juice in a melon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"This is, this is crazy, all it was supposed to do was make me <i>bigger</i> not...do whatever <i>this</i> is!\" Dusk Shine said indignantly, then sighed, \"I guess this isn't really much of a surprise, considering new creations can often go wrong before they are fully refined...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDusk Shine then took a moment to look at his transformed privates, watching as the transparency spell dissipated. His cock throbbed indignantly at being ignored for so long, its thickness and weight reminding Dusk he hadn't finished testing it out yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well... I guess it couldn't hurt to see what <i>else</i> may have changed about my reproductive organs...but first I'll make an antidote...\" Dusk decided, then grabbed the remaining potion and his journal in his magic before trotting down into his basement again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEmerging an hour later, Dusk now carried his journal and an empty bottle. Thankfully, making what he hoped was a reversal potion was easier, since it was just a matter of breaking down the potion's composition and combining ingredients that would counter it. All that was left now was to let the potion simmer for a bit. While that happened, he would \"test out\" his equipment properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDoing a quick cursory scan with his magic, he found no abnormalities besides the obvious. His transformed reproductive system seemed to function just fine, and the sweat glands and other unrelated features of his external anatomy were unchanged. Without the ability to see inside, his cock and balls seemed completely normal, if larger than they used to be. Writing all of it down, he sat down on the cushion he had been earlier and clamped his lips together indecisively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hmmm...well, I suppose the only things left to test are my ability to orgasm and any changes to my semen or sperm...\" Dusk Shine affirmed to himself, then began finishing what he had started earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis hooves began teasing at his enlarged sheath, rubbing it in circles to encourage his penis to emerge from its fleshy pocket again. It quickly did so, the large flat brown head poking out, eager for attention. Dusk obliged, gently squeezing and rubbing his cock-head, moving up and down the shaft as it engorged and hardened. He began magically toying with his nuts as well, this time intentionally jiggling them a bit as he did so, in order to swirl the sperm/semen mix inside them. He had to admit, now that he was expecting it, it felt...kind of <i>good</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith his practiced attention and the thrill of being bigger, Dusk's cock rapidly began dribbling pre-cum, the fluid running down over his cock and smearing on his hooves as he pleasured himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"<i>Well, at least that means the glands for <b>that</b> are more-or-less unaltered...</i>\" Dusk thought, using his magic to write that down in his journal while idly licking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReturning his focus to his cock, Dusk began lightly thrusting into his own grip, making his fat and slick cock-tip squeeze out from between his purple hooves, while he continued to magically massage his balls. His light pink aura shifted and rippled across his sack, rubbing and gently squeezing the sweaty orbs. With all the stimulation, combined with Dusk's earnest desire to get samples to test, Dusk's testicles rapidly began drawing up, their contents shifting and sloshing fervently from all the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a final sharp thrust, Dusk gritted his teeth and came, his cock-head flaring out and his slit widening as thick spunk fired out of it and into the air. Before it could touch anything though, Dusk quickly formed his magic into a bowl-like shape and let his cum land in it, moving it closer to catch each arc of it that sprayed from his dick. With all of his load caught, Dusk added more magic to his construct until it was a closed orb, then with a flick of his horn teleported in a proper container. It was a large clear cylindrical container with a dark gray lid, designed to hold about a gallon of fluid. Moving the orb of his cum over the top and removing the lid, Dusk made a hole in the orb and let his spunk ooze out into the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"<i>Wow, I think this is the biggest load I've made in a while, did all these changes increase my productivity as well?</i>\" Dusk pondered to himself, as his cum filled the container about a quarter-and-a-half-full. He then closed the lid and prepared to use his magic to scan for any abnormalities in his semen/sperm...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He seemed to freeze on the spot, his mouth half open and his eyes wide and fixed on Dusk's unusual equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of blinks though, Berry titled his head and put on a questioning expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with your stallion-stuff Dusk? Did you get Poison Joke in your lotion or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk gave a bewildered look at Berry's bizarre guess, but shook it off and explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Berry, you know how we all showed off our genitalia, last night?\" At Berry's nod he went on, \"Well, though I certainly am fine with my actual size, seeing all of yours and hearing what you've done with them got me curious, so I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh, I get it now!

In fact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Duskie, since you seem to be enjoying <i>this</i>...\" Bubble Berry said, giving a particular strong pump to make him grunt with pleasure, then let the unicorn stallion's cock go. It bobbed and twitched while Dusk bit his lip. \"...do you want to have some fun with your new dick, and me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhmm...\" Dusk Shine responded, momentarily stunned. Considering his needy cock was hungering for more of Berry's attention though, the temptation to go along with it was strong enough to let him shake it off. Still, he should be careful with this, like he had been in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're fine with it I wouldn't mind more of <i>that</i> honestly,\" Dusk said, rubbing the back of his head in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy to have sex with you Dusk! Sex is <i>fun</i>, and I love having fun with my friends!\" Bubble Berry said, then reached for Dusk's pixie-stick again, only for the unicorn's magic to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so you understand Berry, as I said something is wrong with the potion I used, so I don't know what that might mean. That's why I want to test it, and if we do this, I want you to know the risk...\" Dusk explained, trying to sound as serious as he could, at least considering he was still a bit antsy for more pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it Duskie, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about! Let's do this!\" Bubble Berry said eagerly, then began immediately wrapped his hoof around Dusk's cock again as soon as they were released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-Okay Berry...\" Dusk answered through a moan, leaning back a bit as he surrendered to the needs of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that all said, Berry rubbed his hoof up and down Dusk's spire, going from base to tip while occasionally giving gentle squeezes to mix it up. His soft but strong pink hoof jerked the shaft with Berry's usual wild energy, wet *schlick*-s accompanying each pump now as he glided over the moist flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk couldn't help but moan out an \"Ahhhhh!\" as Berry tended to him. His cock burned with pleasure and his nuts pulsed in time with both Bubble Berry's actions and his own heartbeat. He shut his eyes and let himself drift away into the deepening pool of pleasure. Berry really had not been exaggerating when he had talked about his sexual experience...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBubble Berry meanwhile leaned down and sniffed Dusk's cock again, this time just to take in the oddly enticing scent. It smelled both musky and oddly sweet, and Berry soon leaned in further until his nose touched Dusk's nuts. He continued his hoofjob without pause as he breathed in the stronger musk of Dusk's balls, which were still sweaty from his earlier masturbation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...Berry, oh, please don't stop...\" Dusk mumbled dreamily, smiling as the warmth in his crotch spread further and further through his body, this was the best hoofjob he'd ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerry added another hoof to his work, sandwiching the large and hot brown cock between his hooves as he massaged it, while running out his tongue to get a taste of his friend's sweaty ballsack. The familiar and satisfying taste of salt and texture of fur and flesh under his tongue made Berry's own bigger meat begin to harden. He liked to taste and smell things all the time, and sex was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Berry, that feels <i>so</i> good...\" Dusk said as he opened his eyes to see exactly what Berry was doing, though what he felt was definitely a surprise. His previous partners had never given his balls much attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw was actually almost comical. Berry was pretty much lying on the floor, licking at his balls while his forelegs were stretched up so that his hooves were still wrapped around his cock. As he watched, Berry looked up past his dick and winked at him before pulling one nut into his mouth with his tongue and beginning to gently suck at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnnnnn-ahhhh!\" Dusk groaned, his cock responding to the strong ripple of pleasure by flaring open slightly and releasing a thick blot of pre-cum, which grew in size as more was squeezed out until it began to run towards the end of his cockhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerry noticed this though, and in a flash he had stopped his strokings and pulled his mouth off of the ball with a *pop*. He then swiftly swiped his tongue up the length of Dusk's meat like it was a popsicle until he caught the glob. Pulling his tongue in, he swished it around in his mouth for a moment, appraising its taste apparently, before swallowing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...this tastes kind of sweet too...\" Berry commented, licking his lips before returning to his previous position, though this time he just danced his tongue around the whole of Dusk's sack, getting them nice and wet with his saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...wait, Berry? Hang on a second...\" Dusk Shine said, pulling back a bit on his cushion so that he broke contact with Berry. He had caught that comment, and it intrigued him. \"My secretions taste sweet? Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, they still taste musky like normal, but there's this interesting other sweet taste to them too,\" Berry said, then scooted forward so that he could start playing with Dusk's stallion-parts again. \"Soooo...can I keep going Duskie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a second Berry, I need to document this...\" Dusk Shine said, jotting  that detail down in his notebook, which was still right beside him. It normally wouldn't be that suspicious, but he knew that a notable sweet taste (and Berry knew his sweets), in both his sweat from that area and his pre-ejaculate must mean more things had changed then he expected. That done, he scootched back to his original position, causing his cock to boop Berry in the nose. \"Okay Berry, you can continue...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggling his nose, Berry giggled and licked the dollop of pre off his snout, then perked up as he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dusk, I actually think we should take it up a notch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, how so?\" Dusk asked, his cock still throbbing with need, and now fully oozing out pre-cum to run down the shaft in a clear and sticky line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was almost a full adult now, and had earned her cutie mark, a rotten apple. But she was bored here in Manehatten. \"I suppose I could head to Ponyville.\" She thought out loud. \"See Applebloom and the gang, have some fun...\" She looked in her saddle bags and found her coin purse, it was very light. \"But I don't have the money...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssst!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabs ears perked up and saw a hooded pony in a nearby alley. \"Hey kid, come here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabs walked over. \"I'm not a kid, but what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pony pulled his hood back, revealing a white unicorn. \"You want to get into Ponyville? I'll pay you if you'll do something for me.\" He held out a bottle filled with strange pills. \"I need somepony to get my supply to Ponyville and set up shop there if possible. All you gotta do is pass on the goods and bring me back say... half your profits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBabs thought about this. This guy was clearly trying to get her to sell drugs... Of course once she was in Ponyville she could just dump the pills and earn enough to pay him off at the farm... She grinned. Or she could keep the pills for herself. Once he was paid off she doubted he'd bother her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'll contact you in a month to get my share.\" He tossed Babs two bags, one a small bag of bits, enough to pay off a one-way ticket, and the second sligthly larger, surely full of the drugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. See ya.\" Babs grabbed the bits and pills and ran off to the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile on the train to Ponyville, Babs couldn't help but think about the weird drug. \"I'm sure he wouldn't miss one little pill...\" She pulled out the bag and looked in. There weren't as many bottles as she'd expected, only a few, surrounded with a lot of random items. Probably to avoid suspicion she figured to herself. She took one of the bottles and popped off the lid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here goes everything...\" She popped the pill into her mouth and swallowed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing seemed to happen. She blinked. \"What?\" She growled. \"Oh Celestia, if that weirdo was just toying with me...\" She laid down in a humph on her bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes her stomach growled, loudly, accompanied by a slight pain. \"Woah... I'm REALLY hungry...\" She looked in her bag but couldn't find anything to snack on. \"Oh for Pete's sake...\" Thankfully there was service on this train, she could order some food... but a strange thought occured to her, she was so hungry... maybe she could eat a whole pony?</span></div></div>",

We hang out, play party games, then everypony goes to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...\" Featherweight trailed off. Maybe he was just imagining things. No, he had to keep his resolve. \"Well, we can do this without an audience I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spread his hindlegs, revealing his heavy sheath and balls to the host of the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails sat down, as if this wasn't an odd occurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight took this as permission to continue, reaching a hoof down to gently grind along the underside of his sheath, breathing in deeply as he started to coax his arousal out, \"I figured we could compare, since everypony who's been to one of these parties keeps sayin' you're the biggest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails chuckled at that, \"Oh, is that what this is aboot...\" He didn't move, just watching Featherweight stroke himself to hardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tan colt closed his eyes, stroking and rubbing his shaft with the soft inner sides of his hooves, he felt the girth between them, and with each stroke he had to reach further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails watched silently, flicking his tail, smiling warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight grunted a bit, \"Okay... this is as big as it gets...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails looked over the other colt's cock appraisingly, \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

How many colts can you get in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight felt himself start to beam at the praise, before confusion took over, \"How many... colts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn stood, turned, and flopped down against the cushion next to Featherweight, reaching to stroke his friend's shaft gently. \"Yeah, with your size you should be able to get colts in your nuts, I figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight stared at Snails. \"What..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails slowly smirked. \"So, nopony told ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight swallowed nervously. This was not turning out the way he planned at all. \"Told me what...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails didn't answer, except by spreading his hindlegs out, making it easier to see his own junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight followed the taller colt's long torso down to the crux between his legs. First thing he noticed was that Snails' sheath and balls were heavier than his flaccid, by a significant amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing he noticed was that after Snails stopped moving, the heavy balls resting on the carpet continued to shift and sway, rock and move, as if there was something inside alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails, certain Featherweight was watching, began to gently stroke his sheath, coaxing his own arousal into the open. It emerged faster than Featherweight's had, and extended further. It was nearly the size of the skinny colt's torso, all told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight's jaw had dropped at some point, and he wasn't sure when. He also had not stroked his shaft in a while, but it was still throbbing eagerly... did... did he want Snails? Or did he want his dick... or to be... inside? His jaw closed only to allow him to bite his lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Featherweight...\" Snails licked his lips, \"Gonna join the colts, head to bed...?\" He patted one of his heavy nuts when he said 'bed', just to make it clear to the last colt outside of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight swallowed. It seemed crazy. It seemed dangerous, but, every colt who went to these parties was fine at school after the weekend, so it couldn't be dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One way or another, you're gonna be in my nuts, Featherweight...\" Snails whispered, smirking, \"Maybe not tonight, but sometime you're gonna want in. Why not now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat assurance in Snails' voice made Featherweight shudder. He stared at the head of his friend's dark cock. The opening at the center of the flat head opened and closed with the beat of the unicorn's heart, rocking the whole length with gentle pulses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And maybe I'll teach you to do it after I let ya out~\" Snails' voice carressed the pegasus' ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight gulped again, \"R-really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure your rod can handle it, after a soak in my spunk.\" Snails' voice almost sounded like a purr now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight shuddered, and looked back down at the other colt's constantly rocking and swaying nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They settle down after a while, once everypony goes to sleep.\" Snails chuckled. \"Now, coming to bed?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pressed his lips to his \"lips\" and smootched it deeply, so deeply that he had his muzzle in it and was tonguing at Snails' sticky, slimy pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh huh huh...\" Snails blushed watching Featherweight make out with his enormous dick, \"y-you're really good at this... Like you could be my fillyfriend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight's eyes went wide and he blushed even more than Snails. His mind immediately jumped to visions of kissing Snails, holding hooves with him, and even bending over a bed for Snails or kneeling down between his thighs just like he was now. The idea of being a \"fillyfriend\" as shameful as it might be for most colts, seemed very appealing. Snails' strong hoof pushed down on the back of his head, shoving him deeper into his musky dickslit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a deep breath Feather...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did as he was told, and slipped down into the shaft, powerful cock muscles squeezed and pushed on him, slurping him down like a python. Once his large head was slurped down his thin body was a piece of cake to gulp down. He slid down the slimy, musky tube and dropped down into the spacious balls alongside the other colts. Featherweight smiled, curled up next to the other sleeping, cum covered colts and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh huh huh... Better let them out before I digest 'em\" Snails said while jerking his mighty shaft. One by one he spurted out the party guests: Rumble, Snips, Strike, Pipsqueak, Truffle Shuffle and Lickety Split. Everyone, laying out on the carpet, covered in his spoodge but otherwise safe and sound. Snails laughed a bit to himself, then yawned and decided he should get some sleep himself. Maybe even cuddle up with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Featherweight?!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails suddenly realized: he couldn't find Featherweight! He lifted one leg and examined his deflated sack. Not a drop of cum or pony in sight! He started to frantically jerk his speckled shaft to see if Featherweight had gotten stuck or... Wait, was his dick this big? And when did it have these speckles in... Featherweight's colors?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Snails? Are you okay?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-featherweight?\" He heard the voice in his head. Almost like they were sharing a body... \"A-are you in my..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I think I AM your dick...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Whoah. I gotta say this never happened before...

Before Featherweight could move, or have second thoughts, Snails took a big step forward, groaning aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight gasped as he saw the bigger colt's shaft spread around his hooves, and the warmth of Snails' body surround his lower legs. He hugged his own dick to his middle, quivering. All the colts at the party took this trip, while they were in other rooms with Snails. Had the host been hiding this from him on purpose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails pressed forward again, slurping up Featherweight's hindlegs in a single motion, nearly above the pegasus on the cushion, his forelegs bracing on either side. \"Oohh... you're so much easier to get down than Rumble... or Lickety Split... or even Pip...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about to get harder...?\" Featherweight attempted lamely, as that flat head started to stretch against his own nuts. He felt his dick giving Snails' a hard time might be too far to boast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see... might wanna fold your wings there...\" Snails said with that same warm smile from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight blushed. He hadn't realized his wings were extended. Usually he was able to keep them in check, even when he jerked off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails waited for the wings to be folded against his friend's body, before he rocked his hips forward powerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus yelped aloud as suddenly he didn't feel the cushion against his back anymore, that had all been replaced with hot, moist flesh, wrapping him all up. His forelegs, which had been around his middle, were trapped, as were his folded wings. His shoulders were barely peeking out of the stretched slit, for a moment, then he felt the cock close like a collar at the base of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails rumbled low, and sat back onto his haunches, pulling his cock up and away from the cushion in the same movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight gasped at being lifted up so easily while inside that big dick, and then his lips met Snails'. His eyes widened, but then he felt them close on their own accord as he was kissed. Snails was rubbing him through the flesh of his shaft as he held the strong kiss, and inches of the pegasus' neck were sinking out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails gently broke the kiss, smiling, \"My Featherweight. Mine, like the rest of the colts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight blushed, unsure why that made him feel so... warm... But then he felt the shaft creeping up the back of his head, encroaching gradually on his face. He tried to think of something to say, but the only thing that came out of his mouth was one syllable: \"Yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Featherweight was looking up at Snails' warm smile as black flesh began to surround his vision, until his world was the inside of Snails' dick and the bigger colt's smile, and then just the darkness as he sank deeper and deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails leaned against the cushion with a sigh, watching the bulge of his last guest sink down along the underside of his shaft towards his eagerly awaiting balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn licked his lips, getting comfy, as finally, those lumps sank out of view, and his balls shook, as if from an impact, swelling almost imperceptively. \"All mine.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was his favorite way to end sleepovers with Snips, but for a party this special he had something of a surprise. He had traveled with Snips down to the Everfree to visit Zecora and buy a special potion with his life savings that would add something new when his guests reformed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails took the vial of pinkish potion that he had been keeping in his \"secret compartment\" and uncorked it, then emptied the stuff into his urethra. It spread down into his veins, filling his shaft and engorged balls with a glowing warmth. He could already feel it working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh huh, this is gonna be awesome...\" Snails said. He gave the serum ten minutes and when both the glow and the warmth subsided he began jerking his cock. When he felt close to an orgasm, he slipped a jumbo condom around his head and spunked into it, then tied it off and wrote \"Pipsqueak\" on it. Big Mac had explained to him once that when you spermed more than one pony at once, smaller ponies made thinner cum which floated to the top of the mix and is gummed out first. Snails didn't understand it of course, but he got that \"smaller ponies cum out first\". He filled condoms up with Featherweight, Snips, Rumble and Truffle Shuffle, then left them to reform over night, when they came to they'd have a big surprise \"cumming\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">...the next morning...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight awoke to the smell of waffles early in the morning, around him was a shredded rubber condom and underneath him was a.. No not \"a\", was HIS enormous horsecock! He was so frightened that he yelped in surprise, waking up the other colts(except for Snails, who was watching in delight while using his enormous cock as breakfast table to eat his waffles off of.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boys stirred, realizing that they too had \"special\" additions. Snips now had a titanic plot with a fat, donut-like anus for butt voring. Pipsqueak was embarrassed at first to now have a headty pair of crotchbreasts, but he soon realized how sensitive they were and how great it would feel to start turning ponies into milk in them. Same for Rumble and his enormous marecunt. Truffle's belly was bigger than ever, enough to fit several ponies in it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh huh...\" Snails chuckled in his usual drawl, \"you guys love it, don't you?\"</span></div></div>",

Snails was gonna do it, he was gonna show off his \"legendary girth\" to everyone. This was Featherweight's chance. If he got in there right now, he could put his own stallionhood up against Snails' in front of them all. His own throbbing length, 18 inches and cannon-thick, was up and ready from the anticipation. He just had to wait until....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh huh... Here he cums!\" Snails said, reaching down to his sheath. Now! He had to go now! Featherweight thrust his cock through the crowd and in front of Snails just as he-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WHUMP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd froze. Featherweight had pushed his cock out just in time for Snails' own soft member to fall on top of it. And now he can't even see his own length under Snail's enormous cock! His balls quivered, his dick shriveled in shame and his face blushed. Snails just looked down on him and smiled a smug, dumb smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh huh huh...\" He laughed, \"ain't that cute? Guess that's why they call you feather, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other colts laugh, Snips even chimed in, \"Nice toothpick, Featherweight! When a filly's done suckin' it, does she use it to floss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight scowled. He knew he was bigger than nearly anyone here, especially Snips but... Not Snails. And Snails knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh huh huh... How about I send you on a nice trip to my ballies? I'll use my unicorn magic to suck a few inches of you while you're in there so you don't think about challenging the champ again, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's how he did it!

Huh huh...\" Snails chuckled at the sight, rubbing his balls with one hand and his shaft with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly enough, Featherweight's tiny body was able to produce enough force to pull himself free of that hungry serpent, dragging trails of pre behind him as he leaped out. It was just a bit frustrating for Snails, but he knew that he'd just have to stuff Featherweight in headfirst. He waited until his little prey righted himself, then thrusted his cock out like a lance. What happened next, nobody could expect. Not even Featherweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweigt held his own cock out and there was a loud <i>SCHLIRP</i>, but what happened was impossible. His erection hadn't been swallowed by Snails, HIS cock had eaten the other! His cock had eaten Snails' to the medial ring in one gulp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnails was dumbstruck and for once, without words. He tried pulling away, but Featherweight's schlong held tight. Featherweight's light brown horsecock even started <u>sucking</u> on Snails', pulling it in deeper and deeper until Featherweight was sure that Snail's fuckstick was safely curled up in his balls. He moaned in pleasure as his cock sucked and slurped, unaware until one of the boys pointed out that,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Featherweight's dick is getting bigger!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight looked down to check if this was true. He couldn't help but smile a devious smile as he watched his own erection grow bigger and bigger with each slurp. Snails, on the other hand, had gone pale with terror. The worst part about having his favorite size-stealing spell stolen from him was that the process felt so pleasurable. He almost moaned in delight as he watched Featherweight's respectable size grow into a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Snails' once-proud rutstick fell out of Featherweight's now-leviathan cock, it was merely a sad shell of what it once was. It was a mere four inches, perpetually limp, and had nuts like marbles. His entire posture had shifted in an instant from \"High and Mighty head breeding stallion\" to \"nervous little filly waiting for her first rutting\". It looked like he wouldn't be pounding anymore holes anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatherweight felt a surge of new power as his cock came to attention almost instantly. It was a beast, twice the length of his body with a set of wrecking balls beneath. He ran his tongue across his own fuckflesh and smirked at his shamed foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, about stealing my size...\" He said, devious venom on every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Snails...\"</span></div></div>",

Most dismissed such as nonsense and gossip, but the ones that were smarter had noticed a pattern of the more...troublesome students that liked to get in Sunset's way weren't heard from again shortly after. But whatever anyone believed there was one thing that was for certain, Sunset ruled this school with an iron fist!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things were going to be tough. It had only been a few months after everything that had went down in Canterlot High School. Sunset's transformation into a demonic being, mind controlling the entire student body, and then attempting to threaten all of Equestria. Thankfully, Twilight and her friends had stopped her. Which she was grateful for now that she thought back on it. But the school hadn't forgiven her yet, which she understood. It was going to take a while before she gained their trust. At least she had Twilight's friends..sorta. Sure they were a bit frightened as well but at least they took her feelings into account and tried to be her friend. It was a process, one that slowly started working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie had been kind enough to invite her over to a sleep over though. That was very nice of her! The others were going to be there too. Maybe this would be a good bonding exercise between them all. It'd be nice! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping in front of the door, Sunset ringed the doorbell and almost immediately did it swing open. \"Hiya Sunset! I'm glad ya could make it!\" Pinkie Pie greeted her with her usual happy tone. Admittedly, it made the former villainess smile. \"Hey Pinkie. And don't mention it. I'm happy you decided to invite me.\" The bubbly teen giggled in response as she let Sunset enter her home. \"Well of course I invited you! Why wouldn't I?\" Pinkie leaned closer so she could whisper. \"Besides, this'll be a good way for all of us to bond since the....you know what.\" She didn't want to say it, knowing it would probably upset Sunset. Whether it did or not, Sunset didn't show. Merely nodding her head in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into Pinkie's bedroom, which was mostly pink with party supplies everywhere, she saw the others. Rarity and Fluttershy were sitting on the bed while Applejack and Rainbow Dash sat on a few pillows placed upon the floor. They all greeted her, to some extent. It was clear they were still worried over Sunset. She didn't blame them though. The red and yellow haired girl greeted them and sat down besides Applejack. But gave her enough room so she wouldn't feel uncomfortable in Sunset's presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls! Who's ready to have some fun?\" Turning their attention to Pinkie, they all nodded their heads. Pinkie was known for coming up with some really creative ideas during sleep overs. It made the experience very enjoyable! \"Okay then! Now, I need everyone to get into a circle! Then the game can begin! Ooh, I've always wanted to do this one! It's been on my list for years!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset raised a curious eyebrow as she watched the pink haired girl prance around. She seemed more eager and excited than usual, which was really saying something. What kind of game would they be playing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie grinned as she moved around, almost playing a game of Duck, duck, goose really. But what would happen soon enough would be very different. Unknown to all, Pinkie actually had a thing for wanting to be eaten. It was odd and she knew such a thing couldn't happen though...that is until magic came into their world. Through rigorous trials, she actually managed to make such a dream possible. If the girls were to notice, there was a small magical necklace around her neck. It would allow her to be eaten by anyone she choose. Pinkie wanted this to be a surprise for her friends because who didn't love surprises? Besides, she was certain whomever she choose would cough her right back up afterwards....maybe. She actually hadn't put much thought into that part really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her finger rested on Sunset and Pinkie squealed with delight. \"Okay Sunset! You're it! Now, close your eyes and open as wide as you can.\" Sunset shot Pinkie the oddest look upon hearing her comment. Open as wide as she could? That was an....odd request. Even the others found it to be weird. Maybe Pinkie was testing some new foods she made for them? Yeah, that's probably it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure. Whatever you say Pinkie.\" Sunset shrugged and did as she was told, closing her eyes and awkwardly opening her mouth as wide as she could for the other. Grinning ear to ear, Pinkie Pie prepared herself....</span></div></div>",

The magic of the necklace took effect, which would allow Pinkie to be eaten without consequences to both herself and Sunset. The other girls shrieked in fear and shock, scrambling away from their current location. All of them had their eyes on Sunset and Pinkie Pie! They were too shocked to do anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing herself forward, Pinkie entered more of herself into Sunset's maw. The former villainess was in shock as well and attempted to fight back but as she started to get her bearings on the situation, her tongue slapped across Pinkie's cheek and she got just a small taste of her bubbly friend. <i>Oh dear celestia </i>that flavor! It was like every sugary treat in the world wrapped up in one big ball of super sweetness! It was just too good not to want. Instead of fighting, Sunset relaxed and let her tongue lick at Pinkie's face. The bubbly host giggled from feeling her tongue against her face and continued to push forward. She knew one of her friends would've enjoyed this as much as she did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack, Rarity, Rainbow, and Fluttershy watched on in absolute fear and confusion as the scene before them unfolded. Their brains were too clouded with countless thoughts to think that just maybe they should help Pinkie. More and more did Pinkie manage to fit into Sunset's mouth before filling she started going down her throat. A muffled moan came from Sunset as she basked in Pinkie's taste. It was just so good! She wanted <i>all</i> of it. Lost in her daze, a hand went to Pinkie's rump and gently cupped it. Giving a good shove, Pinkie's lower half entered her mouth. By now, the pink-haired friend could see the stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset's yellow belly started to expand upon the large meal it was receiving. At first being the size of a simple soccer ball, riding up her shirt slightly. But as she gulped more of Pinkie down, the larger it became. It pressed against her crossed legs, big and soft. All that stood out now was Pinkie's feet. With one big gulp, all of Pinkie entered Sunset's stomach. A groan of satisfaction and a soft belch came from red-headed individual, letting a hand go to gently rub at her wiggling belly as Pinkie tried her best to get comfortable. She was doing her best to savor such a delicious taste! It was clear that Sunset was still in a daze though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....good...\" She panted and leaned against the wall for support with still sitting down. Just faintly could a giggle be heard from Sunset's big belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd like it Sunset! I taste super duper yummy! Which is why I wanted to share it with you guys! Although...it's a little uncomfortable in here now that I think about it. A bit too tight. And kinda dark...\" Maybe Pinkie should've put more thought into all of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset though wasn't really listening. She was like an overstuffed snake after having a big fat rat, just basking in the moment and relaxing. She had never tasted anything like this before! Let alone be so...full. It felt <i>good.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, she was just about to doze off a bit before Pinkie spoke up again. \"Hey uh, Sunset. You're gonna let me out soon, right?\" </span></div></div>",

Unfortunately this only caused Sunset to experience further pleasure. \"B-But Sunset! If I stay in here too long I could get....\" Pinkie trailed off, unable to finish her own sentence. She really should've put more thought into this idea! Here she was stuck in Sunset's tummy and it looks like her reformed friend didn't want to let her out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls!

And Vinyl was all over that, once she found room on her busy schedule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building itself wasn't that impressive. In fact if it weren't for the rather gaudy sign over the door, Vinyl would have walked right past it. With but the briefest of hesitation Vinyl walked into the place, Her eyes gazed over the dance floor, bar area, and eventually found their way to the DJ booth, which was built into the wide open mouth of a massive stone head built into the far wall that appeared to be a unicorn with a crooked horn. \"Creepy.\" she muttered to herself. She couldn't tell how to get in there from where she was standing, but she knew she'd find out soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl worked her way over to the bar and got the barkeeper's attention. \"Hey, I'm here about the opening.\" The gruff looking earth pony wearing a headset sighed. \"You and about three dozen others. What makes you think you're any better than the rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl chuckled. \"Just tell your manager that a \"Vinyl Scratch\" is here. See how they react.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Earth Pony put a hoof to his headset and talked into it for a second, immediately after dropping Vinyl's name he winced. Whoever was on the other end was talking loudly. The bartender sighed. \"She'll see you. If you walk toward the big stone head, there's a door to the left. That leads to the members and employees only section. She'll be waiting for you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl nodded and walked to the back room to meet her boss to be. Inside is another dancing floor, a door to her right that likely lead to the DJ booth and also several side rooms, each with unusual symbols on their doors. \"Probably some members stuff.\" Vinyl said to herself, \"Now where's my new boss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right next to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl jumped and turned, finding herself looking at a tall black unicorn with a crooked horn and fake insect-like wings. \"Oh hey, totally missed you there. Nice outfit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn blinks. \"Outfit... yes... I've hard a lot about you Vinyl Scratch. I think you'd be a fine DJ for our establishment. I honestly don't need to go through an interview or anything, your name proceeds itself... So then, let's talk business. I'm prepared to pay you 50 bits an hour and give a full membership during your off hours, sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl's mind swam. 50 bits an hour? That's a lot for a steady DJing gig. Plus that full membership sounds like fun. \"Sure!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn chuckles. \"Good. We'll finalize your hours later...  \"</span></div></div>",

Of the many doors, all had one of the following marks: SV, HV, AV, CV, or UB. As Vinyl was trying to figure out what the letters stood for, an earth pony with an interesting mane walked up. \"You must be new.\" she said hoofing Vinyl a drink, \"I'm BonBon. I've been a member for about a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl quickly downs the glass. \"So what do the letters stand for?\" Vinyl asked. BonBon chuckles \"Come with me and I'll show you.\" she said heading into a room marked SV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl shrugged and followed her in. Inside was what looked like a couple's bedroom, complete with king sized bed. \"Wait, are we supposed to have... sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonBon laughed. \"Well we could, but the stuff in your drink will kinda prevent that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"</span></div></div>",

Bonbon giggled, she has been looking forward to this all week. \"It looks like it's time to explain a few things. This is a vore club, that means the food that is served here the most are other members.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl couldn't believe what she just heard, eating other ponies? Then she took a good look at the mare in front of her and noticed how delicious she looked. Bonbon noticed the look she was getting and continued. \"We are in the SV, the soft vore room. Soft vore means that the prey is swallowed whole and alive. HV stands for hard vore, meaning the prey is eaten bite for bite. UB stands for unbirthing, which is pretty self explanatory. AV is anal vore, where the predator shoves his prey up his ass and CV stands for cock vore where the prey will end in the predators balls.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Bonbon explained this the DJ has already moved in on her and was giving her body a throughout licking. Vinyl barely listened as she tasted the pony in front of her. Never in her life did she taste something so divine. All her cares about the whole situation were gone, she only wanted to gobble this mare up in one big bite. As Bonbon saw the DJ open her mouth she explained one last thing. \"You can also go into the CV room. You will be provided with a pill that makes you grow the necesary equipment and when you're done you can order a prostitute to shoot the load into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she finished her head was engulfed by the DJ's mouth. She giggled naughtily as Vinyl licked her across the face. Vinyl Scratch pushed forward, taking more of the delicious mare into her mouth while Bonbon helped to push herself in. A nice bulge was already travelling down Vinyls throat and the DJ used her magic to hold Bonbon up. In a clearer state of mind she would have wondered why the mare wasn't trying to escape but she blissfully continued to swallow her until only her hind legs and tail were still sticking out of her mouth. Vinyl pulled her head back for the last few swallows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonbon now rested inside of Vinyl Scratch's belly, happy that she could finally fulfill her fantasy. She felt the belly sway, telling her that Vinyl was moving. Then the gravity shifted, Bonbon guessed that the DJ must have laid down on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl would have never guessed that other ponies tasted so incredible. Where was this club all of her life? She let out a burp and patted her distended belly. Then Vinyl wondered about the other doors, should she try something else later?</span></div></div>",

Her ravenous hunger now sated and her acid-like feelings of bliss gone, she realized just what she had done to the poor, cream colored earth pony. Her usual calm, cool, and cocky manner completely shattered under the weight of the implications of Lyra and Bonbon's words. She gasped bringing her hooves up to her mouth, hyperventilating and her heart starting to beat faster, horrified at her own actions.\"Oh Celestia... Oh Luna, Oh Faust... What have I just done?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl started to sweat, feeling nauseous. She wanted to throw up, but for some reason, the pony in her stomach refused to dislodge herself. She was going to be melted down into a puddle of inert, nutritious sludge and there was nothing Vinyl could do to stop it! \"I think... I think I'm going to...\" Vinyl trailed off, looking about to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra blinked. \"Hey, whoa... are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe DJ's panic quickly turned to fury as she turned on the mint green unicorn. \"Am I alright? AM I ALRIGHT?!\" she shouted, jumping up and pacing around the room, throwing her hooves around in a tizzy. \"I just ATE a pony! I've KILLED her! I mean... yeah, she literally <i>asked</i> for it, but that doesn't make it <i>alright</i>. It doesn't make <i>ME</i> alright. I'm a murderer! a cannibal!\" She glared at the unicorn and pointed an accusing hoof. \"And <b><i>you!</i></b>\" She screamed. \"You're just sitting there like it means nothing?! I just ate your wife! What is WRONG with this crazy club?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra backed up against the wall waving her hooves at the advancing unicorn, trying to placate her. \"Whoa whoa whoa! Slow down champ! If you'll just give me a minute to explain-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain WHAT?!\" Vinyl shouted. \"How you thought that climbing inside another pony and being turned to a pile of mush would just be the most awesome idea?! What kind of freak are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra's flank was now pressed firmly up against the wall. \"But that's what I'm trying to tell you!\" She insisted. \"She's not gone, she's going to be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what.\" Vinyl deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true.\" a soft voice came from her stomach. Bonbon was still kicking apparently, though from the sound of her voice, not for much longer. Vinyl's bulging, swaying stomach gurgled a little as she continued. \"I'm going to be fine, Vinyl... let her explain... I'm just going to... take a little... sleep... mmmmmmm...\" She moaned in a mix of contentedness and ecstasy. Weird... it was as if being digested into a puddle of goo was actually pleasurable. If she was going to sleep though, that meant she probably wouldn't be around for too much longer. And just because it was pleasurable didn't make it <i>right</i>. Still, if Bonbon was sticking up for the unicorn, she should at least give her a chance to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Vinyl said, removing her shades and looking Lyra dead in the eyes with her piercing red gaze. \"I'm waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra took a deep breath. \"You saw the manager right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl nodded. \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mint unicorn cleared her throat. \"Well, the manager's a changeling. One of the only ones that's got Equestrian Citizenship, especially since that fiasco in Canterlot.\" Lyra stepped out from against the wall and walked to the center of the room and sat down, motioning for Vinyl to do the same. \"Changelings have the unique ability to conceal themselves into a cocoon if they are ever severely injured you see. If they manage to get themselves into a cocoon, no matter how hurt, sick, or near death they are, they will be able to regenerate. Heal themselves from anything that may have happened to them. They can even regrow bones, limbs, nerves, eyes... heck, even brain cells. And brains are one of those things that are usually impossible to heal under ordinary circumstances, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl Scratch raised an eyebrow. \"Okay, that's kinda neat, but I don't see how that applies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra raised a hoof. \"Let me finish.\" She said lifting a pitcher of water from the bedside table and pouring herself and Scratch a glass each. \"You see, Carapace... that's the manager... She came up with the idea to let ponies act out their wildest fetishes, including the ones that would normally be fatal, in safe environments. She set up several clubs all over Equestria for this. After partnering with a few other ponies that had similar ideas, such as one odd little 'vorno' director, she managed to make those clubs a reality. The Ponyville branch is the 'vore' club. And in setting up these wild fetish clubs where the most passionate acts of lust and love can be acted out, she keeps herself very well fed and makes a ton of money, all in one go, without having to maintain a disguise or kidnap ponies or infiltrate families or anything. And since her clubs are all perfectly safe, she can be a legal equestrian citizen and doesn't have to keep hidden or risk the threat of being thrown in prison by Celestia.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch nodded. \"Okay, that seems like a smart move and all, but just how is <i>getting eaten</i> 'safe?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra grinned. \"The changeling cocoons!\" She chirped, taking a long swig of water. \"Carapace teamed up with a very powerful unicorn somewhere down the line. One who set up very complicated but powerful and stable spells on every one of her clubs.The spells take an imprint of every pony that walks into her clubs and monitors them. Should anything otherwise fatal happen to any of the ponies, griffins, dragons, or anyone who enters her clubs, the spell goes into effect. Carapace has set up several hundred changeling cocoons in the back of the club, behind the stone head with the DJ table. When a pony is digested (or chewed to pieces in the case of the HV room), the spell goes off and the enchanted changeling cocoons quickly go to work, reconstructing and reviving the pony that was consumed good as new. No side effects, no pain, no lasting injuries. Heck, they're usually even healthier than before they were eaten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl blinked. \"That's... that's incredible.\" she said. The usually snappy unicorn was rendered utterly speechless at the sound of such a crazy... but otherwise brilliant... plan of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra grinned. \"We're crazy fetishists, but we're not stupid. You really think my wife and I would go getting ourselves eaten and killed? That'd just cut short all the crazy awesome sex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl laughed feeling a little more comfortable, though the whole thing was still weird as hell. She stopped and cocked her head, thinking a moment. \"But then what was all that about your 'last moments together' and all that earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra waved a hoof dismissively. \"Oh that. Don't worry about that. It was all roleplay.\" she giggled. \"It's a lot more <i>thrilling</i> to pretend that it's your last moments alive. Makes the stomach sex WAY better.\" the DJ raised an eyebrow at the mention of stomach sex. She couldn't help but admit that sounded pretty kinky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mint unicorn giggled awkwardly, looking at her apologetically. \"I'm sorry... I wouldn't have said that if I knew you were so new to this. I thought you'd been here longer. My wife and I have been members a week and have been digested three times now. If I'd known this was your first time I wouldn't have said anything so startling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch chuckled, scratching the back of her head with a hoof. \"It... <i>was</i> pretty startling. Not many things make me lose my cool like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're alright now, though right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl nodded. \"Yeah, I think so. I just wish Carapace had told me what I was getting into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra grinned. \"And you're okay with the thought of digesting ponies and getting in on the fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gurgle arose from vinyl's distended belly. The DJ prodded at it with a hoof gently, finding it to be a little bit more squishy than before. Bonbon had to be at least halfway digested into goo right about now. Still, as she patted her belly shw heard a soft, sensual moan come from her gut. She smirked a little. \"Yeah.\" Vinyl said. \"I could get into this.\"<br>\r\n <i>'Sounds kinda fun, even, now that I know what's really going on...'</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden touch on her shoulders caused the DJ to look up. She turned to see Lyra giving her a back massage with her hooves. Winking seductively, she stuck her tongue out at the alabaster mare. \"So...\" she crooned. \"Now that you know what's really going on, you up for another meal, you ravenous little beastie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl smiled a little. \"Actually...\"</span></div></div>",

She crawled out of her bed and trotted up to the window to see where the sun was in the sky. It was approaching noon it looked like, and Derpy's tummy grumbled in anticipation of a good breakfast. She went down to her kitchen to look through her food stores, only to find she was running a little low on just about everything. It was about time to go to the market, it seemed. She did have a little bread leftover, so she had toast and jelly before heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrotting out of her house with her saddlebags secured to her back, she stopped by the mailbox to see if she'd gotten any mail.  She did get two letters and looked them over, content to read them there in her yard. Her vision problem sometimes made reading a little hard as she kept skipping over lines and had to start over. Seemed that she was invited to a party today from Pinkie Pie. Well that was nice, but it wasn't until later, so she still had a few options on what she could do for the day. She needed to get groceries, or at least go soewhere to grab a bite to eat... then she could go look for some work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy was clumsy and had a poor sense of space. Even when blindfolded she had trouble navigating around more so than other ponies, and she was just TERRIBLE at pin the tail on the pony. She also had a big, big, biiig problem with constantly bumping into things with her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy had a big, firm, fantastic rear, which seemed to have fat on it that was far more dense than that of other ponies. Derpy was fairly fit and trim looking, but she actually weighed a lot! And it was all because of her tightly packed, firm rear! If it weren't for her eyes, or at least the fact that the stallions of Ponyvilles at least pretended to be gentlecolts most of the time, Derpy would probably have ponies crawling all over her for a piece of her bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled at the thought. But anyway, her clumsiness was well known, so, most of the employers around town just sort of juggled Derpy from job to job, and while she never starved, she was tight with her money and didn't buy groceries until she needed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy put away her mail and then thought about where she was going to go eat.</span></div></div>",

She was helping with a rainstorm when it happened and accidentally gathered an order of storm clouds when she went to go get them from Cloudsdale. Thankfully only the town hall got struck when she and Rainbow started trying to make the rain fall and got lightning instead. It had really surprised her, because she was so SURE that she got the clouds from the shipment yard that said \"rain\" on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe townhall was also an embarrassing testimony to Derpy's heavy rump though. She looked at the column that had replaced the one she knocked over way back then, just bumping it clean off when she slammed into it with her momentous rear. \"Oh welll...!\" she said with a little sigh and held her chin up. As Pinkie always said, it took more muscles to frown than to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived in the market place and started looking through the booths, wondering what she should get. Her tummy grumbled eagerly for food, but today she was feeling a little picky. She wasn't sure why.

She wasn't sure what she should do, because her insides felt so empty, and even if it was just Applejack's muzzle in her pucker and the rest of her head firmly planted between her bulging buttocks, the Earth pony's presence inside her was stimulating and satisfying, and she kind of wanted more of it. Still, it would be kind of a bad idea for her to eat her employer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as Applejack suddenly placed her forehooves onto Derpy's butt and pushed. The sudden movement caused her pucker to tighten, and the tight squeeze sent pleasure through the wall-eyed pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh!\" she huffed and threw her head high, arching her back and rocking her hip backward, pushing it down over Applejack's with a deep, squishy pop! Derpy moaned and spread her wings as she felt the Earth pony's head, stetson falling to the wayside, lodged so far up her ass. She breathed hard, trying to relax herself. \"Oh no no, I can't eat AJ with my butt!\" she sighed and tried to pull away, but once again the sudden friction encouraged her anus to only pull more pony inside rather than push it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what's going wrong, it's not supposed to pull stuff iiin!\" Derpy whined. She huffed as Applejack resumed trying to free herself, putting a lot of pressure with her hooves on Derpy's plush rump. The strong tug on her sphincter and the touch of those hooves on her butt sent sparks of pleasure through the grey pegasus and made her vision cloud over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" she muttered as she bent her back legs. \"What to do...!\" Her rump pushed down hard, forcing Applejack's shoulders straight into her hot core, her buttcheeks spread quite wide now around Applejack's chest and legs, which were pressed together as they were entering Derpy. The pegasus's tail wagged up and down, slapping against Applejack's back and rear. Derpy turned her head to see if Applejack was beginning to panic.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Applejack is acting a little funny. She had tried to pull herself, yeah, but now that she was stuck like that she wasn't moving around half as much as Derpy would expect. The farm pony was stuffed halfway up another pony's butt, and she was just sort of standing still. Applejack's hindleg began to shake a little bit, a muscle twitching in her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy suddenly began to smell something kind of sweet and flowery, something dirty. Derpy blushed and looked away, turning her head around to see if anyone had noticed what was happening yet, but so far no one had noticed anything strange occurring behind the apple stand. Derpy began to bounce on her hooves just ever so slightly. They weren't being interrupted at all. She took a little gulp and cautiously gave a little squeeze with her loins. She whimpered a little with pleasure, feeling that she was indeed getting aroused, but she wasn't really that wet just yet. She looked back at Applejack and saw that her tail was now twitching back and forth as if trying to slap away some pesky bug. A little drop of something clear fell from between her legs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy gasped and her blush became a lot deeper. Applejack was the one she was smelling! Derpy just stared in shock for a moment, her face scrunching up as she considered this. Then she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy not? Really, why not? She wasn't sure what went wrong, but she certainly knew what was going right! She licked her lips and felt her tummy grumble insistently. Derpy pushed her butt back, and sucked in a little more of Applejack. She felt a little vibration inside her core, perhaps Applejack giving a moan...? Derpy couldn't hear Applejack talking, and didn't feel her attempt very much in the way of communication. She certainly never started hollering or screaming in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy decided to tease herself to get the mood right. Whispering, she said, \"Oh... Miss AJ, do you think Miss Hooves has a nice rear?\" She shook her butt and pushed backwards, and Applejack braced herself against the ground, allowing another few inches of her body to be accepted by Derpy's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's a yes</i>, Derpy thought, and smiled, tongue hanging out. \"Why yes Ah do,\" Derpy imitated. \"Why Ah think Miss Hooves's rear is just dandy!\" Derpy closed her eyes and lifted her front leg and curled it. She shook her body a little and then clenched her tailhole, pulling in Applejack's chest completely as her stretched sphincter closed down tight over her hooves. \"In fact, I think Derpy has the best rear in town!\" Derpy said, starting to break accent. \"Oh I just want to crawl up inside that pony's rear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy squeed a little and felt a few drops of her own honey drip from her loins. She pushed again and felt most of Applejack's stomach sink into her core. Derpy's stomach growled loudly. \"I'm really hungry...!\" Derpy whimpered, grinning as she started to think that this might be a great way to settle two problems at once. This not only felt really good, but if she could just keep pulling Applejack deeper and deeper into her body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy giggled and decided to save that excitement for later. Placing both hooves on the ground again, she thrust backwards hard and felt her legs slap against Applejack's. The two ponies were, manner of speaking, butt-to-butt. Derpy sighed and tugged hard with her insides, sucking in half of Applejack's cutie marks and her dock. Her tail wiggled, Derpy's butt cheeks beginning to squish around Applejack's hips as they got ready to close around the nearly-finished meal. Applejack's legs dangled and kicked, unable to find purchase on anything. Derpy drooled a little as she lowered her rump and pressed Applejack's hooves into the dirt, sitting down on her. The farm pony's own ass slipped quickly into Derpy's with another deep pop as the head had made, and then it was all too easy to keep lowering her bubble butt down over Applejack's legs, ending at her ankles as her cheeks touched the ground. Derpy rubbed her distended belly, feeling Applejack's body through her engorged intestines. Derpy thrust against the ground a few times, just enjoying that full feeling before her anus gave a pull and suckled in Applejack's ankles, her butt cheeks filling the gap and pushing back together in a thick, attractive valley. Her anus tightened back up as Applejack's hooves disappeared completely into Derpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus panted, her brow sweaty as she started to settle down from the incredible meal she just had. \"Thatta girl Miss Hooves,\" Derpy said. \"Oh wooow that felt so good! I should have started sticking things in my rear years ago...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled again, reminding Derpy that she was, despite sexual satisfaction, quite hungry! The large insertion in her ass felt great and all, but could she really keep Applejack lodged inside her? Derpy could feel her intestines beginning to squirrel her away deeper into her winding guts, and figured where it was trying to take her. Was the sexual satisfaction enough, or could Derpy really allow herself to deposit poor AJ into her stomach and gurgle her away for brunch?</span></div></div>",

Unknown to her, Derpy\u2019s belly was canceling out her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDerpy, meanwhile, had set herself down lightly, allowing Twilight\u2019s body to stay standing, everything up to her forelegs already inside of Derpy\u2019s rump.<i> It worked!</i> She thought to herself. <i>And she isn\u2019t using magic.</i> \u201cSilly Twilight, if you wanted to be eaten so badly, why didn\u2019t you just say so?\u201d Derpy heard some gibberish from Twilight, but she just took it as a sign that she agreed to be eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDerpy slowly lowered her plot to the ground, pushing the princess inside, and filling up her belly. Soon, Twilight\u2019s tail was the only thing left outside the mailmare, and with a *slurp*, it joined the rest of her. Derpy rubbed her belly, satisfied with her meal. The bulge wiggles and squirmed, but she took no notice of it. Instead, she opted to start her walk home, planning on sleeping as her body processed its snack.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

By now, there was noting left of Fluttershy, except for a few yellow and pink hairs, and a large pile of stinky waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, there was something else joining the pony in the intestines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus's pet bunny, Angel, was reduced to nothing more than a few white hairs and a small pile of waste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two piles of poop kept drifting down Derpy's GI tract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy awoke with a big stretch and rubbed her eyes, to remove the crust that had made its way there during the night. Gleefully remembering the activities of what had transpired the previous evening, she thrusted the blanket off of her and stood up, craning her head and neck to stare at her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow! It's huge\"!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed it was. Fluttershy and Angel added another three pounds to Derpy's rear, and she squealed with delight. She knew that her plot was the biggest in town, perhaps even in Equestria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, she ceased her thoughts of her plot and remembered Fluttershy's request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy made the bed perfectly and stood up, taking a proud look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a sharp pain in her gut diverted her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey pegasus gave a sly grin, knowing what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly trotted out of Fluttershy's bedroom, and into the bathroom, adjacent to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy shut the door behind her before sitting on the white porcelain toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat up straight and gave a grunt, and pushed, hoping to relieve the pain in her gut, quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force shot a brown log out of Derpy's ass, landing in the toilet with a loud PLOP, which ricocheted some toilet water, that splashed onto Derpy's plot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered from the cold water, but then giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanted to go back up my plot, Fluttershy, I'm sorry to let you down. You're nothing but poop now, that's going to be flushed down your own toilet, before ending up in a stinky sewer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy gave another huge grunt and a big push, and more waste expelled from her tailhole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved a hoof in front of her face, to get the smell out of her breathing area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! Fluttershy, you're the stinkiest one yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mailmare grabbed the toilet paper, and ripped off a substantial amount, and cleaned her tailhole, before discarding the paper in the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, and turned the toilet with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, goodbye, Fluttershy. It was nice knowing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed the handle down, and the toilet swirled, sending Fluttershy and Angel to their final resting place in a sewer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy went downstairs and out the door of the cottage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Today is a new day. </i> She thought. <i>Which pony will I have for breakfast? I just ate a pegasus, so I can't eat Rainbow Dash just yet. That leaves me two choices. Do I want delicious, high class, unicorn meat? Or would I rather have a sweet treat in an Earth Pony?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy put her hoof to her chin and thought about her choice.</span></div></div>",

Her poofy coiffure looked like cake frosting, and the grey pegasus hoped it would taste equally as succulent. The pink Earth Pony always had her mane smelling like cotton candy. Whether that was the shampoo she used, or the natural odor, it didn't matter. It was a sweet smell, and it made Derpy salivate just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Derpy. Keep your head in the game.

As much as she was worried about what it'd feel like, she was also strangely aroused and excited. She felt that if today was her last day alive, she may as well have some fun first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pony stuck a bit of her hoof inside her pussy and began to masturbate herself. The sensation drove her the edge, to be doing this while inside another living creature. It was a feeling that Pinkie Pie couldn't explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe panted as she used her hoof to trace in a circular motion around her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh\"! Pinkie Pie gasped, brushing against her labia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pony continued to pleasure herself as she heard the sounds of the fleshy prison around her. She could also make out the feint beating of Derpy's heartbeat. It felt soothing, almost like a gentle lullaby. Her body began to tingle, not because she was getting close, but because of the acid that was slowly eating away at the meal inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Pinkie pleasure herself faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl, Derpy. Your body knows what it wants. Don't deny it. Let me feed myself to you. I want to become a big bunch of fat on your plot. Digest me and turn me into nutrients!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Earth Pony kept at her self stimulation as the acid began rising higher, now at her knees. Pinkie started to moan, feeling near her release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Pinkie Pie cummed. The force was so intense that her whole body convulsed and she went unconscious from her orgasmic bliss, never to awaken.</span></div></div>",

She grit her teeth and kept pushing, determined to quickly finish dispelling her latest meal into the toilet where she belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blocked her nose with a hoof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Celestia.

Then again, you're nothing but shit now, so I can't be too surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus continued to expel her remains and flush the toilet on occasion, so it didn't overflow with whatever was left of Pinkie.

I'm famished for your shit\"!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good girl, Rarity.\" Derpy said before lowering her plot further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small fart escaped the mailmare's tailhole, and Rarity wasted no time and sniffed the gas right up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy blushed and pushed again, this time, a small trickle of shit was being pushed from her tailhole. She struggled and strained to push it out, and successfully did so, landing in Rarity's mouth with a *PLOP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember to chew your food, Rarity. I want you to enjoy this meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity did just that. She chewed and chewed the fecal morsel, staining her teeth with Derpy's shit. She had to admit, it didn't taste half bad. Having been the remains of her late friend Pinkie Pie, Rarity was delighted to find it had an exquisite and sweet taste to it. The unicorn kept chewing until the shit was reduced to a bolus, before she swallowed it down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not done, my bitch. More food for your tum tum coming right up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Rarity placed her mouth directly over Derpy's tailhole. Her Mistress would be able to relieve herself directly in her mouth, no gravity needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus shit, this time a large solid log, straight into the fashionista's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity's eyes widened as she felt her meal enter her mouth. It was much to large to swallow, and it was coming in too quickly. She was a bit upset that there wasn't enough time to properly enjoy her food, but she was still ravenous for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe log was winding its way down the unicorns throat. Rarity was swallowing her Mistress's shit whole. Swallow after swallow Rarity did and within a minute, it stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick me clean, bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity lapped away at Derpy's asshole, determined to clean it. Once she finished, she licked her lips clean before emanating a loudly belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the meal, Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Now that you've gotten your meal, what do you say I can eat mine\"?</span></div></div>",

Her anus puckered, and began sucking in its new meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn was in heaven. This was it! It's begun! Her ultimate fantasy has started. It was a dream come true for the fashionable pony. She felt her body convulse as more of it was sucked into Derpy's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh! You feel so good in there, Rarity. Be a good girl and squirm for your Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity heard Derpy speak and did just that. It wasn't much, as not much of her was inside. Still, she moved her head in all directions, shaking it forcibly. She did what she could, as best as she could, for her Mistress to be pleasured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Good bitch.\" Derpy teased and sucked up to Rarity's neck now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity couldn't help herself. Her lower loins were leaking large amounts of juice desperate for release. She mentally cursed herself for her current situation, because she couldn't pleasure herself. She needed relief and she needed it bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy sniffed the air, confused by the odor she could detect around her. It was all too familiar. She knew that it wasn't her own loins that were flowering, and then only left one suspect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, she continued the teasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're leaking right now, my morsel. But I forbid you any sexual relief while you're inside me. Do you understand? This is not for your own pleasure. Don't be selfish. This is for my pleasure, and mine alone. Be a good bitch and follow my orders. Oh, and I'll know if you're masturbating, because I'll feel you squirm a certain way inside of me. If that happens, I'll push you right back out of my plot. You don't want that, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside of her plot, Derpy heard Rarity whine.</span></div></div>",

I'm doing this for your pleasure only, not mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy smiled, quite pleased that her food had understood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach gurgled loudly, growing impatient, and Derpy took that as a sign it was time to slurp up more of her meal.

You're almost in my belly now, Rarity. Don't worry. It'll take real good care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bunch of muffled sounds came from her plot, but they weren't audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The time for talking is over, Rarity. Let me enjoy my meal now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn went silent and she slurped her ass again, leaving just the curvy, purple tail on the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly churned, an indication that Rarity was now inside, meeting her destiny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clenched one final time and Rarity's tail disappeared up her plothole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!\" Derpy said, with a happy sigh, feeling her belly nice and full. \"You were delicious Rarity.

The movement causing her belly to shake, and Derpy released a long, loud belch. She giggled and patted her stomach, burping again. Derpy made her way upstairs and found Rarity's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly flopping on the four-poster bed, tiredly, she pulled the blankets on herself, and was snoozing less than a minute later.</span></div></div>",

Rarity was digested, and it put a smile on the pegasus's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling comfortable, she placed her hooves behind her head and lay back down, staring at the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Five elements of harmony down. One to go. Soon, I'll be the epitome of all elements of harmony.

They'd never know the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally kicking herself, she put those kinds of thoughts out of her mind. She had business to do. It was dinner time, and there was a certain cyan mare that was on the menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus kicked her legs and flapped her wings to head towards Rainbow Dash's house. She'd been there a few times. Rainbow Dash enlisted Derpy's help when she'd first move to Ponyville. Derpy was very happy to help out her friend in her time of need. Now, she was hoping Rainbow Dash would return the favor by helping Derpy out in her time of need for filling her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mailmare began to salivate and her stomach rumbled.

Thrashing around, she stretched all of her muscles, ready to begin the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groggily got out of her bed, and made her way to the bathroom. The persistent pain in her gut alerting her that it was time for nature to take its course once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mailmare grinned to herself as she kept walking to the restroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Rainbow. Let's see how fast you are as you're coming out of my ass. Something tells me that you're going to be faster as my shit, than you could ever be as a pony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus let out a loud giggle and planted her plot on the porcelain toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted a few times and dispelled a few vile smelling farts, which she wafted away with a hoof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, Rainbow. For someone who smelled so pleasant, you really have a terrible odor as my digested prey. As Rarity would say, 'How uncouth'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy laughed happily realizing with Rainbow now digested, she had finally eaten the Elements of Harmony. She had done it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried again to shit, but was disappointed that more gas came out instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mailrmare pouted slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Dash. I know you enjoy being in my ass, but my body has already turned you into buttfood. You have to come out now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy strained and pushed, and finally a long brown log containing many prismatic hairs plopped into the toilet. The force sending a cold splash of water on Derpy's plot, which the pegasus eeped at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good girl, Dash. Now I'm gonna try again. You show me how speedy you really can be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClenching her plothole a few times, she was ecstatic to feel a rush of solid matter expel from her anus and submerge itself under the toilet water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. I guess the old saying is true. Third time really is the charm. Hey, charm! Like an artifact! Like the Elements of Harmony! Do you get the joke, Dash? Of course not, you're just a pile of my shit now, just like the rest of your friends became. By the way I was right. You were more speedy as my shit than you were as a pegasus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stopped talking and calmly ripped a bunch of toilet paper and bound it around her hoof. Derpy reached down between her nether regions and wiped her asshole clean, before releasing the hoofful of Dash's remains, as if she were garbage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt landed on top of the rest of what was formerly Rainbow Dash, and the grey pegasus grinned deviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another thought, Derpy flushed the toilet, sending Rainbow's remains deep into the sewers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus stood up and noticed a manebrush atop of the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that she hasn't brushed her mane in a while, she reached for it with a hoof before approaching a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's funny. I wonder why Rainbow had a mirror that was this small. The two of us were around the same size.</i> Derpy thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she studied herself in the mirror, she was shocked to find...</span></div></div>",

She flexed her body a few times to make sure she wasn't dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy had grown another foot, her wings had doubled in size, and she had a horn atop her head. Eating the Elements of Harmony did as Derpy suspected. She had become an alicorn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquealing happily, she gushed over her image, twisting her body every way possible to look at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome! I'm so happy that all my buttfood was able to turn me into this! I wonder if I can use the Elements of Harmony myself now. Though I'd probably have to go to Canterlot for that. Twilight once told me that Princess Celestia keeps them guarded all day and night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the midst of her soliloquy, the gray mailmare had noticed something else. Above her own cutie mark, there were six others, forming a circular pattern around it. Towards the top left, three apples. Below that, were yellow and blue balloons. Underneath her own mark, there was a six pointed star. To the southwest, a cloud with a red, yellow, and blue lightning bolt. Above that, three blue diamonds. Finally, above her own cutie mark, there were three pink butterflies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy squeed as she poked her new cutie marks, glad that her buttfood had contributed something else! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, in addition to becoming an alicorn, I have their cutie marks too? And, I could possible wield the Elements of Harmony? Wow, I might be the most powerful pony in Equestria right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud rumbling sound broke Derpy out of her own thoughts. She looked down at her belly, realizing it was hungry for food. She smirked and had an idea on how to satiate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I plan on seeing if I can wield the Elements, I'd need to go  Canterlot anyway. There's no bigger meal that could fill me than the Princesses themselves. I already ate one, so why not eat the other ones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy left Rainbow Dash's bathroom, flying towards Canterlot, intent on eating the Princesses, as her stomach continued to howl with hunger.</span></div></div>",

She had digested Rainbow Dash the previous night and shit her out very early in the morning. The sun was barely up, meaning it couldn't have been that long past seven. Derpy focused, hoping to get to Canterlot quickly, feeling giddy about her possibility of being able to use the Elements, and because she had a big breakfast awaiting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more she thought about it, she frowned. Eating ponies is one thing, but eating the Princess? Could Derpy even do that? They were a lot bigger than normal ponies. Twilight wasn't that much bigger than Derpy when she ate her, but Celestia and Luna were at least twice her size. It'd be very difficult to do. Still, Derpy had to try!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that her wings were twice as wide, the grey pegasus felt very confident that she could make the flight to Canterlot in half the normal time. Soon she'd have a big belly full of Celestia. The thought made her stomach rumble again, and Derpy drooled with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight willingly agreed to become my buttfood! Why wouldn't the other Princesses do the same? I'm sure my belly is nice and comfy, and they'd be happy to be gurgled up into buttfood! I hope so anyway, I don't want to fight them like I had to with Rainbow Dash. They should just realize their place is to be my buttfood and  agree to be slurped up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept flying, noticing the sun was rising higher now, hoping to get there before anyone had noticed her. It'd be a difficult thing to explain. How exactly she had a horn, and bigger wings, and seven cutie marks! Derpy didn't even want to have that discussion so she focused on her destination. It wouldn't be much longer. Around another twenty minutes or so, Derpy estimated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the gray mailmare flew on, doing random flips and spins while she flew, to combat the boredom she felt. They mailmare was shocked. She had never done that before. Was that the part of her that Rainbow Dash had become? For a quick moment, she wondered if the six personalities of her buttfood had lived on inside of her, as if their souls still existed, even though their bodies had become shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie? Can you hear me?\" Derpy wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep yeporooni!\" A small voice said inside of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy gave a nervous chuckle, knowing she was correct. They still existed in some form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. I hope none of you are mad at me for eating you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not at all. I was at first because, well, let's be honest, who wanted to die and be turned into shit?\" Twilight began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, darling! And I was very happy that Ms. Hooves fulfilled that desire for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway!\" Twilight continued, flustered. \"I was initially, but after talking it over with the girls, we're very happy. We're all reunited again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good!\" Derpy responded. \"But, I'm not done. I'm going to Canterlot to eat the Princesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They need a long rest. They've been ruling too long. We'll help you do it, Derpy!\" Twilight said.</span></div></div>",

Derpy learned from them more about them, and all six said that they'd help Derpy with her mission. Rainbow Dash even thanked her for reuniting them all, and Derpy squeed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in the middle of a conversation with Applejack when Twilight quickly interjected \"Land right by that platform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why that platform, Twilight?\" Replied Derpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the platform outside of the window of Princess Luna's bedroom. Since the sun is up, it's safe to assume that she's asleep. You'll be able to eat her much more easily if she's in that state. Even with all of us absorbed, the princesses are really tough Derpy. I don't think you'd be able to eat one if they were awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mailmare put a hoof to her chin and mulled it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You're right, Twilight. Thanks for the tip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe declined down towards the platform and landed softly. Peering into the window, she was glad to see Luna sleeping peacefully in her chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's asleep, just like you said. Wow, Twilight, you really are a smart one, aren't you\"? Derpy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was really just common sense. One sleeps while the other guards, and if it's morning, I know who's asleep.\" Replied Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your plan now Derpy? Are you just gonna open the window and creep inside to turn Luna into buttfood\"? Pinkie Pie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! If I'm really quiet, there's no way she'll wake up. Besides, the guards are outside her door, not her window. This will be easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Derpy quickly and quietly opened the window and hopped inside. She ambled towards the sleeping Princess and presented her rear over her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy took a deep breath and positioned her ass correctly and looked back at Luna.</span></div></div>",

Her plot tightened and the hole opened up to allow more of Luna inside. Inching slowly, in a mix of not wanting her to wake up, and her own discomfort, the pegasus realized it would take a bit of time to take this meal up her plot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Derpy's anus, Princess Luna slept peacefully. She was dreaming of playing with her abacus, and it brought a smile to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy heard the princess of the night mumble something, but it was heavily distorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, buttfood.

She knew she should have been horrified or angry, or <i>something</i>, at Derpy for devouring her friends, but that gorgeous rear turned her on too much, and she honestly was warming to the idea of it gobbling ponies and growing even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Would it really be so bad for us to all be part of such a big, sexy, probably amazingly comfy plot?\"</i> Rainbow thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash was jostled from her thoughts by Derpy kissing her on the lips, the clumsy mare giving her fellow pegasus a generous, yet slightly off-balance, smooch, which ended with a small pop. The mailmare put on a sultry expression, and nuzzled Dash's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you like my big fat rear so much, why don't we have some fun before I feed you to it,\" Derpy said with a welcoming smile, \"I've enjoyed your friends, but I've been in such a hurry I haven't thought to \"play\" at all, so I'll be happy to\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash's earlier nerves evaporated at that, and a lustful smile sprang to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww-yeah, let's have some <i>fun</i>,\" the sky-colored speedster cheered, \"I want to tap that sexy ass\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Derpy found herself picked up in Dash's forelegs, her hooves groping her ass as she flew her to the bedroom and onto the bed. The mailmare smiled as Dash pushed the covers down to make room, then turned to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir expressions were identical mixes of lust and uncertainty, neither sure where to start, when Dash suddenly grinned predatorily and pushed Derpy onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent and whispered sensually into Derpy's ear, \"Why don't we start out simple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash then turned around over Derpy so they were facing each other's naughty bits, a classic 69 position, and dug her muzzle in between the mailmare's back legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy squealed and moaned at the pleasure of her fellow pegasus lapping at her nethers. She likely would've just lain there if something clear, fragrant, and sweet hadn't dripped onto her muzzle, which she reflexively licked up. Tasting faintly like some sort of sweet and fruity candy, Derpy savored Dash's juices before grabbing her flanks and pulling her on top of her, and then beginning to slurp lewdly at the daredevil's tight pink pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth mares moaned and rocked in rhythm slightly as they ate each other out. The rich scent of their joint arousal perfuming the room as they teased each other towards climax. Derpy's huge rump rocked like thick gelatin, rolling with each movement, while Dash's tight athletic plot tensed with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking and moaning, both mares ground their sexes into each other's faces, orgasms nearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Dash!\" Derpy groaned out, \"I'm cumming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick burst of wetness flowed from the gray pony's crotch and coated Dash's face, even as she licked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy, despite having <i>devoured</i> four prominent ponies recently, now looked adorably vulnerable, her cheeks colored rosy pink, her eyes tearing up dew-like and innocent at the edges, her breathing soft and rushed through her nose, and her mouth scrunched in a childish pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash, licking up the last of the hungry pegasus' creamy pussy juice with a devious grin, turned around, her own marehood wet and winking with delayed orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, mind if I mix things up?\" Dash asked, her dripping slit on full display, as she flapped up to hover inches above Derpy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy nodded, closing her eyes in a relaxed manner and opening her mouth wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash then began to hoof her own cunt, the eroticism of this, and Derpy's serene look, sending a pleasant shiver through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh, ohhh, ohh yeah, ohh fuck!\" Rainbow exclaimed, her orgasm taking only seconds to reinvigorate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy felt a sudden thin spray of juices, like morning mist, coat her face. She giggled and licked it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voracious mare was in ecstasy, all her pent up arousal from eating and finishing with the other Elements had been unleashed, at least partly, leaving her relaxed and floaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash settled back on the sticky bed, her trademark cocky smile in full view, while Derpy finished working through her afterglow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rainbow speedster enjoyed the warmth and scent of their session, Derpy sat up and took a deep breath, regaining her focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big-butted pegasus turned to her soon-to-be lunch with a hungry, half-lidded gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash's eyes shot open as Derpy's hooves slithered ticklishly across her belly, sending her wriggling with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derp-eee-hee-hy, sto-hop, that tic-kles\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeasing her teasing, Derpy smiled salaciously and asked...</span></div></div>",

Rainbow once more began slurping Derpy's pussy, it quickly growing wet, while its owner \"mmmm-ed\" in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gotten Derpy successfully warmed up, Rainbow licked up Derpy's butt valley, moving towards her tail-hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's even softer than I imagined</i>,\" the blue pegasus thought in ecstasy, \"<i>I can't believe I'm thinking this, but now, I-I</i> want <i>to crawl up this awesome butt</i>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the warm and pillowy soft globes clenched around her head, Rainbow Dash, having quickly finished laving Derpy's crack, began licking and pecking her pucker. Her tongue purring over the tight hole, Rainbow let her hooves caress and rub the fat butt cheeks, feeling the jiggly layers of fat that was once her friends. The mailmare-turned-predator's furry bubbles shifted and wobbled around Rainbow's head, only the center of her chromatic mane visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she felt Rainbow's tongue finally start to enter her butthole, Derpy began to tease her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash, I hope you're enjoying this, 'cause you're going up my fat bubble butt afterwards you know,\" right on cue, Derpy's stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit of heat in her butt, most likely from Rainbow blushing, Derpy began humping slightly into Rainbow's probing tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh Rainbow Dash, you are going to be make <i>great</i> butt fat, mmmm, and then I'll (huff) poop-you-ouuttttt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the teasing, plus Dash's licking, had driven her right to the edge, and a quick rub from her hoof sent Derpy right into her second orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling wetness drip onto her chest, Dash pulled away, giving one last rub to Derpy's overwhelming ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derpy?\" Dash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Derpy said, having sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish me off?\" Rainbow asked, exposing her wet crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Derpy walked up, the sticky sheets squeaking, and drove a hoof into Dash's nethers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning, Dash told Derpy to turn around. Now in a 69 again, Rainbow Dash smiled and suddenly slapped Derpy's left cheek, sending it wobbling and shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeek!\" Derpy exclaimed, not expecting Dash to have any more surprises. Turning back, still clopping Dash's cunt, she smiled seductively at her and wiggled her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling as well, Dash gave several more slaps, enjoying the jiggle of the thick and multi-layered rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy let an \"mmpf\" with each slap, as she rubbed and pushed into Rainbow's tight pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh-oohhh Derpy!\" the cyan pegasus cried as she came all over Derpy's hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy licked her hoof clean of pussy juice, then began lowering her butt towards Rainbow's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butt-nomming time Dashie\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart racing more in response, Dash suddenly spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derpy wait...\"</span></div></div>",

Rainbow then turned herself around, balanced herself on her forelegs, and began prodding her back ones at Derpy's winking pucker.

Stallions and mares alike were unable to look away from that huge rear. Which wasn't surprising, Derpy's buttcheeks were roughly the size of basketballs, maybe larger, swaying and rippling masses of fat that only their owner knew was all that remained of 5 of the Elements of Harmony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling at the stares she was getting, and particularly at one waiter at the cafe over pouring somepony's drink without noticing, Derpy added more of a sashay to her walk.

Her eyes hazing over, Rarity moaned and grabbed the squirming pegasus in her magic, using it to keep her in place as she stood up onto her hooves, a much better position to devour the mailmare in. Now Derpy was seated on her pillowy rear, with her face in Rarity's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning again, Rarity used her magic to push Derpy's head into her anus, which entered with a \"fhup\". Now that her head was in, the carnivorous pegasus was quickly sucked in up to her neck by the snow-white unicorn's sexy rump, her squirms utterly ineffective and her yells stifled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her combination of her anal muscles and magic, Rarity soon worked her derri\u00e8re over Derpy's shoulder and forelegs, then her chest and wings. Speeding up, Rarity's ass sucked in Derpy's belly smoothly, before stopping at her engorged bubble booty. Grunting and pouting, the hunger-filled fashionista seized it firmly with her magic, and shoved hard, the fat squeezing in like thick gelatin. Derpy's gray legs and blonde tail disappearing up ass, Rarity's mind began to clear of the deep haze it had been under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my, that felt <i>amazing</i>, I-\" Rarity suddenly stopped as she realized what she had done. Putting a hoof to her protruding gut, Rarity began chewing on her lip as she tried to sort out her feelings on the matter at hoof. Scrunching up her face momentarily, Rarity suddenly \"mmm-ed\" and shut her eyes as a ripple of ectasy came from her insides. Rubbing her belly, Rarity's eyes drifted to the door, then to her stomach, before she shrugged and declared, \"Oh why not? This is probably a more fitting punishment than anything the Princesses could come up with anyway\". Giggling, Rarity waited until Derpy had been deposited into her stomach, which swelled to a massive size, before levitating herself with her magic upstairs to her room. Deciding to forego her usual sleep-mask, Rarity tucked her blankets over her gurgling belly and sighed in relaxation as she put her head on her pillow. Soon, she was fast asleep, her stomach doing to Derpy what the mailmare's own had done to her friends.</span></div></div>",

She had grown taller, though not as tall as Princess Celestia,  she was a head or so taller than Fleur de Lis. Large and majestic wings were on her back, and her coat had a faint glow to it, making it look almost like moonlight. Rarity's eyes had changed as well, now possessing two irises, her own sapphire blue as the large inner one, and the smaller outer one being a shifting mix of her friends' eye colors, emerald green, soft teal, baby blue, purple, and majenta. Her name and tail had become thicker, flowed magically like the Princesses, and had new curls. 5 of the curls in her mane and tail each had a streak of one of her friends' hair colors, Applejack's blonde, Twilight's purple and pink, Pinkie's dark pink, Fluttershy's floral pink, and Rainbow Dash's multicolor. Her cutie mark was no longer three diamonds, instead it was a single glittering sapphire, bordered by a monarch butterfly in the upper right, a cloud with different colored lightning bolts shooting out in the upper left, a red magic star in lower right, a red apple in lower left, and a set of 3 balloons, pink, green, and orange, on the bottom, all over layed over a background of gold bubbles. Lastly, her figure had changed. Before Rarity had been mildly athletic from her mild exercise and martial arts, with enough fat to catch the eye of many stallions (and a few mares). Now, her body was rippling with muscle, a representation of the Earth pony strength she had acquired. As for the fat, it and been shifted to just the right places on her body to make her even more curvier and alluring than ever before, with any excess having went straight to her belly to form a layer of soft chub, and to her ass to make it even more eye-catching. Though not as big as the mare she had devoured, Rarity's ass had grown to a size rivaling Zecora's. At first dumbstruck and uncertain of her new look, Rarity finally spoke, \"I-I must say I look <i>fabulous</i>, and also I-\" (pppttt). Rarity's admiration was interrupted by a low fart. \"-I-I definitely must release Derpy quite soon, it seems\". Rushing into her bathroom, Rarity gently set her improved derri\u00e8re on her toilet seat. Rarity grunted as her anus opened up and released another fart, followed by a lump of brown waste. Farting loudly, Rarity pushed more of the remains of the pony-eating mailmare's as dark logs of shit, squeezing free and plopping into the toilet. \"Oh, mmmm!\" Rarity moaned as she pushed, the poop that came out now containing bone fragments, feathers, and blonde hair. Passing a couple more puffs of gas, Rarity's slit released a stream of urine before the new alicorn got up and wiped her butt and nethers clean, dropping the paper in the toilet to join the pile of waste. Turning to her cutiemark, Rarity suddenly teared up a d sniffled as the reality of her friends' demise came back to her. 'I'll miss you girls...\" Rarity said softly, before giving an angry huff at the contents of her toilet and pushing the lever. Her shit swirling away into the plumbing, Rarity took a deep breath and decided to...</span></div></div>",

Before she could scream, Derpy slammed her butt down on Rarity, wedging her head into her colon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, Rarity, I can't wait 'til you're all the way in,\" she moaned as her anus gave a clench, sucking in Rarity's neck and shoulders. Inside Derpy's bowels, Rarity gagged at the faint stink, whimpering as the muscles pulsed and sucked in her front hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucking harder, the struggling unicorn's body is consumed inch by inch by Derpy's ravenous backside. Forelegs, belly, and waist all being tugged inside the gray pegasus's massive booty. Smiling, Derpy clenched hard. \"Time to end this\". With a final three tugs, Rarity's soft tush, squirming legs, and tail vanished, their owner now simply buttfood for a big butted gray pegasus.</span></div></div>",

Throwing the blanket off, the gray pegasus stood on top of the bed and looked at herself in a tall full-length mirror up against the wall to the left of the bed. Blushing, Derpy looked her new form over. \"<i>Well, I guess eating the Elements didn't make me an alicorn or let me use them or anything, but this is cool too</i>\". Though not an alicorn, Derpy certainly had changed, along with her buttcheeks being almost the size of beach balls now, her eyes had changed drastically. Her irises were now split into sections, each a different one of the Elements' own eye colors, majenta for Rainbow Dash, regal blue for Rarity, Twilight's purple, Applejack's earthly green, Pinkie Pie's baby blue, and Fluttershy's light teal, with her scelera now golden colored like her own irises had been. Her transformed eyes scanning herself, Derpy saw she had gained two new pairs of wings, folded neatly along her slightly elongated body, and now possessed <i>four</i> new tails, nestled around her original one like one thick gold curtain hanging over her butt. Watching as she swished her tails, Derpy also could see that they, and her mane, had become thicker, curlier, and flowed more, as if emulating both Rarity and Fluttershy partly. Part of her  mane, and one of her tails, additionally had a  streak of rainbow color in it. The last change was her cutie mark, which had changed from normal bubbles to larger ones, each the color of one of the girls coats, orange, sky blue, white, light pink, lavender, and soft yellow. Smiling, Derpy admired her new look before a deep rumble from her intestines caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning now, Derpy made her way into the bathroom and slammed her massive booty down, cracking the seat in three places. Her pucker opening and her tails hiking up, the predatory pegasus began releasing the remains of Ponyville's resident dressmaker. Starting with a small chunks, Rarity's remains plopped out of Derpy's behind, until the first log peeked out, and then stopped. Face red, Derpy spoke aloud, \"I guess even after you've become my poop you're still fighting with me huh Rarity? Well, just like the first time, you're gonna lose!\" Taking a deep breath, Derpy pushed hard, stretching her anus around the thick log. Slowly, the poop began to squeeze out of Derpy's butt, until (pppptttt), a fart pushed the back end of the turd out to add to the pile of Rarity in her toilet. \"Ahhh, there we go,\" Derpy sighed as felt a couple more gas bubbles burst from her rear, echoing in the bowl, which were followed by a smaller log that slid easily out and into the mess below. Releasing a stream of her urine into the toilet, Derpy then got up and wiped. Giggling at the stinky remains of the formerly neat and clean unicorn, Derpy spoke. \"Time to send you where you belong now Rarity, down into the sewer!\" Flushing the mess, Derpy pondered her next course of action...</span></div></div>",

Let me enter your ass and digest away in your stomach! I want to become fat for your plot, Mistress! I want to die inside of your belly, while your body turns me into nutrients for you! I want you to push me out of your tailhole without a second though. I'm just shit waiting to be flushed now! Buck fashion and dressmaking! This is my real destiny! To be food! To be pounds of fat on the most perfect plot in Equestria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy blushed heavily after hearing Rarity's tirade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who am I to keep my food from their destiny? Time to begin the feast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity squealed happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand.\" Derpy ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn obeyed and stood, flushing with anticipation of her ultimate fantasy about to come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mailmare turned her body around and sashayed her hips in a teasing manner, as her plot jiggled and bounced around with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rarity's vision was turned to black as her head was engulfed by Derpy's cheeks. Her anus puckered, and began sucking in its new meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn was in heaven. This was it! It's begun! Her ultimate fantasy has started. It was a dream come true for the fashionable pony. She felt her body convulse as more of it was sucked into Derpy's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh! You feel so good in there, Rarity. Be a good girl and squirm for your Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity heard Derpy speak and did just that. It wasn't much, as not much of her was inside. Still, she moved her head in all directions, shaking it forcibly. She did what she could, as best as she could, for her Mistress to be pleasured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Good bitch.\" Derpy teased and sucked up to Rarity's neck now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity couldn't help herself. Her lower loins were leaking large amounts of juice desperate for release. She mentally cursed herself for her current situation, because she couldn't pleasure herself. She needed relief and she needed it bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy sniffed the air, confused by the odor she could detect around her. It was all too familiar. She knew that it wasn't her own loins that were flowering, and then only left one suspect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, she continued the teasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're leaking right now, my morsel. But I forbid you any sexual relief while you're inside me. Do you understand? This is not for your own pleasure. Don't be selfish. This is for my pleasure, and mine alone. Be a good bitch and follow my orders. Oh, and I'll know if you're masturbating, because I'll feel you squirm a certain way inside of me. If that happens, I'll push you right back out of my plot. You don't want that, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside of her plot, Derpy heard Rarity whine.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For another pony to become her buttfood, it made Derpy excited and pleasured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clenched her cheeks once more, and Rarity was swallowed up to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Taking big bites, now are we\"? The mailmare spoke to her plot and giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt Rarity squirm inside of her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't be soon, bitch. You're a bit more than halfway inside of me. I expect you to get comfortable once you're in there. Again, don't you even think about pleasuring yourself. Do I make myself clear\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn whined again and yelled, a bit muffled, \"Perfectly, clear Mistress. You have my word that I will not touch myself when I'm inside of you. I'm doing this for your pleasure only, not mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy smiled, quite pleased that her food had understood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach gurgled loudly, growing impatient, and Derpy took that as a sign it was time to slurp up more of her meal. She clenched and suctioned her tailhole again and Rarity was slurped up to her hooves, leaving those and her tail hanging out of Derpy's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a girl. You're almost in my belly now, Rarity. Don't worry. It'll take real good care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bunch of muffled sounds came from her plot, but they weren't audible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The time for talking is over, Rarity. Let me enjoy my meal now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn went silent and she slurped her ass again, leaving just the curvy, purple tail on the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly churned, an indication that Rarity was now inside, meeting her destiny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clenched one final time and Rarity's tail disappeared up her plothole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!\" Derpy said, with a happy sigh, feeling her belly nice and full. \"You were delicious Rarity. Too bad you'll soon be nothing more than a stinky pile of shit. Now, be a good bitch and digest while Mistress sleeps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus swayed to the left. The movement causing her belly to shake, and Derpy released a long, loud belch. She giggled and patted her stomach, burping again. Derpy made her way upstairs and found Rarity's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly flopping on the four-poster bed, tiredly, she pulled the blankets on herself, and was snoozing less than a minute later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinue<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy awoke peacefully. Groggily, she looked out the window to see Luna's moon shinging brightly and high in the sky. The night had fallen. It was overcast, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw the covers back to stare at her belly, and was pleased to find it much smaller than before she went to bed. Rarity was digested, and it put a smile on the pegasus's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling comfortable, she placed her hooves behind her head and lay back down, staring at the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive elements of harmony down. One to go. Soon, I'll be the epitome of all elements of harmony. It'll make me the most powerful pony in Equestria! Derpy's thoughts were interrupted by a rumbling in her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuck you, Rarity. Why do you have to bother me when I'm thinking? Your Mistress is not pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed again and trotted over to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the seat down, she sat her enormous plot on the toilet seat, which immediately cracked under the wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well. That's not my problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy giggled and strained herself pushing the remnants of what was once Rarity, into the murky water below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I was going to tease what's left of you, when I shit you out, but because you interrupted my thoughts, I'm not going to do that anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy remained silent as she finished shitting out what was once the fashionista. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to be silent as she wiped her ass clean with toilet paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy got off the broken toilet seat and looked inside of the toilet gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Rarity. You can now be what you always wanted, and what you were destined to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, she flushed the toilet, and Rarity was no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. What should I do now?\" Derpy said out loud to herself, trying to decide.</span></div></div>",

EEP! The wall-eyed mare's train of thought was derailed by Rainbow Dash pressing herself against the bulge and stroking it, causing Applejack to begin wriggling, the two things distracting Derpy on a rather intimate level.Rainbow Dash turned her face towards her, saying in a low voice,<br>\r\n\"Do you think you could... Do you have room for one more?\"<br>\r\nNow she thought about it, despite having a whole pony inside of her and no longer feeling quite as empty, having the farmer inside of her felt so good, having more could only be better.

There didn't seem to be anypony looking at them, so what harm could it do?<br>\r\n\"I think so, we'd need to be quiet though.\"<br>\r\nRainbow Dash nodded eagerly, virtually salivating at the idea<br>\r\n\"So would you like to go the same way Applejack did?

The market went on with it's business unaware or unheeding of the pegasus's outburst, rustling in the ever-busy business of Ponyville. Muffled sounds tickled Derpy's distended belly, a hoofprint squishing it's side as Applejack moved within. Fire had nothing on Derpy's face now, as it burned with the firey force of Celestia's sun in embarrassment. And arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure... Just put your face against my butt, and I think I can do the rest.\" Derpy wriggled her ample tush, feeling her belly jiggle with movement, and her rump wriggle with motion.  Turning back, she winked at Dash, seeing the blush spreading on the eagerly nodding pegasus's face. Derpy looked around once more, slinking down under the edge of the cart to hide what they were doing better.  This was going to be so HOT! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this?\" Cool hooves pushed onto the bubble butt, squeezing flesh with their ground-cooled hardness, kneading at Derpy's flesh anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy wriggled her rear as her tail hiked up, giving Dash an glance at the still slightly swollen anal ring there as the technicolor daredevil spread her cheeks wide. \"Yup. Poke my ass with your nose, and then just let me handle it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash frowned, thinking of something as she pressed her nose against the puffy pucker in Derpy's ass. She took her hooves off of Derpy's asscheeks, letting them fall back around her face and engulphing her head in the hot darkness. Well, AJ didn't seem to have minded, but it was better to ask. \"Say, Derpy, it's not going to smell at first is it? AJ didn't make much of a fuss, but she lives on her farm.\" Oh Celestia, it was pretty sweet all stuffed comfortably in like she was, and she wasn't even in that rump yet! She wondered what it would be like with Derpy wriggling all around her as she made a reverse rainbow right into the mailmare.  Wet, squishy, hotter than Celestia's pussy? (What? She had to have one.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy pondered the question, wondering if Applejack had minded. No, no, she hadn't made any 'Eww, CELESTIA NO!' wriggles.  Lots of moaning. \"Nope. You're gonna be great buttfood, Rainbow Dash!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash wondered what Derpy meant by that as a sudden pressure pushed her back on her hooves.  Instinctively, she braced herself, feeling the pressure mounting on her face. Her eyes closed as something slick began pressing over her muzzle, the musky scent getting stronger as- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'POP!' Derpy fell to her ass, collapsing atop Dash as the rainbow flier's head slid in with a neater squish than Applejack's head had. Immediately, the grey pegasus could feel the hum of her new occupant moaning and repeating a phrase over and over again.  This was going to be hotter than... than... darn it, she couldn't think of anything. Derpy slowly crawled to her hooves once more, pulling Dash back to her own four hooves in the deal.  The tightness in her ass from the lead weathermare's head stuffed in there gave her goosebumps, made her want more.  She just hoped Dash would let her take her time and go along for the ride...</span></div></div>",

There! A blanket sitting in the back of the apple stand! The blond pegasus yanked it out, throwing it back over her body like a cape or a dress, tying it around her neck to secure it in place. The thick cover was likely for special occasions or for keeping the flies off (and unpaying customers away) during lunch. \"Go for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash gulped, hoping that the experience would be as cool as Applejack made it look like as she gave one last glance around to watch for somepony watching. Then she lifted up the edge of the sheet, diving under with a burst of her speed and curled up at Derpy's backside. That big plump bubble butt tempted her, as if singing to her, twitching from side to side as Derpy nearly danced with anxiety and anticipation. \"Hurry up and get started, it'll be more suspicious with a big lump instead of a small one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash nodded at the whisper, turning around and planting her hind hooves against that ample tush, oriented so she'd be upright until the end. Bracing herself, and hoping Derpy had done the same, she flexed her powerful hind legs, pistoning them in to squish into the inside of something in the mailmare's butt.</span></div></div>",

Derpy winced from the initial impact, seeing as her butt wasn't made for kicking. Oh, Celestia... she was going to have TWO ponies to blup! The scent of arousal built in the air as her honey began dripping a little more profusely at the thought. She would probably look like she had swallowed a water bed once she finished off Dash. Speaking of which, she had some butt nomming to do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Dash... could you just lay down low? That kinda hurt. Just let me do the work, 'kay?\" Derpy wriggled her bubble butt around the twin intrusions between her cheeks, feeling them shifting as Dash settled down. The mailmare's heart raced as she looked resolutely ahead, trying to look like nothing was happening under her makeshift skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash panted, nodding once. Oh, wait. She had a blanket over her... \"Got it. It's like a cloud in there. A big soft slimy cloud that wants to hug you.\" She let out a heated sigh as she felt the mailmare clench around her, a pressure pulling and pushing at her calves to pull a few more inches of herself into Derpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash swallowed back a hint of a moan, slowly laying her front end down for Derpy. Looking between her forelegs  under herself, she could see the mare's rump stretched around her legs, clenching and unclenching as it slowly tugged her deeper one slurp at a time. It was kind of like a little star; the way it puckered around her legs in a disturbing but hot kind of way. The spectrally maned mare gave a little tug with her legs, seeing if she could tug them free if she had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy moaned, her body shaking as she did. She could feel Dash experimenting with her situation, seeing what she could do. The mailmare gave her tail a flick, and her rump a swish in anticipation. \"Gonna get trained from the inside out to be the next Best Junior Flier of Cloudsdale, huh, Dash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash panted a little heavier, tugging harder with her legs as she began to get pretty wet. The rubbery flesh puckered around her legs would only give a little before it tugged back, pulling her deeper than she had been to start with. Derpy's ass had crawled up her upper legs, smooshing up against her rump now.  She couldn't get free, she was stuck, and couldn't move...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike quicksand, or a black hole (heh)...  The only way was further in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Derpy... keep clenching that ass. I'm gonna get you trained up in no-time once I'm in there.\" Dash's breath came in hot heavy pants as she climbed back to her forehooves. Since she couldn't get out, the obvious answer was to go deeper in! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy's eyes straightened in pleasurable shock as Dash shoved herself in a bit, pushing the mailmare's ass over her own and burying her tail in the soft sucking hole that was claiming her. The mailmare squeaked as she was stimulated by the jerking movement, clenching her ass to halt Dash before the weathermare could shove too much of herself in. Rainbow Dash was always going too fast, Derpy wanted this fun to go on and on. From the vague feelings, Dash's shapely ass was mostly into her. She could feel Dash's underdeveloped teats rubbing against the top of her clit below, and the base of Dash's tail disappearing above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Dash, quit shoving yourself in. You're violating the s-speed limit.\" Derpy found it hard to talk, as she grew more and more antzy as she came closer to sliding over the edge and into an orgasm. Oh, yeah. She definitely needed to eat more things with her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash's breath came in tiny little hitches of movement as she watched the tight, teasing ring of rubbery flesh obliterate her cutie mark from view inch by inch. She gasped just a tiny bit as Derpy's ass rippled over the last of her haunches, burying all traces of her rear end in the slightly slimy puffy darkness beyond. She couldn't hang on any longer, the slow tickling across her entire body was getting to be too much. Dash whined as she felt herself start to flutter and twitch inside of Derpy, a trickle of juices rushing out of her and running down her legs inside her devourer's intestines. As her forelegs turned to rubber, she flopped to the ground, leaving what was left of her trim and slightly squishy belly to rub against Derpy's slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy shifted uncomfortably, trying to keep it from making noise herself as she began to be directly stimulated. She couldn't cum, she shouldn't cum The farm mare would be so- wait... She was going to blup Applejack, and Dash too if she didn't push her back out. Ahd that fuzz was rubbing against the grain, all downy soft and- and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy began to keen loudly as her juices poured down Dash's limply hanging body, her ass clenching harder than ever before, sucking in most of Dash's belly in two or three clenching motions.  Each squeezed a squeak out of the limp pegasus, Derpy's tight rubber anus rippling up over Dash's wingtips, pinning them to her side as the mailmare just barely kept standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-derpy... do you know how to let me back out later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy shook her head, letting her eyes roll back to their normal positions from where they had crossed to in please. As Dash's request came to her, she decided to give it a shot. She wasn't really planning on letting Dashie out, but it didn't hurt to at least find out if she could unslurp her and Applejack, in case somepony found them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash yelped as she was pulled a little deeper instead, watching as it first bulged out, as if trying to evacuate her. But it was still too tight, too clenched around her, and it sucked her in deeper as Derpy's ass returned to a sitting state. \"I- can't escape... I can't escape...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy could feel Dash's hoarse panting, hoping that her latest buttfood wasn't about to panic as her barrel was slowly sucked up. \"Dashie?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ooooh, why am I getting so turned on by this!?\"  Dash wriggled in place as she watched her wings vanish feather by feather. Dash took her forelegs off the ground, letting Derpy support all of her weight as she sank deeper into the mailmare's black hole. \"Please don't freak, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freak out from Wha-AAH!\" Derpy could feel her pucker being spread by  Dash's forelegs as she pushed them in partway. The strain of the athletic pegasus could be felt trembling against her ass as she struggled to peel Derpy open enough to slide free. The mailmare clenched back at the sensations, feeling her tight little star smush Dash's legs back against her body as suck in another few inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash kept panting, feeling the slick heat within Derpy spreading drowsiness through her form. If she fell asleep, she'd be in Derpy's stomach in no time flat! And then she'd be... ulp... pegasus mush! But... was that so bad? She'd be with Applejack, who was likely getting all mushy and churned up already. And her friend needed somepony with her.  And, at that point there just wasn't any escaping it. She could feel the pulsing flesh squeezing shut over her shoulders with a loud and languid slurping noise, trapping her neck in the folded ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd have to be able to teleport to escape with no limbs left! Dash kicked her legs, feeling Derpy jump around her a bit. She could feel her lower legs getting pressed against the ground within Derpy's bulk, with the pegasus mailmare's now colossal stomach bulge. Dash could barely bend her neck, feeling her head pressing into the pillowy flesh of Derpy's bubble ass no matter which way she tried to turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. Teleport!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derpy! You might be able to get us out. Talk to Twilight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want to get you out? Mmmngh... you feel so good in there. Almost got me fully trained up, Rainbow Dash! Just a little farther!\" Derpy clenched again, not caring that other ponies were staring as she talked to herself, and made humping motions midair. She could feel Dash's ears folding flat against her head as the weathermare's last free part began to disappear between her thick grey cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash panted, pushing with all of her might to give herself a little more time as Derpy's bubble ass squished closed over her eyes. She could feel the ring of Derpy's anus squeezing snugly against the back of her head, about to slip her all the way in. \"Derpy! They'll know. And how can I train you if you turn me to mush? Please Derpy! Ple-mmrph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash found herself talking into squishy flesh as Derpy's flanks closed around her head, the mailmare clenching her legs together finally.  Dash's head was slipping in rapidly, the spincter passing over her in a long slurrping squish that practically oozed over her form like a mare's juices would run down her legs.  The mailmare gave a final squeak of pleasure as she clenched around Dash's nose and finished squeezing her inside, mummifying her in the surprisingly clean intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy murmured to herself, stroking her now massively engorged belly that was pressing her legs up off the ground. She copied Dash's accent, knowing the weathermare could probably hear her. \"That's right, Derpy! Slurp me up and make me buttfood! Gotta get you good and strong for the Wonderbolts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the sudden squirm from Rainbow Dash as she slipped around the first corner of Derpy's gut. Hay, she could see Dash's head pressing against her flank from the inside, and feel the murmur of Dash yelling at her from in her gut. Ooh, Celestia! She was soooo full! She didn't even know if she could fly, what with those two marvelous mares in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Derpy! You need to practice flying with a heavy load! Gurgle me up and make me fat!\" Derpy smiled at her cleverness, before frowning as something came to her.  Dash was right. As much as she WANTED to blup them both, somepony would figure out it was her.  And then she'd be in all sorts of trouble.  She might have gotten away with just Applejack, but Rainbow Dash, too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy just hoped she could fly to Twilight's house. She wasn't exactly the strongest flier, and her gut felt more like a lead weight every moment, as she squirreled Dash away deeper and deeper inside herself, the weathermare turning into more of an indistinct lump in her paunch with every passing second.  Well, here went nothing!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She began to flap her wings when she noticed something pink bouncing towards her. It was Pinkie Pie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Derpy!\" she said energetically and then stared at Derpy's stomach, making a \"ooo\" noise. \"Had too much to eat Gosh, if I had a tummy like that I'd be groaning and groaning and GROANING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy burped as she felt AJ's movements becoming more slower. \"Oh sorry Pinkie, I kinda wanna get home and rest...\" She suddenly realized that leaving now would leave AJ's cart abandoned. If nothing else someone who is a friend of hers should watch the cart even if Derpy couldn't get Twilight's help (or, if Derpy ended up being too late to save them anyway.) \"Think you can watch the Apple cart for AJ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure! Um where is she?\" asked Pinkie, looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy decided to shrug and smile innocently, then began flapping her wings again. She grunted and growled as she hoisted her shoulders into the air, her belly resting on the ground and scooting along for a few feet before finally a shadow grew between that gray balloon and the ground below. She began to rise, thanked Pinkie again, and then slowly began to hover up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started flying for Twilight's library. On the way, she started to think again about her desire to digest the two ponies inside her, but she was reminded of how dangerous that would be (and it made her feel guilty about herself for wishing it at all), as she noticed the odd stares people were giving her as she floated through the air with a stomach bigger than she herself was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at the library by smashing through one of the windows and tumbling to the ground, her fur protecting her from the shards of glass. Her eyes buzzed about in her skull as she tried to collect her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooops, my bad...!\" she mumbled before straightening her vision, or, as much of it as she could. She looked around and noticed that Twilight, who for some reason was often the only person at the library, was staring at her with a look of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derpy! What did you do to yourself this time? Oh my gosh are you okay? Did you get some kind of disease? Like poison joke, or maybe you have a really awful case of bloating from something you ate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that!\" Derpy said with a grin. \"Uhhh... So um Twilight Sparkle? Don't be mad, but um... I might have kinda sorta did something weird to two of your friends. Can you um, help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight frowned, walking over and looking over Derpy. \"Huh?\" she noised in an irritated way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I swallowed Applejack and Rainbow Dash and I need you to get them out of me.\"</span></div></div>",

With a huge spark, Derpy felt a painful wrench in her guts as the two ponies were replaced by empty space, and her insides had to suddenly revert to their previous configurations, complete with way too much air. She was either going to have a big burp or something ruder later, but for now the empty space was just collecting together in the middle of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooow ow ow!\" she said and rubbed her stomach. \"It felt a lot better with them inside me, not out of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow and Applejack now lay in a crumpled heap near Derpy.

For many years the two mares have been happily married but the spark they felt when they first fell in love was dying. Everything that seemed so wonderful and exciting to them was just routine now and they started fighting over the silliest things. Still, Bonbon didn't want to live without Lyra and so she prepared a final option. Right now she was sitting at their dinner table, waiting for Lyra to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew about Lyra's fetish, Bonbon saw drawings where she was being eaten by her wife in all different ways possible or just Lyra with a large, distended belly. Bonbon even saw the odd picture of herself being cooked and prepared. If she had failed Lyra as a wife the least she could do was to be a tasty meal for her. After a long wait her wife came back from work. \"Hello Bonbon, how was your day?\" Asked the mint green unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyra, we need to talk.\" She replied with a serious tone. Slightly scared about what would come Lyra sat down in front of her wife. \"Lyra, you know that we have been married for a long time. Sadly our love seems to grow weaker every day.\" Bonbon was almost sobbing as she finished, Lyra was also close to tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Bonbon, I know that but I just can't let you go, I swore that I would stay with you until death does us apart.\" Both mares cried at this point but Bonbon was still dead set on her own solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, that's why I bought this from Zecora.\" Bonbon pointed at the vial lying on the table. Lyra was confused by this, was this a love potion? If yes she would have to decline, she didn't want to leave her wife but keeping their love alive with a potion would be even worse in her books. \"I know about your fetish, what you want to do with me.\" Lyra panicked as she heard this, Bonbon knew that she was a voreraphile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonbon, I can explain! It's just a fantasy, I would never do that to you!\" Lyra put her hooves on the table in a pleading manner, she never wanted Bonbon to find out about this. She frantically apologized to her wife but was silenced by a hoof held against her lips. Lyra expected the tan earth pony to be upset or disgusted but she only saw a warm smile on her face. \"Don't apologize, we all have out fetishes. This vial contains a potion that will enable you to eat me in any way you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra's chin hit the table as she heard this. Did her wife really just offer her to become food for her? \"Bonbon you can't be serious, you'll die!\" Bonbon gave her a sad smile in response. \"I'd rather be dead than to be apart from you.\" Lyra was touched by her wife's commitment, she levitated the vial in front of her and just looked at it for a minute. Then she popped it open and downed the content. A strange feeling surged through her entire body and hunger began to overtake her. As she looked at Bonbon her mouth started to water, this mare looked delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am ready Lyra, make me a part of you.\"</span></div></div>",

Lyra closed her eyes and drifted to sleep while her belly started to gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of Lyras stomach, the unconscious Bonbon was not moving and inch, except for the occasional reflexive twitch. With a gurgling sound, the gastric juices began to seep into the warm, fleshy chamber and covered Bonbon from head to hoof. The stomach started to churn and squeeze the mare inside of it, rubbing the stomach acids deep into her to help break her up into nutrients. At this point, Bonbon was doomed as the stomach chamber was completely flooded with the gastric juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while until the enzymes in Lyras stomach acids could break in but finally digestion really started. The stomach acids, rubbed deep into Bonbons skin, started to slowly break the mares body up. It was almost like a tablet dissolving in water, Bonbon softened up before she started to disperse into nutritional sludge, layer for layer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, nothing was left of Bonbon except for a skeleton that was already getting softer as the stomach juices only needed more time for them and a nutritious slime that was sucked into Lyras intestine, waiting to be absorbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bonbon was a little worried about the horn first but she managed to get it down her throat without injuring herself. As Bonbon reached Lyra's belly she grabbed her wife's flanks and raised them above her head. Now the act was a lot easier for Bonbon as her wife practically slid down herself. She too took the time to pleasure her wife, possibly for the last time, before gulping down the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a happy sigh Bonbon leaned back, Lyra was still moving in her stomach and started to speak up. \"So Bonny, do you think this might work out again?\" Bonbon thought carefully, this was not just a question wether their marriage would remain or fail but also a question if Lyra is going to live or die.</span></div></div>",

Only a small gurgle brought them out of their moment. \"I better let you out now, wait a minute.\" Bonbon coughed and hacked until the mint green horn of her wife became visible again. Slowly Lyra reemerged from the depths of Bonbon's esophagus, covered in slime but still conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra gasped for air before she pulled Bonbon into a tight embrace. \"We need to do this more often, this feeling was amazing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonbon slowly started to understand her wife's fetish.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was far from an easy decision in Bon Bons mind. Entering this little venture, she\u2019d been more than a little desperate to conserve the romance that had sparked 8 years prior between the two mares. Bon Bon loved Lyra with an undying passion and she had been ready to do anything to fix what had inexplicably been broken in recent years. And here she sat in bed with that same unicorn she\u2019d taken to the winter-chime ball, and then to Manehattan, and ultimately the altar, nestled in her stomach awaiting her approval or disapproval of their marriage status. The weight wasn\u2019t just from Lyra that was certain. Well everything was right with it of course! They were both willing to risk their own hides for the others contentment, there was no reason to believe otherwise!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that this element of power had been laid out in front of her the entire dilemma was coming into an entirely new perspective. Why had they been fighting so much? Why was their no excitement between the two where once it was in abundance? Whose fault was it, Bon Bon or Lyras? Bon Bons mind raced at max output searching for the answers she needed; cataloging every event where either of them may have been at fault for some percentage of the damages dealt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026Bon Bon? You uh\u2026gonna let me go or keep me? It\u2019s starting to get a bit stuffy in here so if you want me out you\u2019d best hurry it up\u201d Bon Bon heard Lyra loud and clear and it was time for a hard decision to be made. She\u2019d thought through it all and though it made her a bit nervous, she knew that their situation wasn\u2019t a fluke or a result of being cooped up together for so long. Somepony was responsible and things weren\u2019t going to work out if Lyra was let free. But Bon Bon loved Lyra no matter if their marriage was broken, the same as she had all those years ago. She never wanted Lyra to leave her, so she decided it was time to digest the mare she so loved and make her her\u2019s to love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026not letting you out Lyra\u201d said Bon Bon with solemn compassion, she was serious and she needed Lyra to understand that. From the power of that single statement, immediately Bon Bon felt the gravity of the situation catch up to her. The mare she had said yes so merrily to was about to be melted down into nothing more than nutrients like one of her own candies. In simple terms, Lyra was going to die inside her. And she was allowing this to happen. Oh would Lyra forgive her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026well alright Bonnie. I suppose that\u2019s\u2026that. I still love you sweet heart,\u201d muttered Lyra with a soothing sincerity. That was all Bon Bon needed. That simple little speech was what she needed to permit her actions to pass by her conscious. Lyra was going to be hers forever, and both mares were willing and ready to begin. Bon Bon smiled, not like a filly who had received her most desired object, but a married mare who felt the compassion of her spouse despite everything they had lived through and would live through. Well, perhaps not this time. \u201cI love you too sweet cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBon Bon immediately let her tense body relax, slithering under the covers and letting pass a passionate sigh. She patted the bulge under the covers contently, listening to it moan. Digestion had not yet kicked in, and indeed it would likely take quite a while for the mare of her dreams to well and truly be gone. So for now, Lyra lay nuzzled up in a tiny ball feeling the comforting warmth of Bon Bons stomach feeling as happy as any doomed pony could be. Bon Bon felt her wife move inside her and it was a certainly unique experience. \u2018This must be like what having kids is like\u2019 she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably less apparent though.\u201d Bon Bon was a little surprised when she heard Lyra speak up in response to her thoughts, as if she could hear her inside her head. A ridiculous notion of course. \u201cOf course.\u201d Okay now it was definitely more than a coincidence. \u201c Lyra honey, are you reading my thoughts?\u201d asked Bon Bon. \u201cYep\u201d was all Lyra had to say. \u201cHow in Celestias name are you managing that? I never knew you could do that!\u201d \u201cWell, to be honest I\u2019ve only been practicing since last week but If I do say so myself I\u2019ve made impressive progress\u201d Lyra said with a certain degree of smugness. Hearing this abrupt realization sunk in and Bon Bon realized her moral dilemma from earlier had been broadcast to Lyra loud in clear. And she was able to hear that she was realizing she had only just realized Lyra was there when she-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes yes Bon Bon, I was there. Well\u2026not quite.\u201d That was a tad confusing. \u201cWhat\u2019dya mean hun?\u201d Bon Bon asked. \u201cI\u2019m uh, not too good at it just yet, and it takes an awful lot out of me. So I only heard up to a certain point and\u2026\u201d The pause was unnerving. \u201c\u2026who\u2019s fault did you decide it was?\u201d Bon Bon meddled with the bed sheets a bit, nervous to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Lyra, sweetie, in my opinion it seems to have been\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then grinned at the sight of the minty unicorn passed out on the couch in that silly way she always sat. A mischievous grin grew upon Bonbon's face. As silently as she could, she snuck up on the unsuspecting mare, putting her own face close to that fluffy green belly and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BFHFHFHFHFHFHFHFHT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra was jolted into the waking world by a relentless raspberry from somepony. Her initial anger quickly vanished as she recognized the form of her spouse. \"Now what did you do that for?\", Lyra asked in mock outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you were just sitting there with that big tummy of yours exposed for all the world to see! How am I supposed to help myself when you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, the only reason I'm so chubby is because of <i>you</i>,\" Lyra replied as she playfully nudged the candymaker. \"So, what's the big surprise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonbon trotted back to her saddlebags. \"I heard about this neat little trust exercise we could try out. First-\" <br>\r\n\"Wait, a trust exercise? Bonnie, we don't need a trust exercise, do we? I'd trust you completely!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey, it's not about <i>that</i>, it just sounded like fun!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a cold, desolate night along the flowery plains that dot the border of the Everfree forest-- completely silent and empty, save for one young, mint green mare sneaking through the shrubbery. Even in the darkness, any passing observer would have been able to notice one unusual thing about the strange mare: her belly swaying beneath her was humongous, almost touching the ground. Still, those observers would likely assume she was just heavily pregnant, or that they were just seeing things-- in truth, curled up in the mare\u2019s stomach was an entire living, breathing pony. He had been squirming so much when she first gulped his body inch by inch down her throat, but now, nestled inside of her gut, the ceaseless humidity and relaxing swaying had caused the stallion within her to fall unconscious, never to wake again. She was now struggling to carry the weight of another pony beneath her as she lumbered through the shadowy fields. She reached a large cottage on the very outskirts of town and quickly ducked inside the front door, before sighing in relief as she closed the door behind her. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cAlright, I made it\u2026\u201d</span> She whispers to herself, triumphantly. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cNow I just have to--\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she was blinded as all the cottage\u2019s lights turned on at once. Her eyes widened as she saw her girlfriend-- a light yellow earth pony-- had been sitting by the fireplace, as if waiting for her to walk in. There was a long silence. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cLyra, I thought you said you were over this,\u201d</span> the earth pony mare growled calmly but sternly, not even bothering to look her in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cBon Bon, I--\u201d</span> Lyra immediately tried to explain herself, suddenly feeling ashamed of what she had done, but can\u2019t find the words. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cI <i>am</i> over this! I haven\u2019t eaten a pony in months! I just\u2026 I slipped up, you know? Just give me this one!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWe moved all the way to Ponyville to get <i>away</i> from this, Lyra,\u201d</span> Bon Bon replied, finally staring the unicorn in the eyes. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou wanted your second chance, and I gave up everything to give it to you.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cI know, I know. I know what I put you through,\u201d</span> Lyra whimpers, edging closer to the other mare. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cBut this isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWho are they?\u201d</span> Bon Bon demanded. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWho did you eat?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cIt was just a stallion I met at the bar. He isn\u2019t going to be missed, trust me,\u201d</span> Lyra insists. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cThere\u2019s no way they\u2019ll be able to trace it back to us.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cDamn it, Lyra,\u201d</span> Bon Bon throws up her hooves, exasperated, before walking quickly out of the living room towards the bedroom, not wanting to deal with Lyra for another second. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cThat\u2019s not the <i>point</i>.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra laid on her back on the couch, idly caressing her distended belly. They\u2019d had that conversation before, but not for almost a year now. Not since they came to Ponyville. She silently cursed herself. Has she messed things up already? After all they\u2019ve done for each other just to reach this point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery pony in Equestria was unique in their own way. Every pony has their own quirk\u2026 some more prominent than others. Lyra\u2019s? Well, Lyra\u2019s unique quirk was something special. Ever since she young, she had a passion for swallowing other ponies. They had a flavour unlike any food she had ever tasted, and their squirming desperately within her belly was pleasurable unlike any sensation she had ever experienced. The entire experience of gulping another pony down her throat was unparalleled. She never feels hesitant, or guilty-- to her, when a pony is wriggling in her belly, they aren\u2019t a pony anymore, they\u2019re just food. So for most of her life, her only hobby was gulping down other ponies whenever she got the opportunity. That changed for the first time when she met Bon Bon. Bon Bon was the first pony Lyra ever truly cared about, and they became close friends, and even started dating. Inevitably, Bon Bon learned of Lyra\u2019s terrible secret-- but instead of freaking out and turning her in, she instead tried to wean her off her diet of ponies, to no avail. Eventually Lyra\u2019s secret got out, and she was forced to leave Baltimare. This is when Lyra expected Bon Bon to give up on her, and stay behind-- instead, even then, Bon Bon stayed by her side, and they both travelled to Ponyville to start their new life together. Deeply touched by her friend\u2019s sacrifice, Lyra vowed never to eat another pony again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil today. For the first time in her life, Lyra actually felt guilty for having eaten a pony. She hated to disappoint Bon Bon, after all she\u2019s done for her. She looked down at her distended belly. It had already shrunken slightly as her stomach acids began to work on the unconscious stallion inside. She didn\u2019t even know his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been having urges for months now. Every time she find herself alone with another, delicious pony, she could hardly restrain herself. She had desperately needed to feel another pony wriggle within her belly, one more time. Instead of doing anything about this, she just let the temptations fester, until she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. On her way home from work, she stopped by the bar, met a stallion, flirted with him for a while, before leading him into a back room. The second he closed the door behind him, she had pounced. Over the years, she had gotten so good at this gruesome task that he slid down her throat in under 30 seconds, before he knew what hit him. She rested there for almost an hour, enjoying the feeling of the confused stallion desperately squirming inside of her, until he finally settled down, and she snuck out a window. She never realized how much she\u2019d missed that sensation. It was the best thing she\u2019d felt in months\u2026 but was it worth it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra looked at the clock, and realized how late it was at night. Luckily, she didn\u2019t have to work tomorrow, but she still needed her sleep. She closed her eyes, and decided that she would make it up to Bon Bon the next morning.</span></div></div>",

Silently, so as not to disturb the sleeping mare, Lyra got ready to start the day. Her belly had completely returned to its previous size, allowing her to walk around freely. Lyra donned her saddlebags and snuck out the front door, skipping happily towards the rest of the town. She knew just the way to make things up to Bon Bon. There\u2019s a dress Bon Bon has desperately been wanting, that Lyra has been planning to get her for their anniversary, but she figured it was the least she could do to get it for her early. Usually, Lyra hated getting up this early-- however, after having finally swallowed another pony again last night, Lyra was feeling as lively and upbeat as ever. She knew she should probably feel guilty and ashamed, but there was something about knowing her plump rear end jiggled with all that remains of a recently-digested pony that raised her spirits. Eating ponies was truly her passion-- surpassed by her love and devotion to Bon Bon, of course, but not by much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the Boutique, her stomach grumbles. Is she hungry again already? Well, she figures it wouldn\u2019t hurt if she stopped at a bakery along the way. Just as she was about to settle down with some delicious pastries, however, an earth pony tapped on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cHey. Lyra, is it?\u201d</span> The purple mare asked. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cCome on, we should talk.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra sat down at the booth, sitting across from the strange mare. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cUh\u2026 yeah,\u201d</span> Lyra shrugs. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cDo I know you?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cYou don\u2019t know me, but I certainly know you,\u201d</span> The mare smirked. Even though she hadn\u2019t done anything yet, something about this mare seemed maniacal and scheming. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cYou\u2019ve been making waves around here.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</span> Lyra asks, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cI\u2019ve heard a stallion disappeared from a bar downtown last night. Nopony quite knows what to make of it,\u201d</span> The mare whispered, almost tauntingly. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cWould you happen to know anything about that?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cUh\u2026 no, I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d</span> Lyra denied everything, as panic began to creep in. Does this strange mare know? How could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cOh please. You\u2019re a horrible liar,\u201d</span> The mare giggled. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cYou swallowed him, didn\u2019t you? Lured him out of sight of passersby, and gulped him down in seconds, just because you wanted to feel him wriggle in your belly.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra was shocked. She had left no evidence! <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cHow\u2026 how do you <i>know</i>?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cI know about everything that goes on in this town, honey. Trust me,\u201d</span> The mare chuckles. There was something about the way that the mare talked that made Lyra feel very small, and vulnerable. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not going to tell everypony your little secret. In fact, I\u2019ve swallowed quite a few ponies myself...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra was confused and utterly speechless, so the mare continued. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cYou might think you\u2019re the only one with your little kink, but you\u2019re not,\u201d</span> The mare leans forward, as if getting down to business. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cThere are dozens of ponies across Equestria that do the exact same thing you do. What <i>is</i> unique is how easily you slipped him down your throat. How quickly you swaddled the entire stallion to sleep, and how expertly you got away with it. <i>That\u2019s</i> talent.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cListen. I\u2019m part of a group of mares and stallions that love the taste of their fellow ponies just as much as you do-- including the mayor herself, and several members of Ponyville\u2019s levy of royal guards. We look out for each other, and coordinate together. We make sure none of us get caught, so we can gulp down as many ponies as our bellies desire,\u201d</span> The mare explains, whispering. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cI just came here to make you an offer. With skills like that, you can join us any time you like, and we\u2019ll open up a whole new world for you.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra continued to be stunned in her seat, and the mare rolled her eyes. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cI understand it must be a lot to take in, so I\u2019ll let you go think about it. The offer\u2019s open any time,\u201d</span> The mare stated simply, getting up from the booth and walking off. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cThe name\u2019s Berryshine. You\u2019ll know where to find me.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra watched this \u2018Berryshine\u2019 walk out, stunned, and looked down at her plate for a moment, before pushing it away. Suddenly, she feels like she\u2019s lost her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra trots back towards her cottage, staring at the ground as she walked, the expensive dress nestled within her saddlebags. Why did this have to happen to her? Right as she was about to patch things up with Bon Bon, she just had to get hit with the opportunity of a lifetime. She tried to deny it, tried not to think about it-- but she had to be honest. The mare\u2019s offer was enticing. If this was back in Baltimare, she definitely would\u2019ve taken it. But this town was supposed to be a fresh start. It was supposed to symbolize her giving up her bad habit, for the sake of their love. Could she really throw all that away, and revert back to her old lifestyle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra immediately threw those thoughts to the side as she stepped into the house, and smiled as she saw Bon Bon sitting on the couch. Bon Bon glanced back at her as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOh, hey Lyra,\u201d</span> Bon Bon said. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI was wondering where you ran off to all morning.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cYeah, sorry. I felt bad about what I did last night, so I wanted to make it up to you,\u201d</span> Lyra smiles, hopping onto the couch next to her. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cGuess what I got ya.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBon Bon look at her, looking skeptical at first, but going along with it anyway. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAlright, alright. What is it?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cIt\u2019s...\u201d</span> Lyra announced melodramatically, as she slowly pulled the dress from one of her saddlebags. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cThat cute ruffle dress you\u2019ve been wanting!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBon Bon, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t react nearly as excited as Lyra hoped she would. Lyra was almost worried she was still mad at her, until Bon Bon gave her the most genuine smile she\u2019d seen all week. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI love it, but... this isn\u2019t what this was about. I don\u2019t care about some fancy dress. I care about you,\u201d</span> Bon Bon explained to her, laying a hoof on her shoulder. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI know what a kind and loving mare you really are, deep down inside. And eating ponies\u2026 I know that you\u2019re better than that. That\u2019s what this is about.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra stared blankly into her eyes for a few moments. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cSo, uh\u2026 are you saying that I can take this dress back to the store, then? Because this thing was really expensive.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBon Bon tried to maintain her serious composure, but couldn\u2019t keep it, and burst out laughing at her lover\u2019s signature goofiness. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOh, no! You\u2019re not getting off that easy!\u201d</span> Bon Bon giggled, grabbing the dress out of Lyra\u2019s grip. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWe are definitely hitting the town tonight, and I am definitely wearing this. Lavender is going to loooove it.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra laughed along, relieved that everything was back to normal again, before Bon Bon walked to their room to try on the new dress. The conversation with the mare earlier was definitely still weighing on her mind\u2026 but she tried not to think about that right now. That was a decision she was going to leave for another day. Right now, she was going to focus on having a fun, normal day with the love of her life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was three in the morning, and yet Lyra still couldn\u2019t sleep. It had been an exhausting day. Bon Bon nestled up comfortably beside her in the bed, and Lyra so wanted to cuddle up to the sleeping mare and get some much-needed sleep. But she couldn\u2019t. The stranger\u2019s offer earlier that morning still rattled around in her head. To be able to gulp down ponies with impunity\u2026 to finally be able to meet other ponies that share her passion\u2026 maybe even to meet some willing prey\u2026 it was the kind of opportunity she had always been waiting for! But\u2026 all that is something that she\u2019s supposed to have left behind. She\u2019s given up on that lifestyle already, for the sake of both her and Bon Bon. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 she had to be honest with herself. Her penchant for eating other ponies was something she was never going to escape. It was part of who she was. She loved Bon Bon with all of her heart, but\u2026 this kind of desire was something she just didn\u2019t have the willpower to resist. She couldn\u2019t sleep, she couldn\u2019t think, she couldn\u2019t enjoy the time you spent with Bon Bon. All she could think of was that damn offer. Her breaking point was coming soon\u2026 why delay the inevitable? She crawled slowly and carefully out of bed, before silently grabbing her saddlebags and slipping out the back door. The cool Equestrian night called out to her once again as she descended into the town, searching for the strange mare. It suddenly occurred to her that she had absolutely no idea where this \u2018Berryshine\u2019 was. <i>\u2018You\u2019ll know where to find me\u2019</i>... what the hay does that mean? Maybe she\u2019s still at the bakery? \u2026 it\u2019d probably be closed this early in the morning. Lyra snorted, quickly growing frustrated. She should probably wait until later to find this mare, but she needed her belly filled <i>now</i>. She was so horny, even the very thought of a pony pressing against the walls of her stomach made her feel light-headed. Even if she couldn\u2019t find the mare, she would still catch a pony to gulp down on her own terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wanders the darkened town, her thoughts clouded, the shadowy buildings beginning to blend together. After a few minutes of aimless walking, she suddenly looked up, as if snapping out of a trance, and analyzed her surroundings. It appeared that, in her stupor, she had wandered to a part of town she had never been to before. She had walked into a little, dark alleyway out of sight of passersby, that she didn\u2019t even remember entering. She figured she had just gotten lost, but something about this situation made her feel uncomfortable. Was she supposed to come here? Was their something here that had been beckoning to her, subconsciously?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer questions were answered immediately as she heard the sound of hooves tapping against wet concrete behind her. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cSo you came out to look for me already.\u201d</span> She heard the taunting of a familiar voice. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cYou just couldn\u2019t help yourself, could you?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra immediately whipped around, staring the mare in the eyes. This confirmed it. Through some form of sorcery or another, \u2018Berryshine\u2019 led her here, subconsciously. Panic grips her as she remembers that Berryshine herself had confessed to eating ponies. Was that what this was? A trap? Lyra backed up slowly. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cYou\u2026 brought me here? How?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cI didn\u2019t bring you anywhere. It was your own desire that led you here.\u201d</span> Berryshine chuckled at Lyra\u2019s terrified expression, keeping a smug look on her face. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cRelax. If I was going to eat you, I would\u2019ve done it while you had your back turned.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra relaxed a bit, but remained wary. Internally, she cursed herself for being so foolish. What was she thinking, walking around town alone so late at night, to meet a strange mare she already knows has a proclivity for preying on innocent ponies? <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cMy\u2026 desire?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cYou\u2019re here to take up my offer, aren\u2019t you? What am I saying, of course you are.\u201d</span> Berryshine smiled, as she began walking deeper into the dark alleyway, not even bothering to look back and make sure Lyra is following. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cCome on, follow me. You\u2019re going to miss the auctions!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerryshine led her through Ponyville\u2019s labyrinthine alleyways, traveling along seemingly random paths. Eventually, they come across a rusted metal door, conspicuously out-of-place in the barren alleyway. Berryshine unlocked the door and pulled it open with a loud metal screech as it scraped along the concrete ground. They entered, and Lyra pulled the door closed behind them before the two mares descended down a long, dimly-lit stairwell. As they descended down the spiraling staircase, Lyra felt the tendrils of doubt creeping in once again. What was she doing? Why was she letting the strange mare lead her all the way down here, alone? Even if she was telling the truth and Lyra did get a pony to eat, how was she going to explain it to Bon Bon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they reached the bottom, and passed through another metal door. They must be at least three or four stories underground now, in a large, dimly-lit room with wooden floors and soundproofed walls. There were over a dozen ponies chatting at various tables and booths scattered across the room, and to her right, there was an large empty stage. Along the wall on the other side of the room, there were rows of doors. Dressing rooms, perhaps? Was this some sort of theater? Berryshine and Lyra walk over to a handsome, muscular stallion with shiny white fur and a mane featuring several different shades of green, who Lyra recognized as one of the royal guards in Ponyville\u2019s levy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAh, Berryshine! I was wondering if you\u2019d make it.\u201d</span> The stallion smiled, sounding to be quite a few years older than Lyra. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAnd I see you\u2019ve brought along a volunteer. Mm! A real catch, this one.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cActually, she isn\u2019t a volunteer. She\u2019s the fresh blood I\u2019ve been talking about.\u201d</span> Berryshine corrected him, before introducing the two ponies. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cGavel, this is Lyra. Lyra, meet Gavel.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cUh\u2026 hi, \u2018Gavel\u2019.\u201d</span> Lyra smiled awkwardly as they shook hooves, a bit overwhelmed by the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cReally? <i>You\u2019re</i> the new recruit Berry\u2019s seemed so excited about?\u201d</span> Gavel raised an eyebrow. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cNo offence, but you don\u2019t look like much of a predator.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen her in action. I watched her gulp down a full-grown stallion faster than even I ever could with my own two eyes.\u201d</span> Berryshine insisted, before suddenly grabbing Lyra, turning her around in one fluid motion so her plump backside was raised in the air faced Gavel. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\u201cAnd besides! <i>This</i> is the kind of ass you can only get from a lifetime of eating ponies. What more evidence do you need?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cHmm...\u201d</span> Gavel considered it, as Lyra wriggled out of Berryshine\u2019s grip and turned back around, blushing, hiding her rear from sight with her tail. Berryshine giggled at Lyra\u2019s discomfort. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cWell, alright then. If you think she\u2019s good enough, Berry, then I trust your judgement. Let\u2019s have a seat, so we can explain some things to the poor girl. She looks a bit lost.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you sit down at one of the tables. As you sat down, you noticed that some of the ponies scattered around the room have apparently already had a meal tonight. One lavender mare sitting at one of the booths had a massive, bulging belly, and Lyra could even see the indentations of hoofprints pressing from the inside as the mare idly caressed her belly as the mare talked to her friends. It occurred to Lyra that this was the first time she's seen another predator in action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cSo how long have you been into eating ponies, Lyra?\u201d</span> Gavel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cAs your friend so observantly, err\u2026 noticed, eating ponies has been my passion my entire life.\u201d</span> Lyra replied. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cBack in Baltimare, trying to eat ponies was basically all I did.\u201d </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cBaltimare? Really?\u201d</span> Gavel titled his head. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cHow many ponies did you manage to eat during those days, exactly?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cUh, I don\u2019t know...\u201d</span> Lyra shrugged as she thought back on all her old experiences back in the day. There were almost too many to count. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cMaybe\u2026 around four dozen, total?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cReally? Four dozen ponies? In Baltimare?\u201d</span> Gavel gasped. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cWow! We\u2019ve never heard of a predator being that successful in Baltimare. The levy there is incredibly competent. How did you manage it?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cI just targeted immigrants, sailors who were passing through the harbor, travelling merchants, the like\u2026 you know, ponies that nopony would ever notice were missing.\u201d</span> Lyra explained. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cOccasionally I\u2019d swallow one of those snobby high-class ponies if they got on my nerves enough, but I targeted them so infrequently that nothing could ever be pinned on me.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cOh! If that is true, then maybe you really are as good as Berry says you are.\u201d</span> Gavel rubbed his chin. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cWe should get you one of the volunteers later. I need to see you in action.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cWell, anyway. I think it\u2019s about time you answer some of <i>my</i> questions.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cWhat is this place? Who are you ponies?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cEvery pony in Ponyville that either wants to eat other ponies or wants to be eaten themselves finds their way here, one way or another.\u201d</span> Gavel explained, cryptically. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cHere we have auctions for prey-- some willing volunteers, some not so willing-- have a little fun in the back rooms over there, or just talk and coordinate with other predators.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra sat back in her seat, taking it all in. All of her inhibitions had faded, and she had almost completely forgotten about Bon Bon back at home. For Lyra, this place was a dream come true.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly the brown coated stallion was lifted as Big Macintosh craned his head up. With the assistance of gravity, Caramel slid ever deeper down Big Macintoshs neck. Caramels nose passed the tight ring that sealed the stomach, now he was being pushed in the last place he wanted to be. Big Macintosh continued to gulp and push until Caramel curled up in his gut and he could close his mouth over his hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more gulps, all of Caramels body was curled up inside of the larger stallions stomach. \"Why did I fall for you? You could have at least not let me die a virgin.\" </span></div></div>",

Ah'm as good as my sister at sniffin' out lies.

He noticed, that the situation made his date still uncomfortable. \u201cWhat are you worrying about?\u201d<br>\r\nCaramel sighed. \u201cNormally when I am this near a pony, it only wants to eat me.\u201d \u201cDon't worry.\u201d The red stallion tried to comfort him. \u201dI will not harm you and we will do nothing, what you don\u2019t want to.\u201d<br>\r\nBig Mac took carefully Caramels head and pressed their muzzles together. The light brown pony has never felt such a gentle touch. A tongue licked over his mouth and demanded entrance. Slowly he opened his mouth and the tongue explored the inside. In his nether region his penis reacted. It showed its head, when it came out the sheath. Encouraged by the low resistance Big MacIntosh rolled on top the smaller pony. Caramel let it happen. He closed his eyes and allowed himself to enjoy the sensations. Their sheaths rubbed at each other and both cock get harder pressed together between bodies. Caramel opened his mouth wider to let the tongue explore more of the cave.<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure taste good.\u201d Big Mac said in his mouth. Caramels eyes flew open. With all his strength he kick the big stallion with his hind legs in the chest and threw him off. Big Mac had not thought his words and regretted it immediately. \u201cI knew it. I knew it. You are like all the others. You just want to eat me.\u201d Caramel shouted standing again. Big Mac tried to calm him down, but had a hard time finding the right words. \u201cNo, I'm mean yes. I would love to, but only if you are willing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShould I make a present out of me?\u201d He shouted angry.

Is that how you get off?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not what I meant. \u201c Big Mac sighed. \u201cI like to eat ponies, but I want it to be a great experience for both of us.\u201d \u201cBut I hate being eaten. Have you ever been in a stomach before? It's disgusting. When the acid comes in to kill you.\u201d Big Mac lifted a hoof. \u201cDon't touch me.\u201d Caramel ran out of the barn. It started to rain. His mane loose its form and splashed in his face. More to himself Big Mac said. \u201cBut I won't hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure if he should follow him or not Big Mac stood in place. Why had he to be that stupid? A scream ribbed him out off his numbness. He ran after the scream  into the rain. His hair falls wet in face. Not far form the Barn. He found the source on the next hill. Tow black unicorns off the royal guard urged Caramel to an apple tree. He galloped his hill down. Luckily the rain stopped. It was less luck though, because two white pegasi in golden armor had blown the clouds aside. On the run he could hear the words of the guard ponies. \u201cPrince Blueblood heard you are the most delicious pony in all Equestria. He sent us for you. You have the honor the become his next meal.\u201d<br>\r\nBig Mac reached the ponies and jumped over the unicorns. \u201cOnly over my dead body!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe can arrange that.\u201d One unicorn said.<br>\r\n\u201cIt won't be necessary.\u201c The other replied. His horn glow blue and and two robes flew out of the golden chariot, which brought them here. They wrapped themselves around his hooves and the red stallion fell to the ground. \u201cRun.\u201d He shouted before a third one bound his muzzle.  Caramel turn around and ran, but he didn't get far. Three more ropes and he was as tied up as MacIntosh.<br>\r\nHe began to glow as the unicorns lifted him up and stored him in the chariot. The pegasi back in place flew off towards Canterlot.</span></div></div>",

Maybe he did care for him, but he probably wanted him just for himself. \u201cNo, We are supposed to deliver the pony unharmed.\u201d \u201cPlease, just one lick.\u201d The second guard sighed. \u201cOkay, one lick.

Two Earth-Ponies stand in the frame. Caramel turned his head and was overjoyed, when he saw Bic MacIntosh. \u201cWho dares to interrupt my dinner. Guards arrest them!\u201d<br>\r\nBoth unicorn guards took a step forward but when Twilight Sparkle and Shining Armor  stepped forward too, they hesitated. \u201cFire Frame, Coldstar, not you two.\u201dShining Armor said disappointed.

You can't eat me.\u201d Blueblood said snooty. \u201cYou, servant.\u201d He pointed at Rarity. She looked surprised and point his her hoof at herself and asked silent 'me?'. \u201cYes you. Go to Princess Celestia. Bring her the massage, that I insist, that Captain Shining Armor should immediately be deposed from his duty, because he is out of mind.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon't you remember me from the gala?\u201d Rarity asked. \u201cOf course I do. You were the overdressed servant, who followed me around and was supposed to fulfill all my needs and wishes. You were not very smart though. You didn't know when you should open doors or bring me a cushion. I was so kind to overlook your mistakes, because you were new. But now go and bring the massage to the Princess!\u201d Raritys crunched her teeth and her face got red from anger. From one moment to the other her face were back to normal. \u201cCaramel, my dear, would please be so kind and finish him Off.\u201d She shouted the last words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig MacIntosh jump from the table and pinned Blueblood down. \u201cYou can't do that. Get off me.\u201d Prince Blueblood physical strength was no match against MacIntoshs. He tried to use his Magic, but was not used to levitated more than a cup of tea. Mac began to glow but nothing else happened. Big mac threw Blueblood around. His head landed on the table right in front of Caramels hooves. \u201cYou are sure I should eat him?\u201d He asked around.<br>\r\n\u201cI would like to see that\u201d<br>\r\n\u201dHe deserve it, I think.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you should.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeeha! Get to it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEeyup.\u201d Big Mac said as he ripped of Bluebloods neckline. The only clothing he was wearing.<br>\r\nCaramel was nervous. \u201cI have never done it before.\u201d \u201cJust go with it. It will come by itself.\u201d Shining Armor said. Caramel lean down and took the head in his hooves. He wasn't sure how it worked. He opened his maw and shoved the head in. The taste wasn't bad. It was quite good actual. He shove the head in to the edge of his throat, but the horn pocked his nose. It was strange a few minutes ago he had problems with an apple, but now. It felt very natural, when he just expanded his muzzle wider to take the horn. Blueblood looked very frighten as his head disappeared into the others mouth. Now Caramel worked at he shoulders. Big Mac helped by heaving more of the Prince on the table. The shoulders pasted his lips and the unicorns muzzle glide down his throat. Caramel had to gulp hard in order to get the shoulder down his gullet. He sucked on the chest, that lay on his tongue. He can't believe how good it taste and  feel to eat somepony.<br>\r\nHe blushed when his cock became hard in front of all others. The girls began to giggle. He was ashamed. \u201cDon't worry.\u201d Big Mac told him, who was in front of him. He turned a bit to the side and lifted one hoof. Caramel saw his rock hard horse member. Shining Armor to his right smiled. His member was out of its sheath, too. He calmed down and gulped the chest down. His belly expanded when the head entered the stomach. The rump passed his lips and a musky taste hit he tongue, when it dove into Bluebloods sheath. He played with it for a bit to have a better taste. But he didn't want to give Blueblood to much enjoyment so he swallowed the butt. The rest went quite quick, when gravity took over and the hind hooves were pulled down the throat. The bulge in his belly swelled to the table, when the stallion passed the neck and was fully settled in the stomach. Big Mac leaned forward and gave Caramel a deep kiss. \u201cI love you.\u201d Caramel was in heaven. Finally he found a pony, which cared for him.<br>\r\n\u201cHe sure smells nice. Do you wanna share? Ouch!\u201d Twilight had rammed her elbow in the side of her brother. \u201cI was just asking.\u201d \u201cThis is the moment, where we quietly and discretely go away.\u201d She explained. \u201cWhere is Pinkie Pie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGustave de Grand had hidden under the bed. \u201cSarceblue.\u201d He whispered. \u201cDo they have no respect for royalty?\u201d \u201cI know. How do they dare to rescue a friend.\u201d A voice said next to him. \u201dHey I know you. You were the griffon, who made the incredible tasty \u00e9clairs. I wonder if you taste as good as them.\u201d A tongue licked over the side of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinky Pie crawled out under the bed with a giant wiggling bulge in her stomach. All ponies were looking at her questioningly. \u201cCall her the chef.\u201d She burped and two little feathers slowly fell to the ground. \u201cSo we are out of here and give the lovebirds some privacy.\u201d \u201cWell I have some guards to punish anyway and I now what I want to do with them.\u201c Shining Armor said. The five ponies dragged the two unicorn guards out of the room to the still tied up pegasi and closed the door leaving Big MacIntosh and Caramel on their on.</span></div></div>",

For five minutes he fought against his bound, before the knot opened up and the rope loose. He was free again. 'Lucky the guard had not known how to make a good knot' he thought. 'If my sister had tied me up, I would rot before I free myself.' Big Mac knew he would need help, if he tried to rescue Caramel. Es fast as he could he ran down the hill to one specific group of apple trees, the one that Applejack wanted to work on today. He breathed relieved when he found A.J. there where she should be. Good old reliable Applejack. MacIntosh stormed towards her. She kicked apples from a tree and they fell into baskets. \u201cHey, what's up big bro?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA.J. You have to help me.\u201d MacIntosh began. \u201cBlueblood has sent guard ponies. They captured my new friend Caramel. He wants to eat him.\u201d \u201cWait a second, big bro. With new friend ya mean boyfriend?\u201d Applejack asked. Under the red coat the blushing was hard to make out, but Applejack knew her brother well enough to knew that she hit the target. \u201cDon't be shy. It's not like I didn't know.\u201d \u201cIt's not that. Our first meetin' didn't  end well.\u201dBig MacIntosh was near to tears. \u201cHe probably doesn't want to see me again, but I have to rescue him anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you waitin' for then? Let's find the others.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou're the best lil sister, somepony could hope for.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am and don't forget it.\u201d<br>\r\nBoth ponies galloped into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst they stopped at Raritys boutique. It took a little time till Rarity opened the door. \u201cOh my dear. Why are you in such a hurry.\u201d \u201cYa must help me helpin' my brother. Are you up for a rescue mission?\u201d \u201cWho are we going to rescue from what exactly?\u201d \u201dMa brothers new friend form Blueblood. He wanna eat him.\u201d Rarity looked from Applejack to MacIntosh. \u201cA moment, please. Let me get this right. You want me to help you saving your new special somepony from Prince Blueblood, the Prince Blueblood, the most insensitive, selfish, non gentlecolt in all Equestria, who wants to make a meal out of him?\u201c \u201cEeyup\u201d \u201cIt will be my pleasure.\u201d She thought for a moment. \u201cIndeed, we have not much time, but let me just write a letter to Twilight, so she knows whats going on.\u201d She went inside again. With glowing horn, a paper and quill, she wrote in clear, beautiful hornwriting a letter.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease bring that to Spike. He will send it to Twilight immediately. She is visiting by her brother in Canterlot. I think she can be very useful. In the meantime Applejack and I will look after Pinkie Pie.\u201d \u201cWhat is with Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy?\u201d Applejack asked. \u201cOh dear, they are off training for Tornado Duty next week. Sadly I have no idea where they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter big MacIntosh had visited the library and the letter was out, he met the four Ponies at the train station. \u201cThank you, you want to help  me, too.\u201d Big Mac said to Pinkie Pie. \u201cOh no big biggie. Saving a poor stallion from an other grim royal stallion so he can be together with an other stallion sound like fun. Too bad I don't have song for it.\u201d \u201cWhat are we waitin' for?

How do you get the conductor to go faster.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh my brother can be quite convincin'.\u201d Applejack answered. \u201cIs he hurt?\u201d \u201cOf cuz not. So where do we find the Prince.\u201d A.J. asked. \u201cEasy. It is the third biggest building in Canterlot.\u201d Shining Armor smiled. The six ponies galloped towards the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">In the front of the train sat the brown furred pony conductor. Spit dropped from his mane. His whole body was covered in it. After he had refused to go fast the rad stallion had opened its maw and shoved him in. With horror he remembered how he glided down the gullet and ended in the stomach. \u201cWill you be a good little pony now or should I digest you?\u201d. The conductor shook his had to erase the memory in his head.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor knocked at the front door of Prince Bluebloods domicile. The butler opened the door. \u201chow can I help you?\u201d \u201cI'm Shining Armor. Captain of the royal guards. I need to talk to Prince Blueblood.\u201d \u201cExcuse me Sir, but the Prince is having dinner at the moment. Please come back in tomorrow. I will let him know you were there, Sir.\u201d The butler wanted to close the door again, but Shining Armors Magic held it open. \u201cYou will bring me to him now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig MacIntosh, Applejack, Twilight Sparkle, Shining Armor, Rarity and Pinkie Pie were led to a great two wing door. Shining Armor were surprised to see two of his ponies in front of it.<br>\r\n\u201cGrey Sky, Winter Blow, what are you doing here.\u201d Both pegasi seemed uncomfortable seeing their captain at this place. \u201cWe make sure Prince Blueblood is not bothered. \u201cWell I will bother him now. Stand aside.\u201d Grey Sky answered. \u201cI'm afraid I can't do that, Sir. We are not supposed to let anypony in.\u201d \u201cBut you are not under his command. You are under mine. Now step aside.\u201d Shining Armor commanded. \u201cWe have no time for this. Sister would you please.\u201d Big Mac asked Applejack. \u201cYeeha\u201d Before Grey Sky could even react. A lasso were around his waist, bounding his wings to his body. Applejack attacked him and in no time he was on the back with tied up legs in the air. Winter Blow was reacting but stopped by a cake in his face. Pinkie Pie laughed out loud, while Rarity used a flag on the wall and cord to wrap the head shaking pegasus within.

Caramel shook his head while he was walking down the main road of Ponyville. 'You can't fly!!' Caramel couldn't believe it. 'What does she think I am? A Pegasus? I'm a Earth-Pony, dammit! We have qualities, too. We are way stronger, than the light build cloud huggers, or the unicorns, who always use magic and never move a muscle to do things! Bitch!'<br>\r\nSassaflash had thrown him out of their home after she had left him for an other Pegasus. Technically she just could have flown back to her home in Cloudsdale to let him stay in their house in Ponyville. But she owns more of it so she had thrown him out instead.'<br>\r\n'To nice!!! What is wrong with that?' All sorts of emotions rode through his heart. Anger, despise, mourning, hate, self doubts and finally helplessness. Where should he go? His parents didn't live in Ponyville and he had no stay for tonight. In his thoughts he had left Ponyville without even realizing it and shambled downcast on the road to the Apple Farm.<br>\r\nWhen he lifted his head the next time and saw the rad barn he thought. 'Why not? Maybe he could stay by the Apple Family and his old friend MacIntosh. They are well known for their hospitality.'<br>\r\nHe knocked on the front door and waited. And waited a bit more. This was unlikely. He had expected that Applejack would had opened the door by now, or Applebloom or at least the old Granny. He didn't dare to knock again, but when he had decided to walk away Big MacIntosh finally opened the door. Big Mac looked in the sad face of his friend. \u201cWhat's the matter, Bud?\u201d He asks. Behind him Braeburn looked over his shoulder.<br>\r\nCaramel swallowed his dignity. \u201cSassaflash broke up with me and threw me out. And now I don't know where to stay.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSay no more. Come in.\u201d Big Mac invited him in. After Caramel had greeted Braeburn they all walked into the kitchen. Big Mac gave his Friend an apple juice first. Then he asked.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what exactly happened?\u201d Caramel began to talk. Half a hour he was complaining about his ex mare friend and ended his report with the line. \u201dAnd now she is together with this selfish arrogant Thunderlane!\u201d Both stallions looked at him with sympathy. An uncomfortable silence filled the room. So Caramel asked. \u201dWhere are the others by the way?\u201d<br>\r\nBraeburn happy about a less downcasting Topic answered. \u201dOh the girls are in Manehatten for two weeks for selling. I'm here to help Mac with the work meanwhile. Normally Applebloom stay here with us, but she was so eager to see her cousin that they took her with.\u201d<br>\r\nBig Mac stepped to Caramel and rubbed his muzzle. \u201cYa can stay as long as ya need. We will prepare the guest room for ya.\u201d \u201dThank you.\u201d \u201dYa can help us with the work if ya want. Maybe it will bring ya to other thoughts.\u201d Big Mac suggested. \u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the afternoon Caramel helped Big MacIntosh to kick apples off trees. It was a monotone work, but he was happy to do something what distracted him from his thoughts. Strangely Braeburn was never around. He asked Big Mac about it. \u201cHe's catchin' some critters for the farm. If ya want to help him, he is near the Everfree Forest.\u201d So he searched for Braeburn and caught little animals for some time. Together they carried the cages back to the farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night came and Caramel crawled under the blanket of his bed leaving Big Mac and Braeburn alone. But when it was quiet his thoughts circles around Sassaflash again and he couldn't find peaceful sleep. One hour he stayed awake. Now he felt, that his bladder was full. Unnerved he stood up again. He could find sleep anyway. He went downstairs and did his business. He walked upstairs again, but when he passed Big Macs room a sound drove through his body. It was a deep lust moan. His first reaction was to ignore it, but a second made him curious. He put his ear on the door. \u201cBe quiet or he'll hear.\u201d Big Mac said. \u201cI know, but it feels so good, when you shove it in.\u201d<br>\r\n'What the... Are they fucking?' Caramel thought. He looked through the keyhole. He made out the bed at the and of the room. Big Mac was in front and he saw Braeburns yellow legs spread at the sides. Something squeaked and stopped. Big Mac walked off his field of view. Now Caramel saw Braeburns ballsack and butt. Something stuck out of the hole. Some sort of toy? But then it moved. Caramel was shocked when he suddenly realized that it was a squirrel tail. He didn't know what to think. Braeburn had a living squirrel in his bum. He probably should storm in and save the critters, but he was freezing in place. Big Mac came back with two mice. They were hanging form his muzzle by their tails squeaking desperately. He climbed on he cousin in a sixty-nine position. Caramel saw the proud erection stand to the sky when Big mac lifted it up. Caramels member reacted to the show. He felt that he was getting aroused. His heart hammered in his chest when he witnessed how Big Mac took one of the mice and shoved it in the pulsating member. Braeburn maned again. The horse cock swallowed it with ease. The second mouse followed. Caramels cock bounced hard, when two little bulges traveled down the urethral, while Big Mac licked the precum of the dick. Both mice ended in one ball each. Big Mac sucked his cousin now. One hoof took the squirrels tail and begun to fuck Braeburn with it.<br>\r\nCaramel stoke himself now. He was disgusted by himself but he was also turned on. A moan from deep within began to rise. He could feel it traveling in his throat. He tried too swallow it down.</span></div></div>",

She trotted over to a mirror to get a good glimpse of her full self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm~ I look good~\" Carrot Top giggled. \"Hey are you enjoying yourself in there AJ? Not that it matters. Either way you're going to end up a part of me soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ squirmed a bit to get into a more comfortable position before replying.</span></div></div>",

First was the purple unicorn that asked him to leave, he didn't care and went back to sleep. Then a white unicorn tried to suck up to him, he didn't mind that so much but then she foolishly revealed her true motive, to get his treasure while he was away.

This one was the most annoying one, yelling at him and even kicking him in the nose, causing him to sneeze. The dragon HAD IT.

The he got an idea how he could turn this annoyance to his own favor. \"You want me to leave right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn that introduced herself as Twilight Sparkle nervously stepped forward. \"Uhm,\" she gave a nervous chuckle. \"yes, your smoke would darken up Equestria for a hundred years and our ecosystem..\" He roared and cut her off before she could start with her boring lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about it. If you really want me to leave you have to give me something.\" He said with an evil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, what is it?\" Asked Twilight with shaking voice and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sacrifice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dragon revealed his price the mouths of these ponies were wide open. They heard stories about dragons that demanded a virgin sacrifice but they would have never guessed that a dragon would ever demand one from them. \"A sacrifice?\" Asked Twilight in disbelieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes a sacrifice.\" Answered the dragon, annoyed that he had to repeat himself. \"So, do you agree? Either you give me a sacrifice and I leave or you don't and I won't. And if you keep annoying me I will eat all of you and stay here anyway!\"</span></div></div>",

To give you a better idea of all the kinds of vore and corresponding scenarios allowed in this interactive I have invited the citizens of Ponyville. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst here are Mr. and Mrs. Cake, the owners of Sugarcube Corner. For the first demonstration they shall be our predators. We are going to show you four of the different kinds of vore out there. Both ponies smiled at the camera, looking slightly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here is the prey, while they are being eaten we will also show some degrees of willingness. The flower trio, Roseluck, Lilly and Daisy appear from the sidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst we will show you the regular oral vore, meaning the prey is eaten like any other food with the mouth. Daisy here will show us an example where the prey is unwilling but accepting of her fate, Mr. Cake, would you like to start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Cake steps in front of Daisy, who looked at him with a haunted expression. \"Just get this over with.\" Then Daisy closed her eyes as Mr. Cake snapped up her head with his jaws. He pushed forward and used his tongue to pull her in. Little by little Daisy slid down his throat and into his stomach. As only her hind legs still stuck out Mr. Cake raised his head up to let gravity assist him. Soon enough he was done swallowing and his distended belly hung low with Daisy curled up in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you Mr. Cake, now Mrs. Cake you're next, please show us some anal vore with Lilly here. Anal vore basically means that the prey is eaten through the back door. Mrs. Cake turned around in front of Lilly and patted her wide butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hay no.\" Screamed Lilly, \"I am NOT going in there.\" She then turned around and started to run, only for Rose to bite her tail. \"Rose, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are demonstrating the unwilling prey, Rose shows the feeder, somepony in league with the predator who brings in the prey. Now Rose, would you be so kind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose dragged the kicking and screaming Lilly back to Mrs. Cakes waiting ass. She Lilly's head with her front hooves and shoved her nose first into the hole. Mrs. Cake squealed in pleasure as Rose pushed at her friend, causing more of the protesting mare to slide into Mrs. Cakes butt. Finally all of Lilly's body was inside as Mrs. Cake panted heavily, her forelegs bend and her hind legs still holding her rump in the air. As Lilly reached the stomach she started to kick around wildly but it only made Mrs. Cake feel even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you Rose, now since Mrs. Cake is already in that position could you please show us a willing prey as well as unbirthing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose saluted and put both of her front hooves into Mrs. Cakes vaginal lips and started to push herself in. Mrs. Cake bit her lips to prevent herself from screaming in pleasure. Rose gave Mrs. Cakes pussy a lick before pushing her head inside and using her hind legs to push herself in. As her legs lost connection to the ground she wriggled herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from vore sex is also allowed, straight, gay or bisexual pairings are all allowed, now Mr. Cake, would you help your wife out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Mr. Cake made his way to his wife, and pushed Rose's hind legs inside. He then started to lick her wet, slightly swollen pussy. Mrs. Cake gasped as her husband worked his tongue on her clit. After the pleasure of unbirthing Rose it didn't take long for her to climax. She laid there for a few more minutes as Mr. Cake lapped up her juices. Then Mr. Cake walked in front of her and presented his hard erection to her. Slowly Mrs. Cake opened her mouth and brought it closer to her husbands cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood thinking Mr. Cake, we are out of prey but haven't presented cock vore yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Cake realized too late what was going on and her muzzle was already down her husbands urethra. Pre cum was already flowing out of his cock, making his wifes journey a little smoother. She tried to resist but after her head was inside her husbands cock her arms were pinned to the side. Mr. Cake whinnied loudly in pleasure and bucked forward, taking in more of Mrs. Cake. After only a few minutes she was completely swallowed by his surprisingly elastic penis and now weighed down in his sac, which now almost touched the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you Mr. Cake, that is all for now. And next time I will show the audience the rules about hard vore and gore. Along with a few taboos that I won't allow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Here with me are Ms. Cheerilee and her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say hi children.\" Says Mr. Cheerilee to her class and waved. \"I can't wait to taste those little morsels.\" Her class got kinda nervous as they heard this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI like your enthusiasm but we are here to explain some more rules, for example. Foals like Applebloom or Twist are available as predator or prey but there are some extra rules applying to them. Romance between foals is still allowed but no sex scenes. Also while they can be eaten by an adult the scenes may not include hard vore or painful and graphic digestion. Sorry guys but this is where I draw the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand.\" Said Cheerilee, \"This chapter was supposed to be about hard vore but I am not allowed to eat any of the students that way.\" Estee rolls his eyes at Ms. Cheerilees obliviousness. Then slowly she started to understand the implications of this and slowly turned around. Her class was now looking at her with a hungry expression. Ms. Cheerilee gulped and backed away from the approaching students until her back hit the wall. \"Now class, I am sure we don't have to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we don't have to.\" Said Scootaloo, causing Cheerilee to sigh in relieve. \"But we really want to.\" Then her students pounced on her and pinned her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery well then, now to hard vore and gore. While I don't want to exclude this option entirely I don't really enjoy either. So please keep the gore down a little when writing a scene involving hard vore. The same applies to digestion and cooking scenes but we get to them later. First let's take a look at a hard vore scene with low gore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheerilee tried to stand up again but the cutie mark crusaders and Twist took a huge bite out of each of her legs, causing her to fall down again. Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon meanwhile moved to her flanks. \"Hmm, I always loved the taste of daisies, I hope your cutie mark tastes like it.\" Said Diamond Tiara before she bit into Ms. Cheerilees left flank while Silver Spoon did the same with the right. Cheerilee screamed as her students ate her alive but soon those screams stopped as the pain and blood loss became too much for her and she passed away. Her students did not let that stop them, they continued and after about an hour only the bones were left. The colts and fillies now laid down on the ground and everypony let out a small burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you very much, I let you digest your teacher now and next time we will cook with Pinkie Pie.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Welcome to the next part of the interactive rule guide. This time I'm joining Pinkie Pie here in the kitchen where she will prepare a little feast for us, isn't that right Pinkie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessir, I'm so excited for this, I have never cooked a pony before but thankfully Mrs. Cake gave me some recipes.\" Pinkie Pie was beaming with excitement, on the table next to her laid Applejack and Rainbow Dash, bound with rope and gagged with apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like you already have everything you'll need Pinkie, now cooking is also a part of the vore fetish. Like with digestion and hard vore I'd like to ask you not to overdo it with the gore. For a first example of cooking I'd like to start by turning Applejack into a nice roast. As Pinkie heard this she turned the oven on so it would be hot by the time she put Applejack in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she heard this Applejack started to struggle, trying to break free of her binds. \"Oh you silly pony, you can't escape unless Estee writes that you escape. Now, let's get you stuffed and basted.\" Pinkie Pie procured a bowl filled with a lot of apple slices. She hummed a happy little song while she started to stuff the apples into her friends ass. Applejack couldn't help but moan in pleasure as the fruits she liked so much invaded her plothole. After a few minutes Pinkie was done and heaved her onto the oven plate. Applejack now remembered her predicament and continued to struggle. Nothing was working and soon she was placed inside the oven. She gave Pinkie one last pleading look but the pink pony just closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery good Pinkie, while Applejack is roasting why don't we continue with Rainbow Dash? Instead of cooking her some foodplay can also be used for this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Pinkie procured a large bowl with molten chocolate and a brush. With experience from her work in sugarcube corner she started to spread the chocolate across Rainbow Dash's figure, coating the entire pegasus evenly with the chocolate. After making sure every inch of her was covered she put the brush and the bowl aside and went to the fridge. She took out a can of whipped cream and gave it a good shake before popping the lid of. Almost like an artist she used the whipped cream to paint beautiful lines and curves on Rainbow Dash's body. The pegasus felt a little guilty as she admitted that she kinda enjoyed the process while Applejack was roasting in the oven. After Pinkie was satisfied with her work she placed a single cherry on a little puff of cream on Rainbow Dash's snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she opened the oven door and carefully took Applejack out of it while holding a towel in her mouth to protect herself from the heat. As she was placed down she groaned slightly. It looks like she survived the process, even though her coat was now a little crispy. Rainbow Dash managed to spit out the apple in her mouth and talked to Applejack. \"Man am I glad that you're alive, at least this was just a cooking presentation otherwise we might be melting away in a stomach right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah, that reminds me that I want to cover digestion too. Pinkie, could you bring these two to Big Macintosh for the digestion scenes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...?\" Rainbow Dash was speechless and Applejack glared at her friend. She just had to open her big mouth didn't she?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Welcome back, todays chapter will be all about digestion. All food eventually lands in the stomach to be digested, so will the ponies that are vored. Let's look at some ways you can go about this process, here comes Pinkie Pie with the two meals she prepared last time and over there is this chapters predator, Big Macintosh. Say Big Mac, are you excited about todays meal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup.\" Applejack looked at her brother in disbelieve, she wanted to say something but the apple in her mouth prevented her from doing so. Rainbow Dash also wanted to protest but Pinkie put the apple back into the pegasus mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright Big Mac, eat up, start with whoever you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large red stallion eyes his squirming sister with hungry eyes. Desperately she tried to wriggle her way out of these binds but before she could even get off of the plate the hungry maw of her brother engulfed her. With Pinkies help it didn't take long until Applejack disappeared down her brothers throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, one way to go about this is to only imply digestion. Here we will stay outside of the stomach while Applejack is being digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Macintoshs belly swayed as his sister struggled inside, soon his stomach started to gurgle and churn. After a minute Applejack stopped struggling and Big Macintoshs belly started to shrink down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you, if the writer wishes he can also have the predator fall asleep and wake up after digestion is complete. Those who dislike character death can also have the predator only store his prey for later release. Now it's time for the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash also desperately tried to escape as Big Macintosh approached her. Pinkie Pie picked up the plate and shoved her friend down the stallions throat, he was delighted at the chocolate covered pegasus. In the end she too was curled up in Big Macintoshs stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright everyone, this time we'll cover an inside view of the digestion process. Depending on preference you can have the character melt into a nutritional sludge or have the stomach acids dissolve her, with Rainbow Dash we will look at melting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason the inside of the stomach was illuminated. Rainbow Dash couldn't see any trace of Applejack inside. Then she noticed that she started dripping and felt really soft and jiggly. Fearfully she watched as her body slowly turned into some sort of thick liquid. By the time she got out of the ropes her hooves were already a puddle. In the end Rainbow Dash gave up and waited until she was completely liquefied. All that was left of her was a colorful puddle that was being absorbed by her predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you Big Mac, for the last part... oh wait we're out of prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait, pick me!\" Squealed Pinkie Pie, eagerly waving her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright why not, Big Macintosh, your next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Big Macintosh had no difficulty as the pink pony practically dove into his throat. With one jump her upper body was already in his esophagus and a combination of swallows and wriggles helped to get the rest of Pinkie into the large stallions stomach in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright everyone, here we are at the final part of digestion, dissolving in acids. You may wonder why I approve of hard vore and digestion but ask you to keep the gore down, the answer: you can do a lot with implications. Let's see how we can digest Pinkie Pie without gore but with implications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie laid down in Big Macintoshs stomach as the gastric juices started to fill the chamber. Pinkie giggled as it started to tickle while she could feel her mane and fur falling out. The tickling turned into an itch, covering her entire body as the stomach acids started to work on the skin. A burning sensation spread across her body as her frame slowly shrank down until nothing was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is just one example of using implications for a digestion scene, but I am only asking you to keep it down, if you really want to write gore I won't delete it but please leave an alternate option for everyone else. Gore is only strictly forbidden when the prey is a foal. Otherwise I am pretty open about fetishes, shouldn't throw rocks while sitting in a glass house so you can write many varying scenarios, just leave a little warning when you implement other fetishes like for example post vore scat or watersports. If you want to implement an OC pony then only as prey please, unless it is a non pony like for example a dragon, snake or carnivorous plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Macintosh was about to leave as a large gryphon landed right behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember Big Macintosh, a predator can always end up as prey. Then the author can either end the story or shift the focus to the new predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Macintosh gulped as he saw the gryphon, Gilda lick her beak eagerly. With a desperate look he addresses the audience. \"Help me out here please, we had so much fun in this chapter, wouldn't it be ungrateful to turn me into a meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to him.\" Said Gilda. \"You guys want variety right? So let's switch things up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will end up as prey?</span></div></div>",

Big Macintosh tried to bury his front hooves into the ground but he was still dragged deeper down the gryphons gullet. He looked back fearfully before the beak passed over his head and he got one last look of the outside world before Gilda closed her beak over his front hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not easy to swallow such a large meal but with some work and a few strong gulps the stallions bulge travelled down her throat and into her stomach. Big Macintosh could only think of the irony of this situation. He was just going through the different digestion scenes last chapter and now he was the one being digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside Gilda was rubbing her belly and licked her beak. \"Alright pervs, I hope you enjoyed the show. Let me know if you want me to eat another pony, seeya.\" With some difficulty she flew off.</span></div></div>",

Before Gilda could recover her head and throat, along with her hands were inside his mouth. She wildly flapped her wings but Big Mac used his front hooves to hold them down. He continued to swallow her until he reached her wings where he released his hold. Half of the gryphon was already making a nice bulge in his throat as he threw his head back to let gravity help him with his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly slid down into his stomach until only her flailing legs and tail were still outside. Big Macintosh also gulped theses down and after a few more strong swallows Gilda was struggling in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Big Macintosh laid there with his squirming stomach he almost regretted eating that gryphon. She was one hell of a fighter.</span></div></div>",

An active author who takes care of his story, performs quality control and frequently updates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Variety and the option for others to bring in their ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Other writers who bring in their own ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the third category I would like to announce that all of you who frequently add new chapters to this interactive will get a very special chapter just for you. Here is how this works, if you often add to this story I will write you an email if I think you qualify for this prize and then you can send me a description or picture of your ponysona, avatar or original character and what you would like to see. Then I will write the scenario of your choice with your character in the lead role. I will try to keep track but if you think I missed you you can always send me a request and I will look at your additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I will make an exception in the no OC rule the chapter will have to abide to the other rules of this interactive. So if you want to see your own character devouring the princesses after conquering Equestria or have the main six as your personal vore harem then upload your chapters and I will write it for you. If you prefer to write these chapters yourself you are free to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To counter this, the Princesses cast another spell on Ponyville, causing all ponies that are eaten to respawn shortly afterwards. After a while, vore became perfectly acceptable in Ponyville and even developed in a tourist attraction. Basically, in this path you can use all types of vore and go nuts with whatever character you want, even more so than usually. Only two rules, the second option must ALWAYS be a blank choice in case someone else has a different idea and it's always nonfatal, where the digested ponies pop back into existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. YOU. With this path, you can choose what species you are, what gender and use yourself as a character.

You don't struggle, and soon she's going down your stomach... over your flanks.... And with a mighty SLUUUURP she swallows you legs, sending you down into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRRRRRRRRrrraaapp!\" She belches loudly and rubs her bulging gut. \"Mmmm~ Thanks!

As she rests, her stomach goes into overdrive, slowly breaking you down. Your fur falls off in clumps as you pass out. Soon, your skin muscles and organs are dissolved away, leaving little more than a bleached white skeleton. It too begins to break down under the onslaught of acids, slowly dissolving and adding a bit of a creamy color to the mixture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dissolved remains are pushed into Carrot Top's intestines, where fat and anything useful to her is absorbed. The rest however is drained further on. The liquid is pulled out of it and by morning all that's left is a solid mass in her colon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the mare wakes up she rubs her once again thin stomach and smiles. \"Time for you to get to work.\" She says with a smirk as she heads outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she's near the field, she grabs a small shovel and relieves herself. She then mixes your steaming remains into the soil around some of the carrots, giving them a nice source of nutrients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNopony other than Carrot Top even knew you were in town... and now the only evidence you existed was a bag of bits she was planning to spend, and a bit of fat on her shapely ass.</span></div></div>",

Carrot Top gave a short sigh and said, \"I was hoping for you to enjoy this as much as I will, but I guess that won't happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are paralyzed with fear for a moment when you realize what this means, then you begin to violently struggle to free yourself from her grasp. You remained pinned down to the dirt as she opens her maw and hives you a glimpse into the dark abyss that hungrily waited for you. She stuck out her saliva soaked tongue and pressed it to your right cheek. You were incapable of moving away as she slid her tongue down the length of your head and neck and slowly continued to run her tongue down the length of your torso down to your... oh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               ...Oh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you hadn't been so scared, you would have enjoyed that part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe retracted her tongue, wiped the drool off her cheeks and moved back up to where her head was directly above yours. There was now a streak of saliva that went from your chin to your crotch that glistened in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plea... Please don't eat me!\" You whimpered as your heart pounded in your chest like a drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curly maned mare giggled. \"Sorry, but you came to the wrong farm,\" she said, \"I probably would have let you live if you were more compliant, but now I'm thinking about how much more fun it would be to digest you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were officially to scared to speak. This couldn't be happening! She was so strong, much stronger than you. You could do nothing to resist her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you a little goodbye kiss on the cheek and opened her mouth wide, unnaturally wide. In fact, her maw opened so wide, she was able to completely encompass your head with little effort. Your nose was now all the way in the back of her throat and you could feel her mouth sliding down your neck. She allowed your front hoofs to wiggle free because she was now using her front hoofs to wrap around your torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried using your front hoofs to push on her mouth and free your head, but that proved to be a mistake. She opened her mouth even wider and trapped both of your hoofs inside of her throat as well! She gave the powerful *GULP*s and you slid even deeper into her throat. Your shoulders and upper torso were now also in her mouth. All you could do now was try vigorously to kick with your hind legs, but that did nothing because she still had your lower body pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed even harder and took your entire upper torso into her mouth. Your hind legs and tail were now the only parts of your body in the open sunlight. Your head and front hoofs had passed all the way into her stomach. It was almost empty save for a few chunks of carrots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest was easy for her. She gulped and slurped until your legs and tail were pulled into her mouth as well. After one more gulp you were far enough down her throat for her to close her mouth completely. Your hind legs and torso were still lodged in her esophagus. She smiled and gave one final, powerful *GULP!* and your body was forced down that tube and into her stomach completely. You had to curl up in order to fit in her cramped stomach as it expanded to just barely a large enough size to contain you. You couldn't move at all as your body was completely surrounded by digestive acids that poured into every available crevice of the stomach that you didn't occupy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Carrot Top rolled over on her back and caressed the gigantic bulge in her chest. She felt a tremendous amount of pressure on her throat and let out a thunderous *BELCH!* to relieve the pressure. The scent of digesting carrots and stallions filled the air as she quickly nodded off to sleep. Her dreams were happy because of her wonderful meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stay was not nearly as peaceful. Your mane and coat were the first things to go as you were slowly digested. Clumps of hair and fur fell off of your body allowing the acids to touch your raw skin as you screamed in agony. However, your muffled pleas for mercy did not wake the sleeping predator from her food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, your skin started to peel off and dissolve, exposing your bare muscle and bone. At this point, your nervous system was in shock and you could barely feel the pain. Your body continued to dissolve and the last thing you remember is the muscles on your chest eroding away and allowing your internal organs to spread out into the slurry of digesting remains. After that, you fell asleep, and you would never wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was slushed around in her stomach until even your bones began to melt down. Eventually, you were smooth enough to continue on to her intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrot Top slept peacefully through the rest of the day and the next night as her bulging stomach slowly decreased in size until it was eventually almost back to normal. Much of your body was absorbed as fat in her flank, thighs and stomach. The unused remains continued down her intestines until they finally reached her colon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrot Top awoke late the next day and realized that she had been asleep since the previous morning. You had been inside of her for nearly two whole days, and your remains longed to get out. Carrot Top noticed this too when she felt an intense amount of pressure on her tail-hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a wonderful nap!\" she said after a long yawn, \"But now, I think it's time to take care of my business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled to the center of her carrot field, thrown off by the amount of weight she had gained, then squatted over a patch of dirt. She strained as hard as she could to push you out, but your remains stubbornly refused to leave. \"I know you like it in there...\" She said through battered breath, \"But you can't stay... ugh... forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPWWWWWWRRRTT!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burst of rancid air finally pushed through her plot and the creamy remains of your body followed soon after. She let out a deep sigh of relief as she felt you pass out of her colon and land on the ground with several loud *plop*s. She continued to relieve herself for quite some time as your rank scent filled the air. When she was finally done, she let out one final, loud gush of wind from her plot and turned around to look at her handy work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that remained of you was a massive pile of brown manure that had already attracted quite a few flies. The only way she could tell that it was even you was by the bits of fur, hair, and bone that stuck out from the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled at the thought of how that pile of crap was a healthy stallion less than two days ago. Then she returned home to prepare a to mix her new fertilizer with her soil.</span></div></div>",

She had gotten out of her bondage costume by now, and is having some breakfast. All the while, a certain colt, you, was being held hostage in quite a volatile place. The mare's stomach is empty now after you had slowly creeped your way onward through her digestive tract throughout the night. The mare's belly still hung low with the weight of an entire pony, but she certainly was famished, being the hungry pony she was. She whipped herself up a couple dishes of food, some pancakes and eggs, with two milkshakes to down. After all, she knows she has to maintain her curvy appearance for all of Ponyville to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her meal, she decided it was time to let you know what is going to happen to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my little colt, it's about time I tell you about my plan. Later today, I'll introduce you to Ponyville, and everyone will become acquainted with your cute face. You will be known and introduced as my personal Aide, one who reports to me directly and does all my bidding. Not only this, but I will give you an extension of privileges and power that will allow you to act as any of this town's guards would. You will have the power to apprehend and arrest anyone you see fit. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure a little power would be nice to have, and to have a connection to such a powerful pony WOULD be of some use, but you can't help but feel there's a catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, anyone you wish you may arrest. But instead of bringing them to jail, you bring them here. I'll personally attend to the wrong-doers by introducing them to my personal jail-cell, much like I did with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you basically want me to feed you other ponies? Isn't that a little... odd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gray mare shakes her belly. \"Just do as I say, little colt. Unless you want to be added to my flanks, I suggest you do as I say. Oh, and if you want to resign early, I'll make sure a guard brings you directly to me, and believe me, next time you enter my personal jail cell, you won't be coming back out.\" You gulp at that statement. She's right, you can't do anything about it, and unless you want to be digested yourself, you'll just have to feed her other ponies and do everything she wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I understand the terms. So could you cough me out now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee,\" the mare chuckled,\" do you think I can cough you out now that I've eaten such a large breakfast? I'd just waste an entire meal. Not to mention you've already come a long way. No, the only exit for you is the back entrance, so brace yourself, it's going to be tight.\"</span></div></div>",

I don't often have entire ponies coming out of my rump, but when I do... it's really fun!~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she pushes and grunts, forcing you toward her exit. Facing downwards now, turned by the motions of her system, the warm walls of the mare's rectum constrict and smother you on and off, in a rhythm of their own. The slimy walls cover every inch of you as you are pushed onward towards that small star-shaped sliver of light.How did you ever get through that hole in the first place? You'll soon find out that it isn't that hard for this young, yet experienced, mare, as you will find it apparent she has had some practice before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*plop* A small male muzzle poked out of the pucker, stretching from a star-shape to an oval, as it continued to stretch, opening wider and wider. Here, the mare couldn't help but clench tightly, forcing you back in entirely. Annoyed, you ask what the problem was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it just feels too good, I couldn't help it. How about you help your mayor out, Mr. Aide? You've got two hooves, don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you pull your two front legs upward, pushing your hooves against the pucker to try and force it open. You grunt and you struggle, this mare isn't making it easy for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to push your hooves through with a *pop*-ing sound. You feel the cold water from the shower-head hitting your exposed fur, but you need to be fully out before you can think about cleaning yourself. With a bit of effort, you manage to widen the plot-hole enough to fit your muzzle through, and, sure enough, your entire head. Mayor Mare pushes again with gusto, heaving your head outside with a small slurping noise. Fresh air, finally! But it's not over yet, you've just managed to get stuck on your shoulders, but after this it should be smooth sailing. Now, your captor shakes her hips up and down, trying to get you to wiggle out. With enough force, your shoulders slurp out of the big pony plot, and from here on, you simply sliiiiiiide out. The pony mare simply relaxes and lets you come out on your own. Shoulders, chest and belly arrive before your face hits the tile floor. Now, in a comical stance, you could be seen with your bottom half stuck inside the mayor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to come out sweetie,\" Miss Mare grunts, pushing again to have your hips plop out along with the rest of your legs spilling out like... well, that's a butt analogy for another time. Anyways, Mayor Mare farted really loudly as your legs finally came out. \"Mmm, pardon me,\" said the blushing pony, \"Ponies give me gas. I don't even have a gassyness fetish, but maybe you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you responded with was a \"blech\" as you lay your exhausted slimy body on the shower floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to clean up, my dirty colt.\"</span></div></div>",

You look downwards, expecting a young colt. Instead, to your surprise, is a dragon. A very small dragon, yes, but still <i>a freaking dragon!</i> Feeling a bit of an eye twitch coming on, you stand glued to the floor, your brain struggling to produce a logical reaction to this development. As you stared, he spoke again, \"You alright? You kinda just wandered in, stared off into space, and now you're... beginning to freak me out, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Freaking </i>him<i> out!? Whatever, just say something, quick.</i> \"A-are you in charge here?\" <i>Good enough.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this place is run by the unicorn in the lab downstairs, Twilight Sparkle. I'm just handling checkouts for a bit while she does... whatever it is she does down there. It's open if you wanna talk to her, just... knock first. Celestia knows what'll happen if you barge in. I'm Spike, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit less nervously, you shake his claw as you consider what to do. Despite your best efforts not to judge, neither option feels 100% safe.</span></div></div>",

A group of mares from our show have \"volunteered\" for a little contest. First I will introduce all of the contestants, afterwards I am taking Emails where you can vote for one of the mares to be eaten by a surprise predator. The last mare still uneaten will receive a price money of 100.000,00 Bits. Here are our contestants. First: Twilight Sparkle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTS: \"Hello everypony, I must say I'm pretty nervous. I've calculated the odds of me being selected and it looks pretty bad for me. But please, just consider not voting me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond contestant, Rainbow Dash<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRD: \"Alright everypony, you all know who the most amazing flyer in all of Equestria is, me of course. So, if you ever want to see my amazing stunts in action you better not vote me off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird contestant, Fluttershy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFS: \"What.. oh.. hi everypony.\" Fluttershy looks nervously at the camera. \"A-are you gonna vote me off. It's okay, if you really want to see me eaten you can vote me off. I don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourth, Rarity<br>\r\n<br>\r\nR: \"Darlings, I know it will be sad when my friends get eaten but please, I would really like to kickstart my own boutique in Canterlot and I need the price money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifth, Applejack<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ: \"Uh, hello everypony. Let's do this fair and square but please, my family needs the price money and I don't really like the idea of melting in some stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSixth, Pinkie Pie<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPP: \"Whoohoo! This is so exciting, I already wonder who's getting voted off first. Maybe I'll get voted off first, then I'll throw a big goodbye party for everypony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeventh, Princess Cadence<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPC: \"Oh, hi everypony. I know you don't know me too well but please, my husband would be heartbroken if I end up eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEight, The great and powerful Trixie<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT: \"The true star has arrived. Without a doubt you would never want to miss me. It will be fun watching the others being devoured though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinth, Derpy Hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD: \"Hi there, I heard I get a lot of muffins if I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast contestant, Ms. Cheerilee<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCh: \"Hello my little ponies, could you please let me win? The school really needs new equipment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese are the mares you all know and love, now get to voting.

The first loser is...... Princess Cadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Cadence eyes widen. She gulps and shakily makes her way over to Estee. \"W-why me?\" Sorry Cadence, it was close but you have been eliminated. Now, please go through that door over there and meet your predator. Estee points Cadence to a door which opened. Cadence hung her head and sadly looked at the other as she went to meet her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now let's turn on the camera to watch out princess here get eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence steps into a dark room, scared of what might await her. Suddenly the lights went on, causing her to shut her eyes. Slowly she opened them again to see a very nice looking bedroom with a red plush carpet and a large, luxurious bed. Cadence then saw who was lying in the bed and gasped. \"YOU? Is this some kind of sick joke?\" She asks the figure lying there. It was Chrysalis, queen of the changelings, who flashed her a mean grin. \"Hello there Cadence, after I heard you'd be in this competition I immediately went for the chance to get you in my belly. I'm just surprised that it happened so soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence starts looking around until she finds a camera. \"Are you bucking kidding me? It's bad enough that I get eaten, does it have to be HER?\" Cadence points in the direction of the changeling queen, not noticing that she has gotten out of the bed and approached her. Cadence continues to protest until she suddenly found her head inside a warm, wet space. Her protests turned into mumbles as Chrysalis started to devour her. Cadence tried to kick and scream but Chrysalis already had a good grip on her and was gradually forcing her body down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulge in her throat slowly slid further down until Cadence finally came at rest in the stomach. Chrysalis let out a small belch as her gut hung low with the princess inside. Cadence meanwhile started to cry out in protest again. \"This is not fair, first she almost steals my husband and now she got to eat me alive? Let me out of here!\" Her cries gradually turned into screams as digestion kicked in. The changeling queens belly churned and gurgled, breaking the princess down into nutrients. \"All that love that was inside of you will keep me fed for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so our first contestant has been eliminated and it looks like this day has just been perfect for queen Chrysalis. Without further ado we'll start the seconds round. But first a word from the remaining contestants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTS: \"Is was really sad seeing Cadence go like that, I can't believe such an amazing unicorn got voted out first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRD: \"Oh buck, I almost would have been voted out. Come on, don't you guys like my sonic rainboom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ: *gulp* \"Hey guys, remember that I have the farm to take care of. What will happen to Sweet Apple Acres if I lose this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFS: *whimper* \"Poor Cadence... and I might be next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nR: \"What a gruesome way for this to end. That was no way to treat a princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPP: \"Bye bye Cadence, at least Chrys looked like she was having fun. It was kinda fitting, I wonder who's gonna eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTr: \"And of course I win the first round, was there ever any doubt? I admit it was fun watching her get eaten, watching Twilight being devoured would be even more fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDe: \"Don't Changelings eat love? Wait, what does love taste like? I bet it tastes like muffins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCh: \"I never knew that changelings could digest ponies. Oh dear, when I think about what happened to her, biology will never be the same again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, let's continue with the other 9 contestants. Remember to send me a mail on writing.com or a PM on Eka's and please put the ponies name in the header. See you all tomorrow when the next contestant is vored.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The second pony to be eaten by a surprise predator is.... THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXIE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Says the blue unicorn in disbelieve. \"Have the viewers forgotten that the one with the most votes is not the winner? Count the votes again, there must be some sort of mistake.\" Sorry Trixie, we've already counted the votes twice, you have been voted out. Please go through that door to meet your predator. With an anger reddened face, Trixie stormed off towards the door and went through it, strangely unafraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those no good... UGH, voting ME out. Me, the great and powerful Trixie. Just you wait, if that predator thinks I'm just gonna let him eat me he will have another thing coming to him.\" Trixie now steps through the door and arrives outside the studio. \"Alright, where is this surprise predator?\" Asks Trixie and lets her horn glow. \"I'm gonna show him that the great and powerful Trixie is not a snack.\" Suddenly there seemed to be an earthquake, trees were uprooted and fell to the side. Trixies confidence left her as a familiar being came into view. \"Where the buck did they get an Ursa Minor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others watched in shock as the Ursa roared at Trixie, leaving her stunned with fear. Then the gigantic bear picks Trixie up by her cape as she tried to flee. He held her above his open maw before he let her go. Trixie screamed as she fell into the open maw, almost directly into the Ursas stomach. After passing a tight ring of flesh, Trixie was dropped into a small pool of liquid. She immediately screamed and stood up again. She bolted of towards the wall of the stomach, but the pool of acid got bigger and bigger. Eventually, she slipped on the slimy walls and slid right into the small lake of gastric juices. The great and powerful Trixie did not resurface again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it looks like the great and powerful Trixie became a filling and delicious snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTS: \"It's too bad Trixie did not learn her lesson from the first time we met, her shows would have been great without all the bragging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ: \"Serves her right for all the bragging, she should have practiced some modesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRD: \"So much for the best pony huh? Now we get to see who the real winner is gonna be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFS: \"I know she was kinda mean but I still feel sorry for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nR: \"SERVES YOU RIGHT! NOPONY GIVES ME GREEN HAIR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPP: \"Oh shoot, I was thinking about having her set up some fireworks for my goodbye party when I get voted out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDe: \"Bye bye Trixie. This is really sad, her fireworks were so pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCh: \"Oh dear, I just hope Snips and Snails won't imitate that stunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, now we're down to eight contestants. Now get to voting again and tomorrow we'll see who the next pony is.</span></div></div>",

Pinkie Pie just waited for Estee to announce the pony that will be voted out this time. As Estee returned, Pinkie Pie had a big grin on her face while Cheerilee looked nervously at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright ladies, the votes are counted and this times prey is..... Pinkie Pie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Cheerilee sighed in relieve while Pinkie jumped into the air. \"Woohoo, I get to be next. I couldn't have waited any longer, I wonder who gets to eat me but first, a PARTY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pies party has already been approved of by the studio and the remaining contestants were celebrating even though most of them were sad to know that Pinkie Pie would soon be a shrinking bulge inside of a belly. The party almost had everything, the only thing missing were the fireworks. Pinkie still hoped she could get some from Trixie but sadly the showmare was eaten in the last round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey danced, ate and drank until Estee came back with something on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie, here is your surprise predator, someone you already know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEstee then turns around to reveal gummy sitting on his back. \"Gummy?\" Pinkie Pie asked, \"you are it?\" Pinkies confusion soon made room for even bigger excitement. \"This is so fantastic, I always wondered how to feed you if you grow up, I wanted to feed myself to you in a pinch but now I get to do it right now.\" She then turned around to face the other girls. \"Goodbye then, see you later I suppose.\" The others shuddered at the meaning of these words as they watched Pinkie approach the tiny alligator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Gummy, chow time.\" She said cheerfully. Gummy immediately jumped from Estees back and took Pinkie muzzle into his mouth. Normally he's stop there but this time Gummy kept going. The others watched in awe as the tiny reptile swallowed Pinkies whole head and was already working his way down her shoulders. The others wondered how this was even possible, the alligator stretched out in ways that should be lethal as he put the belly of his prey into his own before sucking down the flanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the miracle was performed, Pinkie Pie was now just an enormous bulge in Gummy's body. \"It's really tight and slimy in here but also warm and cozy.\" Then Pinkie Pie started to squirm and laugh. \"Stop it Gummy, that tickles.\" Pinkie continued to laugh, either she was oblivious to the fact that she was being digested or she didn't care. \"Ow, that one stung a bit, this one too. I feel really tired all of the sudden.\" The other contestants remained silent, knowing that these were the last words of Pinkie before she would be digested. Soon the bulge stopped moving at all and gradually shrunk down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTS: \"The first of my friends to be devoured, I wonder if she was a voreraphiliac, she seemed to not mind being eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ: \"Aww shoot, even though I hope to win this, it still feels weird to watch Pinkie eaten and digested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFS: \"I'm gonna miss Pinkie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRD: \"She was always so random, at least she seemed to have some fun before she melted down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRa: \"Eaten by her own pet. Strangely I am sometimes afraid of the same happening to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDe: \"Bye bye Pinkie, thanks for all the muffins. Who's gonna bake them now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCh: \"Oh dear, it was so close, oh Celestia I don't wanna be next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I'm sure Mr. and Mrs. Cake will still have muffins for you, and our contest will also go on.

Last tie was so close, now they want to see me eaten.\" A large terrarium on wheels was then carted into the studio, inside of it rested a large snake. Ms. Cheerilee's eyes widened. \"An anaconda!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes Ms. Cheerilee, sorry that we couldn't find a fitting predator from the series but a snake is always good in a vorish situation. Now, if you'd please step into the terrarium so our pet here can eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Cheerilee sighed in defeat, knowing that there was no point in resisting she stepped up a ladder that was held against the glass wall and looking down. The large snake looked directly at her, hunger in it's eyes. Ms. Cheerilee gulped before she closed her eyes and let herself fall down. The earth pony landed directly in the coild of the anaconda and the serpent immediately started to coil around her. As a teacher she knew that this kind of snake would constrict her and press the air out of her lungs but for Ms. Cheerilee that was still better than being digested alive. The snake held her in it's coils tightly but strangely the pressure never grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis beauty here fillies and gentlecolts was trained to eat prey alive and conscious, not pressing the air out of it's victims lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the anaconda started to engulf Ms. Cheerilees head immediately, slowly pushing the teacher down it's gullet. Ms. Cheerilee tried to kick and struggle, not wanting to be digested alive but the snake already had a firm grip on her. The scaly lips slowly engulfed more of Cheerilees body. Her shoulders, belly and cutie mark disappeared down the snakes throat. Soon she was only a bulge, travelling further down the snakes body until she came to a stop. Ms. Cheerilee was now a squirming bulge in the anacondas mid section. Over the time, the struggles grew weaker until they completely stopped, then the bulge started to shrink down until it was barely noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, now the teacher has been eaten, I already wonder who the next pony will be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTS: \"Oh no, poor Ms. Cheerilee.

FLUTTERSHY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other contestants gasped and said mare just fainted, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Fluttershy woke up to find herself inside of a cave. \"What? Where am I?\" Suddenly a huff and a gust of wind from behind startled her, slowly she turned around and faced a large, red dragon. \"Remember me? You made me look like a fool back then when I just tried to take a nap.\" Fluttershy remembered this dragon, she used her stare against it so it would leave, but now that none of her friends were in any danger she was too scared to use the stare. Instead she tried to apologize, to plead him not to eat her but no coherent sentences came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spare me your begging, it's time for me to do, what I always wanted to do.\" Fluttershy screamed as the dragon picked her up and held her above his head. Fluttershy gasped as she looked into the maw below her. Desperately she tried to cling to the dragons claw, but she fell as soon as he let her go. As soon as he felt the pegasus on his tongue, the large dragon swallowed, pushing Fluttershy against the roof of his mouth and guiding her into his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy was now sliding down the fleshy, wet tube, rapidly heading for the stomach. From the outside however, only a small bulge could be seen, squirming inside the dragons neck. Finally, Fluttershy was pushed past the entrance to the dragons stomach, where she was unceremoniously dropped into the chamber. Down there, the shy pegasus curled up and whimpered as she heard gurgling all around her and the stomach acids flowed in. Over the course of the next hour, Fluttershy's body was broken down into nutritious paste for the dragon to absorb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, looks like half the contestants are eaten already. Now, who will finally win the competition? Let's keep voting and find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTS: \"Poor Fluttershy, she was always so scared of exactly this kind of thing.

RAINBOW DASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuah, I can't believe this, are you telling me that I lost?\" Rainbow Dash was dumbstruck at the revelation while Derpy looked very relived. \"Come on, how come I get voted off instead of her?\" Rainbow Dash seemed more angry about losing than afraid of being eaten, although a hint of fear was in her voice. Derpy looked indignant at the cyan pegasus and trotted off while Rainbow Dash continued to complain and demanded a recount of the votes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry Rainbow Dash but here comes your predator, someone you might know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething landed behind her, she suddenly became still as she slowly turned around and saw a familiar face. \"Hey there dweeb, missed me?\" The large gryphon stood directly behind Rainbow Dash and licked her beak as she looked down on her friend with a hungry look in her eyes. \"Alright you flip flop, time to see if you may be the tastiest pony in Equestria.\" Rainbow Dash tried to flee but Gilda used her claws to grab her rear legs. \"Oh no, there is only one place where you will go.\" She said as she put her former friends hooves into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash tried her best to get her legs out of Gildas beak again but the pull was too strong and she soon felt the saliva on her thighs. As the gryphon moved on to the flanks, she couldn't resist sneaking her tongue into Rainbow Dashs marehood, causing the cyan pegasus to gasp in surprise and pleasure. This also caused her struggling to cease, giving Gilda the opportunity to quickly bring her belly and wings into her mouth. Rainbow Dash could feel the slimy throat all around her body now, her hooves were already being pressed through some sort of narrow entry. The pegasus tried to block her descend with her front legs but Gilda just grabbed them and forced them inside of her mouth. All that could be seen from Rainbow Dash was a bulge in the gryphons throat, slowly descending towards her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few short gulps, Rainbow Dash was curled up inside of Gildas stomach, she wildly kicked around, trying to get Gilda to let her out again but the gryphon barely seemd to notice. Then, with a loud, wet gurgling noise, some sort of liquid started to seep into the stomach and covered the pegasus inside. The struggles inside intesified as the meal understood what this liquid was. Soon enough, Rainbow Dash was practically swimming in the gastric juices while Gildas stomach churned loudly, rubbing the bubbling acids into her prey. Rainbow Dash felt as if she was on fire as the acids started to break her down, then her struggles ceased as she passed out in the gurgling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hour, Gildas gut shrunk down again as the pegasus inside dissolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright folks, now the next member of the mane six has been eaten, keep voting, we're almost done here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTS: \"I have not been in a tie yet, maybe I have some good chances of winning this, at least I hope so.

Oh no, I refuse to become some monsters lunch.\" Rarity then threw her head to the side and closed her eyes in a defiant pose. Unfortunately for her, she had no say in the matter. A door opened and a figure creeped inside, standing tall on two legs. Rarity dared a little peak before her eyes shot open and she gasped. \"YOU?\" She yelled at the leader of the diamond dogs, who captured her almost a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes me.\" He growled as he got closer to the unicorn. Rarity tried to repeat her strategy from last time but before she could start whining he grabbed her muzzle and lifted her up. \"It's time for me to get revenge on you for almost making my ears bleed. I'm gonna do what I should have done back then.\" Swiftly he shoved Rarity's head into his mouth, the mare gagged at the stench and quickly lost consciousness. With his prey knocked out, the diamond dog started to use both his paws to shove the rest of her inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the occasional twitch indicated that the bulge in his neck was still alive. The flanks disappeared into his throat and he slurped up her rear legs before gulping her all the way down to his stomach. The large dog sat down and burped before starting to rub his belly, which was already gurgling with digestive juices, as they broke the mare inside down. \"Finally she's quiet.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with this our next contestant is gobbled, truly the beauty and the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTS: \"Oh dear, Spike is gonna have a fit when he sees this, he really likes her.

The only two ponies that will remain uneaten for now are Applejack and Derpy, meaning Twilight Sparkle is on the menu today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight Sparkle was dumbstruck. \"Wait, I have never even been in a tie before, why did the voters suddenly change their minds.\" Behind her the other two mares were sighing in relieve. \"From a statistical standpoint, such a sudden change of mind is very unlikely, there must be a mistake.\" A door opened and a large pony stepped inside. Twilight saw who it was and gasped, it couldn't be true, this was impossible. \"Nightmare Moon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitch black mare stood there, grinning at her. \"Indeed my little pony.\" Twilight started to stutter, demanding an explanation why the dark mare stood there before her instead of being, well, not existant. \"Little Twilight, I am a dark force that possessed your princess a long time ago, you did not destroy me, merely forced me out of Lunas body and since I have been offered to be your predator for this show, how could I possibly resist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight stared fearfully as the dark mare came closer. She tried to walk away but soon she found herself wrapped in a dark magical aura. Twilight tried to break it but Nightmare Moon was just too strong for her. Nightmare Moon levitated her above her head and craned her neck up while widely opening her mouth. Twilight looked down into the slimy throat and gasped as she was slowly lowered. The mare tried to struggle but the magical grip on her was too strong to allow even a twitch, soon her rear made contact with Nightmare Moons tongue. A bulge formed on the evil mares neck as she lowered more and more of Twilight into her mouth, she gradually started to gulp, sending her down even faster. Even as her belly was already engulfed by the black lips, Twilight still couldn't fight back and so she could seen feel the wet tongue on the back of her neck and with another stronge gulp her head lost contact with the air and Nightmare Moon closed her mouth, slurping up the rest of the purple mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt as if she was being crushed by the tight esophagus as she was squeezed down into the stomach, were her butt was already dipped into a stinging liquid. With another, mighty gulp the rest of her body soon followed, sending her completely into Nightmare Moons gut. The dark alicorn sighed happily as her belly was hanging low and swung as the pony inside struggled, now that the magical grip on her body was gone. The swinging continued for a while before the movements became less and less before ceasing completely, then her belly slowly shrunk down until it was nearly the original size again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like Nightmare Moon got her revenge, thank you for coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ: \"NIGHTMARE MOON? Are you bucking kidding me? This makes absolutely no sense at all why would she still be in Equestria and even then, what was she doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDe: \"Wasn't that the mean mare from the last summer sun celebration? I don't like her, she scares me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, now we go to the last vote, your next vote will decide the winner of this competition.

With all that money, ah can get Granny a new hip.\" Estee walks over to her with a large bag of bits and gives them to Applejack. \"Sorry Derpy, but ah am just so glad ah won.\" The other mare just nodded to her while she waited for her own predator. Suddenly, with a loud flash, a figure appeared in the room. Applejack dropped the bags and stared, wide eyed, at the newcomer. \"DISCORD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right, for the final elimination I got Discord as predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Draconeequs bowed for the camera before flying over to Derpy. \"That's right my tasty little pony, for this contest I decided to randomly drop by to get to eat a pony. It's been so long.\" Applejack meanwhile was wildly gesturing, her eyes twitching. She apparently had some trouble processing what just happened. Derpy was equally confused but also afraid of the chaos spirit. Discord however just picked her up and held her in front of himself. \"I'm not gonna get a treat like you for a long time, I'm gonna enjoy this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord opened his mouth widely and practically threw the grey pegasus mare into his maw. He felt naughty, so he let his tongue explore the mare a little while she laid on top of it, slipping between the folds of her marehood and pressing her wings against the roof of his mouth. Finally he started to gulp her down, sending her down his throat. Applejack watched the squirming bulge from the outside as it slowly travelled down the long body of the Draconeequs. Finally, Derpy came at rest inside his stomach. \"Well, that was certainly delectable, maybe I will keep you in there forever..... nah.\" Gurgling emenated from his gut as the squirms intensified before they died down and his belly shrunk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ: \"First Nightmare Moon, now Discord, this makes absolutely no sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the winner is decided, the contest is over.

The murmured amongst each other before their memories came back. Discord grinned at them. \"Welcome back, I must say it was delightful to see you all get eaten. Sadly, I had to promise to bring you all back but maybe next time I get to see you digested for good.\" While Discord talked, Twilight and the other element bearers gathered and a tiara and five necklaces appeared on them. Discord looked at them and his grin disappeared. \"Oh piss.\"</span></div></div>",

These rituals often require the \"cooperation\" of a sacrifice to be reduced to mere fertilizer as a gift to the earth, while their soul is left for Gaia's mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's actually rather kind, prefering her sacrifices to be willing. But her devotion to Gaia and the spirits overrides that kindness, and she's more than willing to be deceptive or forceful when she makes a sacrifice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's physically fit and thin, showing little sign of her voracious appetite outside of her round soft flanks. Unlike other zebras, she keeps her mane in a long ponytail and wears little jewelry , prefering a strange bracelet that contains Gaia's blessing and her ceremonial robes which conveniently hide a bulging and squirming stomach. Her bracelet allows her to connect to Gaia directly, sending the souls of her sacrifices to the nature spirit. If Gaia chooses, she can use the connection to speak through Erdlied in order to speak to those she deems worthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErdlied also has on other interesting thing about her. Her stripes are long and nearly meet around her stomach, causing an interesting effect when she contains a meal. They also reach up her neck, with small stripes almost invading her face.

Her lips passed over the princess's crotchboobs and ass with ease. The ass was always her favorite part. A couple gulps later, and it was just her hooves that dangled between of the ninja princess's lips. With one last swallow, Buttercup watched the bulge in her throat travel down into her chest in the mirror.

He keeps his mane a lot like Doctor Whooves, but grows his tail out like Rainbow Dash's. He wears a pair of Wonderbolts goggles given to him by his father and an obnoxiously multicolored patchwork overcoat made by his mother. His Cutie Mark is the Japanese kanji for \"spirit\" (which is actually quite often used to express approaching a situation with intensity and excitement.) His eyes are red like Vinyl's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis overall personality is a lot like Pinkie Pie's. He's very bubbly and almost always approaches the situation with excitement. He's pretty childish and even ditzy on occasion. He has a very limited concept of good and evil and often tries to rationalize the antagonist as a result. He tries to solve problems nonviolently, but if you make him mad (which is hard to do, granted), he'll kick your flank into the dirt. As previously expressed, he's very hard to anger, much to the frustration of the ones trying to make him mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn odd quirk about him is he has an odd condition that forces him to eat live ponies. At first he was terrified of this, but his mother solved this problem by putting a spell on the coat she made him that allows him to regenerate ponies he digests if he wants to. He still prefers willing prey, only eating ponies forcibly if he's half starved. He's very caring for the ponies he eats, often giving them whatever they want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's also more than willing to be eaten by other ponies, even lending them his coat so they can regenerate him. He does request his predator sings him to sleep before digestion begins (he panics if they don't). His favorite lullaby is \"Come Little Children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe naturally gravitates towards the children, since they're a lot like him and are usually more willing than adults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe works as a weather pony in Rainbow Dash's patrol. The two are good friends, even though he kind of annoys her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It tasted good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing his bowl he put on his coat and goggles and flew out the door of his cloud home. His patrol wasn't on duty today, so he had the day off.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The princess\u2019s personal royal guards haven\u2019t changed their protocols in thousands of years, and the initiation requirements are just as brutal as they\u2019ve always been. The role is restricted to stallions, who are forced to have their fur bleached at a young age, and drop out of school to focus exclusively on combat training. They were also all geldings, too, as no \u2018intact\u2019 stallion could possibly resist the allure of the princesses. All of this suffering forms an immense legion of hardened soldiers, who are willing to lay down their lives to defeat the many eldritch abominations that attack the princesses on pretty much a monthly basis. The town guards, however, are completely different. Small towns usually only have to deal with petty criminals and the occasional wild monster wandering in, so their levies usually consists of a militia of local volunteers. In fact, many particularly progressive towns have started allowing mares to volunteer for guard duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was the case of the Hollow Shades, a small, quiet town nestled in the forests of Foal Mountain. For a population of around three thousand ponies, there were about 15 guards; the newest of which was an plucky young unicorn named Rattlewatch. Rattlewatch is eager to prove herself worthy of the title, coloring her mane golden blond to fit in with the other guards and working overtime to stop crime in its tracks. Even now, somewhere in town, a criminal flees desperately through the streets, and Rattlewatch chases closely behind. <i><span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cStop running! You\u2019re only making this worse for yourself!\u201d</b></span></i> She calls after the criminal, who was wanted for the heinous crime of petty theft.  Rattlewatch followed closely behind the thief, keeping a slower but steadier pace, waiting for him to run out of energy or run into a dead end. The thrill of outsmarting and chasing down criminals was one of her favorite parts of the job. She had been training her stamina since she was a foal, so no criminal has been able to escape her yet. Eventually, the stallion did indeed run into a dead end, and turned to face his captor. Rattlewatch slowly down with a smirk, refocusing her efforts to her magic, her horn glowing brighter and brighter as she triumphantly approached the criminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\"><i><b>\u201cGet away from me, you crazy-\u201d</b></i></span> he yelled, but was interrupted when your horn filled the alleyway with a massive flash of light, blinding him. When he came to, the thief saw nothing but darkness. He could hardly breathe, and his fur was immediately slick with strange juices, so much so that for a moment he thought he was underwater. He tried to move, only for him to realize his limbs were tightly pressed against his torso. For a few seconds, he was disoriented; it wasn\u2019t until he heard the constant beating of the mare\u2019s heart that he realized what had happened. <span class=\"cteal\"><i><b>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</b></i></span> he cried, as he realized he had been caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rattlewatch shuddered as her belly suddenly expanded to an immense size in an instant. She immediately rolled over onto her back, wrapping her hooves around her new humongous stomach as far as she could, celebrating another successful \u2018arrest\u2019. You see, when Rattlewatch joined the force, she was eager to prove herself worthy of her title, and decided that the best way of doing so would be coming up with an innovative new method of \u2018criminal justice\u2019. She had always been skilled at magic, and while researching, she had discovered spells that allowed her to both control her digestion and expand her stomach to any size. It was from these discoveries that an idea came to her; every time she caught a criminal, she would teleport them directly into her stomach to serve out their sentence. This was more effective than arresting them conventionally, as the only way to prevent themselves from being teleported inside of her belly is if they have some kind of anti-magic shield. Plus, it serves as a great deterrent, as most ponies find her stomach a very <i>unpleasant</i> place to be. <i><b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cSnatching somepony\u2019s purse. That\u2019s petty theft. That\u2019s worth about fifteen hours in my belly,\u201d</span></b></i> she informs her \u2018prisoner\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b><span class=\"cteal\">\u201cUgh! It\u2019s disgusting in here!\u201d</span></b></i> the stallion sealed within her protested, but his voice was almost completely muffled by her thick stomach walls. Rattlewatch couldn\u2019t make out what he was saying, but she could tell that he was whining about something or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t do the crime if you can\u2019t do the time,\u201d</b></span></i> Rattlewatch teased, as she managed to stand up and walk out of the alleyway, her belly now dragging along the ground.  Luckily, her armor didn\u2019t have anything covering the bottom of the torso, which gave her belly room to expand. <span class=\"ctan\"><i><b>\u201cNow quit your complainin\u2019 before I give you an extra two hours for resisting arrest.\u201d</b></i></span> Seeing Rattle patrol around with a huge, wriggling belly was a common sight around town, and most citizens think nothing of it these days, though it does freak out tourists sometimes. When she first joined the levy, she would have to take the rest of the day off after imprisoning a criminal in her belly, as feeling a pony squirming within her made her feel nauseous. These days, however, she was used to it, and just took it as a free internal massage as she went to return the stolen purse to its rightful owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, she looked up at the town\u2019s clock tower and realized her shift was about over. Nightfall was imminent, and thus, it was about time for the batpony guards to begin their patrols, as they were nocturnal. Every guard station in Equestria was nearly the same in layout, differing only by size, as every station is built and maintained by Celestia\u2019s government. But that doesn\u2019t mean the local guards haven\u2019t decorated it to their tastes, of course. The station was warm and homely, kept alight with the same lanterns that dot the rest of the city, even when the forest canopy blots out the sun. <span class=\"cdorange\"><i><b>\u201cRight on time, Rattlewatch,\u201d</b></i></span> a pegasus stallion acknowledged as she walked in, as she enjoyed the soft carpet after having walked along dirt and rocks for most of the day. His name is Carnifex; while this guard station was too small to have a real leader, he was generally considered the de facto general of your little levy. He was no-nonsense and a bit of a stick in the mud, though he was pretty good at his job. <span class=\"cdorange\"><i><b>\u201cAny action?\u201d</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><i><b>\u201cJust one stallion today. Stole a mare\u2019s purse right in front of my eyes. I think he has, uh\u2026 blue fur, if I remember correctly. He is probably in his 20\u2019s or something,\u201d</b></i></span> Rattlewatch said as she passed by. She noticed the bat ponies gearing up for their patrols in the corner, and greeted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><i><b>\u201cIs that all you know about him?\u201d</b></i></span> Carnifex asked, a little annoyed. He liked to keep records of all arrests made by the levy with as much detail as possible. There wasn\u2019t an standard protocol for how arrests should be processed or how punishments should be doled out -- Celestia\u2019s government pretty much allowed every town to do its own thing -- but Carnifex believed that the Hollow Shades levy should value \u2018transparency\u2019. <span class=\"cdorange\"><i><b>\u201cDo you know his name, at least?\u201d</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><i><b>\u201cNope! Sorry, chief, but he\u2019s not really available for questioning...\u201d</b></i></span> Rattlewatch laughed, rubbing her belly with a forehoof. <span class=\"ctan\"><i><b>\u201cHe\u2019s a bit busy right now.\u201d</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><i><b>\u201cRattlewatch!\u201d</b></i></span> Carnifex growled. <span class=\"cdorange\"><i><b>\u201cIt\u2019s fine that you\u2019re taking the initiative to deal with prisoners yourself, but couldn\u2019t you at least identify them first?\u201d</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><i><b>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let him out tomorrow morning. He\u2019ll be ready for questioning then\u2026 if he\u2019s not just fat on my flank by then, of course,\u201d</b></i></span> Rattlewatch smirked. She wasn\u2019t being serious, of course -- she\u2019d never digest a pony for a simple misdemeanor -- she just enjoyed teasing her \u2018commander\u2019. Before he could reply, she slipped away into the sleeping quarters and plopped down onto one of the bunks, her huge belly in the air. The stallion inside of her was still wriggling and protesting, though this only served to comfort Rattle further. While she was used to having ponies in her stomach, it still make her a bit drowsy, similar to a food coma. This has the extra effect of making the sleep she gets while full of a prisoner the best sleep she\u2019s ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, she drifted off into a deep slumber with a smile on her face, ready for the days ahead.</span></div></div>",
