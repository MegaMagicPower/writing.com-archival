You feel excitement mixed with nervous anticipation as you go to the church to go over last-minute preparations. You're happy to see Jackie already there (fortunately she doesn't ascribe to the rule about the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe greets you with a kiss and you respond passionately. \"Hey, tiger, slow down!\" she teases. \"Save some for the honeymoon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull apart and give her a wide grin. Her hair and makeup are done but she's still in her normal clothes. \"You look incredible!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushes and smiles. \"What until you see me in the dress ... and out of it!\" she says with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then takes you by the hand and leads you back to the dressing room. \"Come here Jerry, I have something strange to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk to the back of the church, out of the sanctuary and into one of the rooms in the back. You see clothes, makeup and hair styling stuff strewn across the room. She picks up a glass orb about the size of a softball and holds it up for you to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it seems opaque, but then you think you see different colors swirling around inside. \"Wow, that is strange. What is it?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shrugs. \"Beats me. I found it outside the door this morning. But what's even weirder is the note that was with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" you ask, raising an eyebrow. \"What did it say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe digs in her purse and pulls out a scrap of paper to show you. You take it and read \"This is a gift to increase the bonds of your new marriage. It will help you and your husband better understand one another. Whenever you both hold it and say these words - 'Evella Kordora Nesti' - you will switch with one another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that even mean?\" you ask. \"Is it some kind of joke? Or maybe some 'New Agey' crystal from one of your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" she says. \"It doesn't seem like anything one of my friends would do. And 'Evella Kordora Nesti' - that doesn't even sound like a real language.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie turns as she's speaking, moving to put the orb back down. At that exact moment the door opens and someone comes in, colliding into her. She drops the orb and it shatters - there's a flash of light blinding you momentarily.  When your eyes clear, you see who came in. It was:</span></div></div>",

She and Jackie are staring at each other in shock. \"Mom, Jackie, are you alright?\" you ask as you walk over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey don't answer you at first and just continue to stare at one another. Then Jackie reaches forward to touch your mom's face, running her hand down the cheek as if she can't believe what she's seeing. Your mom does the same, then drops her eyes down to look at herself. Jackie grabs your mom by the hand and pulls her in front of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stand fixed in front of the mirror, their eyes flicking back and forth between their reflections and each other. You begin to feel very concerned. \"What's wrong?\" you ask. You grab Jackie by the shoulders and give her a gentle shake. \"Snap out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie turns to face you while your mom watches, seemingly too stunned to speak. Jackie shakes off her shock and tells you \"Gerald, something very strange has happened. I'm not Jacqueline - I'm your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back, surprised at her words. \"Huh? What? Is this some kind of joke?\" you stutter. She looks at you sadly and says \"No, I'm afraid not. This is all too real.\"  She turns to your mother who looks like she's becoming reoriented. \"Jacqueline? Are you okay dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom gives her a perplexed look. \"Yes, I think so.\" She looks at Jackie and then back down at herself. \"I'm not dreaming, am I? I'm really you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it would appear so,\" Jackie responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls, this has gone far enough,\" you start to say when Jackie interrupts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerry, stop. You should know us better than that. And I've always been proud of your perceptiveness and open mind. Look at each of us closely. Can't you tell we're being truthful?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look into Jackie's beautiful dark brown eyes and something feels a little off. Then you gaze into your mother's sea green eyes and sense something, you're not sure what. She meets your stare and you can see fear, confusion and maybe a hint of panic - but you also see a deep, pure love for you, one that's NOT the love of a mother for her child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie?\" you ask hesitantly. \"Is it really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lip quivers and she throws herself into your arms. \"Oh Gerry, what are we going to do?\" She breaks down in sobs as you hold her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel very strange holding your mother's body this way. You see your fiance's face watching you with sympathy. You start to speak but she shakes her head, indicating that you should attend to the woman in your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes she regains control of herself. Her face is tear-streaked but she seems to be calmer now. She leans into you for comfort and you feel the press of her rather large breasts against you. You have trouble thinking of her as Jacqueline, your bride-to-be, but you try to force your mind around the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that better, dear?\" Jackie asks - that is, to say, your mom in Jackie's body. You don't know if you can keep this straight in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie (in your mom's body) looks at her thoughtfully. \"Yes, I'm okay. It's weird. I'm not that upset at being you. You'd think I should be freaking out. But I actually feel comfortable, like this is my body. My panic attack was because of the wedding. This was supposed to be our special day but now it's ruined. How can we get married now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom responds \"I wondered why I felt so calm about the whole thing. It must be part of this transformation I guess. But ... how could this even happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought occurs to you. \"The orb!\" you say. \"It must have been that gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looks at you and nods in agreement. Your mom looks confused so you explain about the mysterious gift and note. Jackie looks at the floor and says \"I don't know if it's magic or aliens or what, but how can we change back? The orb completely shattered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom senses your and Jackie's impending panic and so takes control. \"Don't worry kids. However it happened, if something could change us once then we'll find something to change us back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer calm, commanding tone and manner reassure you. That more than anything helps convince you that this is your mom and not your fiancee. Your mom always had that ability to take charge of a situation. Her level-head and rational approach to crisis is one of her best qualities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues, \"there's no reason to cancel the wedding. I can fill in for you during the ceremony. No one needs to know. We'd probably end up in front of a psychologist. Even if they believed us, we might be locked up somewhere for study. No, we can just pretend to be each other for now and get through the next few days. Then we'll figure out how to proceed. Agreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jackie look one another in the eyes. \"Yes,\" you say, \"that sounds like the best plan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom says \"We don't have much time before the wedding so we need to get moving. You can help me, Jackie. We're close, so no one will think it strange that the mother-in-law is helping the bride today. I know the ceremony, so I can fake my way through it. And your role is pretty simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have another thought. \"What about the honeymoon? We're supposed to fly out first thing in the morning for two weeks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom thinks for a moment, then says: </span></div></div>",

I have plenty of savings, so buying a ticket and hotel room shouldn't be a problem. Worst case, if she has trouble getting a flight, we might be there a day or two ahead of her. The two weeks for the honeymoon will give us some time to come up with a more long-term plan on how to handle this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom's reasoning appears very sound and so you and Jackie follow her plan. You stay a little longer to discuss how to manage the ceremony but then need to leave as the rest of the wedding party starts to arrive. The bridesmaids start to shuffle you off, so you give Jackie a hug and kiss on the cheek and whisper \"we'll get through this\" to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to meet your groomsmen and get dressed. You keep busy for the next couple hours until the ceremony is about to begin. You take your place at the front of the church and wait nervously. As the wedding begins, one of your groomsmen escorts Jacqueline to her seat near the front. She has composed herself but you can tell that she's on the verge of tears. To all obervers, though, she appears to simply be an emotional mother on her son's wedding day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bridal Chorus begins to play and Jackie's father escorts your mother into the sanctuary. You stare as she walks down the aisle. Jackie's body looks absolutely gorgeous and for a few moments you're able to forget that she's not your actual fiancee. Her normally long brown hair is put up in elegant curls on her head. Her makeup draws you into her large eyes, and her face is like an angels. She takes your hand as the father passes her off and takes his seat. The ceremony begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure how much of it is 'normal' wedding nerves and how much is the unusual circumstance of marrying your mother in your lover's body - but you feel detached throughout the wedding ceremony, as if you're in a dream or trance. You look into the eyes of the beautiful bride beside you and let yourself believe that she IS the woman you love. She squeezes your hand comfortingly and smiles. When the minister finally pronounces \"you may kiss the bride\", you embrace your new wife and give her a deep, passionate kiss. She hesitates for a second, then returns your kiss with apparent fervor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you pull apart and face the audience, you see your mother's tear-streaked face and the reality of what is happening comes back to you. Others watching would assume that it's just a mother crying at such a special moment in her son's life, but you know that her sorrow is over seeing your mother take her place at what should be her wedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your mother walk down the aisle to the applause of your friends and family. They are dismissed to go to the reception while the wedding party remains for pictures. You and your mother manage to make it through the next hour or so, putting on fake and loving smiles for the photographer. Jackie wipes away her tears and reapplies her makeup, appearing once more as the dutiful mother for the wedding pictures. Finally, you're all done and leave for the reception.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the reception you greet the guests, playing the happy groom. You and your mother try to appear appropriately affectionate, holding hands and kissing throughout the afternoon. She assumes Jackie's role just fine and no one seems to suspect anything amiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline herself holds in her emotions and acts like proud mother on her son's wedding day. Any hint of sadness she may show is easily passed off as understandable. After all, mothers often cry at their children's weddings. You don't get any chance to speak to her alone until the dancing starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your mother take the first dance as groom and bride. Once again as you hold your new wife's body close, you find it difficult to remember that it's your mother inside rather than Jackie. She whispers to you as you dance with her head leaning on your shoulder, telling you not to worry and that everything will work out. To meet the crowd's expectations you end the dance with a long, passionate kiss. They applause and you lead her back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it's time for the mother-son dance. You walk over to Jacqueline and take her hand. You see a flurry of emotions cross her face as she comes with you, but she quickly pushes the feelings down and plasters a fake smile on her face. You know this is hard for her, so you put your arm around her as you start to dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have trouble thinking of this woman as your lover, Jackie, rather than your mom. You try to look at her objectively and critically rather than as a son. It's weird to think this way, but you must admit that your mother's body is still rather attractive. While she is a little fleshy and body sags in a few places, she has a nice figure and the dress emphasizes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dress is dark green, ankle-length, and just tight enough to show off her mature curves without being too risque. A conservative slit in the back reveals glimpses of her tan hose as she dances. The v-neck cut emphasives her large breasts but not inappropriately. The top ties around her neck, covered by her long, brown hair hanging in loose curls down her bare back. She has a silver pin in her hair to pull the sides up, drawing attention to her pretty face and neck. Her jewelry is simple - dangling silver earrings and a matching necklace and bracelet, and a couple rings. Her makeup is tasteful and very appropriate for a woman her age.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe begins to break down. She leans into you to hide her sobs and you pull her close. You feel a little uncomfortable with your mom's breasts pressing against you, but you just try to comfort her as you dance. She recovers in a minute and is composed again by the time the dance ends. You both leave the dance floor to another round of applause. You give her a kiss on the cheek and whisper \"remember, I love you. We'll make it through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reception seems to drag on forever. You go through more dances and toasts, and suffer the congratulations of dozens of guests. You and your mother try to avoid drinking too much, but you do get a little tipsy. You have an awkward moment when you lift your mother's dress and take the garter off her leg. The sight and smell of the women you love arouses you, but then you feel guilty at being aroused by your mother (even though she's in another body).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the day winds to an end. You and your mother march to the limo as the guests throw rice and blow bubbles at you. You already have bags packed and loaded in the car and have reservations at hotel near the airport - your flight leaves early the next morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother and you keep up the 'just married' act as you ride. The driver congratulates you and asks some polite questions about your planned honeymoon. When you arrive at the hotel it's clear what the staff expects, so you carry your mom in to the room as if she were your bride. When you finally close the door and are alone, you both sigh in relief. You open the complimentary bottle of champagne and pour two glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother gulps down the entire glass, then motions for a refill. You oblige, and drink your own. You quickly drain most of the bottle - rather surprising, but then again you think you both deserve it after such a trying day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom looks flushed and a little unsteady. She sits on the bed, kicks off her shoes and starts rubbing her feet. \"I can't believe Jackie chose these heels, especially knowing she'd be standing much of the day. And I think maybe I drank the champagne too fast,\" she adds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me,\" you say, sitting down on the bed beside her. She looks at you curiously, then stretches her legs out across your lap. You take a foot in your hands and begin massaging. You look at the woman beside you and see Jaqueline with her wedding dress pulled up, showing much of her legs. The feel of the stockings is silky and smooth, and you let your hands slowly creep up her legs as you massage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lays back on the bed, enjoying the touch of your hands as you move up to her thighs. Her breathing quickens and you can feel the heat of her groin as you go higher and higher. Your own arousal is evident, and you loosen your pants and slide them down. You continue to rub her thighs, then brush up against her crotch. You push your fingers inside her panties and into her vagina while continuing to massage her thigh with your other hand. She bucks in excitement and you stretch forward to kiss her on the lips.  She pulls you down on top of her and pushes her tongue into your mouth. You continue fingering her while she runs her hands down your body and rips off your shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fondle one another more frenetically as your arousal builds. Finally, unable to wait any longer, you pull up the bottom of her dress and yank her panties down. You lower yourself inside her ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You make love several times before finally passing out wrapped in each other's arms. The alarm wakes you at 5:00 am to get ready for your flight. You slowly shake off your stupor to find yourself holding your lovely wife. The feel of her naked body against you causes an instant erection. You give her a gentle kiss and fondle her breast. She purrs in contentment, not quite awake but feeling aroused. You start to push yourself into her again and she arches her back in pleasure, giving a low moan. Blearily she opens her eyes. She takes a few seconds to focus on you, then jerks awake and pulls back. \"Oh my God!\" she yells, sitting back and covering her nudity with the sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop in shock. \"What's wrong Jackie?\" you ask, not yet clear-minded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares as you for a moment, then says \"Gerald, wake up. Remember who I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to focus and gather your thoughts. Then everything comes crashing back. \"Mom?\" you say hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" she says. \"I'm NOT Jackie. I can't believe what we did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay back and try to process what has happened. You had sex with your mother! But she was in Jackie's body... you feel confused. Last night, you drunkenly thought you were with your wife. You intimately know her body, and everything felt right. Now, though, you're not sure what to think. You know you should be guilty and appalled, but she just doesn't feel like your mom. All your senses tell you (and told you last night) that this is Jacqueline, the love of your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at her face to see her struggling with this as well. A look of resolve comes over her and she speak to you gently. \"Gerry, last night was ... well, amazing.

We may have to keep up a pretense for quite awhile. But we can't be together like that again - I'm not actually your wife. You need to look beyond the physical form - look past all this\" - she gestures at her body - \"to see who's really inside. I KNOW how much you love Jacqueline. I've always thought you two were soul mates. What you and Jackie have is too special to give up on. I want you to try to work it out, regardless of what she looks like now. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod slowly, trying to digest all that she's said. She pulls you up off the bed. \"Come on, now, let's get moving. We've got a plane to Hawaii to catch. We can talk more about this later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes you toward the shower and you get in, still feeling rather dazed. The water helps you shake off your groginess and confusion.

It flatters her figure, showing her lovely legs and buxom breasts. You stare in lust for a momement, then realize who this is and shift your gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just spoke with Jackie,\" your mom tells you. \"The earliest flight she could get is tomorrow and it has a couple layovers. So we'll have maybe two days before she joins us. Then we'll all figure out how to move forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dress and gather your bags. As you walk out the door, she gently grabs you. \"Gerry, I know this is very difficult for you, and I'm afraid it won't be any easier for awhile. It will probably not help your confusion but you need to get used to calling me Jackie. And we'll sometimes need to act like 'honeymooners' -but keep in mind who I really am, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in agreement and answer with resignation \"I know, 'Jackie' ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a sad smile and you leave the hotel.</span></div></div>",

Your mom - 'Jackie' - managed to sleep much of the way, but your mind was racing too much for you to relax. You kept looking over at the woman in your wife's body, trying to make sense of it all. And you were worried about how the real Jackie was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set your bags down in the room. Your mom tells you to get some rest - that you look terrible. \"I'll explore the resort and maybe try out the pool,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I'll do that,\" you answer. \"But first I want to call Jackie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom gives you an appraising look. \"I think that's a good idea. I'm sure she could use a reminder that you love her.\" She goes into the bathroom to change into a swimsuit and coverup, obviously not feeling comfortable about changing in front of you. Once she's gone you pull out your cell phone and hit the speed dial for your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Gerry?\" you hear your mother's voice. \"Hey Jackie,\" you say, trying to sound upbeat. \"We're here. It looks nice but I miss you terribly - I can't wait until you get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's silent for a moment, then answers \"I can't wait to see you either. It's been hard. Everyone has been congratulating me and wanting to talk about the wedding. I've just put on a smile and pretended to be a proud mother. But I'm glad I'm leaving - I don't think I could take much more of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you holding up?\" you ask. \"Mom seems to be adapting well enough. I think she'll have some advice for us on how to deal with all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a wistful tone to her voice that you've never heard from your mom. \"Honestly, it's very weird. I'm surprisingly comfortable in her body but still get a shock when I look in the mirror or take a bath. And going through her clothes to pack for the flight - it just drives home that I'm not 'me' anymore. And some of my tastes are different. This morning I found that I like my coffee black for instance. It makes me wonder what else has changed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Jackie,\" you say comfortingly. \"The most important thing hasn't changed - our love for each other. No matter what, you're the woman I want to spend my life with. Never forget that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the phone you can almost pretend that nothing's changed, that she's not in your mother's body. You're not sure how well you'll deal with her in person, but for now you know she needs your reassurances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can almost hear her smile. \"I love you, Gerald Duncan,\" she says warmly. \"You are the best thing in my life and I don't want to lose you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't!\" you say firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chat for awhile longer until your yawning becomes noticeable. \"You sound exhausted!\" she says. \"Get some rest. I should be there sometime the day after tomorrow. Try to relax and have some fun. I'll be there soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pledge your love to each other again and she hangs up. You feel a little better after having spoken to Jackie, so lay down and manage to fall asleep without too much trouble.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two of you do some hiking in the mountains as well. Your mom is an avid hiker and enjoys the benefits of having a younger body. You two maintain a slight pretense, showing affection in public. But the first night your mother moves to a separate room, saying \"Jacqueline can stay with you when she arrives. I think it would be best for us to not sleep in the same bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie gets to the hotel in the evening of the third day. You meet her in the lobby and help her to the room. You greet her with a hug and modest kiss, not wanting to raise two many questions from the staff and guests who already know you as a honeymooner. Jackie is dressed in your mom's capris and blouse. With her casual clothes and makeup, you'd think this was your mother. It's hard for you to think of her as your wife but you try to ignore what your senses tell you and see the person inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the room she seems relieved to be alone with you. \"Oh Gerry, I've missed you so much,\" she says. She embraces you, giving a passionate kiss. At first you hesitate, feeling very uncomfortable kissing your mother this way. But you hold to your pledge to try to make this work and return the kiss. After a few minutes she lets you go and moves to unpack. She calmly tells you about her last few days and you are suprised. You're not sure what you expected - a breakdown, maybe? - but she is fairly calm and collected. She notes your curiosity and tries to explain. \"I think it's a couple different things. First, however the orb worked, I believe it helps us adjust to the transformation. I can't really explain it but I'm as comfortable in your mother's body as I was in my own. Second, I WAS upset. I cried all night after the wedding, knowing that it should be ME with you. But eventually I came to grips with the situation. I decided that if I'd been mangled in a wreck or somehow crippled, I'd still be okay as long as I had you. And in most ways this isn't nearly that bad. I'm still healthy and fairly attractive; I've just lost 25 years of life. While that's little depressing, it's not that bad - after all, there are no guarantees in life, so who knows how long I'd live. Heck, I could still outlive you - wom3n do have longer lifespans.\" She actually laughs a little at that and you give her a smile in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues \"The hardest part is our marriage. I don't know how exactly we'll work things. The lying and secrecy will be tiresome. But as long as we're together, I'll be happy.\"  She has a hopeful and pleading look in her eyes. You know that this is the moment of decision. You have pledged to do anything for Jacqueline, to spend the rest of your lives together. You steel yourself, lean in and give her a long, deep kiss. \"I love you, Jaqueline Duncan, no matter what you look like. I promised to be with you, before the wedding ceremony. And I aim to hold to that. Somehow we'll make this work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs in relief and hugs you. You sit down beside her and just hold each other for awhile. Then Jackie starts kissing you again. Her breathing becomes rapid and her movements more frantic, as if she feels equal parts desire and desperation. She puts your hand on her breast and massages herself with it. You feel some arousal but are also uncomfortable, having trouble getting past the idea of feeling up your own mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie notices your discomfort and stops. \"This isn't working, is it?\" she asks.  You shake your head. She bites her lip. \"I've got an idea.\"</span></div></div>",

You try to examine her critically, ignoring that it's the body of the woman who gave birth to you and raised you for the last 28 years. Objectively, you think, she IS very attractive - she reminds you a little of Madeleine Stowe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe interrupts your musing by calling out \"Care to join me in a bath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still feel uncomfortable at the idea of such intimacy with your mother - even knowing that she's actually your wife - but you really want to make this work. \"Sure!\" you answer, trying to fake your enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe runs some bathwater while you lie in bed, wondering what's going to happen. You're not sure how to deal with all this but you resolve to make the best of things. After a few minutes Jackie says that the tub is ready. You get up and go to join her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step into the tub, looking at Jackie in appreciation while simultaneously feeling that you should avert your eyes. Unlike last night you can't ignore the physical changes now. You see your mother's form stretched out in the tub, her breasts poking above the water like mountains rising from the see. Her pale skin is so different from Jackie's, showing some spots and wrinkles from aging. But she is still sexy in a mature way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit in the water and Jackie puts her legs across you. You close your eyes and imagine that everything is normal, with you and your wife enjoying a nice bath together. You gently stroke her legs and she lays back, relaxed. You feel her toes begin to play with your penis and you harden at her touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh,\" she says, \"looks like your starting to wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of your mother's voice almost dampens your ardor, but Jackie continues to massage you and the physical sensation keeps you excited.

And you...\" she points to Jackie \"... are Katherine Duncan.

You see she's wearing Jackie's wedding ring. \"Unfortunately you can't wear this now, Jackie - or, I should say, Katie. Even if my body could wear a ring this small, it would raise some questions. But I do have an idea for a substitute,\" she says. \"Did you bring my wedding ring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie answers \"Yes, I wore your jewelry.\" She walks over to the dresser and pulls out your mother's wedding band. It's something of a family heirloom, having been your grandmother's.

You do as she says.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, repeat after me. 'With this ring, I wed thee',\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say the words. Then she has Jackie take your ring and do the same. \"Now, 'Katie', this is YOUR wedding ring, given to you by Gerry. Let it be a symbol of your love and commitment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie nods with tears in her eyes and says \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one will wonder at you wearing that ring,\" you mom adds. \"Besides, it's much more expensive than this one,\" she jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle at her attempt to bring some levity to the situation.

He gets her a drink from the bar and they sit by the water, laughing and smiling. You watch the flirty way she touches his arm and feel a jealous rage come over you. For a moment you forget about your mother and see only your new wife chatting up another man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up from your lounge chair and start to march over to them, ready to punch the guy and scream at your wife. Just as you start to stalk over to them, you feel a light touch on your hand. You look down to see your mother. She gives you a sad look as she gently pulls you back down into your chair. You resist for a second but then see her eyes beginning to tear. Instantly you feel like jackass as you remember exactly what has happened and who each of these women are. You sit down and whisper to her \"I'm sorry, Jackie. I...I just forgot for a second. I couldn't help it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffles. \"It's okay, Gerry, really. I understand. It's hard for both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your arm around her and try to comfort her. \"Shh, it will be alright darling, you'll see,\" you say. But your words sound hollow in your ears. How can this be okay? What will you do when you get back home?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take her back to the room, thinking that treating her like your wife might reassure her. But Jackie softly rebuffs your advances. \"Just hold me, Gerry,\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you take her in your arms and hold her as she cries. Some time passes and you think she may have dozed off - so you relax and let yourself go to sleep as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken a few hours later to feel her stirring in your arms. She opens her eyes and lifts her head to meet your gaze. You are worried for a moment, but then she gives you a warm smile. \"Thanks honey. I needed that. Sometimes a good cry helps, especially when there's nothing else you can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and return her smile, then lower your head to give her a kiss. You still feel somewhat uncomfortable, knowing that your kissing your mother's lips. But you close and eyes and pretend that it's Jackie in body as well as spirit, and you soon push past your reluctance. Your kissing becomes more and more passionate as your hands roam over each other's bodies. You undress each other, continuing to kiss and fondle, and you quickly move past foreplay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you push yourself into her, the sound of your mother's voice gasping in pleasure keeps pulling you out of the moment. Still, Jackie knows exactly how to keep you aroused, and you enjoy a long session of lovemaking. By the time you're finished, you feel much more at ease - but you wonder to yourself what will happen if they ever switch back. The way things are going, you're becoming more and more comfortable having sex with Jackie in your mom's body. But you don't exactly feel like you're with Jackie. It's odd. Your feelings of affection and respect for your mother are becoming confused and mixed with your passion and love for Jackie, forging your relationship into something new and different. You aren't sure what you think - or should think - about this, but you know your life is going to be very different now, regardless of what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You go to the spa and take a few quiet walks on the beach, but much of the time you stay in your suite. By the end of the honeymoon, you've worked past most of the physical hangups you have with your wife's new body. At the same time, however, you don't exactly think of her as \"Jackie\" anymore. Your confusion is compounded by your mom's insistence that you all start referring to each other by the name of the body rather than who is inside it. Calling Jackie \"Katherine\" - or even worse, \"Mom\" - makes it hard to be romantic, but you persevere and feel like you're making real progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still feel pangs of lust (and love) when you look at Jackie's body, but you're now easily able to push those feelings aside. You don't want to confuse your feelings toward the real Jackie any more than they already are - and you don't want to cause her more distress. You mother eases the situation by letting you sit with Jackie in first class while she takes the seat in coach. You and Jackie snuggle on the flight, holding hands and kissing. You seize this last opportunity to publicly express your true relationship here where you're anonymous. Once you're back home you know that you'll all have to hide the truth, with Jackie and your mother pretending to be each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to get your luggage after the flight lands. While you wait, your mom pulls you and Jackie aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For tonight we can go home together. No one expects me back until tomorrow, so that will give us a little more time to discuss our plans.\"  She looks at Jackie. \"But tomorrow you'll have to go back to my house. You and Gerry can 'rendezvous' as often as you want, but a mother moving in with newlyweds would be rather strange. I don't think we could really explain it to our family &amp; friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie nods in agreement. \"But we have arrange something long-term! I want to be with Gerry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I want to be with you,\" you add, putting your arm around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom looks at the two of you, her eyes glistening with emotion. \"We'll work it out, I promise.

I'm the first and most important woman in your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tilts her head as if examining you. \"You look so tense.

I'l make you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, you follow her directions. Your mother was a licensed physical therapist and masseuse for many years. She has given you massages before, although it has been awhile. Jackie had expressed an interest in massage therapy sometime back and your mother has been teaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretch out on your stomach and feel your mother's warm hands on your shoulders and back. Ironically it seems to work - she soon has you much more relaxed. She puts on some light music while she works. You focus on the soothing pressure of her hands and fingers and let your mind wander, trying to escape the pressure of this strange situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 30 minutes or so you hear your mom's voice say \"Okay dear, now turn over. It's time to do the front.\"  You roll over and pull the towel over your underwear. She says \"Just pull them off, Gerry. You can cover up with the towel\", so you slip them off, still feeling relaxed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything goes so fast that it\u2019s easy to forget that the woman sitting next to you is not actually your wife.  And at the end of the night, you jump into the limo back to the hotel with Maggie, and she puts her head on your shoulder.  You arrive at the hotel room.

It\u2026 just doesn\u2019t feel right.  Maggie\u2019s lips are too thin, and her cheeks too big.  But you try to just let it all go and kiss your wife.  You stroke her shoulder as she takes off your pajama pants.  You kiss her again and again, still doesn\u2019t feel right, and before you know it you are looking at Maggie\u2019s naked body above you.  All of the grace Jackie normally moves with, normally approaches with, is replaced by Maggie\u2019s awkward movements.  But you kiss her anyway, and stroke her, and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just peters out.  You\u2019re just not into it.  You apologize and blame the crazy day.  You put back on your pajama pants and shirt, and she puts back on her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she says, sleepily.  Before long, Jackie is asleep, snoring a little bit, and you are staring at the ceiling, head still spinning from the wine and the crazy day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you fall asleep, or go into the outer room?</span></div></div>",

Maggie is laying on the couch outside, reading.  She looks absolutely gorgeous.  Jackie\u2019s silky hair flows over her shoulders, which hold up Jackie\u2019s skimpiest neglig\u00e9e.  The top of her breasts show on the neckline, and it goes barely beyond her butt, showing her long, smooth legs.  You stare, transfixed for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie looks up and blushes.  \u201cSorry, this was all that was in Jackie\u2019s bag.  It must look ridiculous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head.  \u201cNo, you look, wow.\u201d  You both stay still for a second, no one talking.  You finally shake yourself out of it.  \u201cSorry, I forgot you were out here.  Jackie is asleep, so I was just going to read.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie pulls Jackie\u2019s legs in and sits up.  \u201cPlease!  Sit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down and open your book.  Both you and Maggie look intensely at your books, pretending to read.  You look over at her quickly, and smile sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie looks into your eyes for a second.  \u201cLook, Gerry, I know this must be really weird for you.  I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s really weird for me, too.  I never thought\u2026 I never thought I would screw up your wedding by coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over and see tears welling in Jackie\u2019s beautiful eyes.  There is nothing you hate seeing more.  You lean in and pull her to your chest.  \u201cHey\u2026 no, you have been amazing today.  Thank you for everything.\u201d  You sit there for a minute, stroking Jackie\u2019s hair, and feeling her body curved up against you.  You close your eyes and your whole mind goes blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to stroke her shoulder, and she begins to stroke your hair.  She pushes up against your leg, and you can feel her entire body, and both of your hearts racing.  Your hand slides down her shoulder to Jackie\u2019s perfect breasts, covered in silk.  She slides her delicate hand up your shirt and against your chest.  Together you slowly pull off your shirt.  You caress her butt and pull off her panties.  She strokes your stomach and pulls off your pants and your boxers.  She slides on top of you, and you slide into her.  You run your hands over Jackie\u2019s whole body.  Her delicate face and neck, her beautiful breasts, her tight stomach, her small, round butt.  It seems like it lasts forever, and you struggle to keep silent.  You both burst in a moment of pure ecstasy.  And she slides off of you and slips next to you, stroking your chest and barely able to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, Jackie,\u201d you whisper, not thinking about anything but how perfect she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, Gerry,\u201d she answers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you...</span></div></div>",

She seemed nice enough\u2026 but she was nowhere near as attractive as Jackie. Unlike Jackie, who was a tall blonde with generous sized breasts; Olivia was short and somewhat pudgy woman of Mediterranean decent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly on in your relationship with Jackie, it was clear that Olivia had an unhealthy obsession with you. Despite all of this, Jackie still kept a close relationship with Olivia through the rest of you college days. Jackie always rationalized to you that either Olivia was just messing with you or that those thoughts were just in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter college, Jackie and Olivia parted ways as both of them got jobs at different companies as human resource specialists. Luckily you didn\u2019t have to see Olivia very often. But you suspected that they still stayed in touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bright light died down, your eyes came back into focus to see Olivia and Jackie standing in front of each other looking dazed and disoriented. You rushed to your soon to be wife\u2019s side and grab her hand and ask \u201cAre you alright, Jackie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie blinked a few times and seemed to be confused. She pulled her hand out of yours and inspected her splayed hands in front of herself.<br>\r\nOlivia meanwhile composed herself and said \u201cGer, why am I in Olivia\u2019s body?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your head towards Olivia, you saw the woman that you didn\u2019t really care for feeling up her face before examining her bulging gut.<br>\r\nForming a serious look on your face, you told whom you thought was Olivia \u201cOlivia, this is not time for games. Today is Jackie\u2019s and my wedding day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you were able to ask Olivia to leave, Jackie had finished composing herself and spoke. \u201cGerry, she is telling the truth. Somehow Jackie and I switched bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t believe it. It had to be real though. Jackie would never try something like this on a day as big as this. Looking towards Jackie-in-Olivia\u2019s body you asked \u201cHow do we fix this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie scrunched up her face in displeasure as she looked down past the purple dress she was now wearing and to the orb that was on the floor. \u201cThe orb is completely broken\u2026\u201d she trailed off as she looked up at Olivia in her body who did a great job at hiding any excitement in her new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your mismatched bride spent a few minutes picking up pieces of the orb and attempted to put it back together while Olivia just stood there quietly and watched. \u201cIt\u2019s no use Ger. The ceremony is supposed to start in an hour and this thing looks done.\u201d Jackie told you as she kneeled on the floor with two broken pieces of the orb in each hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning towards Olivia-in-Jackie\u2019s body you asked \u201cWhat are you even doing here? This is our dressing room.\u201d<br>\r\nOlivia looked taken aback in Jackie\u2019s beautiful form. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Gerry, I didn\u2019t know you would be here. I just stopped by to see if Jackie needed any help getting ready for her big day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t buy it. But, before you could say anything, Jackie spoke up \u201cIt isn\u2019t her fault Ger. She couldn\u2019t have known about that weird orb someone gave us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie sighed as she looked over her now fleshy shoulder and caught a glimpse of her new reflection. She was now barely five feet tall with a curvy and heavyset body. Her tanned skin and black hair was almost the polar opposite of what she had known for whole life. She wore a purple dress that looked like it was trying to hard to flatter her now pudgy form. Jackie continued to look at the mirror as she prodded the bulging gut she now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Olivia stared and silently admired you while your attention was on your poor fianc\u00e9. Olivia got both your attentions by asking \u201cSo what are we going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie spoke up before you. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any choice. Olivia will have to be me for the wedding and we\u2019ll figure out something after.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? We can postpone the wedding\u2026\u201d you asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Everybody is already here and it took forever to plan. Everything is set, so Olivia won\u2019t have to do much other than say \u201cI do\u201d when the time comes.\u201d Jackie explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia smiled up at you with her now blue eyes as she wrapped one of her arms around your waist. Jackie was right you thought. There wasn\u2019t much you could do without stopping the wedding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGerald, I need you to step outside while I get Olivia ready.\u201d Jackie told you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jackie emerged first, wearing Olivia\u2019s purple dress and signaled to you that everything was okay. She sat down on your side of the pews near the front, Still distracted with watching Jackie pretend to be a guest at her own wedding, you were brought back to attention as the music starting playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the bridesmaids and groomsmen went down the aisle, Olivia in Jackie's body appeared at the end of the aisle. She looked absolutely gorgeous. For a brief moment, you forgot that the doppelganger wasn't actually your soon to be wife. The dress she wore looked amazing. It hugged and flattered her hips while edging pushed up her breasts. As she walked down the aisle, you could see how she swayed her hips side to side as she got closer to you. When she finally reached the front, you were speechless. You get a hold of yourself as you saw the real Jackie behind her begin crying. Olivia hugged the strangers whom everyone thought were her parents and turn towards you. You could see Olivia's subtle smile form on Jackie\u2019s gorgeous face. You weren't sure if you could go through with this. Olivia nudged you to turn towards the front, and the ceremony began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter months of meticulous planning from Jackie, you knew exactly how the ceremony was supposed to go. You managed to muddle your way through it while being extremely distracted. When it had come time for you to give your vows, you stuttered a few times as you repeated the minister\u2019s words. To everyone there, people probably figured it was the usual wedding jitters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when the minister finally said \u201c...I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride.\u201d you hesitated for a  second. Quickly looking over towards Jackie, you saw her face\u2026 Olivia\u2019s face looking devastated. Olivia took the initiative as she grabbed and pulled you towards her. She planted a passionate kiss that was completely different than how Jackie had ever kissed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could dwell on your situation, everybody got up and swept both you and Olivia down the aisle towards the door. As you and your 'wife' headed outside towards the waiting limo to take you to your reception. You looked for Jackie-in-Olivia...</span></div></div>",

Olivia didn't say much as she spent most of the time examining her form while smiling and periodically stealing glances at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the reception, Jackie grabbed your arm in the hall and pulled you into a side room where you wouldn\u2019t be overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank goodness everything is going okay Gerry. You and Olivia pulled it off perfectly. I don\u2019t think anyone thought something was off. It\u2019s kind of liked watching my own wedding from someone else\u2019s point of view.\u201d Jackie told you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod with a slightly bewildered expression. You could tell that Jackie was just trying to put up a strong front. looking at her, you couldn't help but notice the slight double-chin Jackie now had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie lowered her voice and smirked mischievously. \u201cOlivia took time off of work. I\u2019ll get a room in the same hotel and find a way to sneak into the wedding suite tonight. I\u2019m sure Olivia will understand if we celebrate our wedding night, even if I\u2019m still in her body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d you responded faintly. You were not sure how that would go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, we need to get back to the reception to keep up appearances. Once we get to tonight, can and try to figure this all out. I got all the pieces of the orb in her purse\u201d Jackie motioned to you as she patted the bag hung over her shoulder. As she was leaning up to kiss you, she stopped and kissed your cheek instead. She sighed before saying \u201cWouldn\u2019t want anyone to see the groom kissing his wife's friend at his wedding reception.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jackie stepped back inside to join the reception. After chatting with some of your guests, you spotted Olivia next to Jackie's parents. She looked radiant in Jackie\u2019s wedding dress. As you walked up, she spotted you and smiled before stroking your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the reception goes on without incident. You danced with Olivia while trying to avoid eye contact with Jackie while she looked on. Although she gave off a good appearance, you knew that she was quite hurt. While the toasts you received from your family and friends were sweet and heartfelt, you barely paid them any attention. With the end of the reception, you had spoken to a whirlwind of people from both your life and Jackie\u2019s. Every time you hear glasses tinkling you kiss your wife\u2026 er, Olivia while the crowd applauded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, the afternoon went by so fast that it had become easy to briefly forget that the woman sitting next to you was not actually your wife. At least until you kissed her. At the end of the reception, you and Olivia got back into the limo with Jackie. You could tell some people thought it was weird how the bride's college friend followed them to their honeymoon. As the three of you got away from the crowd and were alone once again, Jackie puts her head on your shoulder while Olivia starred daggers at the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you arrived at the hotel...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you arrive at the hotel room. You quickly take a shower. Although you didn't feel particularly dirty, you were not really in the mood for sex with Olivia or Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you stepped out of the bathroom, you saw Olivia\u2026 or rather Jackie-in-Olivia's body standing in her underwear with a towel in her arm. \u201cMy turn!\u201d she said playfully. She moved up to you and wrapped her hands around your waist as she stood on her toes to give you a quick peck on the lips before heading into the bathroom behind you. With the door closed, you heard Jackie turn on the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a knock at the door. You went to see who it was and come face to face with Olivia\u2019s cheeky smile. \u201cHey Olivia.\u201d you said with relief as Olivia slipped inside your suite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jackie was in the shower, Olivia has changed back into the more casual clothes Jackie had worn earlier before the wedding. Even without the fancy dress and all the makeup, she still looked amazing. \"So what are you doing here Olivia?\" you uncomfortably asked. Olivia gave off her mischievous smile with Jackie's face and told you \"I was looking to spend time with MY handsome husband\" as she cornered you towards the bed. Running out of room, you fell onto the bed with Olivia standing over you in Jackie's beautiful body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body betrayed you as you became quickly aroused. Olivia noticed the bulge in your boxers. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think I would miss our wedding night, did you?\u201d Olivia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before anything could happen, Jackie emerged from the bathroom in a towel. \u201cHey Olivia, do you mind if Gerry and I have some time alone? Despite all that happened today, I want to at least be able to have my wedding night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jackie was still somewhat dripping from the shower, Olivia looked a little disappointed. \u201cNot a problem Jackie\" she said. \"I just came by to get some clothes. None of mine fit me anymore.\u201d Even though Jackie didn't notice, you could tell Olivia sounded disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe green bag over there has all my clothes.\u201d Jackie told her. Olivia grabbed the bag and headed back out of the suite, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie pulled out a bottle of champagne and a couple glasses from the counter. \u201cFinally rid of everyone. Now, why don\u2019t we celebrate a little bit handsome?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie let the towel fall to the floor, revealing Olivia's form in its glory. Handing you a glass, she sat down on the bed next to you and commented about how stressful the day had been. You kept getting distracted as your eyes couldn't help but notice the naked form your wife now wore. Despite being a larger framed woman, Olivia had small breasts. Though her dark nipples were twice the size of Jackie's. You kept returning your attention back to your new wife as she kept asking how you felt. Jackie clearly saw that her nudity was distracting you. Her black hair was still frizzy since she didn't brush it before it dried while her brown doe eyes stared at your erection. Although she wasn't her normal beautiful self, you knew that inside this woman was still your wife. You smiled, and crawled all the way onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her glass, Jackie crawled on the bed up to you. Her chubby form wasn't particularly graceful or erotic to you. While Olivia took some care of her body, the black hairy bush Jackie sported wasn't very inviting. Nor were the meaty thighs and large jiggly ass. Jackie climbed on top of you and began stroking your chest. She smiled, and leaned in for a kiss. Closing your eyes, you felt the familiar passionate kiss that you were used to getting from Jackie. However, her new lips were too thin to feel exactly the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes, you noticed how her cheeks were too big. You tried to push all of these things aside and told yourself  to just let it all go while you kissed your 'wife'. As you stroked her shoulder, you could feel the fat adorned her arm. She took off your boxers and kissed you again... and again. Even though it didn't feel right, your body betrayed you. Before you knew it you were looking at Olivia\u2019s naked body above you. All of the grace Jackie normally moved with... had been replaced by Olivia\u2019s jiggly movements. Nothing on Olivia was firm. But you still had sex anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex hadn't been that bad. Much to your surprise, Jackie's new body was quite multi-orgasmic. Once you were done, you were quite tired and decided to pass out. \u201cThat was amazing. Definitely the best sex I've ever had\u201d she told you as she rolled off of you. Climbing out of bed, you dozed off while Jackie presumably went into the bathroom. Before long, you felt Jackie climb back into bed with you and cuddle up against your body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She felt there was only one thing to do. She grabbed Gerry's head and kissed him on his lips. Gerry wanted to push Michelle's body away when suddenly he realized she was kissing just like Jackie. There was no way that was possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jackie stepped back Gerry looked at her. \"Jackie, it is you.\" He said realizing this was his to be wife. He grabbed Jackie tightly as the two held each other tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you realized it, you fool.\" Jackie pouted. \"But wow, this is so weird.\" Jackie walked over to the mirror where she was standing just a few minutes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though a different woman was standing in front of it. A Spanish attractive woman. Long dark hair tied in a bun. Dark brown eyes. A slightly weathered face showing off some wrinkles. And instead of a wedding dress she was standing there inside a white business suit with a red shirt, showing off a hint of cleavage and on her feet a pair of high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me. So how do we undo this thing?\" Gerry asked unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it all happened with that orb broke.\" Gerry pointed out the smashed up orb lying in pieces on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's resemble it, you know, see if it works that way.\" Jackie suggested.

You had no idea what that bright flash of light was, but it seemed to have startled Jackie. You grabbed her hand and pulled her towards you before asking \u201cAre you alright, Jackie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie blinked a few times while looking confused. She looked down at her wedding dress she wore before inspecting her hands. \u201cWhat happened to me? Why am I white?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile your boss peered intensely between Jackie and herself. \u201cOh my god. Why am I in your boss's body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scrunched up your face in frustration. \u201cMs. Jackson, I don't know what you're trying to pull at my wedding. But it isn't funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie responded. \u201cDuncan! I don't know what you did to me, but if you don't fix it pronto, I'm going to have you fired.\u201d She looked over towards your boss who seemed to be freaking out, then down at her own body like she was seeing it for the first time. You didn't know what got into the both of them, but they were acting weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look plaintively at Shanice-in-Jackie\u2019s-body. \u201cThis isn't funny. We're about to get married in a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShanice turned Jackie\u2019s face into a scowl. \u201cI would never marry one of my employees. Do you know how fast I would lose my job!? I've worked too hard to get where I'm at!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb! It had to have been the orb that did this.\" Jackie-in-Shanice said as she searched for the orb on the floor. She spotted it and picked up what was left of it. \"It's broken...\" she mumbled as she looked like she was about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! what's going on?\" you asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't undo this right now and the wedding is going to start soon. I have to get dressed\u2026\u201d Jackie trailed off and looked over at Shanice in her body. Shanice's blue eyes went wide. Jackie beamed at her old body and suddenly demanded \u201cWait. Why were you even over here in the first place? This was our wedding prep room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShanice was taken aback in Jackie\u2019s blonde curls. \u201cWhat am I doing here? I needed to find somewhere private so I could call the office! What are you doing with some freaky body switching orb at your own wedding!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump in, \u201cIt wasn't her fault\u2026 it was an anonymous gift that was just given to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie sighed in frustration. She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror; Her skin was chocolate brown and she looked thicker and heavier than what she was used to. The white zebra striped dress she wore looked tacky. Especially with the gaudy hoop earrings and the tribal looking necklace that rested above her now gigantic breasts. \u201cIt's too late to stop the wedding now. We have to just try to get through today and hope that we can find a way to undo this later. Sharon, you shouldn\u2019t have to do much \u2013 everything should already be set. Just pretend to be me\u2026 and try to not screw this up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShanice looked irritated. \"Who the hell is Sharon!? First of all, my name is Shanice. Second, I'm not marrying Duncan. He's not my type.\" she said as she folded her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also objected. \u201cHoney, I think switching bodies with my boss is a good enough reason to postpone the wedding. We should...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie cut you off. \"Jerry, all our friends and family are here. Do you honestly believe telling them that the wedding is cancelled because of body swapping? They will think we're crazy. Everything has to look normal...\" she said as she batted her now big brown eyes at you. She came up to you and wrapped her fleshier, chocolate colored arms around your neck and kissed you intensely. It felt weird kissing your boss like this, so you closed your eyes and just went with it. It was still the woman you loved after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShanice pulled Jackie off of you. \"Girl, get my lips off of him. If this wedding is about to start and I need to pretend to be you, you need to get me ready.\" Jackie swept her out of the room and lead Shanice to the bridal room to get ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat for a bit and stared at the broken orb on the table that caused all of this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ceremony had just started and you stood at the front of the church nervously waiting for what was about to happen. You spotted Jackie in your boss\u2019s body take a seat on your side of the pews, looking somewhat distracted. You wanted call all of this off and walk over to her and comfort her. But the music had already started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the parade of bridesmaids, Jackie... your boss in her body appeared at the end of the aisle. She is absolutely gorgeous. Her dress slinks in right way as it hugged her hips and held up her breasts. She femininely swayed side to side as she walked down the aisle with her Jackie's father. When she finally reached the base of the alter, you were frozen and speechless. You get managed to get a hold of yourself enough to shake her father's hand before turning to her. For a brief moment, your boss Shanice, wore Jackie's body well.  So well that you weren't sure if they had found a way to switch back, but at a closer look, you could see your boss's subtle facial expressions on Jackie\u2019s beautiful face\u2026 and you didn\u2019t know how to react. Normally when she made these kind of faces at work, it was because something bad was about to happen. Frozen and unsure what to do, she nudged you toward the alter where the priest was waiting so the ceremony could begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, because of months of planning, you knew the ceremony inside and out. You were able to muddle your way through it while being distracted. When it came time for you both to say your vows, you stuttered a bit while trying to repeat the priest\u2019s words. You could hear a few people in the audience chuckle. \"If only they knew...\" you thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you repeated your vows, the priest finally said \u201cI now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride.\u201d You hesitated for a second. Even though the woman in front of you looked like your Jackie, you knew inside it was really your boss. Shanice saw your hesitation and ended up kissed you. Everyone cheered and applauded as they watched the newlyweds kiss for the first time as husband and wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShanice looked like she was kissing you passionately, but in fact felt nothing like how Jackie kissed you. You didn't have time to dwell on it as friends and family members swept down the aisle and ushered you and \"Jackie\" into a limo that was heading to the your reception. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your boss sat awkwardly in the limo in silence. Eventually, Shanice broke the silence and asked \"Duncan... Gerald, did I play the part well enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\" you answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to your destination, you stepped out of the limo and made your way inside to greet everyone. For a few minutes, everything felt somewhat normal again when suddenly the real Jackie pulled you aside to talk in private. Jackie lead you out onto a balcony where you could talk in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank goodness the ceremony is over Gerry. You and Shanice did a good job acting. I know it had to be hard pretending to marry someone else that looks like me. I personally thought it was kinda of neat being able to watch my own wedding. I got to enjoy seeing all our hard work and planning come together.\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod but felt slightly bewildered as you watched what looked like your boss act so out of character. You can\u2019t help notice the facial features your boss\u2026 or rather Jackie has. Her eyes looked much whiter than normal as they contrasted with her chocolate colored skin, her nose was much wider and her lips were fuller. When she smiled, you could see a gap between her two front teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looked around to make sure nobody was looking before lowering her voice and smirking mischievously. \u201cShanice and I managed to fake a family emergency to get her some time off from work. I also managed to book another room in the same hotel we're staying in so we can still have our honeymoon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoneymoon? What about getting back into your real body?\u201d you asked. You weren't sure why Jackie didn't seem too concerned about finding a way to change back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll have plenty of time to figure that out. I'm not about to let this ruin our honeymoon\u201d Jackie said as she leaned in to kiss you. Right as she\u2019s about to kiss your lips, she turned and gave you a peck your cheek instead. Sighing in disappointment, she explained \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want anyone seeing the groom making out with his boss, would we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie turned around and left you alone on the balcony. After a moment, you stepped back inside to rejoin the reception. Shanice looked beautiful in Jackie\u2019s wedding dress. She was doing a good job at pretending to be Jackie. As you walked up, she smiled and took your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the reception goes on without any issues. You danced with Shanice but avoided eye contact with her. Periodically, you looked around for Jackie but couldn't spot her. Your family and friends were sweet and heartfelt as they toasted to you and your new \"wife\". You mingled with a whirlwind of people from your life and Jackie\u2019s and every time you heard glasses tinkling you were forced to kiss Shanice to appease the crowd. The reception dragged on as you pretended to be happy with a woman who sat pretended to be your wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the night, you and Shanice eagerly jumped into the limo. People probably thought that you two were probably eager to consummate your marriage, but you simply wanted to get away from them and cut the charade. Shanice already changed into a simpler dress and the two of you headed headed to the airport. You could tell she wasn't as thrilled about all of this as you, but  the two of you really couldn't talk about it in private as you barely had enough time to make it through security and board the plane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you settled into your larger, first class seats, you both had some champagne. Shanice seemed to loosen up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cant believe I got married... to a younger, white dude.\" Shanice said with a bit of a slur in Jackie's voice. You weren't sure why, but it seemed like Shanice was also getting more and more comfortable in her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be taking this well Ms. Jackson.\" you said in the same tone you normally would have at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and giggled in like she normally would have in the office. This was supposed to be one of the best days in your life and now you've technically just married your boss. She may look like Jackie, but her mannerisms and the way she carries herself is still Shanice Jackson. She's literally a middle aged black woman that had little in common with you. As you thought about your current situation more and more, a hand reached over onto your leg and startled you. As you looked over, Shanice's dainty hand met was resting on your thigh as the cabin lights went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Duncan... I mean Gerald, you're kind cute for a white guy.\" Shanice said before giggling. This was a totally different side of your boss that you were seeing. You weren't sure if it was the alcohol or another effect of that orb. But you were positive that after today, you were going to have the worst case of blue balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To compensate for the divorce, Terri put all her effort into bonding with Jackie and her sister, Judy, who was only seven at the time. They all grew very close especially since Terri and Jackie were almost mirror images of each other and they still are. Terri has the figure of a twenty-seven year old with only a slight indication of age in her face and hands only noticeable up close and only when she doesn't use face and hand lotion. This allows Terri to fit in wherever they go or whatever they do together, and they do a lot together. Jackie considers her as much a sister as mother, and many believe Terri is Jackie's sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou first met Jackie and Terri at the same time and place and even flirted a bit with Terri until you completely fell under Jackie's spell. Terri and you get along fabulously, and the three of you often go out together. Terri is more adventuresome pushing you and Jackie to try new things and places particularly for dancing. You often are left exhausted after an evening with them since once one would tire, the other would keep you on the floor all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only do they look alike, Terri's voice is identical to Jackie's, or really you guess Jackie's is identical to her mother's. You sometimes forget when calling their home phone if Jackie doesn't pick up her cell, and you will talk to Terri lovingly while she lets you go on until finally telling you it is her. She likes playing little games like that and even got herself an identical New Year's costume to Jackie when the three of you went out last year. You had to be alert all evening, but finally gave up. Fortunately, it was Jackie you kissed at midnight although you gave Terri a little kiss right after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie has let Terri do most of the wedding planning and decisions since Terri never got a real wedding herself. Terri had run off with her boyfriend and gotten married after her parents refused to give her a wedding because she was pregnant with Jackie. Jackie told you that she wanted her mother to be just as involved and only wished that Terri could be as happy as she was going to be as the bride marrying you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what caused the bright flash that blinded you for several seconds, you look around to see if a light blew or what and only become aware of how quiet it is when you look back and see Jackie and Terri staring at each other as if in shock. They usually are immediate chatterboxes when they see each other, and their strange silence leaves you at a loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Are you two OK?\" you ask after watching them touch each others cheek in slow motion then step over in front of the mirror together like mimes practicing synchronization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused that neither answered, you walk over between them and put an arm around each. \"I know I'm not suppose to be in here before the wedding, but do you have to pretend I don't exist?\" you chide them with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both turn to you with looks of concern that make a shiver run up your spine. You feel that something is very wrong, and it makes you nervous and scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are, a, ... are you two playing some sort of a, ... game on me?\" you sputter trying to regain your composure. They've tried to deceive you before although you wonder why now since this isn't the best time for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerry, who ... am I?\" Terri's voice trembles as she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my future bride-to-be ...\" you pause, \"... be's mother, of course, Terri,\" you chuckle, but that happiness drains from you as Terri's face turns pale and frightened as you speak. \"Terri, what's the matter?\" you plead then turn to Jackie and ask, \"What's wrong? Jackie, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a lump swell in your gut as you get really scared this time seeing Jackie's face only slightly less concerned. As you wait for answers glancing back and forth, Terri begins to break down and cry, and you take her in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It must be nerves finally catching up with her,</i>\" you think as you tell her. \"It's OK. Everything will be alright. The wedding is going to be perfect, you'll ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! IT WON'T!\" she pushes herself back and shouts in your face tears now staining her makeup. \"How could this happen? I can't get married like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink and shake your head trying to figure this one out and finally say, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerry,\" Jackie's voice comes from behind as she puts her hand on your shoulder. \"There's been some sort of accident. Somehow, Jackie and I have switched body's. I'm really Terri. She's Jackie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit teasing me, you two. This is some sort of pre-wedding gag, right?\" you nervously respond. \"Now both of you say, \"Just Kidding.\" OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerri begins to wail and falls into your arms. You hold her again and try to calm her with soothing words but avoid mentioning the wedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's hard, if not impossible to believe, Gerry, but it's true,\" you heard Jackie's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Terri rises up from your arms and screams, \"The orb. Where's the orb? That's what it must have been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all turn to the floor by the door where there are shattered pieces of glass reflecting or glowing in a rainbow of colors. Terri's body drops to her knees in front of it sobbing profusely again and again, \"NO. No. No, no, no, no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That thing did this?\" you puzzle out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like it actually works like it said.\" comes from the Jackie with Terri inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now it's broken, and I can't get married. We have to cancel,\" comes another wail from the body of Terri that supposedly now has your fiancee\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People are already arriving. How can we call this off?\" you start to rant in a panic turning to the Jackie body. You need to do something but aren't thinking clearly as you react desperately. \"Maybe we can say Jackie got ill. Can you start throwing up? What if you fell and got knocked unconscious or were cut by this glass.\" You reach down and pick up a piece and start to slash at Jackie's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerry! Jackie! Get a grip,\" she says backing away from your attempts to slice her up. \"You don't want to hurt me, so put that down. All is not lost. We can still go through with this and then find a way to fix it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You step back and look over at Terri then at Jackie or at least their bodies not sure if you just dreamed this or are they really each other inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" you barely whisper as your arms fall to your sides and your body completely relaxes. \"Tell me the truth. Are you two really switched, and <i>how</i> can we fix this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, John,\" comes Jackie's voice. \"I am really Terri mentally. I have all her memories and knowledge plus I remember being in my own body when I opened the door. Then there was this flash, and I found myself looking at my own body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie?\" you say soft and tenderly as you walk over to Terri's body, but she just stares blankly, tears still hanging on her cheeks. You gently wipe them off and say again, \"Jackie? Jackie love dove, please speak to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes blink when you say her special nick-name, and her face slowly turns to you so you peer deep into her eyes. Yes, they are different, but deep behind them you can see that essence that you fell in love with. You can sense Jackie in your whole being as you stand next to her. It's unmistakable, totally amazing, and completely weird, but you know absolutely that this woman is the one you love and will soon be marrying, you hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerrikins, pooh bear, what can we do?\" she pleads so pathetically using your pet name that Terri doesn't even know, and you melt into each others arms. You stroke her head gently noticing how strange it feels because it is Terri's short curls rather than Jackie's thick long hair. A shudder grips you for caressing Terri's body this way, but it vanishes instantly as something inside you overrides the physical difference and tells you that you are holding your true love. \"I love you so much and want to marry you today, but how, oh my god, how?\" She begins to weep again with her head on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at Terri seeing only Jackie's body, but again that special sense inside you tells you that she is Terri. Terri is always the strong one, so you just mouth to her in silence, \"Help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch her take a big breath and let it out before she speaks. \"We can all do this and carry out this wedding without anyone knowing different, if we just remain calm,\" Terri coolly says as she approaches the two of you. \"It isn't that hard to take each others place since we all know the routine. We don't have time to try to fix the orb or track down another before the wedding, but we can do that afterward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, ... but,\" Jackie starts then clears her throat before continuing. \"You will have married Gerry instead of me. Your two souls will have been linked by the ceremony even if it looks like my body. It's the souls in God's eye, not the physical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't ever thought of it that way, but all you've been taught about religion would confirm that. You and Jackie had actually met at a church function, and it was as much your consistency in belief that drew you close as it was your common interests. You now realize that's why you can feel Jackie right now inside Terri's body and that just re-enforces the fact that it is the souls that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerri ponders this for a while as you continue to embrace her body with Jackie inside. Finally, she looks over and says, \"...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thank you so much for saving this day.\" Then the two embrace. You are bit stunned and confused but  also now feel good inside knowing all is not lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can pretend to be me,\" Terri says with a wink. \"And I can be you until after the reception. Then we can all get together and figure out where we go from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better start calling me Jackie, <i>Mom</i>,\" Terri winks at Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my little precious,\" Jackie giggles as Terri often does when she uses the pet name for Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be so much fun. I can't believe that I'm finally going to have a real wedding,\" Terri chirps knowing that she didn't get one when she eloped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jackie turns to you with an annoyed look. \"Gerald Duncan. What are you doing here? You know it's bad luck to see your bride on her wedding day.\" She walks to the door and opens it. \"Now go get yourself ready and pretend none of this happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mom,\" you say and give her a kiss on the cheek as you walk out still a bit nervous and concerned as the door closes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least now you feel comfortable that you all have a plan, and you trust Terri who's always been good at planning. In fact, she planned most of the wedding and the honeymoon so neither you or Jackie had much to worry about. She's been like a sister to Jackie and a great friend and confidant to you as well. In fact if she wasn't Jackie's mom and was a tad younger, you may have made a play for her. You only wish she could find someone to be with and as happy as Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile dreamily but also wonder what you'll be able to do about this switch. Hopefully, there is some way of finding out where the orb came from and what it's full capabilities are. Maybe it only lasts for an hour or a day even if it's broken. You assume Terri has sense enough to gather all the pieces just in case, but you almost go back and knock on the door to be sure. However, just then your best friend, and also your Best Man, grabs you by the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Gerry,\" he says. \"Don't go trying to see the bride before the ceremony. You know that's bad luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. It's time to get ready anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he hauls you off to another room where all tuxes are waiting and starts kidding you about honeymooning in Door County peninsula of Wisconsin instead of some tropical island or fancy show place like Las Vegas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know we both just want some quiet time and enjoy the slower life,\" you tell him. \"Terri has always talked about what a great place it sounds like and has wanted to go there. Jackie and I just have to go see for ourselves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" he chides and winks at you. \"Not like you need to spend lots of time out and about, heh?\" and he elbows you about what he's implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush and start discussing the many women in his life and when he'll ever settle down. Soon you've completely forgotten the earlier incident, and the rest of the groomsmen arrive keeping you focused on the ceremony details and kidding you not to forget to say the right words. They also remind you to make sure you give a very long kiss at the end like you promised them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reaffirm your agreement, you remember who it is that you will be kissing. You didn't tell Jackie what you planned to do but knew she would go along; and with your agreement with the guys, you're really stuck. Hopefully, neither Terri or Jackie will be upset with you. You're finding yourself feeling rather guilty but also a bit excited about kissing Terri even if she is in Jackie's body. There's also the reception and first dance to get through with even more kisses expected. You start to get nervous at these thoughts although everyone believes it's just wedding jitters.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dressing and teasing continue making time fly, and your concerns sink to the back of your mind. Soon you are on your way being jostled and shoved into place at the front of the sanctuary. You clear your head of all thoughts except what you rehearsed so you do and say everything right. Anything about the orb is packed away. You concentrate hard but are almost shivering with nerves, and you just stand there not paying any attention as the bridesmaids go by and line up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you recognize is Terri's form marching straight at you down the aisle as the maid of honor. Her face is very nervous but she tries to smile at you even though as she passes by you see a small tear run down her cheek. You smile and think how typical of a bride's mother she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no time to focus on her as the music changes and everyone stands. Your mind knows that this is it, and you brace, but it suddenly all happens so fast. You see a glow of white shoot from the back into place beside you as time moves like light. A veil hides the face, but your mind knows it's Jackie. All the minister's words merge in the flash of a single sound, and your mind barely catches the question, \"Do you, Gerald Walter Duncan, take this woman ...\" Fortunately, you manage to stutter, \"Y-yes, I d-do.\" When the question is posed to your bride, you hear a duet of voices affirming \"I do\" as if angels singing along making it perfect. You feel so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesmerized and totally oblivious to the pre-ceremony accident, you place the ring automatically as if a robot, mindless until your next command . When that command comes, you lift the veil and stare at her deep red lips growing bigger until they fade to darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlow motion takes over now as your lips graze hers lightly. They are cool and firm but warm quickly, softening when pressed gently. They move with your touch from a shy smile to form a small \"O\" in a gasp of excitement mirroring your own causing them to lock together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips taste of berries, sweet and fresh. The smell of flowers wafts to your nose seeping timidly into your mind obliterating the world around you. Only the thought of Jackie and how much you love her remains. The sensation of your mouths together is exhilarating. Slowly your heads turn as they grip stronger and your jaws loosen opening to form a union of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body relaxes, and your neck twists and tightens pushing you together. Floating is how it feels, though you are anchored solidly in place. Relief fills you that all the waiting and formality is now over. It will be a long life of togetherness, happiness, love, passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that your lips begin crushing against each other while your tongue caresses hers and tingles along her teeth. Her body shudders at this, but you persist in tender slow exploration while you bend her body back so she must grasp you tightly to not fall. Perhaps it's submission to your power or perhaps it is trust and caring that finally entices her tongue to shyly brush against yours before the two start a gradual waltz of swirls and tugging. Her lips and mouth and tongue reach perfection with yours, and you rise back upright, releasing as the external sounds and light fade in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first vision is of her ruby lips, those wondrous lips that you just kissed, forming a smile. Her expression is of shy surprise but turns to a mischievous grin and wink before softening to joyous bliss. Your whole mind and body join her with this feeling until a troublesome nag pops out from a far corner of your mind. That passing smirk was familiar but not something you ever remember Jackie doing. It is pure Terri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shock and thrill both surge through you remembering the accident with the orb and knowing how you had just just kissed your mother-in-law. You eyes jerk toward the real Jackie in Terri's body and maid of honor gown. She is crying, but her eyes so sparkle with happiness that tells you she feels that kiss just as if you had placed it on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is but an instant before Terri takes your hand to applause and cheers, and you walk down the aisle together. You smile as you hold hands fingers entwined. It feels so right with Jackie's body, but you are concerned how you let yourself get carried away and whether you should have, and whether you ever should or could or would again. Terri notices your standoffish actions as you wait with her to go back for photos, and she pulls you aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Gerry,\" she whispers holding your hand in hers as she's done as Jackie's mother and your friend. \"Forget it's me and pretend like you did with the kiss.\" She smiles reassuringly. \"It's OK, and Jackie understands. We must get through this and move on. Do it for Jackie, and for me.\" The last words are almost too soft to hear, but she also squeezes your hand on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kisses you tenderly on the lips, then you take a deep breath and nod smiling back. Her eyes sparkle and she winks again, you think, rather mischievously, but she is so happy and that makes you feel the same releasing your inhibitions. As others approach, you take her in your arms and kiss her again though not quite as passionately.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mom,\" Terri cries out dropping your hands and running to embrace her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confuses you as you're about to joyously cry, out \"Oh, Jackie, my love,\" until you see the rest of the bridesmaids coming several steps behind her. As Terri releases her, you start, \"Mrs. Driscoll, er ... <i>Mom</i>,\" and embrace her trying to hold back your true feelings of wanting to crush her body to yours even though it is Terri's. However, you lean your head against hers to whisper in her ear, \"Jackie Driscoll, I love you more than anything.\" That's all you have time for to avoid it looking unusual while the rest of the bridesmaids rush Terri and surround her with hugs and best wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you pull back, Jackie plants a kiss on your cheek and loudly sings, \"You're very special to me now, Gerry,\" so everyone can hear. She also gives you a wink that squeezes a tear out to slowly run down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what she means even if everyone else has another interpretation, and you want to say and do so much more, but you suffice to just catch the tear on your finger and bring it to your lips since your back is to everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiles broadly as her eyes start to turn puffy holding back a flood. \"I need to get touched up,\" she says and turns to walk briskly down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no time to react as the bridesmaids are now all over you tugging you back to Terri and pushing you two together. Caught up in the moment and burning with emotions for Jackie from the brief encounter, you play the happy, confident groom and now husband hugging, tickling, lifting, and kissing Terri treating her <i>just like Jackie</i>. It all seems so right, and your concerns vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly as everyone gathers, no one can find the maid of honor - Jackie to you and Terri, but Terri physically right now. You aren't that worried until most of the wedding party departs and again notice Jackie is nowhere in sight. Concern now boils up, and you grab Terri's hips and nibble her neck treating her <i>just like Jackie</i> then ask if she's seen \"her mother.\" She shakes her head and turns around to embrace you while others gaze on. Naturally you kiss her just like you would Jackie until she is pulled away so she can hug goodbye to another well-wisher. You wander back towards the dressing area and start searching the rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's quiet and calm as you look in every room even the janitor's closet and down the stairs to the boiler room. \"<i>Where can she have gone, and why?</i> you keep pondering. It's not like Jackie to just vanish especially at her own wedding. \"<i>And it was hers,</i>\" to tell yourself even if she had to watch from the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceremony replays in your head. You clearly remember the sound of her voice as one of the angels singing \"I do.\" You wish so much this hadn't happened and that you could have spent more time with her after the ceremony, but you have to treat Terri just like she is Jackie to keep up the pretense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA touch of guilt and sadness enters your thoughts, then all the love swells up, and your emotions overflow with tears running down your face. Wiping them away seems to just spawn more, and you find yourself stumbling blindly forward and slowly climbing some stairs. At the top, the tears fade, and you see you are at the back entrance to the alter. You stare at your feet as you shuffle your way around towards the same spot where you'd made your vow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere in beams of colored light coming through the stained-glass window is Jackie. An angel with her face aglow looking into the light, and you feel your chest heave and your face ache as tears again flow into your eyes. Desperately wanting to move but feeling unable, you stand and whimper like a child until a cloud dims the light and Jackie turns to you holding out her, or actually Terri's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou join her holding hands and gazing into each others eyes. Slowly words form on your and her lips, and in unison you speak quietly to each other the ceremony vow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pledge my life and soul to you, forever and ever, here before these witnesses, in this place of God, and ..\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Terri's face is similar to Jackie's, and with your eyes still fuzzy from crying, your mind doesn't see the differences at first. But as you get closer, you recognize it as your mother-in-law and hesitate for a moment. Jackie however has closed her eyes, and you see Terri's lips waiting, puckering, slightly open, pink and full, slightly moist, luscious, very desirable. A sense of taboo, forbidding, and guilt rack your mind stopping you even though you know it is really Jackie inside. But your love fights back forcing your eyes closed and pushing your mouth timidly forward until it touches hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in a stalemate, your lips only lightly caress hers feeling an electric sensation at the slight difference that is both thrilling and scary. On the one hand it feels so right as your breath merges your souls, but the physical and spirit are in conflict. You try to imagine Jackie's face and body, but it only exacerbates your knowledge that she and her mom have swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break off way to soon, though leaving a lasting impression that kissing Terri's form is not revolting and even pleasing. However, you will have to resolve the conflict in your mind because the physical is prominent holding you hostage to your true feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie doesn't seem to mind the short kiss. Her face is again aglow with color as if the sparkle in her eyes has lit up her whole face, although it is but the light through the window that has you both in its beams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so there you are,\" comes Jackie's voice echoing through the sanctuary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to see Terri still in the wedding dress come floating silently down the aisle. You squint and blink at the apparition letting loose of Jackie so you can rub your fists in your eyes to make sure what you're seeing. When she gets close you notice she is caring her shoes and take two steps forward to greet her. A smile forms on you both as you open your arms and embrace. You lift and spin her around as you kiss just like you would Jackie. When you set her back down, you watch her rosy lips as they open and close barely hearing the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone is waiting out front to throw rice as we get into the limo,\" she says taking your hand and pulling you back down the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to follow until you hear Jackie call, \"What about me? What are we going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, relax,\" Terri says which strikes you as peculiar since no one else is around and she could use real names. \"Judy leaves tomorrow for two weeks of camp. You can catch a flight up and join us. You're already off work and told everyone you needed a break from all the planning and work you've done on the wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looks confused at first, possibly the same way you did as Terri talks to her as if she really was the physical form she possesses. Her countenance changes as Terri outlines the plan, and she relaxes and nods at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wise and yet so beautiful,\" you compliment Terri and give her a quick peck as you normally do with Jackie. Then you turn and take Jackie's hand while your eyes beam longing love dispelling her worry of your action and the time you'll be apart. \"Everything will be fine, and we'll find a fix when you join us, <i>Mom</i>,\" you tease her as you squeeze her hand the way you always do with Jackie to indicate your love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerri again takes your hand, and you hold on to Jackie with the other as the three of you briskly head to the front door to make your exit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, you're away from all the others and sit back and relax in the limo. It will be about an hour and a half to the airport. Terri is inspecting the spacious inside and already found the button to close the window and blind between you and the driver for complete privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look!\" she chirps just like Jackie when she's excited. \"Champagne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls out a bottle and hands it to you to open as she fishes out two glasses as well. You manage to get the foil off, but have problems with the wire holding the cork. Terri giggles and climbs next to you to help. Suddenly the cork pops and hits the ceiling while champagne gushes forth. Pushing the bottle in front of you so the liquid doesn't get on your clothes, you both laugh as Terri takes the glasses trying to catch as much as possible. When they're filled, you toast each other with big gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should change so we don't ruin the gown and tux,\" Terri offers. \"The casuals are in the bag,\" she adds pulling out a small suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And get our traveling clothes wet?\" you tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wouldn't be time to go and change for the airplane, so it was planned to use the privacy of the limo. The company would then have the wedding dress and tux cleaned and packed. It was Terri's idea to help get the honeymoon off quickly without an intermediate stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a compromise,\" she replied and winked. \"Help undo me, please.\" She turns her back and you start unbuttoning without thinking. In no time she's sitting in her undies and stockings glass in hand feeding you another drink that she almost pours all down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you say after swallowing. \"You trying to drown me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just giggles again so much like Jackie that you laugh yourself. She starts on your shirt buttons while you take off the tux coat. The champagne in your tummy makes it feel warm, and you reach for her glass and hold it to her lips slowly emptying it like she did to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm. That's really good,\" she purrs after finishing the last button and you remove your shirt. As she goes for your pants, you remember that this is really Terri, your mother-in-law, in Jackie's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa. Wait a minute,\" you say holding her hands on your zipper accidentally pushing against your penis most sensually. \"Maybe we shouldn't ... really ... undress ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, John,\" she corrects looking you straight in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately find yourself lost in her, Jackie's, amazing, beautiful eyes. They sparkle so, and you start to rise in the crotch to her wiggling fingers. As Terri speaks, the words seem to echo even before you hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't let the clothes get ruined. We're both adults and suppose to be newlyweds. Remember to just think of me like Jackie. Forget the orb and Terri. Act like I'm Jackie always so you don't ever slip up. Just think I am Jackie. <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">I am Jackie.</font> <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">I am Jackie.</font> <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I am Jackie.</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerns begin to seem insignificant. After all, you've known Terri for as long as Jackie and consider her a very close friend. Besides Jackie would be more upset if you allowed the gown \u00a0<i>or</i>\u00a0 your tux to be stained. It won't hurt anything and neither will pretending, you convince yourself. Practice will definitely help since you can't let anyone find out of the switch. The best thing to do is just think of her as Jackie. <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">as Jackie. </font><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">as Jackie. </font><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Jackie.</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your eyes break apart, you let her undo your pants and help you pull them off. Next you both have another glass of champagne snuggled together, arms entwined, and serving the other from each others glass. You start toasting everyone, and soon the first bottle is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the only way to toast now is with a kiss,\" woozy from the alcohol you jokingly offer only to have Terri exclaim, \"To us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes her lips on yours passionately. You're too surprised to resist but don't immediately respond. Slowly, though, as you taste the strawberry of her lip gloss and feel the tantalizing sensation of her tongue seducing your lips, you open up and join her wholeheartedly wrapping your arms around her as you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerri's actions are different with the kiss and her movements against you. You know in the back of your mind that she's not really Jackie, but the warmth in your tummy and the heat of her lips has your mind aflame with arousal burning away the fact that the physical form of Jackie that you're holding is in any way not wholly her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you are rolling on the seat and fondling each other. You reach behind her and unhook her bra which she pulls off much quicker than Jackie ever would and smashes her breasts against you so you feel her hardened nipples dig into your chest. Those definitely feel just like Jackie even if her crushing approach is foreign. You continue to make out groping her butt cheeks and reaching your fingers into her pantie legs from behind and finger her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerri begins to wiggle even more against you, and she slides a hand into your boxers massaging your growing cock and balls in such a new and exciting way that you immediately become fully erect. You moan at this and dive your mouth down onto her breast and suck gently flicking her blood engorged nipple with your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery nuance that's different screams that you are with Terri, but every sense - sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound - impresses your consciousness that this physical body is your love. You body shivers with excitement and races with increased desire just because of this, and it's all that matters now. Terri's moans are even more erotic than Jackie's as you move to her other breast and roll it between your teeth. Each sound she makes drives you more wild with primal lust, and her hands manipulate you further to caress every part of her body. Your fingers move in the top front of her panties to find the moist lips between her legs that she readily spreads for you to probe. Her pleasure nub is also blood engorged and firm. You circle it with your finger, and she arches up trying to pull your fingers in as her head goes back in a purr of pure pleasure. Her fingers encircle your manhood and draw it long and hard then squeezes it under the tip almost causing pain but, more importantly, making your feeling of imminent release fade while still remaining completely hard and exceptionally aroused. Jackie could never do that, and you would have exploded way too early if Terri hadn't. Your mind craves this new experience acknowledging that it's Terri's maturity and knowledge that you want. You begin to think how great it would be if she had her own body to use with you. The thought is so wrong that it makes you shutter with more infinite lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she rolls away and onto all fours and whispers sensually, \"Take me Gerry. Take your wife like you were meant to do. Make Jackie's voice scream for more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't deny her and move behind her between her legs rubbing your boner between her cheeks until she begs again for you to please her completely. Pressing your penis gently over her lips, you slide it back and forth but not entering, yet. Her lips part even more trying to grab for your rock solid shaft. Slipping just over the threshold to bump against the swollen nub makes her moan loudly and again entreat you to enter her fully. You move the tip passing back and forth over her nub. Terri cries out incoherently with the pleasure that you're giving her. Her body is shivering now, so you push down further, slowly, but just a bit more then pull back repeating a little deeper each time until you feel the end of the channel against your head. Her vagina is tight, but almost without friction as her juices make it easy for both to enjoy the movement. You reach around and grab her large soft mounds taking her swollen nipples between you fingers to squeeze and roll them making her moan even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour surroundings disappear from thought. There is no car, and any bounce, sway or stop and start is insignificant to the motions of your joined bodies. Only the feeling of Jackie's body that you start to ram with ever increasing speed and force exists to you besides your own. Jackie's voice is calling you to keep going, faster, harder, deeper until she clamps down on you and screams in absolute elation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh - my - god. \u00a0\u00a0I've wanted you for so long. GerRYYYYYYYYYYYY !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice sings a siren's song making you explode in ecstasy within her. You groan repeatedly, \"I love you so much,\" while you expend yourself over the next minute convulsing within her until you collapse on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain this way for some time. Eventually your senses return knowing you're in the limo and will soon be at the airport. You gently pull yourselves apart and lie facing each other on the floor embracing and gently kissing while your hearts slow to normal. That Terri is inside Jackie's body while you make love is a distant afterthought that now seems meaningless in your blissful state. Another half hour passes in your contentment until a voice comes through a speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifteen minutes until we arrive.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we better get dressed,\" you say looking into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes are still sparkling with an afterglow of your passions, and you kiss her deeply and with even more feeling unconcerned that you just made wild passionate love to your mother-in-law in your wife's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You find yourself carefree and happier than you've ever been as you and Terri make your way through the airport, security and onto the plane. It's a small one with two seats on one side and three on the other. Terri and you are together in the short side. The plane is rather cold, so you get a blanket to cover both of you and push up the armrest between to snuggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerri gives you a quick kiss then falls asleep almost immediately afterward. You look at the magazine and the Sky Mall catalog intrigued by all the ridiculous things you could buy. Recounting the day's events pulls up the memory of the broken orb and the switch, then of you and Jackie-in-Terri's-body alone in the church sanctuary pledging you own vows to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder how she is doing and handling pretending to be Terri. It shouldn't be too hard since she could just head home, and only Judy would be there until tomorrow. They probably would only see each other briefly as Judy prepares for her trip. Jackie would mainly be alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this you become melancholy and wish you could call her right then and there. Unfortunately, it will be well over an hour before the plane lands in Green Bay. This depresses you further. However, Terri shifts and snuggles up closer causing you to look into her face, actually the face of Jackie that Terri is now behind. She looks so beautiful. You kiss her forehead and hug her with the arm she's leaning on and around her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But this isn't really Jackie,</i>\" you think. \"<i>I can pretend all I want with her, but Jackie's not really here.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember what happened in the limo, and guilt begins to build. You can blame it on the alcohol or maybe the great acting that had both of you fooled. Really, though, it was your desire from the excitement you felt knowing it was Terri. You convinced yourself it was OK because it was Jackie's body. Maybe that was wrong. Maybe it isn't Jackie that you love but just her physical form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe differences that Terri did come to mind and how you thought it would be interesting to make love to Terri with her own body. Perhaps you aren't in love but just lusting. Or is it because you know Jackie is in Terri's body that you want it. The whole process leaves you confused thinking you've abandoned your true love, Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>NO!</i> you tell yourself as tears form in your eyes. You've been married for only a few hours and already you're cheating, but you're not sure with which woman due to teh switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky outside is brilliant blue with the sun pushing light from behind across the tops of the overcast clouds below you. These bright little hills and gloomy gray long valleys slide below you. Right now you are in one of those valleys trying to find a way to climb out into the sunshine. Your revulsion of your actions almost makes you push Terri away. You do lift your arm which obviously makes her cold as she pulls the blanket and squeezes tighter against you. Now you feel even more guilty taking out your anger and apprehension on her, so you put your arm back. She sighs contentedly when you do. A sigh just like Jackie, and from here on until it can be fixed, you know you will treat her just like Jackie. That thought actually eases your pain even though you know that you will sense a little guilt riding with you until Jackie can be reunited with her body and you confess everything to her, especially your love, and hope she forgives you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Terri and you talk about all the things to do as the plane lands and taxis in. She has some different ideas and is very animated about them, much different than Jackie's calm and serious discussions. It actually perks you up having this cheery conversation even if she's acting more like herself than Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerri wants to do some hiking and tour the lighthouses - a couple things that Jackie was not too keen about, but you are enthusiastic. She also wants to do some antiquing which neither you or Jackie are really into. The big thing that she insists you do because it is fall is going to the Packers game on Sunday. You haven't been to a big even like that in years, and figure by then Jackie will be there and it will be fun for the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're both very animated and appear to be the perfect couple while you deplane and head into the terminal. As you get the bags, you remember you wanted to call Jackie. So while waiting in line to get the rental car, you hit the speed dial and wait. All you get is voice-mail, and you quietly leave a sexy, almost dirty message hoping no one in the line hears. Then you think that maybe they switched phones, so you call Terri's number. Voice-mail again. This time you just say you've arrived safely and wish she was here. You set an alert on your cell for a couple hours to try again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive up the Door County peninsula is routine. Terri watches the scenery and signs while browsing all the brochures and guides she picked up at the airport. She's always been a real planner, and you're sure there won't be much down time until Jackie arrives. You notice that besides Terri's preferences coming out, some Terri-isms in the way she moves, her speech inflection and phrases are more pronounced like a hybrid of the two. As you mention this, she just shrugs it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're away from everyone that knows either of us, so it's not that important. What is, is us making sure everyone thinks we're newlyweds,\" she says beaming and jumping up to give you a peck on the cheek then leaning her head on your shoulder. \"Like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put an arm around her shoulders and laugh at her playfulness. It's something you've always liked about Terri, Jackie being much more subdued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on the two-lane road, she quickly points out each winery and antique store and sign to others like a little kid for candy stores. It's another Terri thing that Jackie never does. However, you actually enjoy her spirit just like you always have with Terri. Eventually, there's the sign to Peninsula State Park, and she talks about hiking and biking, pulling you into her adventurous plans and making her more endearing. Finally, you come down a hill and turn a corner to drive along a wide open bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so beautiful,\" she exclaims, and both her arms grab you to hug your shoulder almost causing you to veer across traffic and into the bay. She slides back and giggles, \"Sorry. I'll try to behave myself.\" It's just like Terri does when she gets carried away. You just smile again at her exuberance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes later you turn into the hotel, and ten minutes after that, you're both standing in front of the large window on the top floor looking out at the bay of boats docked and some sailing, and seeing the shoreline of the park on the other side. Through a blue sky, the early fall sun is low and shining brightly, not quite right at you. The beams through the glass make you both very warm, and the room is aglow behind you. The bay shimmers like a mirror with vibrant dots of color from sails coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand naturally grasps Terri's then soon slips behind her back as she does the same. It is so perfectly romantic that you can't help but pull her against your side, both entranced by the wonderful scene and the fact that this is your honeymoon. There's a fleeting reminder that it's Terri in Jackie's body, and you uncomfortably let go as mixed emotions confuse you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to you unsure of why you released her, and you turn to look into the face of Jackie that Terri has. It glows with the sun. Her eyes are gems in a spotlight. Her hair shines with a rainbow of browns and reds. Her lips are soft burning embers. This visage clouds your mind with memories of Jackie and your love for her, deceiving you of Terri behind those features. You pull her into a tender and loving kiss that relieves you of all cares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments you are overcome by your hormones shifting to a more passionate embrace and, minutes later, fall onto the bed making out and fondling each other. Clothes are shed followed by moans, groans, and grunts as you both explode into ecstasy with the setting sun. As those mesmerizing rays vanish while you lie together in each others arms, the dark reality forces itself upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the guilt rise up again trying to replace the afterglow of happiness and contentment. Your throat tightens, and your face aches as tears begin to form in your eyes. Again, your mind and logic failed you by letting you be intimate with Terri while hosted by Jackie's body. Terri misinterprets your soft crying, pulling your head against her chest to comfort you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are such a great lover. I'm so glad we are now together. I love you,\" comes in a whisper of Jackie's voice but a cadence and slight accent that is pure Terri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but, I, ... I shouldn't be,\" you barely whisper with a sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, now. It is what you should do with your wife, and I am that right now. There's nothing wrong and everyone will understand,\" she purrs reassuringly in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words make you feel better, but it also heightens those conflicting emotions so all you can do is stay frozen in her arms with joy and fear. Shortly, you are saved by an alert playing on your cell and have to get up or it won't shut off. Looking at the reminder to \"Call Jackie\" clears your head; but as you stare at the screen, it shows that you have no bars - no connectivity. Curiosity takes over from guilt as you wander the room with growing anxiety that you can't reach her and trying to get it to change, but it doesn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close the curtains or everyone will see you naked, dear,\" Terri calls slipping off to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you reply on instinct as you back off around the walls to get to the curtain pulls and close them. \"There's no signal here. I didn't think we were that far in the boonies,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably just the service you have. It's always good in the big cities, but ...\" she replies in typical Terri, mother-like tone as you hear the shower start. \"Come get cleaned up for dinner, and we can try the WiFi with your iPad later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing the phone aside, you start for the bathroom aching with regret that you hadn't paid for premium service. You hope Jackie isn't trying for you or Terri and leaving messages but not getting any response. You really hope that she doesn't think you are ignoring her on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause looking at Jackie's body moving in the large glass shower. Being with Terri is becoming natural to you. First it was how well she pretended and acted like Jackie that you could easily forget it was Terri. Now her gradual slip into her own self in Jackie's body seems part of the woman you love rather than this strange anomaly. You are acting freely with few, if any, second thoughts treating her just like Jackie. Only rarely do you even remember the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou so want to join, but because it's really Terri mentally makes you reconsider. It is your true love's body, so you haven't really cheated on her physically. Besides Terri is right that this is what you would be doing and that Jackie is very understanding, but are you continuing this too far? Are you losing the distinction, or does that matter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you wonder how you will treat Jackie when she arrives. Can you love her - physically - in Terri's body. It seems it was all too easy to forget the mind behind Jackie's body. Would Terri's body turn you off and make Jackie feel you've rejected her? You love Jackie so much, but are caught by your thoughts of how great it's been with Terri. Will what you have done make you want to continue with Terri even if you do connect with Jackie in Terri's body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deep down there's a pain of loneliness. You truly miss the real Jackie - the mind with her feelings and peculiarities that you fell in love with. Although her body is what draws your eyes and drives certain actions - and does it very strong, her real self is the mind and soul that you left at the church. You need her, and you need her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking off to get your iPad, you connect to the hotel's WiFi and quickly are on Jackie's Facebook page. What greets you makes you cry. She's already uploaded some pictures and notes about the wedding saying how happy she and you are. As you read, you begin to sob even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Gerry and I declared our vows to each other today as the bright streams of God's rays blessed us. Our souls are now bonded for eternity. Even if our minds and bodies are apart, we are truly one, and our only wish is that we can be together and do whatever we must to make that happen.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words had special meaning to you because of the switch and leaving her mind back home for now. It was hard for you to even continue to read. There are lots of well wishes on her wall, and you just hope that she checks the site often to find your private note about the phones and how much you miss her and want to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's an e-mail from her of love and longing to hear from you. It was sent while you were on the plane. You then send her an e-mail as well about the phones and recommending you set a time to communicate somehow. You sit and stare at the screen hoping she's online and will immediately reply, but she doesn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of movement in the room brings your head up. Terri is now out of the shower with a towel around her and damp hair slick against her head and shoulders. It makes Jackie's body even more exotic and sensual. You've only seen her hair like this when out swimming. She smiles at you and walks over, moving in a sexy sway unlike normal for her, but you recognize the happy jaunt of Terri in her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any luck?\" she asks as she runs her fingers through her hair and tosses her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesmerized by this, you pause momentarily before your brain connects the question to communication with Jackie back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been online, so I sent her notes, but no response yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps after dinner,\" she offers causally. \"Better get cleaned up. I'm getting hungry.\" She winks at you while untangling the hair dryer cord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away. I know how you get if not fed regularly,\" you joke moving to the shower. Actually Jackie can skip meals without a problem, but Terri can get anxious and agitated. Somehow your subconscious is recognizing her a Terri, not finding it unusual at all now that it's Jackie's body, or that you're still naked in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, honey. So chop chop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle and hop through the shower and getting dressed. By then Terri has Jackie's hair in a lovely style, Terri's usual style. The blouse and skirt are more formal than Jackie usually wears, and she has on jewelry, a nice necklace and bracelet, which Jackie rarely wears. It makes her look mature and very attractive, so you compliment instead of questioning the obvious Terri things she's doing. You don a sport coat, also a rarity for you, to match her style and to escort your beautiful bride to a small restaurant for a quiet candlelit dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a delicious meal where everyone treats you special (they seem to know you're newlyweds), you walk along the bay as the moon rises behind you casting a spotlight onto the boats and buoys making the tiny, gentle waves shimmer sliver. It cannot be any more romantic as you sit together on a bench gazing out in silence for several minutes until Terri speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a wonderful day for me, Gerry. I'm so glad that you've not shied away from me and what's happened. It's been what I've always dreamed about even before I eloped. It has always haunted me that I would never see this and feel the happiness of a real wedding with family and real honeymoon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke still looking straight out and never turned to you, her words soft and light with joy, making you feel warm and happy inside as well. Slowly  her eyes - Jackie's eyes - met yours as she took both your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must confess that I never tried to hold back today. I didn't want to ruin anything, but I just so wanted to be young and live out my dream. I wish this could go on forever, and maybe it will, maybe we'll have to. I don't want to hurt anyone, but if there is no way back, if what has happened will be forever, ...\" Her eyes start to water as her voice fades to a whisper and she turns away without finishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, ... we will never abandon you. I don't know what we can do if you both stay like this, but either way, we will make it work.\" You put your arm around her and hug her close. She continues to stare into the bay as it grows calm like a mirror reflecting the sky. You gaze up to see more stars than you ever have. The few lights here and clarity makes it look like the heavens are opening up just for you two. You remain there for some time until a chill fills the air. Your heads turn to face each other, and you embrace with a warming kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk to the room holding hands, you realize that you would be happy with Terri, to live with her as Jackie as your wife, but you feel very bad even thinking you would leave Jackie.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you get to room, Terri gives you a hug and quick kiss quickly making you aroused. However, when she lets go, she surprises you by saying, \"Check to see if Jackie got your messages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou connect and pull up e-mail to find one from Jackie and begin reading snippets to Terri. It's very upbeat and says she's been having fun finding out all sorts of things about \"us\" from Mom's friends. At this you laugh and give Terri a quizzical glance that she just shrugs off innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She says to make a video link up to her account, and we can talk. That'll just take a minute,\" you say and immediately go to it. In another minute, Terri's face comes up on the screen with a very loving smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tiger. Glad to see you,\" Jackie tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sorry about the phones, but I'm happy to read that you've had some fun,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she says anything more, Terri pops her head over your shoulder and calls out, \"Hi, <i>Mom</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie freezes momentarily on the other end seeing her own face albeit make-up and hair more like Terri. Then she cracks a smile and chuckles back, \"Hi there, my big princess. I hope you've taken good care of my favorite guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch knowing what you've done with Terri, but she banters back quickly. \"I'm doing the best I can to keep him entertained until you arrive. Do you have a flight yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie turns Terri's face gloomy as she replies, \"The next available going up isn't until Sunday evening, something about football fans. I thought it might be too late in the day, so I booked the first one Monday morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that works perfectly!\" Terri exclaims. \"We're going to the Packers' game Sunday and plan to stay overnight, so we'll be there waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looks surprised at this since she is not into football at all, so you jump in turning to Terri on the second half. \"Remember Mom's a Packers fan. If I didn't know better, I'd think she did this on purpose just so she could go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Gerry,\" Terri gives you a little push as she teases. \"I saw your eyes light up when I mentioned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmpft,\" Jackie grunts trying to look upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, dear. He's been the consummate husband even if he is pining over you. Why don't I go get changed and let you two alone. Bye <i>Mom</i>.\" Terri waves before strolling to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch Jackie's body wiggle it's way in and close the door before you turn back to Jackie. She's smiling and instantly starts talking about how Terri's friends think you are such a hunk and tease her, as Terri, for not stealing you away. It makes you wonder if that may be what's happening. Then as she talks, your guilt starts eating at you until Jackie finally drops her joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerry, you look sad. Is everything OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords stick in your throat, and you have to cough before you can get them out. \"I miss you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss you, too. But you are still having fun, right? I know you and mom always hit it off well, so I hope you aren't ruining <i>our honeymoon</i> just because I'm not there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin at her humor, but you feel like it's a cringe. taking a deep breath to collect your courage, you stare straight at the screen and decide to confess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that, ...\" you start but not sure how to say what you need to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you've been \"the consummate husband,\" how was consummating the marriage?\" You must have looked shocked for she came right back with, \"It was bound to happen, Gerry, and I don't blame you. I've actually thought about it a lot. First I was angry, then depressed. I even tried denying it would happen, but after hearing the talk of Mom's friends and knowing it was my body there tempting you, I knew that sooner or later the two of you wouldn't be able to control it. I just hope that you'll be able to accept me the same when I get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end tears are dripping off your cheeks, and your voice cracks as you speak. \"I love and miss you so much. Please forgive me? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do Gerry. I do. I said \"I do\" in the church and nothing, ... nothing will ever change that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tears are now visible as well, but they are tears of happiness, and you discover that that's what yours have become, too. Her eyes are staring right into yours through the camera. You both smile as the tension turns you both to laughter, and you wipe the tears away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Gerry,\" she whispers and leans into the camera. \"How many times?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel flushed with embarrassment again but chuckle back, \"Twice, ... so far,\" and give her a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my big stud. Just don't wear yourself out before I get there, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPure elation fills you mind and body with the love between you two souls. Even the worse tragedy possible - that of separating the bride and groom at their wedding and honeymoon - cannot stop the connection of the deep love you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerry, do me one favor, though, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do anything for you, you know that, Jackie. Just tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses with a deep breath looking down then her face beams up at you with a little grin. \"Set up the camera so I can watch you make love tonight.\" Shocked by this, you just stare silently at her. Your mind unable to fully comprehend this bizarre request. \"Please, Gerry? I want to feel I'm there. You and me together like it is suppose to be. Do it and just pretend that she's the real Jackie. Please, Gerry? Do it for me. I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart is overjoyed by her words, you know that you will comply. You nod and say, \"I love you,\" then set your iPad on the dresser with a full view of the bed turning the speakers and screen off. You sigh and start getting undressed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute Terri appears wearing a white silk camisole that barely covers Jackie\u2019s chest and the silk panties underneath. Your eyes go wide seeing her already raised nipples pushing underneath and your penis stands to point at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the wedding gift <i>Mom</i> gave me. Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll thoughts of the camera and her not being Jackie fly from your mind as you drool out, \"I like very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then. Go get ready, and I'll be waiting for you, Tiger,\" Terri purrs as she jumps exuberantly onto the bed and slithers into the pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of your mind, you know that Jackie would never do that. She's too conservative and would just lie down easily, but in your aroused state, you just toss your pants aside and race into the bathroom to wash up and brush your teeth. When you come back out, ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You glance back at your Ipad with it's camera pointed at the bed. Resolute, you lean down to continue kissing Terri's neck, pausing to whisper in her ear, \"Tonight, pretend to be Jacquelyn, my wife. Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks you in the eyes and, for a moment, you only see Jackie's loving gaze. She whispers back \"Who else would I be, Tiger? I'm the woman you married, the one you want to spend you life with.\" And she pulls you down onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, sex that night is even more spectacular than before. You never thought you could cum so many times in one night. Terri uses all her skills and knowledge to draw out the experience.

She is a perky, slender, average-sized redhead, at least that's the color she choose for the wedding. She's been experimenting with her looks since you first met her when she was a sophomore in high school - she's a senior now. For a while you even thought Jackie had two sisters since she was always in different styles as well as hair colors the few times you saw her. You're pretty sure she tried to make you think that as well, though she would never admit it when you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerry! What are you doing in here?\" she exclaimed and grabbed your arm. \"Don't you know it's bad luck for the groom to see his bride on the wedding day?\" She drags you to the door as you stumble and mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, ... but Terri, er ... Jackie, .. I mean, ... we need to, ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No excuses, Gerry,\" she adamantly says trying to push you through the doorway as you hold onto the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Gerry,\" comes Jackie's voice that you know is really Terri. \"We'll work this out. You just do exactly what was practiced and everything will be fine. OK, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, ... you and ... not real, ... how ...\" you stammer until Judy quits pushing and starts tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to have to do this,\" Judy smirks knowing that you are especially ticklish. \"But you heard Jackie, now vamoose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't hold on and drop your arms to try to fight her off, but you know you can't win. Even your twelve year old nice, Amanda, your sister's daughter can turn you to a helpless baby when she tickles you. You teeter out the door. As it goes shut, you hear Jackie's voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Act like nothing happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>How can I act like nothing happened?</i>\" you wonder but are shaken from those thoughts as your best man takes hold of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong way, buddy. It's time we got you ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drags you across the hall and the next couple hours fly by as you are completely distracted getting dressed and joking with all the groomsmen. By the time you all snake through the basement and up the back stairs to the alter, you are too nervous just about the wedding to think of what happened. You just keep going over the rehearsal in your head so you don't make a mistake. First you will watch your best man seat your mom then the procession will start. The bridesmaids including Judy and then the matron of honor, Terri as Jackie had wanted, will come in one by one. Finally Jackie escorted by her grandfather. There was no way Terri was letting Jackie's jerk of a father be involved. You would then turn and face the minister and ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear, \"It's time,\" and are pushed forward. You stare at the floor as you come in to make sure you stop at the right spot.  When you look up, the whole place is a blur until you see your mom and best friend come down the aisle. She is smiling as she sits and your dad comes up behind and joins her. Then the music changes and your heart begins to race. One by one the bridesmaids step-and-stop, step-and-stop to their positions. At the rehearsal this seemed to take forever, but today they flew by until you noticed Judy's smile as she passed. Next would be the Matron of Honor, Terri, and immediately the earlier happenings with her and Jackie flood your mind.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wonder if they told Judy or if they had been able to reverse it. Is Jackie still upset about being in Terri's body? Terri told you it would be OK, but is it? Your stomach rolls while your head spins and your heart beats faster and faster trying to run out of your chest. Every concern you and Jackie ever had about marriage and the actual ceremony marches to the forefront until you start to sweat and get giddy at how this is exactly what everyone said you'd feel at the big moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything is like still shots. Judy jumps from in front to alongside the other bridesmaids, and the Matron of Honor appears at the end of the aisle, popping forward a meter at a time growing bigger as she gets closer until you see Terri's face clearly. A joyous smile. A single, slight tear of happiness. Her eyes a bit glazed. Red lips move in silence. Each frame is a word: \"be - happy - love - you.\" It's all exactly how Terri would be and what she would say. You relax and feel your heart slow. Maybe everything is OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she pops out of sight, and there's an empty aisle looking to be a mile long stretching to a figure in white. From stop action to slow motion, she floats towards you. Your heart now swings with joy, and you can barely hold back tears as your emotions take over. The veil precludes you seeing details, but the sparkle from her eyes passes through distinctly. Contentment, happiness and love shine bright as you gaze at them. You feel her hand take yours though you don't recall offering it, and you both turn to face the minister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceremony runs its course, and you barely remember the question and the \"I do's\" or placement of rings; but when you hear, \"You may now kiss the bride,\" you don't hesitate lifting the veil and squeezing her with the truest passion from your lips. Your only thoughts were that you and your true love, Jackie, were now man and wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is so much hub-bub after you two strolled back down the aisle that you never think of what happened earlier. The bridesmaids are hugging and chatting. The groomsmen are congratulating you. The photographer is posing everyone which feels like it goes on forever. Finally, it's just you and your bride all alone, and you just smile at each other as you pull her in for another even longer and more passionate kiss.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm not really the woman you love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terri?\" you say in disbelief. \"But I thought...I mean, I hoped..\" you stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hoped we'd changed back, or that maybe it was all some kind of weird dream?\" she interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes,\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but it's very real\" - you are interrupted by a knock on the door - \"in fact, that's probably Jackie right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens the door and in walks Terri - actually, Jackie in Terri's body, you guess. You just stare at each other for a moment without speaking. Finally, Terri (in Jackie's body) says \"Go ahead and kiss you two. I don't mind. You should get a kiss on your wedding day, and you won't get another chance until after the reception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie walks up to slowly. She has a nervous expression that looks strangely out of place on Terri's face. You look at the body of your now mother-in-law. She's still quite attractive and the gown actually flatters her, showing the curve of her breasts and hips while minimizing the slight middle-age weight she's put on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Jackie's reluctance and guess that maybe she's afraid you'll reject her. You feel a bit weird at kissing Terri but steel yourself. You pull her close and put your arms around her, saying \"I love you, Jacqueline Duncan. It doesn't matter what you look like. I will always love you.\" That seems to click a switch in her and she throws herself at you, giving you a passionate kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kiss for several minutes, running your hands over each other's bodies. Your breathing is rapid as you become aroused and you fight the tempatation to rip off her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem!\" Terri interrupts you loudly. \"Guys, I don't mind you doing this with my body, but we do have a reception to go to. You need to wait until later. I really don't want to get a reputation for stealing my daughter's husband on her wedding day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jackie pull apart, breathing heavily. You are surprised at how turned on you are. Part of it is your love for Jackie, regardless of her body. But you suspect another part is that you would like to have sex with Terri. You decide you should probably keep that to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerri dithers over Jackie, straightening her makeup and clothes. \"There, now it doesn't look like 'my mother' has been making out with my husband. Okay, let's go. Remember, stay in character. It's only for a couple more hours.\"</span></div></div>",

She smiles and gives you an appraisal up and down finishing with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerry, you're a wonderful man. I wish I had waited and found someone like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you had, Jackie would have not come along, and we would never have met and become a family,\" you reassure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs and shakes her head. \"Who knows. Maybe <i>we</i> would have met.\" She winks at you. \"Actually, ...\" she starts then blushes that makes Jackie's face even prettier and shakes her head remaining silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Come - on. Spill it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just between you and me, OK?\" she whispers with her normal color back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you nod then puff yourself up and proclaim with mock authority, \"You can not make a husband testify against his wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerri giggles and again shakes her head. \"Actually, that's just it. I would be amiss to say that I haven't had thoughts of staying Jackie and stealing you away.\" You blush this time as she saunters up to you and finishes with a smirk, \"A mature woman might be able to show you a thing or two, ... or three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou burst out in a nervous laugh hoping she can't tell it's not real. You're actually frightened because of you're feelings for Jackie <i>with</i> Terri's body, plus that it's still hard to separate the physical and mental attraction. So Jackie's body in front of you, even without her inside, is very alluring. Terri became a close friend in the past year, and you just shared an intimate kiss with her physical body and found yourself extremely aroused by it. Actually, you're still hard in your pants, and Terri's little confession didn't do anything to calm that down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember that when you're holding Jackie - in my body. Now come on, Tiger,\" Terri purrs taking your hand with a wink. \"That should help us keep up the pretense until we can all escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerri always knows what to say, and this relaxes you perfectly, though it's another minute before your penis shrinks back comfortably. The two of you beam like true newlyweds as you enter the reception to cheers. You take your seats at the head of the table with Jackie sitting next to Terri so you can see her each time someone calls you to toast your wife and kiss her. You always look past Terri and at Jackie when you do, so much so that Jackie starts to look away after a while because she keeps blushing and your compliments and speech start being affected by the alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers may have noticed this, but you don't care. There's some new courage that's grown in you now, and it's not the champagne. You're starting to really see Terri's body as your true love. This doesn't mean that you'll break the charade or go after Terri when they switch back. It just gives you the strength to carry it all off better than you could ever have done before especially with your real lack of acting ability or a poker face for any lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the first dance is called, and you lead Terri to the floor. You have been practicing with Jackie and suddenly shudder wondering if Terri can waltz as planned. Your fears are soon dispelled as the two of you glide gracefully around the room, Jackie's weeding gown billowing like a princess at the ball. It makes your mind wander to Cinderella and whether midnight might break the spell, but here it would be in a good way returning your love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your mind just enjoying the scene and the mood, you wrap Terri in a bear hug at the end pulling her feet off the ground. She bends her knees moving feet up so they're ever further off. You start a deep kiss but are surprised and confused when her mouth barely opens and you can't twirl your tongue inside as Jackie always says she likes so much. It's then Terri uses Jackie's nails into your back to bring you back to reality, and you gently lower her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you whisper as another round of cheers erupts. \"I got carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just smiles and leads you back to the main table for the parent-newlyweds dance. She pulls out your dad and you take Jackie's hand. Well really it's Terri's body's hand since you're to dance with the bride's mother, but you know it's Jackie. Your heart begins that faster, loving beat it always does when you're with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt arms length you start and again float across the floor together as Terri and your dad do the same. However, as the tune plays you get closer and closer until it's time to dance with your mom and Jackie swirls off with your dad. Finally the formalities conclude, the floor soon fills with couples, and the music changes to a dance club beat as the reception becomes a full blown rocking celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie, Terri, and you manage to split most of the dances, although you had to dance with each bridesmaid. Jackie acts her part thoroughly as Terri, always coming to separate you from other women then dancing you back to Terri, usually taking her time. No one is the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, she dances you out onto a side patio then, with no one around, takes your hand and drags you off through the garden. Shortly you pass a sign that reads, \"Maze of Souls,\" but everyone calls it the Lover's Lost Maze because couples wander into one of its many dead ends and get lost in themselves. There are so many hidden spots that there is never a chance of anyone running into anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie runs with you for a minute dashing down this hedgerow and then another until you are boxed in from going on. You sit together on the stone bench. The romantic moonlight transforming Terri's features to appear as your beloved Jackie, her age disappearing with their looks being so close already. It is only a moment gazing into each others eyes before you clutch in a passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready breathing hard and hearts beating fast, it isn't long before you are fondling each other with desire, your penis trying its best to escape. Terri's body is just enough different from Jackie's to make you pause occasionally as your hands run over it, but it also gives you an extra thrill knowing it is different which makes your exploration even more exciting. Most important, though, is the knowledge that it is really your true love, Jackie, who you'd do anything and everything for and to be with even if the orb had switched her with your own mother. Unfortunately, that thought causes you to break off and sit back shuddering. Well, that and the fact that the bridesmaid dress is very peculiar and unique such that it is not about to allow you to get your hand inside or release it or your arousal to anywhere near what you need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of frustration, you chuckle, \"This isn't the right place, and that dress ... If I didn't know better, I would think it was meant to keep the bridesmaids in chastity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looks at you just as frustrated and offers with a pout, \"But I'm the <i>Matron</i> of Honor. It's too late for me. This one should have a quick release.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both laugh then sit for a few more minutes with your eyes locked lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just another hour, and we'll depart for the hotel. I can't wait,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terri already told me that she has an extra room so she wouldn't have to drive home. I'll leave in a little while and be there waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kiss briefly and tenderly again then say, \"We better get back before someone notices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you walk back out of the maze hand-in-hand. She takes one path back, and you take another through the garden. You think how daring and adventuresome this is becoming. Neither of you have ever considered anything like this. What a way to start off your marriage.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She always had been a strong young woman, and the hardships she endured from her husband walking out on her, made her even stronger. Nevertheless she was still glad when you came around to babysit Amanda when she would have to go her job. Amanda saw you as the father she never had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie and Karen got along great. Jackie never had a bigger sister, so she found herself pleasantly surprised with Karen around. Karen took around her as well, even though they were two opposites in characters. While Jackie was a more-outgoing girl, Karen preferred to spend time at home with Amanda. Jackie still acts more playful, Karen is more serious. Still they were like siblings and you and your sister were both surprised when Jackie asked Karen to be her maid of honor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what caused the bright flash that blinded you for several seconds, you look around to see if a light blew or what and only become aware of how quiet it is when you look back and see Jackie and Karen staring at each other as if in shock.

Then both women looked at each other, not sure if they should cry or do something else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were standing there in shock.

If one of the partners was unavailable through sickness or couldn't travel far, a replacement was sought and that person would stand in front of the church. This is the same thing, Jackie can't marry with Ger because she's in my body now, that's why I'm going to replace Jackie as the bride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds okay, though Jackie can easily travel.\" You told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\" Jackie said still looking sad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren walked over to Jackie. \"Look Jackie if you don't feel fine with that, we can do something else. When the priest asks me the question, you say at the same time as me I do. And I'll add \"not\" to my part. That way you and Ger are still married, is that fine with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie nods as she seems to almost cry. She then hugs Karen. Karen calms Jackie down as she looks at you. It was weird seeing Jackie's body being the one that receives the hug instead of Karen, though that brings you to the next subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is something I wanted to talk to you also about. I mean the two of you are really different in behavior, not that's something wrong with it but people will get suspicious if Jackie is more serious and vice versa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good point, let me think.\" Karen said as she closed her eyes. As she was thinking, her body shook suddenly. \"Mmm, I'm ready for it Tiger.\" Karen suddenly said as she walked over to you and leapt at your neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karen?\" You asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, Jackie of course duh tiger.\" She said rolling with her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. If I didn't know better, I would say that was me standing there.\" Jackie said as she stood up and looked at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but it's not that difficult. You only have to relax yourself a little Jackie, try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really that easy? Okay let me try.\" Jackie said a little excited as she closes her eyes. After a few seconds she was shaking the same as Karen. \"Yeah, I am feeling good Ger.\" Jackie answered speaking as slow as Karen would. She sat down and crossed her legs the same as Karen would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I told you.\" Karen said jumping up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it feels weird, but I find myself thinking much slower. I think we can pull this one.\" She said a bit more confident than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad of it, because we're a little late. We should hurry up.\" You told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go then.\" Karen said as she stood up and grabbed her bridal bouquet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was still looking at me. \"One last kiss for the road?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were unsure if you should, after all it was your sister's body. But you could see she had it difficult. So you closed your eyes as your lips touched Jackie's. It's a kiss for a few seconds before you let go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" She said smiling. Try not to run Ger.\" She said in a Karen way as she walked through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on hurry a little.\" Karen said as she grabbed your arm to hold it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now ready for your wedding.</span></div></div>",

When you held her hands standing in front of the priest you could see her glittering eyes looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get half of what the priest said during the minutes he spoke. You were so entrenched by the beauty besides you. It somehow scared you a little too. It was your older sister inside there, shouldn't she be a little more acting like herself? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't catch her doing something Karen would do, instead as Karen stares at the priest you noticed her hands. You saw her playing with her engagement ring. Something the real Jackie was always doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was time for the I do part. You look Karen straight in the eyes as the priest finishes the question. \"I do.\" You tell him quickly looking at Jackie. Jackie didn't notice your staring, instead focusing on the priest. Now it was time for Karen's turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the priest finishes his sentence you look at Jackie, the real one who was standing behind Karen. You can hear Karen saying I do and at the same time you see Jackie's lips doing the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you may kiss the bride.\" The priest said to me, waking me up. I looked at Karen's face, or Jackie's face. I was still a little stunned and as Karen looked around she grabbed me by my neck and kissed me on the lips. Those familiar lips greeted me, those same lips I kissed almost every day. It was almost natural for me to do it and I held Jackie's back as I kissed her. Jackie? I quickly tried to look at Jackie apologizing for my act, but before I could do something Karen grabbed me by my arm as we turned around to leave the church. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last time that day I spend time with the real Jackie. At the reception she congratulated me of course, but she had to act like Karen in front of the others and take care of Amanda. Then me and Karen had to dance in front of the others. She apparently inherited Jackie's dance skills. She danced wonderful, it was like nothing had happened.

Fortunately, you were booked First Class and didn't have any lines to wait in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Jackie, Karen grabbed your hand and was almost dragging you through the airport as she scurried along. What caught you most was the way she moved as if she was dancing. Her motions were so fluid that you completely forgot she wasn't Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you settled into your large, leather First Class seats, you both had some champagne then tried to snuggle across the divider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I gah-guess this is both br-bad and good for a wah-wedding night,\" Karen whispered with a bit of a slur in Jackie's voice, punctuating the end with the cutest burp - Jackie's burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that, Sweetness?\" you asked using one of your favorite pet names for Jackie and giving her a little tickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and jiggled in true Jackie form, and you couldn't stop yourself from giving her a passionate kiss. As it grew in intensity, your hand tried to reach over for her leg but hit something blocking your grope. As it climbed over the divider, a smooth, delicate hand met it, and your fingers intertwined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabin lights were dim by the time you opened your eyes. Jackie's eyes were staring at you and her lips turned and parted slightly with that beautiful smile you so loved. You sighed and tried to shift to be more comfortable, but it was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are big seats. Maybe we could share,\" you offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled then whispered back, \"Not going to happen.\" You pouted making her laugh again. \"That's what I meant about bad and good. A wedding night where the marriage can't be consummated, but we shouldn't be doing that anyway, Tiger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that the events just before the wedding resurfaced in your alcohol infused mind. This wasn't really Jackie. It was your sister. You hope she didn't notice the bulge in your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get some sleep. I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted. Being a bride really took it out of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled and moved your arms back into your seat. But your eyes couldn't let go. Here sat the love of your life - well, the body of the love of your life. You wanted her so much that you started to wonder if your love for Jackie was just physical lust. It was a good thing you were on a plane headed from the West Coast to Europe for a cruise. In a hotel room, Karen may have had to really fight you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, now. Close those big brown eyes before they swallow me whole,\" she tells you clearly with your sister's attitude and manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought back so many memories of the fun times you had with Karen growing up and after college until you met Jackie. Even then, she and Jackie hit it off and Karen was usually around and joining the two of you on occasion. Jackie even had Karen \"baby sit\" you when she had to leave town for business, and the two of you always managed to have great times together. You're glad it was Karen that switched. You can't imagine anyone else who would be compatible to carry this off until you figured out some way to get them switched back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, Sis,\" you pout again before adding what you always told her when she kept you from doing something stupid. \"You're no fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scowls then smirks, \"We'll see about that. It's a two week cruise, and the one <i>I've</i> always wanted to go on. You better not spoil it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, you couldn't  tell if it was Jackie or your sister with that tone. It was Karen who had convinced Jackie to take this cruise for the honeymoon. Did Karen arrange for the magic orb and know just when to come in so she could switch with Jackie? Did you sister have an erotic fantasy about being with you? Are you too drunk to think clearly? At least you knew the answer to the last.

It's then that you remember where you are, on the plane going on your honeymoon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment you open your eyes wide and to your surprise see Jackie's face close to you, her lips almost touching yours. \"Good morning sunshine.\" She says quickly giving a peck on the cheek. \"We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed it, thanks.\" You tell her looking out the window and seeing the landing strip. You're really here, almost going on your honeymoon. Karen looks uncomfortable about something as she wants to say something, but doesn't know what. \"We should really go, or else the plane will return back with us.\" Karen tells you as you stand up and stretch yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be a shame considering the cruise.\" You tell Karen as you grab your jacket and put it on. Together you leave the airplane, the stewardess wishing you a pleasant honeymoon. Karen replies that she knows it's going to be one. Walking next together at first you are embarrassed to hold Karen's hand. The last time you did that was when you were twelve years old and she was guiding you around the amusement park back home. Karen looks hesitant at first, but slowly she takes your hand in her own. \"Hey, we're a couple remember, we might as well look like one.\" She tells you. You nod to her suggestion as she is right of course. The only problem is that when you and Jackie would walk hand in hand, you automatically would stroke her hand gently with your thumb. It was a little thing that slipped right in, but you're not sure if Karen would appreciate it, so you try to prevent it from happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter collecting your luggage you're ready to leave the airport and head for the port where the cruise ship is lying. Standing outside there are a few cabs waiting, so you pick one out, throw your bags in the back of the car you step outside and head to the port. Inside the cab Karen has her head resting on your shoulder while holding your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is nice you know.\" Karen says after a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is.\" You confirm as you just hold her hand, not knowing what else to say. This behavior is typical of Jackie, but not so much of your sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to lye down on our bed in the cabin, looking through the porthole as we sail away. I have always dreamed of it.\" Karen says closing her eyes as she's already imagining it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, though we have to make sure the bags are properly divided in the middle. Can't have you get more space than I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren suddenly looks up to your reaction. \"What are you talking about Ger?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant the separation of the bed. I don't know about you, but it would really be awkward if we would you know, end up in a tangled mess, if you catch my drift.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a clear glance you expected, Karen looks upset. \"Gerald Duncan, don't you ever say things like that. If you do, I'll throw you off that ship myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but  Karen..\" You stutter as you are completely surprised Karen acts like Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shish, it's Jackie now. And don't act like that, when we were little we would sleep in the same bed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an entire different situation, grandma only had that spare bed for us to sleep on.\" You tell Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just pretend it's like that. And besides I don't want to throw my pillow to your head in case I need a well deserved massage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A massage?\" How did Karen know about that? You only talked about it in private with Jackie the day before yesterday discussing what you would do on the cruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, do you know how much a pain it is, wearing those heels?\" She says referring to the heels she wore during the wedding. She then grabs your arm tighter as she let her head rest on your shoulder. \"Come on tiger, just enjoy yourself. We don't have to go the whole way, but you should enjoy some of it.\" Karen says nodding off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just sit there with Karen hanging on your shoulder. You're in shock a little, not sure what to think of Karen's behavior. She had these little changes that made it like you were talking to Jackie here, it makes you wonder if the orb only switched their bodies. You're curious how Jackie is feeling inside Karen's body. Wait that's it! Perhaps you should call Jackie to see how she's doing. Or would that perhaps upset Karen?</span></div></div>",

Jacqueline and Amanda stand still facing one another as if in some sort of trance, while a strange energy flows visibly between them. You hesitantly walk toward them, unsure as to what is happening. \"Jackie? Amanda?\" you ask as you reach to grab Jackie. As soon as you touch her, she jerks back and the flow of energy suddenly stops. She turns to you slowly, appearing to be in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacqueline? Are you okay? Talk to me!\" you shout. Her eyes look a little glazed. \"Uncle Gerry?\" she says in a daze. \"What's going on?\" She drops her eyes and looks down at her body. \"What!?\" she says, starting to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the sound of Amanda clearing her throat. \"Gerry,\" she says calmly, \"I think that orb was real. Amanda and I have switched bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to her in disbelief while still holding Jackie, trying to ease her nerves. \"What? Are you kidding?.... Wait, how do you even know about that?\" you ask, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes you and Jackie by the hands and leads you over to some chairs. She tries to convince you that she's telling the truth. 'Jackie' calms down enough to join her, and you soon find yourself believing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" you ask feeling confused and panicky. Surprisingly, Jackie-in-Amanda's body seems calm and collected. Her ability to keep a cool ahead has always impressed you. \"We go on with the wedding for now. It's not like we can tell anybody, can we? We have the ceremony and then figure out what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When?\" you ask. \"We leave on the cruise tomorrow.\" (You and Jackie have a cruise to the Bahamas for your honeymoon).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs. \"Well, if we don't get time this evening, then you and Amanda will have to go. We can still communicate - phone, text, email, whatever - and come up with a plan. I can't believe that this is permanent. If we changed once, we can find a way to change again. We just need to make it through the immediate situation without alerting anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer calm demeanor helps both you and Amanda get a grip. In fact, after her initial distress, you suspect Amanda is actually excited about being able to be the bride in a wedding. You think she may be taking this all as some sort of game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you agree. \"Let's make it through today, then we'll see what happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn talking with both girls, though, you notice something about their speech, body language, and behavior.</span></div></div>",

It just looks and sounds strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie considers your words for a few minutes while Amanda looks on with a mixture of nervousness and excitement. Jackie has that look of intense concentration she always gets when trying to figure something out.  Then she relaxes and there's a visible shift in her body language. She bounces from one foot to the other while moving around as if full of nervous energy. \"Wow, this is totally awesome Uncle Gerry. I can't believe it's your wedding day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her in amazement. She drops the act. \"Like that?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" you answer.

Amanda looks at her in awe, her mouth agape and her eyes wide. \"Cool...\" she says. \"But I can't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie turns to her and takes her hand. \"Don't worry, Amanda. Just try to relax and control your movements more. And slow down when you talk, use a more even voice. Frankly, your role is actually easier. You can pass off any strange behavior today as 'wedding nerves.' It's the longer term issues that concern me; but we'll have to put those worries off for now.

By the time it is ready to begin a few hours later, you have almost convinced yourself that this morning was a strange dream or hallucination, brought on by your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand at the front of the church with your best man, watching the bridesmaids come down the aisle. Amanda looks very cute as she walks to the front - you'd think she was older than her 12 years if you didn't see her excitement and nervous energy as she bounced across the sanctuary. She winks at you and mouths \"Good Luck!\", and you supress a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the Wedding March plays and Jaqueline begins her walk down the aisle, escorted by her uncle. She looks radiant, like an angel in her dress, the train trailing far behind her. She comes up beside you and takes your hand, and you turn to face the minister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceremony passes like a blur - you can hardly remember any details. Jackie seems poised and elegant, not missing a beat. You manage to say all the right words and, before you know it, you hear \"I now declare you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take her in your arms and give her a long, deep kiss. At first she hesitates as if reluctant; but after a few seconds she throws herself into the kiss enthusiastically. It's weird - she feels a little inexperienced, like she's unsure what do to with her tongue. But you accept it as 'just nerves' and continue the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally break apart and the minister introduces you to the audience. You march back down the aisle and into a side room to wait for everyone to head to the reception. You have to wait on the photographer, so you won't be joining the reception for another hour or so. Jackie squeezes your hand excitedly. You whisper \"I love you!\" to her and she gives you an odd look. You don't get a chance for further conversation, though, as the photographer whisks you and the rest of the wedding party out for a grueling series of pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all wait good-naturedly, though, and finally it's all done. The whole wedding party hops in a limo to ride to the reception. Amanda manages to slip in the seat beside you, so you ride between her and Jackie.</span></div></div>",

You feel very uncomfortable at that type of contact from your niece. Yet it was also a little erotic, and that makes you feel even more guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks a little sad. \"I just wanted one real kiss on my wedding day.\" Then she suddenly smiles brightly at you and says \"good luck Uncle Gerry!

You put on a smile and dance with your \u201cwife\u201d. After a few dances you try to distance yourself as much from Amanda as you could. Which isn\u2019t a lot because you two had to be basically glued to each other\u2019s hip. You chit chat with the guests and Amanda isn't afraid to chime in. It starts to bother you that she is able to act exactly like Jackie. They don't see it like you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Jackie in Amanda\u2019s body sits at the kid\u2019s table with the other children. You wish that you could go over there and sweep her off her feet. She notices you staring and you both quickly divert your gazes. You see her smile slightly as she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know your honeymoon doesn't technically start till tomorrow, but you two newlyweds have a fun, and safe night.\u201d Your mom says to you. You groan with embarrassment. You and Amanda leave the reception in a fancy limousine. She is ecstatic. When you both sit down inside says that she has never ridden in a limo before. You aren't sure if that is Jackie talking or Amanda. You turn your head and stare out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two arrive back at the hotel that you and Jackie were using the day before. Closing the room door you collapse on the bed, relieved that you can finally drop the charade. Even for just a night. Amanda sits down on the bed next to you. She clearly had a fun time today and you were upset that Jackie wasn't able to experience her own wedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today was so amazing Gerry!\" She beamed. \"I'm glad that your dance moves have improved since our sophomore dance.\"<br>\r\nYou snap. \"Stop it Amanda! Stop using her memories! They aren't yours.\" You sit up and bury your face into your hands. You feel Amanda get up from the bed and you look up at her. She isn't mad, but she is hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Gerry, it's just so easy to slip into her personality I don't even realize I'm doing it. I'm going to go for a walk.\" You start to protest, but she quickly leaves the hotel room. You slowly get up and walk over to the mini-fridge and pour yourself a drink. You shouldn't be feeling like this after your wedding. <br>\r\nA couple of drinks later you hear a knock at the door. You put down the drink to go let Amanda back inside. To your surprise it isn't Amanda, but Jackie!<br>\r\n\"Jackie! What are you doing here?\" You say as she lets herself into the hotel room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Amanda drove over and picked me up. She said that I should be with you tonight.\" You gulp. \"I am your wife aren't I?\" Seeing Jackie's mischievous smile on your niece's face is odd to say the least, but you can see Jackie inside her. You nervously smile back and nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do? I still love you Jackie, but you are 12 years old now. It's not like we could just start over, I'm over twice your age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure something out.\" She gently touches your leg. You look into her eyes and only see Jackie. The extra drinks you had earlier helped you lean in for a kiss. She recuperates and you two are passionately kissing. Suddenly she breaks the kiss. You look at her and she is quietly weeping. \"I'm sorry I was just scared that I would never be able to kiss you again.\" You smile and she laughs.
