            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erina Pendleton had never felt so revolted in all her life. Here she was cleaning her mouth out with puddle water while the most vile of villains screamed curses at her. Dio Brando was every bit the rapscallion. Arrogant and evil. Jojo had described him to her perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking of Jojo made her feel sick now. Dio had sullied her. Taken her first kiss away. How could she face him now? How could she face the man she loved and tell him he'll never be her first. Dio had essentially taken their blooming romance and killed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was on her knees in the dirty, cleaning the taste of Dio out of her mouth with filthy puddle water. The very action only served to enrage him. His massive ego would not abide her actions. In his mind he was leagues above everyone else. In his mind she should be honored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you!\" he screamed, yanking the poor girl from the ground. Erina was scared and even Dio's entourage looked nervous. \"I am the great Dio! How dare you disrespect me like so?! You should feel honored I gave someone as lowly as you the time of day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sealed his insult by giving her a hardy slap across the face. This action caused Dio's entourage to go silent. Despite being a band of misfits, they had never actually struck a woman. There were simply some lines they just wouldn't cross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain that shot through her was immense, but her resolve to get Dio's taste out of her mouth was stronger. Again she went back to washing her mouth out. Even if it made her situation worse, she had to. If she could she would teach this brute a lesson herself. But she lacked the strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she were bigger and stronger. She'd make Dio answer for his crimes against her and Jojo. If only she were just bigger. She closed her eyes tightly and continued to clean out her mouth. Had anyone been paying closer attention, they would've noticed the strange green substance in the puddle that made it's way into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Dio. Let's get out of here.\" One of his \"friends\" suggested. The other's agreed. Dio was about to indulge them until he heard a violent and wet cough come from the downed blonde girl. No doubt choking on puddle water. It did Dio's heart good to see karma at work. It's what she deserved for rejecting his mighty kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he left he might as well get one more jab in. With a wolf-like grin on his face he walked over to the downed girl who had suddenly stopped her thorough mouth cleaning. She yipped in shock briefly at being hoisted up by her elbow. Dio was about to give her a good verbal thrashing before his words suddenly died in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis instincts were all of a sudden screaming at him. Growing up in the slums had taught him many things before being adopted into the Joestar family. One was to trust his gut. But why was his gut telling him to run far away? And from Erina Pendleton no less? How could this girl even register on his danger scale?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it hit him through the silence. He released her elbow once he made eye contact. It finally donned on him that he was no longer looking down at her, to be more precise he had to crane his eyes slightly upward to meet hers! WHAT! He could've sworn he was taller than her just a few minutes ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when a sound hit him. Like that of tearing fabric. He instinctively took a step back at he watched the blue dress of the girl start tearing in certain places. Just what was going on here? She must not have known because she looked just as confused as everyone else. Dio's eyes widened as yet another realization hit him. He was having to now crane his neck upward to maintain eye contact. Erina Pendleton was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErina couldn't make heads or tails of wat was going on. For a second or two she felt ill. The next her clothes began to feel tight against her skin. Then Dio was yanking her to her feet to no doubt further insult her. Then she was stunned into silence when he suddenly went silent. Did he get smaller all of sudden because last she checked she had to look up to meet his gaze, not the other way around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't stop there though. Her clothes began to feel even tighter until they finally started to give and rip apart. Dio and the world around her began to shrink. No! To be more accurate, she began to grow. But how? It wasn't physically possible to grow at such an alarming rate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoes were the next thing to give as they completely burst open, revealing her bare feet. She was scared now. How was this happening and how big would she get? Dio and company didn't even move as they were frozen in shock. Little by little they began to dwindle in her eyes as her height rose. She just kept growing and growing and growing and growing until finally it began to slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer height finally capped off at one-hundred feet tall. Her dress had long since been torn asunder and was now hanging off her like a skirt and bra. How that much survived she'd never know. She was massive. The tree down below barely reached above her ankle. This was unbelievable. She then remembered her desire by the puddle to be bigger and stronger. Was this a direct result of that wish? Did wishes really come true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Dio and his \"friends\" were left stunned. Little Erina Pendleton had just grown into a giant. It was like something out of an phantasy epic. This defied all logic. She was massive. A monster. What else could she be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDio felt nothing but dread in the pit of his stomach. This what his instincts were warning him about. Erina had just become a threat like no other. Remembering his past transgressions towards her made his face go pale. He was afraid. Afraid of what she could now do to him once her own shock wore off. He needed to get out of here. Get help. Perhaps the people could chase away the monster with their torches and pitchforks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Dio and Co, could even attempt an escape, a loud cough demanded their attention. They all gulped before breaking out into a cold sweat. Slowly but surely they all looked up to meet the bigger girl's face, She starred them all down with her hands on her hips and displeasure written all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going somewhere?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yoshikage Kira was victorious. Fate once again smiled upon him as he was able to turn back the hands of time. Bites the dust was invincible. \"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" the serial killer laughed. He was unrivaled, no one would ever threaten his tranquility again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it! I was able to return! I was able to activate bites the dust again!\" He laughed to himself, his arms spread wide. \"HAHAHAHAHAHA! I beat them all! I'm finally free! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe madman's manic laughter continued until it was interrupted by a strange sight... Birds? Or rather, how they flew past him. \"What was that just now? Those birds flew in from behind me, and... Just what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it. Something else was off. Yoshikage Kira found himself is some sort of back ally maze. \"Come to think of it, this isn't the normal route I take to work... But if Bites the dust did turn back the hands of time by one hour then, then I should be on my way to work right now. What time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe killer in disguise pulled back his suit sleeve to find his wrist bare. It then dawned on him that he'd removed his watch earlier and placed it in his pocket. Reaching into the inner pocket of his suit he pulled out his watch, only to be left stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible, but... \"What is this!? Why is it broken!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed his watch was still smashed to pieces from his last encounter with Josuke and his band of merry men. In Kira's warped mind this made no sense. Nothing did at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 8:29am! Bites the dust did go into effect again! The watch Hayato destroyed with Stray Cat should have returned to normal, too!\" Kira freaked. This made no sense! Nothing made sense! Why was his watch still broken! He activated bites the dust again, didn't he!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his world began to spin. He felt sick. He shut his eyes. Something was clearly wrong! But what was it!? What was amiss!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAVE YOU FIGURED IT OUT YET!?\" A voice asked. It sound familiar, powerful, and at the same time so far away. Slowly but surely the deranged STAND user opened his eyes and found that his surroundings had changed yet again. Instead of being in the maze like before he was now surrounded by two massive pale pillars. The ground beneath him had even changed to a pure shad of violet. Was this some sort of carpet? Just where was he now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot thinking much of it the killer walked up to one of the pillars and rubbed his hand against it. It felt odd. Not like hard stone but instead soft and smooth. It left Kira with more questions than answers. Just what kind of pillars were these? \"What on earth is going on here?\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were getting way too bizarre for his liking. He had no idea where he was, his watch was still broken, and then their was that strange voice. Kira couldn't process properly what was happening... All he knew for certain was it was time to leave... Wherever the hell this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could take another step he heard the telltale sound of the voice again. \"SO THE KOSAKU KAWAJIRI THAT ROHAN TOOK A PICTURE OF WAS ACTUALLY IN FACT, YOSHIKAGE KIRA... AND THAT MEANS IT'S FINALLY OVER, DOESN'T IT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira was freaking out now. Where was that voice coming from? He frantically began to search around his surroundings before finally looking up. Once he did he instantly regretted it. Sweat began to pour down his face as he began to back away. It was another pale pillar that reached up high into the sky. A sky that was now being blocked out by... A giant face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEY FINALLY MANAGED TO CORNER YOU, YOSHIKAGE KIRA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight was so unreal, Kira actually fell back. This was a girl, a giant young woman. This defied all the laws of reality, even to a STAND user like himself. \"W-wha\u2026? Who are you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a valid question. He didn't know her but she obviously knew him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME? I GUESS THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. FIFTEEN YEARS IS A LONG TIME. OH WELL. IT DOESN'T MATTER! YOU'RE HERE NOW... AND ALL MINE.\" the girl said emotionlessly. \"IS MY SANDAL COMFORTABLE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandal, Kira wondered. He then looked closer and the violet floor he was on, and the two pale pillars that surrounded him. It then suddenly cliqued. He was tiny, and he was sitting in between this girl's toes. WHAT THE HELL!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKira gulped nervously. Things weren't looking too good for him. \"W-what are your intensions for me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were her intensions indeed? </span></div></div>",

Coming back from school, he was covered in what seemed to be glue and feathers as Francis decided to replace him for the school pinata they had set up for the International Festival Day. Groaning from the pain, he entered his room as Cosmo poofed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there champ, why so glum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a pinata is one of the worst lives to ever live,\" Timmy groaned as he laid on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, you tell me, I covered once for my friend Stretcho the Clown Fairy, and it wasn't as fun as I thought it would be,\" Cosmo said with a hint of shivering in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only good thing I can get from this was,\" Timmy sighed in happiness, \"Was seeing Trixie hit me with the bat. She looked so graceful and beautiful as she beat me up for candy.\" It wasn't a secret that Timmy had a crush on Trixie for the longest time, it was so strong that he would even endure any pain given to him, especially if it was from her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmo looked at this and was conjuring up an idea he had. A terrible one as Wanda would put it. But she wasn't around at the moment, Cosmo had all custody in fulfilling Timmy's wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you wouldn't mind if Trixie was the one hurting you then?\" He asked mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh...no, heck I wouldn't mind what she would do to me, as long as she did it,\" jumping from the bed in an excited stance as all the pain he felt had simply vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then sport,\" Cosmo said as his wand glowed, \"Do I have a show for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go ahead Cosmo, I wish you did whatever you had in plan for me!\" And with that the wand glowed and flash. Quickly running to the window, Timmy stared at Trixie's house across the street as he waited for whatever was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside her home, Trixie was laying on her bed, disposing of all the fan mail she had received and just....admiring herself for the most part. Not a worry in her world, except her world was to change in a drastic way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly felt a strange tingling sensation across her body. With no time to react she quickly hit her head on her ceiling, \"Ow, what the-\" She didn't get to finish as she felt her body become...maturer. Her hip became curvier, her legs longer and sleeker, while her breasts began to rose. Wanting to question once more, she didn't get a chance as she sprouted once again crashing out of her home and demolishing her house with the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking confused, she looked around noticing that she had grown to quite the size of a hundred feet or so. Meanwhile,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cosmo, what did you do?!\" Timmy furiously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you now, just grew the love of your life into a smoking, irresistible, giantess.\" He said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairy magic, you really think I was gonna allow anyone to die? It's against Da Rulez anyways,\" He said as he poofed the giant book and showed the exact rule right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well....in that case then...\" Timmy was pondering what to do and so was Trixie at her sudden change.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her boot alone covered the width of two lanes, adding only giddiness to the already beautiful pre-teen. Although her body looked more mature, her mind was still that of her young self-resulting in very unpredictable actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked away, causing more potholes than any rain would ever make, Timmy couldn't help but stare as Trixie swung her hips with each step. Was that she always did, or was he just noticing? Nevermind that, he quickly turned to Cosmo and pulled him by his shirt, \"We need to keep an eye on her, who knows what could happen?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax,\" Cosmo assured him, \"like Da Rulez say, no death, so there's no possible way anyone can die.\" <br>\r\n\"Only, to be in a huge amounts of pain,\" he realized immediately with an annoyed Timmy staring at him, \"Alright then, let's go.\" As they quickly turned into pursuit at the monolithic teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie in the meantime couldn't help but be in amazement at her surroundings, everyone was looking up at her-fueling her ego even more-and it only helped with her enlarged breasts and curvier hips. She flaunted her beauty as she swing her hair with her hand, hearing a lot of whistling and cheering from the crowds.<br>\r\nOf course being focused on that, she tended not to watch her step. Incoming traffic was being demolished under her sole as they screamed, darkness would fall, feel the mother of all pressure, and then be over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo red splats or smears of blood where found, but you did find a lot of people with stars spinning over their head while others complained of the back pain they always suffered. Much like regular day to day life in Dimsdale. The greatest reaction was from the old cook, Crocker who was waiting in traffic as he beeped his horn at everyone. \"Imbeciles move already! Can't you see I have important <b>FAIRY GODPARENTS, </b> catching to do,\" Saying that last line in his spastic movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he took a swing of his coffee, he spit it out splashing on his eyes, \"Ah My EYES!!!\" Wiping them clean he then screamed, \"AH MY GIANT STUDENT! Surely the work of <b>FAIRY GODPARENTS!</b>\" Twitching once more only to be flatten by Trixie's boot in a second and then released by the next. A woozy and beaten Crocker crawled out from the flatten steel he used to call a car as he pointed out, \"or...maybe it could have been one of my experiments running loose again,\" before passing out from pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Timmy riding Cosmo as a bird could only barely keep up with the buxom brunette as every step widen the gap between them. \"Cosmo anyway to stop this.\" <br>\r\n\"Unless she gets tired of it, then no.\" Answering in his usual dopey self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" Trixie pondered as she stopped for a minute, causing cars to crash into her boots and pile on. \"New York is such a far distance from here,\" looking northeast as she could faintly see the outlines of other cities. \"What I would do to get their faster,\" She pouted only to be rewarded with another familiar feeling, the same one she felt in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh,\" Cosmo said. \"What, what is it?!\" Timmy asked alarmed.<br>\r\n\"Brace yourselves!\" As he flew away from Trixie as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie looked down at herself as she began to smile and feel glee. The cars piled next to her, where now being pushed away as if they were pebbles. Her line of sight was increasing as her head was reaching higher altitudes. The telephone lines began to snap as her body pressed against them as they could not take the pressure from her. Trixie placed her hands on her hips as she waited for her process to finish and just peered at the every shrinking world underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon from a hundred feet she expanded to that of two, then three, then four, and now reaching five hundred, perhaps even a tad bit more. But soon the process finished as she smiled and looked around, she thought she was big before, now this was the start of something.</span></div></div>",

Small and weak, while she was big and tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she didn't mean to hurt them, but she also wanted to flaunt her power towards them.

One of the most despicable persons on the planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEgotistical.<br>\r\nMoney Hungry.<br>\r\nRude.<br>\r\nEvil.<br>\r\nSadistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust plain not a great person to either hang out with, or just be around. Which what Timmy was doing at this point. After he sacrificed his freedom for the greater good of the planet, Timmy still had to endure every horror that Vicky would come up with it. He still wondered how his parents where so blind to the obvious psychopath that Vicky was. Then again he remembered his dad believed that money came out of a cow's uterus, so he shouldn't had been that surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, he had his Fairly Odd Parents around, who constantly protected him and granted, any desire he had in his heart. Unfortunately, on the other hand, they where off to vacation this week, and the next following weeks to come. Fortunately, they left him with a more than capable device-shaped like a mix of a calculator and a tv remote-to grant him any wish that he wanted. Wanda mentioned that it shouldn't be left alone, or in the wrongs, or something along those lines, but for Timmy was preoccupied as he was messing with the device more than paying attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the remote severely unattended and also leaving it in the worst possibles areas to leave a remote. I.e. the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky had kicked the front door of the house as she slumped herself into the living room couch. She knew her bosses weren't around to tell her anything, always either taking vacations or leaving their twerp alone. She thought nothing of them as she only saw them as a means to get easy money. Too easy. So easy, she could do whatever she wanted while she was here. Might as well, no one was gonna tell her no at this point. Leaning in to grab the remote to the television, she noticed the strange device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heck is this,\" She said in her gruff voice as she quickly analyzed the thing. It looked like a remote, yet the strange dials on the sides and front threw her off as she never had seen any model like this before. She shrugged it off, believing it was probably a newer model that her idiot bosses bought just because it looked shiny. Leaning back unto her usual spot, she pointed the remote towards the television as she pressed the power button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an immediate response, but basically, the TV had exploded in a flash of color and smoke as Vicky stood up rather quickly, thinking she had broken the device on accident. Worrying about her pay getting deducted, she quickly started to notice the smoke clearing away as the television was still there, only for it to be covered in weird pink fur. Stupefied by the result, she was reluctant to do anything as she picked up the controller once more and started to really analyze everything about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she discovered the dials were named and separated, into power, intensity, and desire. A strange feature, but she shook it off as there was a pink fur tv in front of her. Slowly, she pointed the control again and pressed the power button once more. The television worked fine! Even turning on and playing shows, even though it would have been scientifically impossible. Vicky jaw dropped as she saw the apparatus work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down once more on the remote, she looked at it curiously, <i>What else could it do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doubted it was only good for one thing. Messing once more with the dials she raised the desire dial all the way up, and the power one somewhere in the middle, along with the intensity one. Then, she pointed the remote towards the floor and thought of anything. \"Hmm, some ice cream would be good now.\" She thought to herself as the remote glowed and immediately three large bowls of ice cream sundaes appeared. She grinned as she was very well pleased that the remote acted upon her commands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiddling once more with the dials, she pointed the remote once more to the TV, wishing for it to be back to normal, and larger than it once was. Immediately did her command became true as the television not only was normal, but was a large curved flat screen displaying only the latest channels and shows. This only made Vicky's grin, grow even larger as she looked at the remote as if it where a miracle sent gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending a good few hours messing with it, she finally figured out the device had certain features to it.<br>\r\nOne, it made anything she wished for real.<br>\r\nTwo, the desire dial made the chances of it happening occur-which she always kept at maximum.<br>\r\nThree, the power one affected how strong that wish was going to be.<br>\r\nAnd finally, the intensity affected how much of an area it was going to affect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving this newfound information, she looked at herself in the mirror. Nature hadn't been kind to her, but with this new device, she could change that within a matter of seconds. But then she noticed the stairs leading up to the twerp's room, she could have some fun with this new power of hers. Oh decisions, decisions.</span></div></div>",

As Vicky marched up the stairs and saying \"Hey Twerp, I have a surprise for you!\" She heard some muffled conversation, usually she would shrug it off, thinking the Twerp's either on the phone, or just playing with his toys and talking to himself like her own sister, but this time, Vicky heard voices she never heard before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMad at him for having friends over, she burst through the door ,seeing, Timmy, a winged woman Timmy's height with swirly pink hair, some sort of baton in her hand, and floating 4ft off the floor, another man with wings, green hair that looks almost identical to Timmy's own hair, and a baton as well, floating at the same height as the woman, and last she saw a little purple and samon colored orb with a rattle and little wings, realizing it's a baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh No! Guys, I wish Vicky was back in the living room and she doesn't remember any of this!\" Timmy yelped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, the three floating being raised their batons and rattle, having them glow, making an odd noise, followed by the sound of someone blowing raspberries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH COME ON! WHAT IS THE REASON THE WISH DIDN'T WORK THIS TIME?\" Timmy whined. <br>\r\n\"Probably, because she's holding the Heart of Magic, shielding her from all other acts of magic while simultaneously giving her absolute power over literally everything.\" The green guy said in a shrill, monotone voice. \"Wanda!?! What's Cosmo yapping on about?\" The Twerp whined. \"Well, Cosmo does have a Masters Degree in Mystical Ancient Artifacts, Legends, and Myths. The only class he passed with flying colors. The onlt fairy that has scored so high ever.\" The pink one, called 'Wanda' responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said the heart slipped from her grip, pushing against her chest, disappearing into Vicky, B-cup breast and fusing with her heart. <br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh...That's not good. Now she's inseparable from the heart, as well as invulnerable, immortal,..\" As Cosmo was giving exposition, Vicky started to grow wings as black as deep space. \"...And grow wings allowing her to travel faster than light itself.\" Cosmo finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Vicky said. With that, she banished Cosmo, Wanda, and Poof, from Earth Forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOO!!! Bring them back Vicky. Please.\" Timmy begged. <br>\r\n\"Oh, you  might want to worry about yourself, Twerp!\" She said as she shrank Timmy to the size of a strawberry seed.

Who are all these people? And where am I at?\" He wondered out loud as the menacing Dr. Claw from the nearby speakers issued out of nowhere <br>\r\n\"Poor,dimwitted Gadget once more you have fallen into my trap and now I shall dispose of you!\" The robotic private eye was looking around in utter confusion <br>\r\n\"Where is that voice coming from? Did you hear that voice just now? I wonder where it came from?\" He asked a nearby MAD Agent who rolled his eyes in annoyance <br>\r\n\"It is I Gadget Dr.Claw your sworn nemesis!\" <br>\r\n\"Wait a minute you mean you're Dr. Claw? But you're in a speaker box! How am I going to arrest you when you're in a box?\" Gadget asked <br>\r\n\"He's the one speaking through the speaker box you moron!\" One of the MAD Agents said also annoyed \"Seriously why is the boss so worried about this guy? He can't even find his way out of a paper bag! Let's just put him out of his misery.\" <br>\r\n\"No! Gadget must be properly disposed of! Begin the countdown on the bomb strapped to Gadget!\" Came Claw's voice again from the speakers <br>\r\n\"Right boss!\" Said the last MAD Agent as he pressed on the switch on the bomb but at that moment Gadget's young niece Penny who was as usual trailing her uncle's whereabouts fell through the wooden plank boards overhead <br>\r\n\"Uh oh!\" She thought as the MAD Agents screamed out <br>\r\n\"Hey it's that little girl! Get her!\" <br>\r\n\"Uncle Gadget Help!!\" Penny cried out as the men began a almost tug of war with trying to grab hold of her Gadget seemed to be shaken out of his stupor <br>\r\n\"Penny? Is that you? What are you doing here? It's very dangerous here young lady! I suggest you go home at once I'll take care of these MAD Agents.....\" <br>\r\n\"But Uncle Gadget They got me please help!!\" While running from the Agents Penny managed to defuse the bomb and pulled her uncle to his feet \"Come on Uncle Gadget...\" <br>\r\n\"Hold on Penny I have to take care of these MAD Agents and arrest Dr. Claw my special fishing net ought to do it Go,go Gadget Net!\" As he hit the wrong button on his waistcoat and a ray gun appeared out of his hat and fired right at Penny who shrieked <br>\r\n\"Wait Uncle Gadget that's not a fishing net.....That's your growth ray......Ahhhhh it just hit me I feel weird...... What's going on!!\" Penny cried out as she immediately started growing in size and height the MAD Agents who were chasing her suddenly backed up staring at the growing little girl in shock <br>\r\n\"What the- The little girl's growing! Quick let's get out of here before she wrecks the whole place!\" As Penny's body was quickly filling up the warehouse and Gadget as usual was clueless to what just happened <br>\r\n\"Wowsters! Why has everything gotten so dark all of a sudden? And where is everyone going?\" As he observed the Agents running for their lives but not his niece growing at a alarming rate before him <br>\r\n\"Uncle Gadget please help!! I...I'm growing.....\" She cried out terrified as her head literally hit the ceiling and part of it started to cave in <br>\r\n\"Penny? Is that you? Your voice sounds different.\" Gadget pondered what was going on knowing her uncle wasn't going to be of much help Penny decided she had to think of a way out of this but first she hoped she would stop growing <br>\r\n\"Ohh why did this had to happen to me? I hope I stop growing soon.....oh no I'm already too big Whoa!!\" As she grew right through the ceiling leaving her uncle on the ground still not understanding what was going on meanwhile Dr. Claw also fled the hide out when the giant Penny appeared on his viewing screen <br>\r\n\"What th- It's Gadget's niece she's been turned into a giant!

Now to try it at full power!\" At this the scientist aims the sprayer through an open window without realizing it and fires shooting out a huge cloud of smoke into the open sky, not know who the spray would effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Back with the chipettes)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney and Jeanette giggle at the astonished look on their waitress' face as Eleanor finishes of her 16th plate of food onto a stack of plates beside her, \"When you know Eleanor and her appetite as well as we do you don't even need a garbage disposal!\" The siblings say together with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly without warning the cloud of smoke from earlier appears, Everyone in the area quickly bolts all except for Eleanor who's to busy eating! \"Ooooohhh!

Why do you ask?\" The man smiles and says \"Let's just say I think I know how to fix this mess.\" This gets the attention of the two girls very quickly as they shout \"What HOW??\" The man smiles at that as he begins to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I've heard there's a rare clove of garlic that can help your sister, but the thing is it's in the forest somewhere.\" Britney just says \"Whatever let's just go find that garlic already!\" The man puts his hands up in defense as he says \"No. Where you two need to be is with your sister. I'll go get the garlic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said the group separates, after a while the girls find their sister stuck between a rock &amp; a hard place so to speak. \"Eleanor!!\" they shout as they come in between their sister &amp; the townspeople to stop them from doing something stupid. \"Wait everyone, Stop!\" Britney shouts out getting everyone's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen everyone, this has all been a huge misunderstanding!\" This causes the townspeople to mumble in confusion as Britney continues to explain, \"There's someone coming with an antidote to what caused our sister to grow giant! All we need to do is wait for him.\" After about 20-30 minutes The man comes back with a giant clove of garlic trailing behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd looks on in shock at the man before he says \"Hey Eleanor was it?\" the man asks to which Eleanor nods \"Well, Eleanor. Eat up!\" The man shouts with a grunt as he flings the garlic upto the giant chipette, who catches it in her mouth and downs the thing in seconds.

I'm all out of other ideas Krang if I had some of my advanced weaponry....I could think of a better one!\" \"Well you're not getting even a simple laser pistol from me until you can prove you can beat the Turtles on your own still I don't see how transforming yourself and those two morons is going to aid you in anyway...but still if you think it will get the job done then go for it! Krang out!\" As the Shredder ordered his minions to head to the surface world and steal the device as he had to remain below to continue working on the Technodrone. At the local New York Science Emporium the scientist was just preparing to explain and show a demonstration to how the device resembling a telescope with a laser attached to the end was supposed to work the event of course was being broadcasted by the local Channel 6 News with top lead reporter April O Neil covering the whole story being this was the only news coverage  she had in a long time as things were pretty quiet in NY for a while \"Okay the device is ready for its first run!\" The scientist said as he gave the okay sign to fire the main button at a nearby display of fruit and vegetables on a nearby table when the ground beneath the floor burst open and two hideous creatures sprang out of nowhere \"We'll take that doc!\" The massive rhino said everyone present screamed and ran for the nearest exit all except for April who gasped \"Bebop and Rocksteady? What are you two numbskulls doing here? Don't tell me the Shredder has another evil plan to destroy the city!\" \"Yep sure does you brown nose bimbo reporter! And this time em Turtles ain't going to come to the rescue cause we're going to take you with us! Grab her Bebop!\" Rocksteady yelled to his warthog partner \"Sure thing.\" But being clumsy he tripped over one of the electric cables in the room allowing April to evade him \"Call to contact the Turtles right away!\" She thought as she played almost a game of tag as one couldn't catch her as much as the other they eventually tired out and exhausted both collapsed on the ground as she breathed a sigh of relief and pulled out the Turtles' communicator April had no idea she was right in the line of fire the prototype growing machine was positioned right at her \"Oh No Miss O Neil  quick duck! The device it's going to.....\" The head scientist screamed but she turned too late \"Huh?\" The laser struck her right in the midsection and April shrieked instantly feeling funny her whole body was literally stretching and expanding \"Hey Wh...what's going on?\" She cried \"Oh no I was afraid of this it appears you got a full dose of my machine's atomic energy and it's causing your body to expand like crazy!\" The scientist explained getting highly alarmed as the news reporter with her yellow jumpsuit intact began to rapidly fill up the whole building her enormous white boots went through walls and her head burst right through the skyline ceiling \"Ahhhhhh doc please make it stop!

Immediately the road paved, cars were demolished and some windows were shattered with the after shake. \"Sorry, can't really help it!\" April said in a concerned tone as she lifted her right leg only to have the same event occur again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a couple of steps as April was finding it harder and harder to continue going. New York was such a tight city already and it's infrastructure showed as the buildings were tightly built together, with roads even tighter, making leg and hip room for April increasingly difficult. Not to mention that citizens kept panicking around her as they would run away at the latest of times, making her descending steps harder as she waited for everyone to move out of the way. Some looked from the rooftops, even taking out some private cameras to fill what they could, increase her nervousness about the situation already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually her usual walk cycle couldn't fit through the streets anymore, therefore she turned sideways as her breasts pressed against one building while her bottom on the other, making the getting out part even more difficult. And with the buildings towering over her, it was harder to not get a bit claustrophobic as she continued on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after taking a few more steps into the street, she started to feel...tighter. April opened her eyes in shock as she realized what it was. The more she went in, the tighter the area was around her, and the more tedious it was to move without causing any heavy damage. So far she was lucky as she pressed to one side to move one of her assets, while the weight was being barely supported by the building but now with this problem-she could barely find any room to move even!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she was stuck, between two buildings, with her breasts squeezed in tightly against railings while her butt was pressed firmly against already tighten windows. \"Oh dear, what now?\" </span></div></div>",

It forced her clamped cherry lips apart, making them quiver like bacon. The ones that could see the devastation quickly advancing toward them would have given the burp monikers such as \u2018tornado\u2019, \u2018earthquake\u2019, and even \u2018tsunami\u2019 &amp; \u2018nuclear bomb\u2019. Each of them was very apt, as it had shared many similarities with all of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belch itself was so powerful that every building within the surrounding city block was instantly demolished. People, animals, vehicles, and debris were sent flying for miles by the 1,000 mile per hour gales that April's burp produced. Many of them died from the whiplash, others had their bodies actually torn to shreds by the current, and more still from the collisions with the remaining structures and aforementioned debris. As the radius of destruction expanded, so too did the volume of the gaseous roar. All those closest to the recently enlarged giantess were spontaneously deafened, their eardrums exploding in a gush of liquid hemoglobin as the outer part of her belch formed a domed shockwave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the very ground beneath Miss O\u2019Neil\u2019s giant feet was not safe. The vibrations made by her eructation connecting to the streets caused deeply buried sediment to be unearthed. Enormous cracks split open Times Square, the Empire State Building collapsed into the dark underground world, and the Chrysler Building tipped over, flattening the unfortunate souls in its way. New York\u2019s ports fared no better, the fierce winds and chaotic shifting of rock whipping up the tallest, widest, and fastest tidal waves ever recorded in human history. Grimy sea vessels containing various trading goods, basic fishing boats with only a couple boarders, and even yachts housing the wealthy elite farther out at sea; all of them capsized , sending their occupants to a watery grave. Even the Statue of Liberty, one of <i>THE</i> symbols of the city easily recognizable around the world, could not withstand the unnatural disaster. The pedestal was first to go, any poor tourists visiting drowned in the tides. Then, the sea level rose, swiftly enveloping the copper woman\u2019s little piggies and knees. After a few minutes, Lady Liberty was swallowed by the displaced New York Harbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after five ungodly minutes, the monstrous eructation had ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a sight there was to behold following it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a single building was still erect in the aftermath, even the grandest skyscrapers were no more than rubble. The popular beaches resting near where the ocean once was were abandoned, no umbrellas or beach balls around to indicate that anyone was vacationing there. The waters themselves were completely gone, leaving a sandy barrier to separate the island of Manhattan from the rest of the state. In a few hours, the water would return to fill the gap, rushing in with enough force to flood the remains of the once thriving metropolis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhole city blocks were rendered tiny islands themselves, unconnected from each other by the giant abysses that were leagues in depth. It would be impossible to traverse such a fractured terrain. Long stretches of Sewer line were brought to the surface, spouting hundreds of gallons of filthy H2O. It\u2019s safe to say that whatever beings dwelling in there were unlikely to have survived, maybe even the turtles had finally met their end. A thought that April would rather not focus, given the entire trauma that she\u2019d have to endure afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the worst thing to come out of this was the \u2018fallout\u2019, so to speak. A thick cloud of sickly green fog descended unto the lifeless streets, so solid that any living being caught in it would be utterly unable to see a foot in front of them. That is, if the smell alone hadn\u2019t blinded them with their own tears. Its scent was vomit-inducing amalgamation of hot dogs, pizza, burgers, milk, soda, stomach acid, and other unidentifiable substances. Mixing in with the fragrance of fresh corpses, it only served to enhance the odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd where was April following that havoc?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in a crater 100 feet in diameter and 50 feet deep, the 70 foot news reporter had her hands clasped over her mouth. Her whole face lit up in a shade of red that perfectly matched her hair and rivers of salty tears streamed past her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe list of survivors was a very short one, but some were lucky enough to live another day. These fortunate few were\u2026</span></div></div>",

And how did I wind up getting so big like this?\" As she looked down at the tiny buildings most barely reached her chest the city wherever she was in sure didn't look like any part of Manhattan or New York for that matter but Jean quickly brought back herself into reality trying to process this then she tried to no avail mentally calling out to any of the other X-Men \"Professor,Logan,Storm,Scott if any of you can sense my thoughts please respond I need help I'm somewhere in a unknown city and at a alarming and terrifying size please anyone Scott,Professor respond.\" She tried with all her might to detect their location to no avail \"OH...oh no they're not responding either I'm far away where the Professor can't detect me or this really is happening!\" Jean shook her head trying to clear her mind which at this state was already tortured enough with that whole Phoenix business a few months ago how did she end up like this? Was it a dream,Was she doing a training session in the Danger Room, or was it the Inner Circle member Mastermind messing around with her thoughts again with his mental  illusions?

This was too much for her <br>\r\n\"Don't panic Jean remember what the Professor thought you they're only panicking out of fear this is no different than how people normally see mutants,okay maybe a little different but I must inform them I'm not what they think I am.\" Then she tried to repeatedly communicate with them both with her voice and her mind <br>\r\n\"Please do not be alarmed I'm no monster from outer space and I mean you no harm I only need your support.\" She pleaded but the people panicked further once they heard her speak it sounded like the mother of all hurricanes as several people were literally blown away Jean could have used her telekinetic powers to steer them to safety but refrained from frightening them she wanted to take this nice and easy until she figured out what was going on here <br>\r\n\"Please don't run I promise no harm will come to you I merely need all of you to listen to me.\" She pleaded again with her mind but this only made things worse as all this time Jean was standing in one spot afraid to move when she....</span></div></div>",

Still, that would sound fun. Wait right here.\" Daphne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes to the bathroom and she comes back out in the same purple bra and panties. But, cleaner.

She sighed eventually as she plopped herself to the ground. Sure Grimwood School was fun, but today was one of those days where everyone seemed to be busy for the day. All her other friends had gone out with the Counselors to explore the deep woods, and Miss Grimwood herself was out getting groceries from the local ghoul shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just wanted one thing to do, and so far, nothing came. Lying down, she noticed one of Sibella's magazines lying around under her bed. Rolling her eyes, she evidently grabbed the darn thing and started flipping through the pages. \"Boring, boring, boring,\" she went through several articles on fashion, monster dates, ghoulish recipes, things that never did-and never will-interest her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached the end of the pages though, she noticed something quite....strange that it caught her eye. A very, very, very tall giant, only it was a female. Phanty never heard of such things, but it was now, sparking her interest. She attentively read the titles as she absorbed every detail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Large and in charge!\"</b> The title read, <b>\"Massive woman on the rise, rest of the world falling down!\"</b> Noticing on how big the lady was as cities barely reached her legs, as she walked through a countryside not minding was underneath her. Phanty kept staring for quite a few minutes after she whispered to herself, \"I wouldn't mind being that big...\" And like that, a flashbulb of idea came, standing up from her position as she flew up and away to the library. Seeing if she could find anything on the topic of size change.</span></div></div>",

As she passed through the walls, unaffected by its boundary, she quickly inspected every bookshelf and every book by spine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely Miss Grimwood had to have something on spells to change size. Or something along those lines. \"Salamander's body parts use, no. Salt and Vinegar, make everything richer, no. Sequential use of the Dark Arts, .....I'll read that one later.\" Browsing the gigantic catalog of books around the library. \"Come on, there's gotta be at least something!\" Picking up several books at once as she laid them out the table and began to quickly flip through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Useless, useless, useless, useless,\" Phanty said as she read to several pages of history and social class commentary as she continued on her quest, \"Who even reads this stuff?\" Complaining as she tossed the book aside and continued on. This took about a good several hours as she had nearly read almost every book, or flipped through to be more precise, as she was finally about to give up. Reaching out for one of the last shelved ones, she opened up the table of contents to read, SIZEOMANCY, on the first page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she opened to the page as she read up on what she needed to do. According to the book, there where many possible way to change one's size at will. It was very simple to reduce mass and matter, but very difficult to increase it. However, if achieved, it would be very potent and possibly unstable. Phanty only cackled as she continued to read, she was getting very excited by it. Moving on the specifics, since she was a ghost, there where two exact ways she could bloom up in size. <br>\r\n 1.) She could gather some ingredients to create a potion potent enough to allow her to change, but only if the specific instructions where followed to the letter without any change.<br>\r\n or<br>\r\n 2.) She could concentrate on gathering enough energy, to forcibly expand her body. The book described that electrical charges seemed to work best instead of gathering energy by sheer will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhanty stopped reading as she had a mischievous smile on her face. She had two choices, both sounding exciting, but which one to go with?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Elsa Frankenteen knew she was different. Not a bad different, but just enough she could differentiate herself from her friends. For one, she was taller. Much taller. And this only increased as they got older.  She went from her \u2018petite\u2019 size of 5\u2019 10\u201d to almost reaching the 8\u2019 mark, even passing her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one held it against her though, in fact they glorified the fact she was tall. Adding small blushes to the humble monstress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to her unusual height, Elsa had another strange feature added to her; her feet. Not only did she walk around barefoot all the time, but she also had the largest pairs of soles any ghoul would had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo large, whenever her friends came over for a sleepover, they would be aghast at how both their feet made up one of Elsa\u2019s. Easily did she win at footsies, and easily did she cover long distances. Even sasquatches would be outdone by her; and even though she could never find shoes to fit her massive feet, she didn't mind so much as she loved the feeling of the earth under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlas, adding to another feature to her. While being tall, strong and large, she had a peculiar sense of sole skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough large and strong to withstand anything, they were also quite\u2026petite. A strange word to associate Elsa with but throughout her years she eventually took notice of this feature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring one of her morning walks along the countryside, she had taken a different route than her usual one. One that went through the woods near her home. She knew the area roughly as she walked around, but wasn't very familiar with the surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did notice however how crunchy the path felt underneath her feet. Hearing multiple crunching sounds beneath her gave her a small laugh. Eventually she continued on home, entering her room, propping herself in a chair, only to have a surprise that spooked even her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her foot over her leg, she was about to wipe the dirt off her sole, when she noticed some peculiar black dots. Barely visible to the naked eye and where only noticed by Elsa\u2019s modified irises. Looking more closely at it. She gasped at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were small creatures, very keen on the word small, all over her sole. So small they could have easily mistaken for dirt or pollen. But that's not what she gasped at. Instead she had gasped at the barely audible cries. Of course this perplexed her, she couldn't have heard it, right? She may had been a monster but there was such a thing as ridiculousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her index finger, she scooped up these dots, as she brought them closely to her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere under her fingernail stood \u2026humans. Or more specifically, a cross of humans and dwarven people who happened to be the size of microbes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost dropped them, if it weren't for her fingers rough texture giving them a very tight grip. After getting her conscience however, she did manage to gather them on her desk as she placed her feet on it and slightly shook them for the populace to fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards though she had many questions on what they specifically where and how they got there. And how they weren't grapes under her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently they were surprised as well why they weren't in a state of smears as well. Nevertheless, what appeared to be the leader of the tribe, walked up and spoke to Elsa. \u201cOh great being of power, please have mercy on us!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held back a laugh but managed to give a good response, \u201cWhat makes you think im casting judgment on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell didn't you come to destroy our great civilization?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuuhhhhh, no. Heck I didn't think people this small existed until today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis perplexed the small leader, making Elsa smirk at his reaction. \u201cWell where are my manners, i'm Elsa Frankenteen, and you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErasmus, leader of the Microne people for the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMicrone? \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he then explained, \u201cWe are not in official records of any kind as we wanted our existence to be hidden from the rest of the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell when your as small as dust, you tend to get paranoid and be more uptight on securing the safety of your own people. And with your recent...display, I believe we will have to move again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa then winced as he mentioned her walk,\u201dYeah sorry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not worry, we had accepted our fate the moment the ground trembled and your massive form stepped in the middle of our small city.\u201d This was only making Elsa feel a bit worse. \u201cNevertheless may I ask you for favor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, what is it?\u201d Leaning forward as she was excited to help, making Erasmus a bit uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...could you...possibly be able to gather the rest of the villagers and bring them here? You were only able to bring a majority of us when you passed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure but...um..how do I get them over here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither mention me and the rest of us as being safe, or\u2026well..the same way you brought us.\u201d Elsa nodded as she stood up, the shin of her legs only being visible to the Micrones now. \"Don't worry, I'll try to do my best!\" And with that she took off, every step making the Micrones jump in the air as she left her room and walked outside. It was still pretty strange for her to accept that such people existed in the first place, but then again, she was the daughter of one of the most iconic monsters in history, her friends were also daughters of all sorts of types of iconic creatures, and her teacher was a witch that new all sorts of potions and spells-with a pet dragon. So...not too strange, but not what she was expecting either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back in the Microne city, the villagers and citizens remaining were trying to rebuild and accept a bit of the loss that they had just received. However, they weren't able to relax so easily, as the familiar tremors were coming back. Putting them into a state of frenzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't hard for Elsa to trace her steps back to the road she took, but this time she did take precautions in where she was stepping and she looked down on the ground until eventually she reached an area with leaves and small sticks surrounding it in a circular way, while small shells and rocks stood in the middle, extending outward. \"Huh,\" Elsa said as she stopped at the edge of the border as the \"walls\" barely reached her toes, \"Not sure how I missed that in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with the survivors, they were panicking as the destroyer returned. Fearing their lives, they ran in opposite directions, hoping to escape the wrath of the giantess coming to finish them off. But as they awaited a devastating end, they instead heard, \"Uh excuse me,\" leaving them confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa immediately noticed the small dots running around. There were definitely Micrones down there, but they were deeply afraid of her and at the point of trying to move away as fast as they could. \"Uh, excuse me,\" she spoke, getting some of their attention. It was a start. \"Excuse me, but somebody called Erasmus told me to come and pick all of you up. I'm extremely sorry for what I did, really I am, but I'm willing to make it up to you. So if you could please all gather to be picked up, that would be great.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"She lies!\" One of the Micrones said, \"She's come to kill us all!\" Immediately getting the crowds to panic once more as they ran everywhere to get away from the monstrous girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, no I'm actuall-\" \"RUN AWAY!\" \"Listen I'm tryin-\" \"SAVE YOURSELVES!\" Elsa just sighed and face palmed as it was hopeless to get any of them to listen to her after that one comment. \"Welp, I really wanted to avoid this,\" lifting her foot over the village, \"but I guess this is the only way your going to listen,\" immediately dropping it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe settlers screamed as they saw the massive sole come down. They were sure their lives were about to be extinguished that they stood there and prayed their misery would be quick and painless. Elsa's sole covered the entire city, or mostly the area that was most populated, feeling the fragile structures get diminished and the Micrones quickly come into contact with her. As she stepped down, she couldn't help but smirk a bit, knowing that everything would have been fine, even though her size had clearly pointed at the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the villagers awaited their deaths, noticing the dark shadow come down, along with their homes being destroyed and their friends disappearing in front of them, they were surprised to find themselves....alive. Surely this must have been only their denial and cling towards life, but each second they spend under and engulfed by her sole the more they had realized they weren't gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa smiled, feeling the small crowd getting stuck. Lifting her foot to check, the populace that had been under her were now firmly secure. There were still some running around but she wouldn't let them get away either. Still for safety reasons, she lifted her foot up to check if everyone had been firmly stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Micrones were in for wild ride as they were lifted from the ground up into the air and blinded from the extreme change from light to dark. Suddenly they viewed the face of the girl that had come to torture them, only she was smiling-and given their situation-it was a reassuring one. \"See I told you,\" Elsa informed as she was relieved they were safe. Even managed to find the one person who had panicked everyone, \"Your gonna owe me later you hear.\" Sticking out her tongue as the micro person nodded his head quickly. She laughed a bit but got back to business as she pressed her foot down again and scanned the area for anyone left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she found some running away from the village as she lifted her other foot over them and brought it down, \"Not so fast,\" she teased. She had to admit it was getting quite fun. Turning around she found a few more standing in the middle of the city as if they had given up on the situation and admitted defeat. A \"small\" press from her left foot and immediately they were added to her rescue. Now to just look sweep the area once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around carefully, it seemed she had gathered everyone under her feet. She was quite amazed by that, but then again, she did steam roll through her first visit, so she was kinda half and half about it. Regardless, she was glad that she had done her job, and with one last checkup of her passengers, she was off towards her home. Hopefully Erasmus wouldn't be too mad at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at her home, the Micrones were conversing one another on what to do about their situation. With their location discovered, there was no possibility to return to it as it had become far to dangerous. And with the giant girl, Elsa, knowing about them-would she let them go knowing this information? It was a very long debate, one that had started as soon as Elsa had left the room. Nevertheless, they quickly fell silent as they felt the familiar tremor come back again, louder each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone began to jump with each step as the large form of Elsa returned to the room. It was still terrifying for them to see her. Even from the door, she was already massive and only grew in comparison as the table they were in seemed to dwindle in size as she approached. Finally Elsa was in view of them, or more specifically her shins, as she called for Erasmus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Erasmus I'm back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we noticed about five steps ago,\" a grumpy Erasmus came forward as he got his footing back, \"So did you manage to convince the remaining villagers to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\" \"They panicked didn't they,\" \"Yeah.\" Erasmus sighed, \"Well it's what I thought would have happened, just wish it didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on, I did manage to convince them that I didn't mean any harm through demonstration and for the majority, it seemed to work.\" Elsa said as she really didn't want to lose the trust of these really small people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, well do you mind if we ask them ourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Just..uh...let me sit down first.\" Elsa pulled the chair she was sitting on and sat down, creating a massive wave of air that blew over all the Micrones and let them to fall once more. Next, she brought up her feet unto the table, careful to place them as comfortably close towards the Micrones as possible as she once again repeated her tapping from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome had winced as she brought her feet close once more, while others marveled at how big they were-making them feel...well smaller than usual. Nevertheless, the members of their tribe coming down safely unto the wood, broke their trance as they quickly went to embrace their friends and family who otherwise had seemed to be lost forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa removed her feet as she was done and was glad to see such reunions being made. Made her feel a bit warm inside her mechanical heart. However she did clear her throat as she wanted to get their attention once more. \"So can I be trustworthy now?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a hot summer day in the island of Hawaii. As per usual the local citizens and fauna woke up from their peaceful homes and into either work or school.<br>\r\nHumans and aliens, finally living together and helping each other out. Such was even the case, that they lived with one another, like back in the Pelekai manor. It was loud, moving, and even a bit chaotic, but it was a regular day for the denizens of the home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilo and her companion Stitch excited the house, excited to see either a new experiment or just have fun, in general. Pleakley, being his....strange self, had obsessed over one general new thing now and began to search as much information on it, while Jumba tinkered away with another new gadget(s). This left, Nani, the eldest of the two Pelekais, and the de facto head of the house. She was cleaning the left over breakfast from the family, as she took out garbage, started up the washing machine and was now vacuuming the living room. She was a simple woman, not quite asking for much, just enough money to pay her bills, watch over her family and have a little bit of fun here and there. Then again, with alien technology installed to her home, it wasn't like she was paying much of taxes as of recent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she did not mind having a little adventure here and there, but she usually reserved herself from it or it was taken by her little sister before she could say anything. She sighed as she had finished the vacuum cleaner as she sat down on the couch, all was well for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaahhhh, Big Sister of Little Girl!\" For about a few minutes as she opened her eyes as Jumba was in the frame of the hallway, \"I require for you to be...assistant.\" <br>\r\nNani perked up as she lifted an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assistant?\" She asked as she stood up, \"Jumba you don't usually ask me for experimental help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, but....\" He waved his hand in the air, \"I think this would be....experiment you might enjoy.\" He said as she urged her to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" Nani said as she rolled her eyes, \"But if something bad happens, you're giving the TV a new upgrade, I'm urging to see some of those new dramas on the foreign channels.\" She followed Jumba down towards his makeshift lab in his room, made out of old gadgets he had or made from the spare junkyard on Hawaii. The room was filled with the things but none of them were important as Jumba lead Nani to the desk he was in, showing her....what appeared to be black...cuffs of some kind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNani looked at them with curiosity. They definitely were cuffs as they were circular in shape, glowed green from the inside as Jumba tweaked them, and were five in total. She was quite confused what they were for until she had to ask, \"Don't tell me you've been taking fashion advice from Pleakley!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" Jumba retorted as he chuckled at the joke, \"I've been doing more than that actually.\" Checking to see if his invention was in sync with the others as one cuff began to glow and so did all the other in that faint green light. \"Now here, please put on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Nani said as she was curious what he was up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is for experiment, I assure you, 100% non-lethal!\" He affirmed as he once again brought the cuffs to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, \"Fine,\" extending her arms as Jumba began to apply the cuffs around her wrists, they were quite good to the touch actually. Not too heavy, or comfortable, almost as if they were lighter than they were made. He slowly made his way around her neck, only for Nani to stop him. \"I think I'll do this one.\" Jumba only sighed as he gave Nani the next cuff as he let the device wrap around her neck, adjusting to her size as it once again was put on snugly. Odd thing for a machine to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...uh...\" Jumba stuttered a bit as he had the last two left. He shook his head as he put on his professional face, \"You must put this around ankles as well.\" Handing the devices to Nani as he knew she was going to be a bit hostile if he had done it herself. Nani only sighed once more as she reached down towards her sandal feet as she let the cuffs lock into place. Once she was finished the five devices began to glow as they synchronized with one another. \"Okay now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on,\" Jumba said as he looked into his computer to make sure the devices were correct. Once it gave him the all clear, he instructed her, \"Outside we must go! Unless you want house to be destroyed.\" He said as Nani smirked at the idea, \"Like that hasn't happened.\" Nevertheless, they were outside, Jumba looking up at the skies as he made a bit of calculations while Nani followed him still wondering what this was all about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think you can explain to me now, why we are doing this?\" She asked as she crossed her arms in front of him while he still looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" He looked down, jotting some notes as he explained. \"The simple answer is,\" He leaned in, \"Today we are testing growth bracelets.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNani stood quiet, before bursting out laughing. \"You can't be serious right?\" She was holding her stomach as she continued only for Jumba to shake his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, it is true. I must find way for you to grow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumba stood quiet for a bit, before answering. \"Because......Earth Lady would look nice while big.\" Nani stood stupefied by the answer. She didn't know what to say, she was not expecting this after all the things she had witnessed. Nevertheless, she was already in the get up and the idea was interesting at least....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she said after a few moment of silence, \"I'll do it. BUT! You have to promise me, nothing bad will happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh do not worry!\" Jumba replied as he was adjusting some settings on his device to begin the process. \"I have made sure, everything is safe and secure!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" She took a deep breath as she closed her eyes, \"Just tell me when to begin!\" <br>\r\n\"And when to open my eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Initiation!\" Jumba yelled out as he inscribed some numbers. \"Countdown, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1....\" He pressed a button on his wrist watch as the cuffs beeped and a light engulfed Nani. Her frame visible getting larger and larger by the second. Yet how much, it was unknown. They were testing them for a reason. </span></div></div>",

Developing new sciences as he now worked for the secret agency that Mr. Bubbles worked for. <br>\r\nTinkering away at his latest device, he failed to notice the two smaller members of the family, sneak in as they leaned in to see what he was working on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just needs a bit more calibration, a few new wires, and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to be?\" Jumba almost jumped out of his chair as he turned around to see Lilo leaning against him, trying to see whatever he was working on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small child, don't scare me like that, you almost make me blow up the entire house,\" He mumbled as he turned around again and continued on his work. Only to find Stitch chewing on one of the wires. \"626, get out of there!\" He grabbed Stitch by the legs as he pulled him away from his apparatus and was relieved to see no damage on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't answer my question Jumba,\" Lilo said as she put her hands on her hips, Stitch rolling next to her as he stared at his creator as well. Jumba did some minor fixes here, as sparks flew away from his tools. Setting them down, he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see child, this is new technology I am working on. Able to diminish the matter and mass of items.\" Showing off the weird dome contraption with wires under it and lights emitting as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it shrinks things?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In short, yes.\" He said setting it down to test it. \"Stand back however, it's highly dangerous, haven't tested it out yet.\" He pressed some buttons as the machine buzzed to life only to power down. \"Bah, blasted thing is broken.\" Shaking his arms up in the air as he went back to the desk to check what had gone wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lilo and Stitch approached the item as they inspected what could have caused such failure. \"You think he forgot to install the battery again?\" Lilo asked her blue companion. Stitch shrugged as he began to pull some wires and mess with the machine. He spouted his usual gibberish while Lilo observed. At that moment, Pleakley came inside the room as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you all doing?\" He said as he approached the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying out Jumba's new machine, but he's having some problems,\" Lilo explained as Stitch was now re-routing wires left and right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you should be doing that,\" Pleakley said as he was trying to move Stitch to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Stitch, stop touching!\" Lilo joined on the pulling as the blue fur ball was being persistent. Jumba turned around and was mortified to see everyone on his machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO STOP, GET OUT-\" He moved in to push them off, but as soon as he did that, the machine started buzzing around, coming back to life as it filled the room with green light. The four residents where blinded by it as it flashed before their eyes, only to subdue itself within seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...happened?\" Lilo said, as she grabbed her head. \"Stitch? Jumba? Pleakley?!\" The little girl was worried as her head was throbbing but was relieved to hear the ramblings of Stitch as he came running to her, to a quick hug. \"Where are the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here,\" Jumba said as Pleakley joined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to explain?\" Pleakley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, I told you not to touch it, you did, and now the device has shrunk us down, to small size.\" As he explained, did they soon start to realize just how the environment around them had changed. The device itself was like a mountain overshadowing them. The ceiling was miles away from their position. The floor stretched on and on forever. While the furniture, was another towering fortress on themselves. \"Very small size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before they could do anything, did they hear a distant sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then again, but louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThooom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Lilo asked scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LILO, ARE YOU HOME?!\" A thundering and familiar voice could be heard in the distance. All of them started to panic as they realized who was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, letting in a huge gust of wind down unto the party. There, standing on the frame, stood the monolithic tanned figure of Nani...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They split up as they entered the nearest slips and grabbed on to whatever they could. Lilo and Stitch occupied one and Jumba and Plekley, the other. They held their breaths as the loud thuds stopped hitting the ground until they heard, \"MUST BE JUMBA'S,\"and where quickly lifted into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had all screamed for their lives as they grabbed to small railings around the edges of their safe zones. Praying they wouldn't fall and fearing their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Nani was just inspecting the machine, noticing all the strange wiring and machinery. \"I have no idea what Jumba would use this for,\" shaking it a bit to see if there were any loose ends or bits. Back with our heroes, they held on tightly, feeling the vertigo of rising up as they felt the violent movement of the shake. Lilo had almost fallen if it hadn't been the firm grip Stitch had on the girl; while Jumba held tightly with Plekley wrapped around his arm. After two shakes, Nani deemed the apparatus pretty pointless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" she said as she placed it back on the desk. </span></div></div>",

I can use it to make me human!\" As her father had a powerful golden magical trident that he carried around everywhere and it apparently could do basically whatever he mentally willed it to from creating lightning and bolts of energy to practically affecting the weather on the surface world above to dark storm clouds to sunny skies its upper limits was unknown even to him but Ariel was certain it could help her fulfill her dream the problem was that he rarely was even seen without it and there was the question to how she was going to smuggle it from the throne room without being seen especially by the king's royal advisor the little crab Sebastian but Ariel wouldn't be discerned that easily so she waited patiently day after day until finally her father had a important meeting to go to with some fish folk in another part of the kingdom and accidentally or maybe he just forgot it but he left his trident behind in the throne room this was her chance and quickly she snuck into the throne room and swapped the real one for one she had made out of seaweed and bits of coral and seashells <br>\r\n\"There no one will notice it's a almost exact replica of the true trident which I'll return right right to its spot once I'm finished.....\" She thought as she swam away before anyone saw what she was carrying then she swam into a isolated part of the ocean near a abandoned wrecked ship where no one ventured to anyway and pulled out her father's trident from the heavy seaweed cloth where she concealed it <br>\r\n\"Okay magic trident make me human!\" But nothing happened at all and a bit annoyed she ordered it again 'Trident turn me into a human now!\" Once more nothing happened it wasn't even glowing nor did sparks fly out and she was getting ever so frustrated finally she cried out<br>\r\n\"Trident I want to experience life on the surface world so that I can live among humans.\" At once the trident began to glow brightly and a golden aura like light formed around the teenaged mermaid's body Ariel squealed happily this was it she was going to be human but instead something else unexpected happened rather than grow legs where her fish tail was she began growing bigger in height and physical size and let out a cry of fear and panic<br>\r\n\"What....wait this is.......this isn't what I asked for....I wanted to be human not grow bigger...trident stop!\" But instead of granting her request she grew faster and far larger already she could hear nearby screams from other sea creatures as they fled for their lives Ariel panicked even more as she dropped the trident  as soon she was the size of a whale but rapidly grew even bigger than that soon most of the kingdom and surrounding sea bed she couldn't make out nor any of the creatures she only hoped her father was nowhere around to witness his youngest daughter shooting up like a weed to giant size <br>\r\n\"NO,NO STOP....I DON'T WANT TO GROW BIG I WANTED TO BE A HUMAN.....PLEASE STOP......\" But finally she did stop growing and breathing a sigh of relief Ariel looked down at her now gigantic body and the rest of the tiny ocean most of the sea creatures were mere colorful,moving dots to her and judging from her perceptive she had to be around a good 70 feet or fin if you will considering she still had her green fish tail but smiled to herself<br>\r\n\"Maybe this isn't exactly what I wanted but in a way it's better as I'm gigantic and now no one can tell me what to do or where to go.....especially Daddy.....ohh I'm so excited I'm about to make a really big splash in on the surface world won't the humans be surprised!\" As she made her short ascend towards the surface but where exactly does she make her BIG entrance at?</span></div></div>",

I told you all I wouldn't dare let anything or anyone harm you now do you see I mean no harm to you humans?\" She asked pleading with them trying to gain their trust slowly they nodded and she couldn't control herself she squealed with glee accidentally splashing a few when she leaped up in the air <br>\r\n\"Oops sorry but I can't help it....I'm so happy right now nothing could spoil this...... Growl.....oh my!\" She moaned lightly as a deep rumbling came from the depths of somewhere the people on the pier terrified looked around <br>\r\n\"What was that? Is it the Kraken coming back?\" Ariel clutched her stomach in slight embarrassment<br>\r\n\"Er no it's actually my stomach I hate to admit this but I'm very hungry....\" At this once more the people's trust for her flew out the window as fear settled in again <br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh she's ravenous with hunger,she's got the look!\" As they started to run away Ariel quickly stopped them by placing a hand in front of their path <br>\r\n\"Wait! I didn't mean eating any of you! I just saved you all from being eaten by the Kraken what makes you think I would want to eat any of you?\" She giggled \"I'm far away from my own home under the sea and just need some nourishment please if you don't mind....\" The people at once looked at each other and muttered to the next person beside them<br>\r\n\"What do we feed a mermaid? What do they eat?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't ask me? Do I look like a expert on mythic creatures?\" Ariel was thinking along the same lines<br>\r\n\"I wonder what the humans will feed me? Whatever it is I'm certain it will be delicious!\" She thought then asked \"Well have you decided what you're going to feed me?\" She kindly asked some of them wearing chef hats nodded and informed her they'll be right back she calmly waited she really wasn't in a hurry to go anywhere so what if the entire ocean her father included was searching for her? Finally the chefs returned with several platters of the most unusual food she ever saw but fortunately or rather they thought it might be a personal insult to her there was no seafood not any fish anywhere Ariel beamed as she slowly reached down picking up one plate after the other and devouring the whole thing silver platter and all<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh it tastes so delicious! I have no idea what this stuff is but I really like it!\" She gushed happily as one by one she devoured platter after platter<br>\r\n\"She...she's not even tasting it! She's swallowing it all whole! Are all mermaids like this I wonder?\" One of the chefs asked finally finished Ariel swallowed her last mongrel and smiled down at the tiny chefs <br>\r\n\"Ohh that was so delicious! I don't think I ever tasted anything more yummy in all my life thank you all of.....\" But she stopped midway as she again clutched her stomach in slight pain <br>\r\n\"Something wrong Miss Mermaid?\" One of the other chefs asked Ariel didn't reply her eyes wide and both hands on her stomach as she groaned then the same chef spoke up urgently to the others <br>\r\n\"Uh oh guys I....I think she ate a little too much and....look out she's going to......\"</span></div></div>",

I didn't mean to-\"  She stopped, feeling a lump in her throat for a second that stopped her speaking.

To Arial's horror the town shook more severely from this, as though it was being struck by a fool scale earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I swear I'm not doing this on- HICK!\" She hiccuped again with the same effect. Shouts and screams filled the air and the land looked like it might break apart. She put her hand over her mouth, but could feel another hiccup building. Arial knew she had to get out of there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dived under the water and sped away. Sure enough, another hiccup came, shaking the ocean. Swimming on a full stomach didn't make her feel any better, and certainly didn't help her hiccups, which continued to rock the ocean, but she couldn't stay and ravage the world she so loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trident! Arial had to find the trident, maybe it could restore her to normal. She wish she hadn't placed it down so carelessly. She tried to remember where she left it</span></div></div>",

However, if he refused to leave once more, she would swallow him for real. She spit him out onto her hand. He was soaking wet and terrified. \"Since I'm nice, I'll give you one last chance. Leave and never return!\" She said tightening her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok ok, I'll never come back! Please forgive me!\" He cried, he didn't want to die to her.

We have lots of food! Give us a few minutes and we'll round it up for you. I'm assuming you don't eat fish, correct?\" A woman asked. Ariel nodded, it should be obvious since Ariel was part fish, so it would be cannibalism. The people didn't mind bringing her food. They had lots of fish and meat to survive on. They brought a large pile of fruit. There was so much, it scaled up to Ariel's bellybutton. She started to eat, the people were surprised at how fast she could gobble it down. Ariel ate the entire pile and started to burp. She quickly covered her mouth so she didn't cause damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Ariel thought she was about done, a teenage girl called her. Ariel kindly lifted her up to her face. The girl's tummy and legs were exposed. There were strange markings on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this may sound weird, but can you eat me? We humans eat fish with no respect, so I was thinking of offering myself, a human, to someone who is part fish. The rest of the town knows this so they won't be afraid if you do eat me. And please, don't hold back.\" The woman said. Ariel was surprised about this request, but it did sound logical. Ariel smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, you asked me to devour you as price for eating fish. This act is pretty noble, and brave to do. I would be happy to fill your request, if that will make you happy. Please confirm that you want to be eaten, for when you do, there is no going back.\" Ariel told her. The girl told her to eat her again, and said she wanted Ariel to be happy. The giant mermaid smiled and gave her a kiss. \"Thank you human. It was nice knowing you, goodbye.\" Ariel brought the girl above her open mouth. She tilted her hand, making her fall into her mouth. Ariel tossed her around with her tongue. She was really tasty. Ariel didn't bite her though, she didn't want to cause her to suffer. When she swallowed, she could feel the girl going down her throat. \"Mm, you humans have great taste.\" She said.

She was the princess and was virtually allowed wherever she wanted to go here and besides a lot of these things looked fascinating to her so she picked one of them up hid it in the folds of one of her pants' pockets and quietly snuck off in her own room where she could examine the object,a simple round mirror <br>\r\n\"I wonder why Jafar would have thing around I don't see what's so special about it it's just a ordinary mirror.\" She said to herself after a few hours of trying to figure out how it worked <br>\r\n\"Looks can be deceiving young one....\" A mysterious voice spoke from the depths of the glass the princess gasped out loud as she nearly dropped it <br>\r\n\"Did you just talk to me?\" She whispered to her surprise the voice in the mirror responded <br>\r\n\"Yes I did and I'm no ordinary mirror girl I'm magic duh and can grant you whatever you ask me of but be wary the results often aren't what you expect.....\" Ignoring the voice's rude attitude as well as the strange word \"duh\" she excitedly whispered<br>\r\n\"So you said you can grant me anything I ask for like....like a genie?\" <br>\r\n\"Yes but unlike a genie I can grant a supply of unlimited wishes while they're limited to only three per person but be careful if something happens to me or if I break whatever recent wish I granted for you will become permanent.\" But she wasn't listening instead she was busy thinking about that new place free life she was about to experience and excitedly made her first request <br>\r\n\"Okay mirror this is my first wish I want to leave the palace to experience the wonders of the known world,I want to experience everything there is in the world.\"<br>\r\n\"So you want to experience everything in the world all at once?\" The mirror calmly asked Jasmine nodded <br>\r\n\"Yes I want to experience a whole new world! In a way that no one ever has please can you grant my request?\" The mirror didn't directly reply only began to glow incredibly bright and a strange light engulfed the princess once more she gasped out loud as both her and the room vanished. <br>\r\nOnce she came to Jasmine realized the confides of the palace and kingdom of Agrabah itself had vanished entirely she was in a completely strange place and everything looked incredibly tiny as she took her first few steps she could make out the faint sounds of horrified screams coming from somewhere below <br>\r\n\"Ummm magic mirror where exactly am I?

The people had they had seen it all, but nothing they have dealt with can prepare them for what is to come. Out of thin air, a 70 foot girl with with long blonde hair, she wears a cerulean blue knee-length dress, with a white pinafore apron on top. Underneath her dress, she wears a white petticoat, white stockings, white knee-length pantalettes, black strapped Mary Jane shoes and a black bow in her hair. Who is this girl and where did she come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you believe me if I told you she was Alice from Disney's 1951's classic movie? Alice had finally escape Wonderland, that strange place where logic wasn't welcome. But atlas, she further from home than ever. \"At least I escape that beastly Queen,\" Alice sighed in relief. Then realize three things; she was now giant size again, and she was in a strange new place. \"OH dear,\" She gasped. \"How did I get so big? And where am I?\" Her curiosity getting the better of her again, she decided to go look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the citizens of the Big Apple, was a sweet and kid girl, she wasn't being careful and her footsteps causing tremors for the folk for the big city. She ended up putting a lot of china shops out of business. Not bothering where she was stepping, she crushed someone's fancy new car. And the worst part, he still had 3 payments left. Alice decides to look in one of the sky scraper building and finds to her surprise, there was tiny (to her) people living in them. And some of them did NOT like to be peek on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear!\" She screamed. \"There are people living in this city!\" She was so caught up in looking at she never considered that anyone was living here. She then pushed down her dress and sees tiny people panic and scream at her feet. \"Goodness,\" She said. \"Please stop panicking.  \"I don't mean you any harm.\" But sadly the damage has been done. Suddenly Alice is over come by hunger as her stomach rumbles as loud as a rock concert. She loses her self and begins majority feeding frenzy, stealing food from all the city's fast food and restaurant food supplies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she's finish, she returns to normal. \"What just happened?\" She asked, forgetting the food rampage she just went on. Then her stomach begins to hurt so much that she  clutches her stomach, \"OH WHAT NOW?!\" she moans in pain. She lets loose a earth shaking burp that destroys ever window and ever thing else glass within 50 feet of her. Infact the burp is so powerful that she falls on her rear end, crushing a majority of the road.  For the people of Yew York City, things couldn't get any worst. But unfortunately they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the final straw for poor not so little Alice. She was in a stranger new place. she was stuck as a giant with no way of getting back to normal. She had no one to help her, and everyone she might have asked for help wouldn't even dare get within 12 feet of her. Her butt was hurt. And she had no idea of how  to get home. So was so frustrated that she starts to cry. And just like first time she became a giant, her giant tears started to flood the city.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\nWhat will happen to her now?</div></span></div></div>",

Stop this moment, I tell you!\" That when she decided to stop feeling sorry for herself and find someone to help her out.

As she wandered the city, the street were devoid of life, this is normal when a giantess caused billions of dollars in damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she spots a handsome boy around her age. Alice smiled as she picked up the boy from the street. The boy Tom was screaming his head off. \"Pardon me,\" Alice said kindly hopping to calm the boy down. \"But I could use some help. You see, I'm having some trouble. I need help getting smaller and I don't know how to get back home. Could you please be of some assistance to me?\" The boy just looked at her and replied, \"NO way! Now put me down!\" Alice did not take kindly to this, \"Listen, I tried to be nice but I will tickle  until you say yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read me lips,\" Tom answered. \"NO!\" Alice began tickling him.

I like big girls but you're really,really big!\" He exclaimed Cinderella giggled noticing the way he was looking at her and reached down picking him up in one hand Dipper had to admit he was instantly in love with the Disney Princess \"Whoa you're even more beautiful up close and at this size Cindy!\" She giggled again shaking the whole forest and said <br>\r\n\"Ohhh you're so sweet for saying that and just for being my new friend you deserve a reward....\" And to his astonishment she kissed him all over his whole body by the time she was finished Dipper was covered from head to toe in her cherry lipstick and saliva then at his odd request she placed him in her left breast cup then....</span></div></div>",

Even though its legendary protector, the Dark Knight had left to fight alongside the Justice League, there was still one to keep the street safe from crime; Batgirl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was currently atop an abandon warehouse, her costume consisted of a dark gray suit  with yellow utility belt, blue gloves, a black and blue bat-shaped cowl with two holes for eyes with a black with black cape attached to said cowl and a  yellow bat logo.  She received word that the criminal organization known as Intergang would be getting their hands on several stolen LexCorp inventions and Batgirl was bent on foiling their plans. Suddenly a large white truck arrived on the street below, she observed as thugs brought the stolen cargo inside the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl decided she had seen enough and jumped through the ceiling window. This had caught off the thugs that they didn't have to react before Batgirl threw a couple of smoke bombs. During the confusion, thug who forgot to bring a gun opened one of the boxes in hope of finding something of defending himself. He found a sci-fi looking gun and shot Batgirl.  \"Hey what was...\" She said before she clutched her stomach in pain. She felt  like her organs were getting too big for her body. Then she began to grow at a rapid speed.  The smoke cleared to revel she was now 15 feet tall and still growing. The thugs not wanting to be around  when she finished growth spurt exit the building. Her head rammed her head into the ceiling, she tries to crouching down but that doesn't work. Eventually she grows through the roof until she reached nearly 50 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around at her tiny surroundings. \"I could use to this,\" She smiled as she thought of all of the good she could do with her new height. Then she caught a glimpse of the crooks and mischievously grinned, \"Well, well, well. What do we have here?\" The thugs quickly got into the trunk and drove off. \"Oh no you don't\" Batgirl she said as she chased after them. Unfortunately in her zeal, she didn't notice the destruction she left in her wake. Her footsteps causing powerful tremors which a lot of damage. The truck she was after drove into a busy street only to crash into a lamp post.  She jumped over a street of people and landed on the road, which left deep craters in the ground. \"I finally caught you!\" She laughed as she took a step the struck and accidently stepped on empty car. She heard this and realize what she had done, \"Oops.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sent the people into a panic as they ran and screamed. \"Oh dear,\" She frowned, Batman wasn't going to be happy about this. \"Please don't panic, I'm not her to hurt you.\" She told the citizens but no one would listen. To make matters worst, stepped on a car and was rolling back and forth. She then loses balance and she felli nto the side of a building that was maybe twice her size. Between the force of her falling, and her weight, the brick walls were no match for the 50 foot girl and they burst inwards. As her arms tore two gouges through the wall, destroying whatever was inside, the rest of her followed as she fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned as she got up, sending an assortment of rubble to fall off of her as she did so. There was still some dust in the air and she coughed a bit from it. She sat up and looked around, noticing several wires, and the destroyed telephone poles they belonged too. She sighed and looked around and then gasped. She had crushed that building! People could be injured or worse! Quickly she started to dig through the rubble to look for people. After a few seconds of finding nothing, she picked up what looked like had been the front door. She squinted her eyes and sighed of relief when she saw the \u201cClosed\u201d sign still attached to the window.  She then turned her head and saw the streets were empty. \"Batman's gonna kill me,\" she moaned. she started to walk to a place where she wouldn't cause any more trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she spotted a little boy, no older than 10. She gently got down on her hands and knees to take a closer look at him. He was scared, not that she could blame him. .\"Aww, don't be scared, little buddy.\" she said sweetly.\" I won't hurt you.\" She then grabbed the boy by the waist and brought the bot to her lips and gave him a small peck on the head. \"What's your name cutie?\" She asked the boy. \"Ben,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want something to eat?\" She asked him. Ben simply nodded. Batgirl placed the boy on her left shoulder and headed to a gas station. reluctantly she tore off the roof of the building before she put Ben back on the ground. She grabbed some food and handed to him. Next saw a hug huge 32 liter bottle of soder big enough for her. Feeling incredibly thirsty she picked up the bottle and gulp down.  Batgirl was about to eat but stopped clutch her stomach in agony. \"OH drinking was a bad idea.\" She mumbled.  She then let out a long and loud burp that broke every window in a five miles radius and set off every car alarm in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatgirl, blushed with embarrassment and covered her mouth with one hand and said \"Excuse Me!\" She was about to cry when she saw Ben hugging her leg. She smiled and place her on her shoulder. This night was a disaster. She caused millions of dollars worth of damage, she wondered how it could get any worst. Then she heard Police sirens as the GCPD arrived. Many of them holding guns pointed right at her. And among them was her own father, James Gordon who was holding a megaphone. \"THIS IS THE POLICE, DON'T MOVED!\" Batgirl was sweating, wondering what she should do?</span></div></div>",

She was none other than Supergirl; last daughter of Argo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the? How did I get here? And why is everything so tiny?\" She asked herself. She observed her surroundings. She saw the people running away and cars driving away from her. She then realized she was huge, at least 50 feet tall. \"I'm not going to hurt you! I just want to talk.\" She said.

Then another town came into view, not wanting to cause another panic she was about she fly somewhere else. Then she saw one of the building was on fire. Supergirl couldn't simply let innocent people die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed toward the building which turned out to be a hospital. Naturally people were scared of the towing flying girl who showed up out of the blue. \"Wait, I'm here to help.\" She explained. She held out her open hand next to the windows and allowed both doctors and patients to step hand. Next she gently lowered her hand and let everyone get off. The blonde super heroine repeated this until everyone was safely out. Finally she used her freezing breath and blew out the fire. The crowds cheered and Supergirl smiled. The last daughter of Argo saved the day, her cousin would be proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the blonde super heroine took off to find a secluded place away from civilians to avoid hurting anyone by accident She eventually found a large valley a mile away from the town. There was a lake large enough for her, complete with a waterfall. \"At least I can take a bath without perverts watching.\" She grinned. There was even a cave where she could sleep in.

Even the Mayor wants to give you a medal of honor.\" He explained. Supergirl was glad she could help people out like Superman did. Even though any medal she would get would be too small for her, the gesture was sweet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ben. I can't believe I'm talking to a real live comic book character.\" Ben beamed. \"Hold on a minute, what did you mean by comic book character?\" She questioned with a raised eyebrow. Ben decided to come clean and tell her the truth. He told her that she, her cousin and everyone she knew was a made character in a comic book. \"Great, I stuck in another world with no way of getting, I'm a giant, and now I'm not even real.\" She lamented. Ben felt sad for Super-sized girl. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you to upset you.\" \"Don't be,\" She replied. \"You only wanted to tell be the truth.\" She lowered her hand on the ground. Ben stepped on her palm and sat in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to lift him until he was level with her face. He couldn't help but stare into her big blue eyes. Her skin was flawless. The truth was he always had a crush on Supergirl, he bought every comic that had her in it. So this was a dream come true for them. His cheeks began to turn a little pink, this did not escape Supergirl's notice. This caused her to giggle. \"Why are you blushing?\" She smiled playfully, she already knew the answer. Before he could even speak, she brought him to her mouth and enveloped his face with her lips in the biggest kiss he had ever received.  \"Did you enjoy that?\" She winked. \"The truth I think you're quite handsome.

He wondered how she was going to even feed herself. Luckily for him and the whole town Supergirl really didn't need to eat. As long as she absorbed the ray of the sun, she would be fine.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAnother day, another opportunity,\u201d Lucas said to himself as he laid on his bed. It was a fine Saturday morning for the young boy as he was eager to start the day from an exhausting week of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up he quickly washed up as he thought what to do for the day. No homework or chores to do, which bode well for him. And his parents weren't around meaning he had the house to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch it you dweeb,\u201d Well almost, the nasally voice of his sister, Tiffany, came as he accidentally bumped to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I wouldn't if you weren't so tall,\u201d he replied slyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell maybe if you weren\u2019t so short,\u201d she replied with a hmf, as she continued to walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas just rolled his eyes as he made his way into his room. He was frustrated but he let go of it quickly, realizing that her sister was only getting older and having some form of height complex. Then again he really couldn't tell. After his adventure with his\u2026. more hidden\u2026 friends, he did have that near death experience with her. He doubted she recognized him but....he could never tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then recalled the one time he passed by her room while he door was slightly open. She had many boxes of different shapes and sizes around the floor, with her walking around them, over them, and in between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas dismissed it as her being weird, and that was saying from where he came. Still that didn't answer the question, what was he supposed to do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking back to his room, he jumped into his bed and took a note from under his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a long while since he had visited his friends from the front yard. Strange he was saying that, but it was the truth. Due to certain events he....wasn't too proud of, he was introduced to the large world beneath him. <br>\r\nTo make it short, ants had shrunken him and he had the task to stop an exterminator. He called on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, he could laugh about it now but it was sure as heck that he was terrified when he was facing him.<br>\r\nRegardless, he read the letter that Hova had sent him. Amazed that it was even his size, probably one of Zoc's potions or inventions or something. Still the letter read,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dear Lucas,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been quite a while since you've visited us. Fugax and the rest of the hive are still thankful for the rock candy you give everyday, yet it's still not the same as you being here. Thus Zoc suggested giving you a small part of the potion that brought you to us.\"</i> As he read he looked over to the small bottle he had gotten, along with several instructions in how to take it and such. <i>\"Please visit whenever you need to. The Hive is thriving and I'm sure the Queen would not mind your visit.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nSincerely, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHova.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas looked at the bottle once more. \"Hova did say, ANYtime....\" trying to convince himself it was okay to dive into it. \"But then...\" He however held back. He really didn't want anyone to worry about him, but the only one to worry about him right now was Tiffany, and knowing her-she was probably leaving her room for the next couple of hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at it once more. \"Plus...it is Saturday.\" Convinced that whatever problem there would be, he would be back home before anyone noticed. Reading instructions on the note in the bottle, he slowly got a drop of the potion and dropped in his ear. After that, he only had mere seconds to put it down before the effects started working. Slowly, then rapidly, he felt himself change as the world around him grew. His bed enlarged to gigantic proportions along with all of his belongings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he had reached the floor, expansive as an entire plain, only made of wood and gleaming. He smiled, feeling the nostalgia of the adventures he had, and the excitement of making new ones. Walking to the ventilation system, he looked a the mighty grits as he waited for the breeze to begin to carry him outside.</span></div></div>",
