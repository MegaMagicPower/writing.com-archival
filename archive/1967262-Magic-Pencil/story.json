When the cosmos first exploded in a Big Bang, out of the nether regions of a void of nothingness came the truth. The truth governs the universe, a fluctuating state in an ever changing form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat humans call the physical constants and laws of the universe is nothing more than sparse fluctuations of truth within the universe. What people call random probabilities of quantum flux is just simply a very minute, yet noticeable, changes in reality. But as humans are a very small part of the universe, their influence is also very small and only yields same results if they attempt to repeat the same thing. This is the true nature of the laws of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being smirks as he gazes at the newly created, bright yellow object within his hands. <i>Wait until the humans see what the true power of the truth has to offer</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, where am I?\" Timothy says as he wakes up. Glancing around he notices something... strange. Instead of the usual scenery of his bedroom, Tim is greeted to black vastness of space. Millions upon millions of stars, galaxies, and nebulae stretch out before him, rapidly rotating, stretching, folding, and collapsing upon themselves in a quick manner. A manner that defies limitations of the speed of light and the physical forces of the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a sight, isn't it?\" A voice, booming yet soft at the same time, resounds beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, unbelievable...\" Tim responds, voice full of awe, as he turns his head to face the voice. He gasps. In front of him wasn't a human... no, it was not anything he had ever seen before. Some sort of mist, an ethereal cloud, was spreading in front of him, quickly changing form - a naked man, a tapir, a giant tarantula, a mountain, a laughing clown. The shapeshifting suddenly stops as Tim, while unsure, feels that it has noticed him staring at it. The mist falls apart into particles as the voice resumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curious, but not afraid, are you?\" It \"smirks\", despite having no form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need. Interesting though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim tilts his head, trying to decrypt this being's words. \"Who... no\u2014<i>what</i> are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am delighted that you asked. Though, I suppose it is a bit unfair to say that since I <i>knew</i> that you would ask that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... knew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I know everything. I could be said to even be everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then... God?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you can call me that. I do not have any true name, nor any descriptor. But God will do. You see, I am the truth of the universe, the one who dictates its path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't the universe already set in stone? I thought that if you always drop, say, a pencil, it will fall to the ground. Gravity, y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, see my little friend,\" the enigmatic being shakes its \"head\" as it continues. \"That is where you are. The universe is malleable, like clay, and can be changed to one's whims. You humans are just too weak to be able to do anything... interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" Tim replies, uninterested. \"I'm still not sure if this is a dream or not. Last I checked, I was in bed, but... this all feels so <i>real</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is real,\" the light replies, \"Though this might be your dream world, I have transferred all aspects of reality here, though I am toying with them right now. But it is connected to reality itself. If you die here, you will die there too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Tim nods, understandingly. \"So what exactly is it you want from me? I can't imagine someone like you would find me all that interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but that is not the case. For you see, I am the truth, a concept of an age greater than time itself. And while I am able of everything, I am also able of nothing at the same time. Mortal, cure me of my boredom. Have, this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy looks at the object that had just appeared in his hand our of thin air. It was yellow, with a pink snub on one end and conical graphite on the other. A pencil?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pencil, obviously,\" the being snickers, but quickly returns serious atmosphere, \"Well, not quite an ordinary pencil. It is connected to me and my power. One of its features is being able to draw over a canvas and bring it to reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be... the power of transformation?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely. Do you want that newfangled computer? You can take your father's dear weight lifting machine and redraw it into one. Be warned, if doused in water, then the transformation will wear off as if it never was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah, what's the point then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will see that the power of truth is able to be set in stone for as long as you desire. I'll leave that to you to figure out. I would also like to note that tapping a transformed object will lead to interesting effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is for you to figure out. Now, one last thing of note. This pencil is a pencil, and is not restricting to drawing. After all, the words came from the truth and speech was constructed to deliver the truth. Using that power, you can change the fabric of reality and destiny itself. Be warned. The changes will not always be desirable and truth is open to interpretation. Now with that, I will leave you to your own. Bonne chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy violently sits up in cold sweat, panting. Was that all a dream? Huffing, he looks to the left at his gripping hand, and sees it. The pencil! So it wasn't a dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you fucking retarded?\" Tim tells himself. \"You could've just grabbed a pencil off your desk and went to sleep with it. It doesn't mean anything. I thought you were already grown up to be believing in fairy tales.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door startles the 15 year old as he flinches, dropping the pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, lil' bro, what're you doing in there? You jerking off or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ugh</i>. He thought. It was Emily, his 17 year old big sister. Pretty, with a lean body and waist, thick hips and ass, and generous breasts, she was the number one model at school. Captain of the cheerleading team and top student in academics, she was the perfect girl that everyone yearned to either be (in the case of girls) or be with (in the case of guys). However, her true personality resided under that mask, which only Timothy knew. She would constantly talk dirty when in his presence, even mentioning his 'tiny cock' (god damn it, it's not like he wanted it!) often, and would constantly walk around the house naked when the parents were away. In short, she was a sex-starved freak (and a virgin, ironically).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I just woke up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you tiny pricked face?\" There she goes again. \"Anyways, mom wants you to be up, so I delivered her message. See you later, lil' bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally. Timothy picked the pencil back up. Should he test it? He decides that he probably should. He thinks about it when Emily's face comes to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! I'll show her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe begins to draw, for lack of a better term, on his dick. Enlarging it, causing it to swell, to lengthen. The process only takes a minutes as he soon finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" He says, not believing his eyes. Unlike the small 2 inch penis that he was used to, a massive cock was almost hanging to his knees. \"Is this... is this real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabs it, hesitatingly, and strokes it one or two times. It was real. He could <i>feel</i> it. Not only that, it began to rise, swelling as blood was pumped to it, soon turning into a full blown erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving it another one or two strokes, he begins to feel lightheaded as the blood is diverted from his brain to his hard dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels amazing, but...\" Tim touches his head. \"I'd rather not get a headache every time I want to masturbate. Looks like I'll have to take a shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he begins to move to the door, Timothy stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thinks back to last week, back when his sister burst into his room, naked, making fun of his small dick. Tim wasn't sure what her problem was, but he did see more than a glimpse of her bare pussy. Envisioning it, he begins to draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim stands awkwardly in the middle of his room, the same as he always is, with the glaring exception of the replica of his sister's pussy located where his penis should be. Extending his arm to it and touching his clitoris, he moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, this feels nice! Is this how sis always feels? I can kind of see why she thinks about sex all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that he spent the last 5 minutes drawing his newfound pussy, Tim panics slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I'm almost running late for school. I need to get dressed and I don't really have much time to have a shower. I could skip a little bit of class, but I don't my parents would approve. At the same time, I kind of want to know what the tapping with the eraser does, the God did hype it up to be something interesting. Hmm...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>m! Come on, you don't have much time left!\" His dad's voice resounds from the kitchen with an agitated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! Coming!\" Tim replies with an audible shout, rushing towards the drawer. Sifting through the several pairs of underwear in it, he decides to discard the boxers he usually wears and go for microfiber briefs that his mom got him last week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>These should conform better</i>. Tim thinks as he pulls them up his legs. And while they are no panties, the briefs sit on his boyish ass with the minimum amount of chafing, to which Tim grunts a sound of approval. Quickly throwing on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, Tim briefly scans the room in search for the pencil he dropped when heading to the drawer. The floor reveals nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell? Did the pencil roll underneath the drawer or bed?</i> Tim thinks as he's about to check underneath those locations, before the resounding voice of his father interrupts him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim! Get a move on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" Tim shouts as he runs downstairs. The pencil will have to wait. He'd rather not get on his parents' bad side again after he was just grounded two weeks ago. Moving to the kitchen, Tim sees his father sitting at the kitchen table, finishing up his oatmeal, while his mom was packing the eggs and sausage mean for breakfast into his lunchbox. His mom was quite a gorgeous woman, and rightfully so, considering that his sister came from her. Long brown hair reaching her breasts and green eyes paired together to create a soothing combination to her soft facial features and puckered lips. Her breasts were quite voluminous, but more so her butt and thighs. His friend always joked that he would love to get his head squeezed in between her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Tim!\" His mom's voice resounds as she places the lunchbox near his backpack. \"You took so long to get ready, so I just packed your breakfast along with your lunch. You can eat it during classroom breaks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom,\" Tim responds as he throws a brief glance at his father. He is quite chiseled, with a square jaw and unkempt dark hair. Glasses adorn his blue eyes as they finish reading the newspaper and throw a glance at you. Tim's friend was used to calling him 'Clark Kent' as a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid,\" his father greets Tim amicably, \"Took so long to get out of bed? In my childhood, I had to get up at 5 AM and run 10 miles to the nearest town in order to go to school. You're quite lucky to have these school buses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim rolled his eyes. It was the same story his dad told over and over again. He was already frankly quite sick of it. It's not like he didn't have his own set of problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, thanks mom. I'll be heading out right now.\" Tim comments as he opens the door and sees the school bus rolling up to a stop. Tim was just about to run up to the bus before his mother smothered him with a vice grip and pecked him on the forehead with her lips. Tim's face reddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, stop doing that, I'm going to be late!\" Tim says, wrenching from her grip and jogging up to the bus. He enters the bus to the sounds of laughter and smooching sounds. Someone was even shouting, \"Mama's boy!\" at him. Keeping his head down low, he waltzed up to his friend Jamie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup,\" Tim tells him, plopping down onto the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, man,\" Jamie replies, snarling, \"Man, nice mom you have there. Practicing your kissing skills on her? Man, I can't wait for the day I get to fuck that slutty, tight MILF ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. Jamie shot up into the air with sudden speed as he quickly marched to the back of the bus and away from his friend. He could endure everything. He could endure jokes about himself, insults about himself, and hell, even jokes about his mother. But this crossed the line. He just plain insulted his entire family with that line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe plopped down on the seat next to a girl with his arms crossed. This girl was Anna, a friend whom he knew from middle school. Her parents emigrated from Russia when she was young, which could be seen in her shoulder-length blond hair, light blue eyes, and charming face. She's also been developing quite adequately recently, her pert breasts sitting there on her chest just waiting to be handled. Needless to say, Tim had a (not so) secret crush on her, but since he didn't know whether she liked him or not, he couldn't get the courage to confess to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tim\" she chirps as she notices him sitting beside her, \"What's wrong? Not feeling it to sit with Jamie today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's such a prick,\" Tim replies, grumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he can definitely say a mean thing or two accidentally. What was it about? Your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he said he wanted to screw my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sucked the air in her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was really childish and uncalled for. Looks like I'll need to talk to him later.\" Anna replies. Tim knew that Anna stuck fear into Jamie and would definitely bring him in line. Though, he always was kinda of unsure about her relationship with him. They seemed like friends through an acquaintance, him to be precise, but he could never shake a feeling that the two were somewhat closer than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tim was twitching in his seat. He just couldn't sit straight with thoughts of his newfound pussy in between his legs. The whole experience felt alien to him and was quite bizarre. Attempting to calm down, he shut his eyes and began to take deep breaths. However, he was suddenly interrupted by...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, do you need to pee? I noticed that you keep fidgeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's concentration broke, his mind in a raging whirlpool as he glanced over to one of his dearest friends. The various trees zoomed by past the window, leaves already turning slightly yellow in the anticipation of the coming fall, as the grey construction buildings blurred in the scenery. He saw the attentive gaze focusing on him, a coy smile curling on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Did she notice?</i> Tim thought that even the thought of it was absurd. But over the years he'd known her, Tim understood that Anna should not be one to underestimate. She was curious, mischievous, hungry for knowledge. Perhaps that was the effect of her Russian blood, or perhaps that was a trait unique to her. But the most important was that she seemed to pierce anyone as finely as threading a needle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? I hope that your answer won't be boring.\" Anna winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... actually, I want to show you something. Not here though. In private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes seem to light up like a Christmas tree, glistening brightly like the sun. Her hands fold around Tim's in a friendly manner, cupping them in a handshake. \"Now this sounds like something interesting! I know a place where we can discuss this secretly at school. Let's go there straight away, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" Tim nervously gulped, wondering if it was such a good idea to tell Anna about the events that happened to him this morning. He'll leave out the entity he met in his dreams - he didn't want to appear <i>too</i> crazy. But he was definitely on planning on baring his newfound pussy to his friend. He just couldn't handle keeping it all in secret, and who best to confide in than his closest friend who's been with him for several years? If only he knew what was being done with the subject of interest right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, look at this mess! That kid is always such a trouble.\" The dainty fingers of Mrs. Anderson picked up the strewn shirts, jeans, and underwear across the room. \"He didn't even respond to my farewell kiss today! I do hope that he's not a troublemaker at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes that were tucked underneath her arm were quickly deposited into the basket laying at her feet, meant to store them until the day of cleaning. Tim's mom looked around the room, noticing the settled dust on the walls and windows. She proceeded to open one of them, the cool, late summer's breeze blowing into the messy room, wafting about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! That should do it. Now, time for my weekly inspection.\" Tim's mother balled her hands into fists, placing them gently on her hips in a 'let's see what you've got' manner. This was her warning pose for what's to come as she hastily burst open the drawer with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Anderson was a housewife in every sense of the word. While her husband was off at work, earning large sums of money at a pharmaceutical giant, she stayed home, cooked meals, cleaned the house... and thoroughly searched the rooms of her children for pornographic paraphernalia. It was partly because of this reason that Emily remained a virgin... she couldn't smuggle a dildo into her room, let alone a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs someone who was raised in a truly religious family, Mrs. Anderson placed a complete ban on any cardinal sin, including those related to sexuality. Mr. Anderson, a former atheist who converted also agreed with her, placing a strict restriction on browsing porn, owning erotic magazines, and even masturbating. Tim had to spend an hour after school every day to release his load, lest he be embarrassed the same way when he was taken to a priest at 11 years old to repent his sins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha!\" She exclaimed, noticing something underneath his bed. \"I swear, if he's gone bad I'll need to take him to the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words were cut short as she pulled out a simple, yellow pencil. The one you would find with an eraser nub on top. She was slightly disappointed at the fact that it was something so simplistic - so innocent - but more relieved than anything as she tucked it into the pocket of her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, that boy shouldn't litter...\" She trailed off, as she headed to the kitchen to fill out dentist appointment forms for both of her children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being at the back on the bus, Tim and Anna were the first ones to shoot out of it as it skid to a stop, the brown-painted school clearly visible from the windows. She dragged him along with her in a vice-like grip that seemed to be inescapable no matter how much he twisted or rotated. Tim briefly wondered if this was how crocodile victims felt like as he was being led through the corridors of the school. Anna seemed particularly excited in finding out what Tim had to say. Perhaps too excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he snapped out of his thoughts, he noticed that the girl had already stopped, motioning him to enter the door in front of him. A brief look at the sign above it revealed the location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you want me to go inside the <i>girl's locker room</i>?\" Tim hissed, glancing between Anna's face and the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? No one's here around this time of the day, so it's pretty secure! Come on, don't be a wuss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts, let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim sighed in exasperation, realizing that he was getting himself into something unbelievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Anderson flipped over the sheets of the dental forms of her children, her bare, feminine hand reaching out towards the black pencil case sitting at the edge of the counter, which, to her dismay, was found to be empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" She exclaimed in shock, glancing downwards at the papers in her hands. How could she had forgotten that they were out of supplies? After all, the children had just returned to school not long ago - they needed writing utensils, to write down notes, to learn in class. She hadn't restocked once they were gone - there were none left in this house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden thought popped into her head, as she recalled the pencil that she picked up in her little boy Tim's room. Withdrawing the pencil from her blouse, she shook her head. The act of theft was quite sinful, she shouldn't use it without his permission. But if she was just loaning it... she would make sure to return it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, let's do Timmy's form first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Anderson slightly wet the pencil with her lips, giving it a brief smuck as she proceeded to write in 'Timothy Anderson' in the <i>NAME</i> section. She was about to proceed before the ring of the telephone came, causing her to jolt a bit, before picking up the phone. A standard greeting escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mrs. Anderson speaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mollie! It's me, Natasha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha - whose full name was Natalia Popova - was also a housewife, a Russian immigrant whom Mrs. Anderson met at a local housewife meeting. Amusingly enough, she was also the mother of Tim's friend Anna, even though neither she had met Tim a single time, nor had Mrs. Anderson met Anna once. She lived just a block away from the Andersons and she and Mrs. Anderson were quite close friends, just like Anna and Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natasha! How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine. Thank you. And how about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know, the same old. How's your daughter faring recently? I heard she's the same age as my son. We should arrange a meeting between them soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's doing fine. Thank you for asking. There's a boy she's telling me she's close friends with at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Anderson nodded her head as she proceeded to the next section on the form - gender. Her hand negligently floated over the box next to the word 'Female' and crossed it with firm and grace. A silly mistake produced by her being distracted by the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A boy, you say?\" Mrs. Anderson repeated, giving a brief smile to her days of youth and romanticism. Of course, she didn't expect high-schoolers to cross that line yet - they weren't married after all - but it was the perfect opportunity to build relationships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say boy? Oh, I'm sorry. I meant to say girl. She's close friends with a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Typical.</i> Mrs. Anderson thought, disappointed that her feelings were crashed and burned within seconds. But this did give rise to a new opportunity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then she should really meet my son some time. How does Saturday sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a son? I thought you mentioned that you only had two daughters. Saturday's fine though! See you then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd, Mrs. Anderson thought, as the dull tone of the phone ringed in the background, indicating that Natasha had already hung up. Placing the phone back onto the holder, she wondered about Natasha's last remark as she proceeded to fill out the bottom of the form before flipping it. <i>Two daughters?</i> Odd, she would've known if she had mentioned that. And she obviously had one daughter and one son - Emily and Tim. Where did the second daughter come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's so interesting? Show me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was already somewhat regretting his decision as he nervously decided whether he should really pull down his pants in front of his best friend. God, even thinking about that was awkward. But he had already crossed the Rubicon River, the point of no return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, whatever I do, please don't be surprised. This is kind of awkward for me, but I trust you enough. Please don't make this more awkward for me.\" He carefully stated to Anna's nodding motion. It was clear that she was riled up. There was no letting go. Taking a deep breath, he calmly braced himself and... pulled down his jeans in a swift motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stood there for a second, frozen, blinking twice before saying...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stuffing the pencil into the pocket of his school uniform, he hurried to the bathroom. As he stood under the shower head, he glanced down at the perfect, pink pussy between his legs, his hand drifting towards it - just as a torrent of water flowed over it, washing it down the drain. His minuscule manhood popped back into being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim, what are you doing in the shower at this time?! You're going to miss the bus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just be a minute, dad!\" he yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have a minute! If I'm late for work again because you miss your bus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim shut off the shower and quickly toweled himself dry. As he grabbed his school uniform to pull it on, the pencil clattered onto the floor. It wouldn't take that long to redraw... would it? The thought of whipping it out in the changing rooms in Phs Ed began to play in his mind. Hastily he began to redraw the monster dong from before. He had already completed one testicle and was halfway up the shaft when- \"<b>Tim! The bus is leaving!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm coming,\" he sighed. It was not a pretty sight. His manhood looked like a half-inflated balloon replete with one grotesquely swollen testicle. He would have to finish it up at school. He pulled his uniform on, stuffing it down one trouser leg, and opened the door to his father's furious face. \"Sorry,\" he mumbled. \"I'll make it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it up to my boss,\" his dad growled. \"Go get in the car, I'll be down in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffed full with manmeat, the fabric of his trouser leg was pulled tight. With just the first step, he could feel the course material rubbing against it. That could be a problem, he thought, shifting his gait into an awkward limp to stop the rubbing getting him too excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey drove to school in angry silence. Though Tim was dying to tell his dad about the pencil, he could see it would be best saving it for another time. First bell had already rung and the corridors were already empty by the time he arrived at school. The first class was English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Late again, Timothy ,\" tutted Mr Draper, the English teacher, as Tim tried to sneak in. Nothing went unnoticed beneath Draper's hawklike gaze. Tim glumly slunk to his desk, carefully rearranging his snake before sitting to avoid crushing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld \"Droney\" Draper returned to his lecture. On the desk to his right sat his friend, Jamie, who shot him a curious look before quietly tearing a sheet from his book and scribbling a note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Why are you walking so funny?] it read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim smirked. He pulled out the pencil and wrote [You really don't want to know]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet when he tried to pass the note back, Jamie merely stared at it. Tim's hand hung there outstretched, but his friend refused to take it, pointedly ignoring the note as if he didn't want to know all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Late<i> and</i> passing notes, Timothy,\" came the blood-chilling voice of Draper. \"See me after class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim sulked. After a few minutes, the teacher turned to the board and Tim took the opportunity to scribble another note. [Draper really has a stick up his ass today]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as though a ripple had passed through the room. When he turned to pass the scrap of paper across, he saw Jamie was now sat with his feet up on the desk, playing on his phone. As abruptly as pressing play on a song, an excited, chatty hubbub kicked in from the class who, much to Tim's surprise, were also slacking off, making paper aeroplanes, making jokes, making out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Mr Draper was suddenly nowhere to be seen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open. In strode a women in a suit and her mid thirties. Slamming her bag down on the teacher's desk with enough noise and authority to draw attention, she announced, \"Okay, settle down everybody. Settle down. Good morning. I'm sorry I'm late. My name is Ms Lisa Mayhew. I am going to be your substitute English teacher for today. Please get your books out and open them wherever you left off last lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the students asked, \"Miss, what's happened to Mr Draper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Draper has been, uh, taken ill. He's had to go to the doctors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chubby girl called Jessica who was the center of every rumour going in the school thrust her hand into the air. \"Miss, my friend Annabelle says that her sister saw Draper fall ass-first onto a tree branch in the park on his way to work. She said they had to get the ambulances out and everything, but even the paramedics couldn't get it out! Is that true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corner of the substitute's mouth twitched as if repressing a smile. \"I'm afraid I can't really be encouraging any rumours at this time. Let's all just wish for Mister Draper's quick recovery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's hand was trembling around the pencil as he stared from the note to the reality around him. Somehow the pencil had done this.</span></div></div>",

Sure it was unnatural for Jamie to suddenly ignore him, and he was sure that Mr. Draper was just present, teaching the class, but it could've been just his imagination and he mistook the teachers. Besides, he wasn't even certain that Mr. Draper was hospitalized because of a stick in his ass. Maybe he had appendicitis?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try something out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim decides that he needs to test something that cannot happen. Something that is completely supernatural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teleportation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ability to warp through space to another location. Such a thing cannot happen, but with the ability to mold the fabric of reality to his own whims, such a thing would be a breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's test it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it for a minute, Tim decides that he should make a surprise visit to his sister, mostly because the girls are having P.E. now and he definitely wouldn't mind checking out their lockers. Grabbing yet another piece of paper and the pencil, he decides to write. <i>I am currently with my sister Emily, with the pencil and the note</i>. A sudden ripple travels through the fabric of reality, molding it, as Timothy finds himself in a different location...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Tim could not believe his eyes. It worked! He currently resided in the girls' locker room, lustfully looking at all the girls in their brassieres and underwear. He could see Vanessa, the tit queen, who had sizable H-cup (or so it was rumored) breasts, shimmying on her sports bra. He could see Anastasia, whom was his sister's friend and his longtime crush, stretching the shorts onto her long beautiful legs. Yet, for some reason, Tim could not see his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's weird. I did specify that I would teleport to her</i>. Tim thinks, standing up. Or, at least, he tries... before realizing that he couldn't move!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's going on?</i> Tim thinks. <i>Why can't I move?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim proceeds to try to stretch his legs, bend his arms, tilt his head, all for naught. It seemed as if though he was paralyzed, each and every single limb not functioning as they should. Suddenly, he starts to move, but not of his own will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Weird.</i> Tim thinks. He wasn't even trying to move, yet here he was doing exactly what he wanted to do a minute ago. His sister's locker is opened, revealing the mirror attached to the inside of the door and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>N-no... it can't be...</i> Tim murmurs, or at least, murmurs in his \"head\" as he sees the figure of his sister booming in the mirror. But that wasn't the most shocking thing. No, the most shocking happened when he looked directly at himself... and saw nothing but a pair of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am...</i> Tim thinks, as he gazes over the reflection. The only thing that he could see were the blue-and-white striped panties that now adorned his sister's figure, how they stretched all over her curves. Emily bent over to pick up her sports bra, and Tim also \"bent\" with her, stretching his body to the limits over her nice ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, it stinks. What the hell has she been eating? Tim thinks, as Emily lets out a silent fart or two. This was definitely not how he wanted his day to go. And the worst part - he couldn't do anything about it. He was now just panties, a thing, an object to be worn, to be washed, and then eventually thrown away. No voice, no limbs, nothing that he can do except sit on his sister's curves and cover her crotch. Speaking of crotch, Tim began to feel wet as he could feel Emily's pussy moistening. No doubt she was getting horny once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Am I really stuck like this...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Emily, have you considered joining the cheerleader team?\" Anastasia says as she struts up to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cheerleader team...? But isn't Emily already on it? Why would me suddenly becoming panties change that?</i> Tim thinks, wondering why this new reality was that much different from his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but... you know I can't.\" Emily answers, grimacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that...\" Anastasia also grimaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anyways, see you in class I guess.\" Anastasia waves her hand, going to the gym's direction. Emily sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next couple of hours were spent by Tim in various positions, but ultimately his only role was to cover his sister's buttocks and pussy as she stood, sat, and walked wherever she pleased. Finally, it seems that school had ended as Tim sees the uniform's skirt topple to the ground, revealing his sister's room, which has way more furnishing that she previously had. No doubt the removal of his existence allowed for his parents to construct a bigger budget for his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, school suuuuucked,\" Emily says, as she begins to take her books and lunchbox out of her bag. \"Being an only child is soooo boring, and I don't really have that many friends and... hmm, what's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pulls out a sheet of paper and a pencil that she didn't recognize, staring at it blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I don't remember this. Let's see what it says,\" she says, unfolding the paper. She takes a brief glance at it, her eyes widening as she sharply turns her head to look at Tim - or rather her panties -  and back to her paper. Then back to her panties. Then back to the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...\" She says, finally looking at her striped panties. \"Tiny prick bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Finally!</i> Tim shouted inside his head. He didn't know how his sister knew that it was him, considering the fabric of reality was supposed to be changed, but he supposed that it had something to do with that paper and what he wrote on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird...\" Emily murmurs. \"You're supposed to be the panties I bought a week ago with mom, and I remember purchasing you... But at the same time I know that's false. I somehow know that I have a brother, and that you're my brother, and that is the truth, but... How weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she takes the band of her panties, and stretches Tim before snapping him back to her hips, causing him to internally wince in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, this is so funny!\" Emily smirks. \"I can't believe my little brother got himself stuck as a pair of panties! I don't even know how you did that! I guess it has something to do with this paper, or its writing, considering I only realized it's you after I read it. Hmm... maybe erasing this writing will cause you to return form?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Do it!</i> Tim screams in his head. <i>Please do it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again, not sure I'd want to do that. You're kinda comfortable as panties, and I would hate to lose them. What to do, what to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily ponders for a moment, before exclaiming, \"I know! I will...\"</span></div></div>",

First new thing Tim did was draw a meter long furry monkey tail from his lower back.  Tim was so satisfied with his new appendage he let the tail grab the pencil and had the tail draw a pair of angel wings on his hard to reach upper back.  Tim then went to work on his right arm, he drew some scribbles on it trying to picture what he wanted and it seemed to work.  Instead of a hand Tim now had what looked like a laser cannon.

Tim stepped out of the stall and worked quickly to finish before Ellie finished her business in her own stall.  Tim quickly gave himself long hair that went down to his waist that was a rainbow of colors.  On top of his rainbow hair Tim drew two large white bunny ears.  As soon as they were done Tim was surprised at how well he could hear the ambient echoes of the girls bathroom around him.  Tim then took the pencil to his eye and replaced one eye with a ruby.  Thankfully Tim could still see out of it, although admittedly with a slight red hue.  And to top it all off Tim gave himself a cartoonishly large handlebar mustache to complete the insanely ridiculous look just for the heck of it.  Tim made sure to tap the eraser to all of the changes and just in time too because as he finished, Ellie stepped out of her stall and looked at Tim.  Tim anxiously waited for a millisecond before Ellie reacted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tim's heart pounded in his chest. The women's toilets. If he was wrong, if he didn't become a girl, then this would be a very awkward situation. Tim was so focused on steeling himself to enter behind Ellie that he didn't see the outstretched foot catch his own. Tim stumbled forward, trying to reach out and grab onto something in vain. He fell stomach-first onto the tiled, linoleum floor, his backpack cluttering to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tattered combat boot that caused him to trip was attached to none other than Zack Pidge. High school senior and profligate school bully. Even worse, he had his two goons with him, Rex and Lyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woops, how clumsy of <i>you</i>, Tim!\" Chortled Zack, grabbing Tim by the shirt collar and lifting him up with his meaty cuffs. Tim stared up at the imposing, brutish figure hulking over him. Tim stood about average height for a 15 year old, but Zack loomed over everybody including most of the teachers. Rumour had it that the 6 foot, 6 inch former Varsity defensive end was expelled from the (American) football team because he beat up one of the cheerleaders after they lost a game last season. Thereafter \"Pidge The Fridge\" -- aptly named for his block head and barrel chest -- became something of a pariah at the school, a fallen angel. Not that he was much of an 'angel' to begin with, especially to people like Tim who Zack seemed to enjoy terrorizing. They didn't cross paths too often, thankfully for Tim, but God knows why the meat head found such enjoyment in singling him out in particular?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex, whose birdlike face and hyena-like demeanor reminded Tim of a creature from <i>The Lion King</i>, snatched up his backpack and picked over its contents. Lyle stood guard next to them in the hallway, making it abundantly clear that bystanders and onlookers weren't welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Pigeon?\" Tim grunted, struggling against Zack's grip and calling the bully the name he hated the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an instant, Tim thought Zack's face turned a shade of purple like an eggplant. But he regained his composure and plastered on that shit-eating grin that only meant bad news for Tim. Zack brushed off Tim's shoulders as if to wipe off dust he may have got from falling down. \"I just wanna make sure you're okay, friend-o! Such a lack of generosity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, a five syllable word!\" Tim jeered. \"How long did it take you to learn that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack merely chuckled. A low, rumbling tremor that unsettled Tim like a mini earthquake. \"Normally, I'd pound ya for that, Anderson. But I'm in a pretty good mood today. And we are friends, aren't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sure are, good friends we are!\" Parroted Rex, tossing one of Tim's books aside as he continued pouring through his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good friends help each other, don't they?\" Continued Zack. \"See... I get ya back up after you fall on your arse... and you lend me some money for lunch today! How we doin' Rex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got nothing... kid's poor as shit.\" Rex seethed finally, dumping the backpack on the ground. Some materials spilled out, including a pencil that rolled up to the tip of Zack's boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't notice it immediately, however. Instead, Zack spun Tim around and performed the time-honoured deed of bullies everywhere. \"You know what we do to kids who don't got any money?\" He grabbed Tim by the elastic waistband of his lacy knickers and yanked them upward. Tim yelped in pain. Oh, how he wished he could teach those lunkheads a lesson in manners!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds, Zack released his grasp and snapped back the frilly fabric, causing Tim to stumble forward and wince, blinking the momentary wetness out of his eyes. Too mortified to face his antagonists any longer, Tim quickly grabbed the straps of his still-open backpack and hefted it over his shoulders. He was about to bolt out of there, until Ellie came out of the girls' toilets with a furious look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack, you brain-damaged bastard!\" She shrieked. \"Why don't you pick on someone your own size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex snickered. \"Look who's coming to Timmy's defense.\" Zack folded his beefy arms and grinned stupidly. \"I don't know who you are, but I don't hit girls. Everyone knows that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie laughed spitefully. \"Ha! That's the biggest lie I've ever heard! And I've heard all about <i>that </i>story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex and Lyle rejoined their leader in the hallway. One of them said, \"C'mon, let's go boss. These two aren't worth any more of our time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zack was about to turn away and trudge out to the football field, he finally noticed the pencil at the edge of his boot. He picked it up and inspected it dimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know... Mister Carson said knowledge is the most valuable thing in the world.\" His voice boomed, putting it in the pocket of his torn-up blue jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie retorted, \"You want a pencil? What use is that to you? You've gotta be able to read and write to use one of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill spinning in embarrassment and wishing he were anywhere else but there, Tim tapped his friend on the shoulder. \"Don't piss them off any further. Let's just get to class.\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie huffed but ultimately gave in. She fired off a few more choice insults at the bullies before skipping after Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerks. They're going nowhere in life, you know that?\" Ellie prattled, trying to console her friend. \"Total losers... they're gonna be forty and still be working the drive thru window at a fast food restaurant. Assuming they're not rotting in prison somewhere by that point. Yeesh... your knickers look totally warped. Sorry about that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No big deal. These aren't really my style anyways.\" Tim said truthfully, in the way only he would understand, thanks to the reality change from the pencil. But she was right, that wedgie really did a number on Tim's underwear. He considered ditching them and 'going commando' for the school day, but the bell had already rung. Most of the students cleared out of the hallways even before his encounter with those three delinquents. And while he shared his first hour class with Ellie, he doubted that Misses McKesson would be very forgiving of their being late once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you work out some more? Y'know... lift some weights, hit the gym?\" Ellie suggested sweetly, as they picked up the pace en route to class. \"Then maybe those idiots will think twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim nodded. <i>Why spend so much time and effort working out when he had a magic pencil</i>, he thought to himself. Still believing that it was secure within his backpack instead of in the very hands of his biggest enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose story should we follow next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tim's foot was already past the classroom's entrance, as the second chime of the bell rang through the school's intercom system. <i>Safe</i>, was the first thought that came to his mind, as the sharp gaze of Missus McKesson followed him and Ellie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what I will ever do with you, Tim.\" Missus McKesson remarked, shaking her head. Her auburn hair had been tied into a bun, and the thick-rimmed glasses adorned her intimidating, dark-brown eyes, giving her a stern and authoritative appearance \u2013 not too far away from her actual personality. Nonetheless, while her wrath burned brighter than a thousand suns, she was also fair and reserved punishment only for rule-breakers. \"But I suppose you did arrive on time today. Go take a seat. And Ellie, well... I'm certain that it was Tim who caused you to dawdle as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was certain that Missus McKesson wouldn't give <i>him</i> reprieve had Ellie been the first one to step in. But all he could was keep his mouth shut, as he rushed towards his seat. Best not to argue. The classroom seats themselves were arranged in a structured grid; 3 rows and 3 columns of 3 desks grouped together, a total of 27. The seating was randomized, of course, but through either sheer luck or the fortune of the gods (God? At the very least, Tim had only seen one), Tim had been seated together at the back with his friends Ellie and Jamie. Or perhaps it was due to Ellie's influence. She <i>was</i> Missus McKesson's favorite student, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup, dudes!\" Jamie greeted, adjusting his glasses and patting the seat next to him. Tim made a point to note his greeting, but could glean nothing from it. Jamie greeted everyone with 'dude'. \"Already running into trouble with the Demoness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim chuckled. Jamie had always been somewhat of an odd guy, a mix of various immiscible traits. On the one hand: frizzy, red hair; black, browline eyeglasses; and freckles scattered around his cheeks. The stereotypical look of a nerd, and the intelligence to boot \u2013 straight A's in math and sciences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet he was also erratic, cunning, mischievous, and held a vast array of connections, including his brother \u2013 John the Gun \u2013 captain and the star quarterback of the football team, aptly named for his ability to throw the ball as quickly as the bullet out of a gun chamber. Tim had suspected that he was the reason why Jamie had avoided the bullies thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, Jamie!\" Ellie frowned, chastising her other friend. \"You know she doesn't like it when you call her that! Lord knows how many times I had to talk her out of giving you detention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, my fair lady. Would you also like a glass of wine with that?\" Jamie retorted, semi-kowtowing in a mocking manner. Tim had to suppress his giggles, as he stared at Ellie's open mouth. Jamie was truly a master when it came to getting on other people's nerves. It took her several seconds before she noticed her hanging jawbone, at which point she simply snapped it shut with a 'hmph!', and turned away. Tim silently apologized to her in his mind, hoping that she wouldn't hold <i>too</i> much of a grudge against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, Tim, you got to check out this thing out!\" Said Jamie excitedly, rustling in the compartments of his traveler backpack. \"Had to smuggle it all the way from Japan. My dad's been keeping tabs on me ever since that incidence with the miniature figurines, so I had to rope in my bro to do it for me. Called me weird for wanting it, but luckily I only need to throw a football with him a couple times for him to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly pulled a bound booklet from the left compartment of his bag, presenting it to Tim. It wasn't thick; maybe a half-inch at most, and its dimensions were on the smaller size too. Nevertheless, Tim instantly recognized the \"style\" of the drawing on the cover, resembling that of recent manga coming out from Japan. He had been introduced to them by Jamie three years ago when they first met \u2013 the vivid cover of <i>Two Piece</i> still within his memory. Tim was embarrassed to admit that he first thought that it was something about the beach and swimsuits, but was pleasantly surprised by the grand adventures of a paper-boy and his crew, who sailed the seven seas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Tim asked, as Ellie shuffled closer to get a better look at the cover. It was a cute girl with the traditional big eyes; sleek, black hair; and a button nose, wearing what appeared to be a halter top and baggy pants. The title read, \"Futanari Gallery\". Jamie only smiled in reply, before turning to the first page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tim and Ellie recoiled; their jaws dropping, their eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is <i>that</i>?\" Ellie spat out, irritation clear in her voice. Tim could only groan in reply, as he steadily examined the contents of the page. It was a drawing of a nude girl, about 16 or 17 years of age, lying on a Chesterfield sofa, as one of her hands rested on her breasts, while the other was propped up underneath her head, supporting it. The proportions were phenomenal \u2013 hips and waist that curved into an hourglass figure, breasts the size of melons that would overflows in one's hands, and legs that would cause any teenage boy looking at them to grow a stiffie. But the most surprising part about her figure was the flaccid manhood that was attached to her crotch, running down her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <i>futanari</i>, as it says on the cover. A Japanese word for a girl with a dick. You seriously didn't know that?\" Remarked Jamie sarcastically, rolling his eyes in an exasperated manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike you, I'm not some deranged pervert who spends his time obsessing about Japanese cartoons!\" Ellie crudely replied, before softening the tone of her voice. \"Yeesh! Are you seriously into that? And here I was trying to convince one of my girl-friends to give you a chance and try dating you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate your concern.\" Jamie replied in a sing-songy voice. \"No, seriously, I really appreciate your effort. But I fear that none of your troupe will be able to understand the divine gift that I am. Besides, isn't it kind of the same with you and...?\" His eyes flitted between Ellie and Tim, with her eyes following suit. A revelation seems to come to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.... oooooohh...\" Ellie breathed out, understanding the meaning behind his words. \"You're right, I guess it is kind of similar! I guess we need to find you a girl with a big one, huh?\" She playfully jestered between her legs, shaking her fist in a pumping motion. \"It would only be my pleasure!\" He retorted back just as playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tim was carefully examining the details on the booklet, flipping the pages as he saw more and more \"dick-girls\"; completely oblivious to the conversation nearby him. It interested him. He had always assumed that his friend was of a more normal variety \u2013 at least, by Jamie's standards. He had never stepped down from a discussion with Tim about girls, always describing them as, \"lovable creatures\", \"fascinating beings\", and \"curious exemplars\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad this morning's change in reality caused his personality to shift, and delve into the depths of the unknown? Or had this always been a front, his dark desires lurking deep within all the time? Or perhaps this was just a playful joke; an innocent prank to rile up Ellie? All these thoughts circled inside Tim's mind. His actions this morning were fleeting ones, but not even a day had gone by and he was already learning more about his friend than in the past month. His intellectual curiosity hungered for knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim took one more glance at the booklet before an idea sprang into his mind. What if he brought one of <i>those</i> into reality? Perhaps he could attach the appendage to Ellie, or even Missus McKesson. Would there be drastic changes in their attitude, or would they simply carry on in life, acting as they always were? Tim's mind was swamped with such thoughts as he riffled through the contents of his school backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The homework is page 76, questions 1 through 8. I expect it to be done by Wednesday. You are all now dismissed.\" Missus McKesson's stoic voice resounded through the class, before she headed back to erase the chalky formulas and diagrams jotted down on the blackboard. However, Tim's mind was elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pencil was nowhere to be found. Thirty minutes of search, an emptying of the bag, and meticulous inventorying of his possessions yielded nothing. His mind frantically recounted his steps, as it searched for the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Tim! We're going to be late for gym!\" Said Ellie, shaking his shoulder. \"Or would you prefer to run into that jerkface Zack and his gang again?\" Tim's face paled, as he recalled his encounter with Zack the Pidge earlier that day. The panty-warping wedgie, the mean-spirited trip, the... pencil by his combat shoe. He realized where the pencil was currently located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" Prompted Ellie, shaking him by the shoulder even harder. Tim knew that he needed to find Zack immediately, in order to retrieve the pencil. He was the last person whose hands it should be left within. But, at the same time, where would he find him? Was it worth running in the empty corridors of the building in his frantic search, risking his movement being restrained by detention?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Tim decide to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tim's mind was racing elsewhere, to the pencil -- the magic wand -- that was currently in Zack's hands. He wanted nothing more than to retrieve the all-powerful object from the hands of that brute. But he stopped himself. He knew that his impatience would lead him nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start, where would he even find Zack? He would typically be roaming the fields of the football team by now, but he had been banned from going there since the cheerleader incident. And Tim highly doubted that Zack would attend his classes. And if he did find him, so what? The pencil was now firmly in his hands (or in his pocket), and Tim could hardly just walk up to him and demand it back -- even a meathead such as Pidge the Fridge would suspect something's wrong. No, what Tim needed was a plan -- a very good one -- if he wanted to retrieve the almighty tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiiiiiim,\" Shouted Ellie in this half-annoyed, half-melodic voice. It always grabbed his attention. \"We need to go! Now! Stop dawdling on the spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming, I'm coming,\" Replied Tim in a groaning, exasperated voice, trotting after his protective friend. He had always regarded Ellie as somewhat of a gadfly, stinging his bottom to constantly pester him forward. Not that he minded, of course, since he always regarded her behavior as that of someone who truly cares about him, but it did get on other people's nerves. Which he was quite happy to admit, as he relished the time he spent with her, and wanted it to remain uninterrupted. He was a bit embarrassed to admit, but... he had feelings for her, though she didn't know of them. At least, he hoped not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... see you in class?\" Said Tim halfheartedly by the time they reached the lockers, panting as he peeked at her from underneath his eyebrows. He made a move towards the blue door on the left, with an apt symbol of a male stick figure decorating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where are you going?\" Shouted Ellie, motioning him to come over with her hand. \"Since when did you start hanging out with the boys? You always complained that they would bully you for being a little... different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't the girls...\" Tim began, but quickly cut himself off. Ellie had already emerged directly in front of his face, peering into it as if she was examining a fine work of art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong with you today? Since when you were worried about that?\" Inquired Ellie, tapping her chin. Tim simply shrugged his shoulders. The two stood there silently, as if they were playing stare-off, before Ellie turned back around and headed towards the female locker room. Tim followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female locker room. The dream of every high school boy to be within. And Tim was now living that dream. He was surrounded by various-colored frills and laces that were attached to the bras and panties worn by girls. It was enough to make him blush. And to also make him feel... something, some wet feeling beneath him, in his crotch. It was strange, and it was different from a growing erection, yet felt pleasant nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tim!\" A figure suddenly jumped on and wrapped her arms around him from behind. Tim instinctively turned his head and, no matter how he tried, he could not help but elicit a gasp. It was the star cheerleader of the school, Betty White! \"Surprised you, didn't I?\" She purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not really,\" Uttered Tim as he escaped from her grasp, but he knew that he was lying. Betty was every boy's wet dream, someone who they could only dream of talking to. Even simply passing by her in the halls was a moment worthy of praise (especially since she was constantly accompanied by her troupe!) and earned the envy of others around him. Tim himself only had limited contact with her through being Jamie's friend, as she was his brother John's girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now here she was, standing in front of him in her underwear. The bra that was supporting her sizable breasts (E-cups? Tim wasn't sure of the measurement) and her panties were ridden with lace, and were a sort of darkish-pink, giving of more of a cutesy feeling than a sexy one. And it suited her well. That, as well as the long, blonde hair cascading down her neck and her sky-blue eyes, gave off a feeling off a \"girl-next-door\". And it suited her well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, stop it!\u201d Ellie stepped in between them. \u201cGosh! You\u2019re embarrassing him, Betty. Look how red he is right now.\u201d The truth was that Tim was blushing due to the copious amounts of nude bodies around him, but he didn\u2019t want Ellie to know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Tim minds it,\u201d Betty slithered up to him in a coiling manner, before quickly taking him under her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m stealing your boyfriend or anything \u2013 Tim and I are just good friends. We even went panty shopping last week. See?\u201d Betty\u2019s slender, dainty finger hooked into the waistband of Tim\u2019s jeans, before quickly yanking them down to expose his waist and smooth, hairless legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe black thong that I got him as a present, all...\u201d She paused, her blue eyes thinning and carefully peering downwards, as if they were attentively focusing on something small, like an ant. \u201cTim, what happened to your knickers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat jerk Zack came out of nowhere and attacked him,\u201d Ellie answered for him. \u201cThose are the damages that he incurred, unfortunately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZack?!\u201d Betty exclaimed, eyes wide open. \u201cI should\u2019ve known it would be him. Oh, how glad am I that the pervert had finally been kicked off the team. Lord knows how many times I caught him taking a peek of my underwear whenever I do a kick. Should I get my father to do something about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Tim shrugged his shoulders. Betty\u2019s dad was the principal. \u201cThough I\u2019m really sorry that your gift got ruined. I should\u2019ve taken better care of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Betty waved her hand off. \u201cYou\u2019re not to blame. In fact, this gives us an excuse to go shopping once more today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim gave her a shy grin. Perhaps he could get used to this, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sat in the hardwood seat of his chair, continuously fidgeting in it from boredom. For perhaps the first time of his life, he had finally attended a math class, more from there being nothing else to do. He was kicked off the field, again, and after some hesitation, had finally decided to attend class for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe considered it the biggest mistake of his life. The terms thrown out by the teacher seemed to be a bunch of mumbo jumbo, and it did nothing more than bore him to death. Seriously, who is ever going to use \u2018inti grails\u2019 and \u2018dare vat eves\u2019 in his life? Certainly not him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also pissed. Very pissed. He had thought that messing with Tim would improve his mood, but it did nothing more than worsen it, especially when Ellie came to his aid. Ellie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did that girl see in Tim anyways? He was nothing, a wimp that deserved to get his ass beaten time and time again. Meanwhile, he would workout at the gym at the day, building those hefty biceps to make any lady swoon to him. She deserved him, not that twerp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took another look at his mostly empty sheet of homework paper, before proceeding to take the pencil out of his pocket and scratching a sentence on it with his chicken scrawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! I wish,\u201d he snickered, before handing in his paper and throwing the worthless pencil into the trash can. He confidently walked out of the room \u2013 the gym awaited him, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he write?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So when are you going to tell him about us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie breathed while nibbling Tim's neck. Ellie's parents didn't get home from work until late most evenings, which gave the two teenagers plenty of time to 'fool around' in her bedroom after school. They were both mostly nude, with the exception of Tim still wearing the thong from earlier, resized to fit his boyish waist and hips. Laying on top of the bed sheets, Tim and Ellie were spooning with Tim leaning into Ellie as the 'big spoon.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is there to tell?\" Tim replied, groaning as she caressed his inner thigh and ran a slender finger across his <i>mons veneris</i>. Since secretly asking to be her boyfriend, Tim enjoyed the thrill of sneaking in these make out sessions with her behind Jamie's back. As it turned out, Zack's wish was interpreted very narrowly as establishing a romantic relationship between Tim and Jamie. However, since Zack only said <i>Jamie </i>was gay, he created something of a love triangle between his enemies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right therrrrre,\" Tim cooed, as Ellie reached inside Tim's thong and rubbed his clitoris. Of all the novel sensations of transforming his penis into a vagina, Tim liked that little nub resting at the top of his labia the very most. The second thing he liked the most was a freshly shaved vagina: both his and Ellie's. Not to mention how handsy Ellie would get in bed. He shifted over and returned the favour by kneading Ellie's breasts, feeling her nipples harden as he tweaked them softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not gonna tell me why you're leading poor Jamie on?\" Said Ellie. \"You know how much he loves you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know I don't roll that way, babe.\" Muttered Tim. They kissed, pressing their warm bodies against each other. Tim <i>did </i>feel a little bad about using Jamie to escape Zack's bullyings. What with Jamie's brother's girlfriend's Dad being the principal of the school. All it took was one well-placed call and that bully would be persona non grata. Nobody fucked with Principal White. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd nobody would dare lay a hand on Tim as long as he had Jamie wrapped around his little finger. So what if the cost was pretending to be gay in public? Ellie knew the truth anyway. Besides, Jamie had a lot of redeeming qualities as a friend, sexuality notwithstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's his big cock you like so much?\" Ellie teased playfully but crudely. She sat up in bed, still straddling Tim's naked form. \"Tell me: Have you slept with Jamie recently? How big is he? Is he cut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross! You know he and I haven't... <i>done it</i>...\" Tim grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yet!\" Giggled Ellie, every one of her honeyed words dripping with cheekiness. \"Or... Maybe that's what you <i>want </i>me to think! You must roll in the hay with him every night you aren't here at home with me. My, my... you truly<i> are</i> a little slut aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it when you talk dirty to me.\" He deadpanned, sticking out his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you do, baby.\" Ellie grabbed Tim's neck and pulled him close up to her chest. \"I bet you wanna bury your face into my chest, don't you loverboy?\" She pushed him away coyly. \"Well you can't! Not until you tell me how much you want them. Jamie doesn't have a set as nice as these, does he!\" She cupped her perky C-cups, complete with pink areolas and dotted with little bullet-sized nips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time, me and Jamie aren't a thing.\" Tim sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To everybody else at school, you <i>are</i>.\" She persisted. \"And you should know what a dangerous game you're playing: Toying with the heart of the principal's daughter's boyfriend's brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me.\" Groaned Tim. Maybe once he recovered that wish-granting pencil he could make Jamie be someone else's boyfriend. Or, better yet, just wish away those stupid bullies who made him start this whole charade with Jamie in the first place. But how to get the pencil back? Since Tim still believed it was in Zack's possession, he could only hope Zack hadn't discovered its powers yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Tim's juices were really flowing. Even Ellie noticed and remarked about how 'wet' he was getting and started to fear they would make a mess of the bed. She actually forced him off the bed and told him to clean himself up, abruptly cutting the affair short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Ellie, that's not fair!\" Tim whinged peevishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bedroom, my rules.\" She laughed, smoothing out her gorgeous blonde hair. \"Besides, Mom and Dad will be home soon. Don't put on that thong, Zack utterly ruined it. Why don't you try on one of mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt you'd have any that fit me proper,\" Tim replied, \"Not with that big ass of yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie blushed profusely and pouted. \"Sh-shut up! You know you like it.\" Twirling around at her bedroom doorway, she watched with satisfaction as Tim's eyes trained themselves on her waspish figure. She loved having that power over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWadding up the thong, Tim opted to simply zip up his trousers and get on his way. But not before visiting the washroom to wipe off whatever 'juices' remained on his snatch. Ellie escorted him out the door and watched him until he clambered into his old, beat up car that looked like a relic from the previous millennium. But it was <i>his </i>car, earned from mowing many lawns and working part time over the summer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie was fairly turned on as well, but she managed to wait for Tim to be out of sight before she dashed back inside to finish herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tim is in a relationship with his gay friend Jamie.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Rochefort furrowed his brows. Grading Zack's homework after school was a trivial task since he had barely written anything at all. At least he turned something in today, the maths teacher grunted. He placed the paper into a special manilla folder designated for 'special cases' like Zack, tossed it into the drawer in his desk and locked it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced wearily at the clock and finally put on his hat and coat. As he got ready to leave the classroom, he wondered briefly whether Tim and Jamie could possibly be gay lovers. He dismissed the idea as ridiculous; after all, any idiot could see those puppy dog eyes Tim was telegraphing toward Ellie in class every day. And doesn't everyone know about Jamie's miserable track record trying to get with the girls at school? Surely if Tim and Jamie were gay lovers, he would know about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Rochefort sighed and shook his head. \"I really have to keep my nose out of teen drama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic pencil sat at the top of the trash bin in Mr. Rochefort's classroom. Luckily the school janitors replace the trash bins every <i>other </i>day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at school...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the last three years since you quit your job and committed yourself to your art full-time, depending almost entirely on your wife's paycheque to survive, you have made a little money here and there selling your talents and time out to people's requests online, drawing their fantasies, Doctor Who romance fantasies, dead pets, their furry fetish pornography, whatever. All in the hopes that it might garner some attention and bolster your profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately it had the opposite effect. Though you have attempted to release some more serious pieces since, they have only be mocked by your artistic peers, who regard you as little more than a sell-out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon... Soon they will respect you as the master that you really are. Now that you have the Pencil, everything will change. The Pencil is a conduit for your genius, able to bring to life anything you imagine with just a few strokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough therein lies the problem. The Pencil is <i>too</i> good; it almost feels like cheating. You suspect it would make even an amateur into a fantastic artist. You want others to respect <i>your</i> ability, not those of some strange artifact you found in the back of a second-hand store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is also of course the small problem that anything you draw immediately comes to life. It would certainly make for an interesting exhibition though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo perhaps the introduction of the Magic Pencil into your life hasn't quite changed <i>everything</i>. You still have a backlog of online requests to catch up with, which you doggedly intend to complete, lest you disregard to last scraps of your integrity. You still spend your thursdays and fridays trudging down to the local art college to give classes. The greatest boon the pencil has brought you in the few weeks since you discovered it is a little peace and quiet to focus on your work. Often you are left by your wife, Lucy, to look after the children. They are are a handful. Or they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week ago you discovered the pencil can turn a box of cornflakes into an energetic golden retriever puppy, easily vanished again before your wife gets home. That certainly keeps your youngest, Celeste, entertained, on the caveat that A) her mother never find out, and B) not to ever get the dog wet, for to do so would immediately reduce it to a golden slurry. At the moment, you can hear them playing in the garden beneath your attic studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for your eldest, Elise... Well her teenage attentions are currently occupied by the mysterious French-exchange student, Andre Fontaine. Ahhh, Andre. Your finest creation. Exotic, raven-haired Andre with his dark eyes filled with conflicted emotions and fiery passion, as though he had just leaped from the cover of some tawdry romance novel. Which he effectively had. Fortunately you had seen fit to deprive such a construct of its manhood before letting it lose on your daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had unfortunately not followed your enigmatic advice not to get the foreign-exchange student wet. She had discovered his artificial nature the first time they decided to share an erotic shower together, and you had been forced to disclose the existence of the Pencil to her to avoid a lifetime of emotional trauma at the intimate slurrification of her first boyfriend. She hadn't cared. She had agreed to keep the Pencil a secret, for now, just so long as she got her Fontaine fix. Fontaine 2.0 was at this moment getting hot and heavy with your daughter in her room, but fortunately quietly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was your last child, Tyler. Once a boisterous and unmanageable teenage boy, you had succeeded through the Pencil to draw him into your artistry, no-pun intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table beside the easel, the tiny female mannequin lowers the paintbrush it has been hefting single-handedly over its head for the last hour. It twists its blank, featureless face to look at you, head tilted to one side questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Tyler, you can move now,\" you reply to its unvoiced question. \"Do you want to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure nods energetically. The paintbrush clatters to the table as it jumps into your lap to get a look at the finished painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler has been fantastic since learning of the Pencil. Not only does he agree that telling mum about it would only ruin the fun, his only request was that you use it on him. The kid loves to be transformed, and he makes a fantastic model, literally! Before he couldn't sit still for five minutes. Now he happily poses for hours for your paintings. He really gets into the roles too. It has been a tremendous help in capturing the spirit of the characters you paint and the quality of your work has really improved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, you pick him up lightly in your hand and place him back on the table. Once he had been quite a handful. Now he was literally a handful. He stands about 8 inches tall from top to toes. His featureless face stares up at you as you fasten a fresh canvas onto the easel. He strikes a few poses as if to ask 'what next?': <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img00.deviantart.net/c91b/i/2015/280/7/d/female_standing_poses_by_sellenin-d9c9a30.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img00.deviantart.net/c91b/i/2015/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pre02.deviantart.net/4c67/th/pre/i/2017/112/8/8/poses__h__by_asteltainn-db6qjsa.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pre02.deviantart.net/4c67/th/pre/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance to the next request...</span></div></div>",

The first handful of months with the newfound abilities had taken some time getting used to. Sara(42), the mother, made a list of rule the family had to follow when using the pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Any and all reality changing effects were recorded in a notebook and had to be agreed upon by the majority of the family before being implemented.  The reason was because things had gotten a bit out of hand in the beginning and it took a while to sort everything back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Anything goes when transformed. Objects are meant to be used, the same goes for transforming into other people/animals, they had to play the role of whoever they turned into.  I.E. If someone turned themselves into a sandwich, they were fair game for whoever was hungry, as that has happened once. Or if someone turned into a dog, then they had to act like dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No telling people outside the family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara had made this list to try to control her chaotic family. She even had come up with a handful of interesting punishments using the pencil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband Tom(45) had taken to giving himself a hunky Adonis-like body whenever they were at home or on vacation. But whenever Tom abuses the pencil too much, She had been known to turn him into a dumb blonde bimbo and having her way him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her son's, Andrew(19) and John(20) really liked pushing the boundaries of their imagination. Sara once found Andrew, being the curious teenager he was, with massive breasts and stretching out a top she had really liked, so she had punished him by making him into a female dog and letting the family dog, a large German Shepherd named Rex, mate with her. Afterwards Sara had used him to replace her ruined top on more that one occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, John and her liked to switch places and relax from their normal roles, sometimes without telling anyone. That's always interesting, because it leads to some interesting encounters as Tom regularly likes to redraw Sara into a wide variety of forms when she's asleep. One time John found himself waking up as a Blowup doll and had been thoroughly used before being turned back into his mothers form. All the while Sara likes to have fun with John's girlfriend while these swaps take place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the real wild card was Claire(25), the oldest daughter and an art major. She almost always walked around with tattoo sleeves and a sizable bulge in her pants. and even liked using the pencil to make women out objects to use her new appendage on. On more that one occasion the family has woken up to find that they had been turned into any number of objects. From food, to animals, to sex toys, to even clothes. She'd been known to turn everyone into a sexy outfit and go clubbing with her friends. Which has lead to some awkward situations where she had forgotten a family member at a friends house. Tom will never admit it but he loved being the underwear of a tight 20-something  stranger while she went about her day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall the pencil has lead to a number of interesting situations for the Robinson's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday for instance, the pencil is currently being used by...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The Magic Pencil is the most powerful object in the known universe but to the unwitting eye it is nothing more than a standard, slightly-chewed HB pencil complete with an eraser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this seemingly unremarkable item can be used to reshape the world itself. All it needs is a canvas. Anything can be a canvas. Paper. Furniture. People. Using the pencil, imagination and a slight modicum of talent, an artist can redraw an object into any shape that they wish. A talented artist can make something indistinguishable from the real thing, down to the look, feel and even taste. Turn a dog into a sandwich for example and it will be, well and truly, in all ways, except for the occasional bark, a sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is one flaw. The transformations do not hold up to water. With just a slight shower, the transformation will melt and wash away into nothing, returning the item to its original form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake a mistake? Added an extra arm? Don't worry - with a few swipes of the eraser, any object can be easily, harmlessly erased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the magic doesn't end there. For this pencil doesn't just transform objects, it can transform reality itself.  By tapping a transformed object with the eraser, it's previous form is erased and reality rewritten as though it has always been that way to all except the current wielder of the pencil. Turn a dog into a sandwich, tap it a couple of times, and it will be as if Fido never existed. No dog bowl. No chew toy. Only you and a delicious snack that nobody will miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there's more! With just a few short sentences, reality can be yours to command. Scribble '<i>I want a sandwich</i>' with the pencil and sure enough, you will desperately desire a sandwich. Write '<i>I will soon come into wealth</i>' and all sorts of rich uncles will start dropping dead. '<i>The moon is pink and the sun is green</i>'? Sure, if you say it is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease be advised that the pencil may misinterpret vague statements and that, once written, any commands are absolute, unable to be countermanded or contradicted even by further commands such as 'The moon is white again'. Only by finding the original paper upon which a reality-warping wish is written and erasing the words, can the magic be ended. Only the writer is aware of changes to reality, though should anyone view the written wish, their memories of the true reality will return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's about it. In all other aspects, the pencil is indeed a pencil. It can be snapped, burnt and lost quite easily, will need to be sharpened when its gets blunt and will eventually be whittled down to a useless nub with enough use. So be careful with it! Make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Goodness knows what the consequences might be!</td>",
