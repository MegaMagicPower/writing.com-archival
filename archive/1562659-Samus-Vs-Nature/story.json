Her descent was only slowed down by the Sheegoth's tongue, as it made sure to get a good taste for every inch of her body before swallowing her down in one massive gulp.

She started punching the stomach walls, but all she succeeded in doing was getting her hands stuck to the wall, coated in thick slime. Slowly, the stomach walls started contracting around her, in preparation for digestion. Samus was forced to crouch down as she frantically flailed about, hoping to find an exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 30 seconds, and Samus was lying face down, breathing in slime. The chamber became tighter and tighter still, wedging deep inside of every nuance in her body. Just when she thought she could take no more, all the movement stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the cold began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike most creatures, Sheegoth's stomach acids are cold. Samus first felt this coolness in her thighs, where the acids were dripping off of stomach walls (among certain other places). The slime in Samus's mouth froze next, shutting her mouth from the inside and making it impossible for her to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus felt her hair become stiff and eventually, most of it snapped off due to the combined cold and stomach pressure. A thick layer of frost had formed across the rest of her body, and what was left of her zero suit had frozen and fallen off in chunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain in her lower body was unbearable now. It was as if two icicles had been taken and shoved through her front and back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus didn't have long to fear, though, as soon her body became completely stuck in ice, and choked off her breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes later, Samus found the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving sucked the life energy of it's meal during the unusual digestion, the sheegoth excreted her body, intact but frozen solid, into a nearby crevace in the earth and covered the spot in icy mud.</span></div></div>",

As the insides of the vagina heat up, the ice around Samus's body begins to melt down around her. The creature started to breath more heavily as her orgasm was nearing as more of the frozen body is pushed in. Eventually, the massive sheegoth let's out a loud roar and climaxes over Samus's frozen body. The hot liquid manages to melt off the rest of the ice as the creature slowly pulled herself off of Samus. When Samus came to, she cringed as she slips out of the creature's cunt, being relieved when she slides out fully, only to see the creature squat down more over her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus then realized what she was up to and attempted to flee, only to have her head pushed into the massive creature's rear, feeling some musky slime rub over her as she was slowly worked up the massive creature's rear! After she was pulled up the creature's rear, the massive creature felt some pressure in her gut and broke wind, pushing out an icy blast out of her rear, forcing Samus to breath in a horrible smell before her body was frozen on the anal walls of this creature!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Samus was doomed to bring anal pleasure to this creature whenever she farts or has to relieve herself, with Samus thankfully not being forced to endure the horrid smell inside of the Sheegoth's rear as Samus remains frozen for the rest of the sheegoth's life...</span></div></div>",

The Sheegoth was coming backwards, she might get crushed!  Then, the Sheegoth began to lower itself down.  Samus wasn't completely familiar with all the alien organ systems, but she knew all about a female's organ systems, and what was coming at her was definately a vagina.  She tried to dodge. but the labial opening was just too massive to escape.  It came down on her with a loud *squelch*.  Samus couldn't believe it.  She was inside the lady parts of a monster!  Samus flailed around, her frantic limbs slipping and sliding inside the hole of the huge creature.  The Sheegoth pressed down and grinded on Samus.  Samus was coated with the wetness of the Sheegoth's pussy, she was completely helpless and dissoriented.  Samus began to pass out.  Amidst the squishing and sliding, she blacked out.</span></div></div>",

Her hands started to get slime on her right hand and stick to the wall. \"I guess it's time to leave.\" Samau thought to herself when she got another good whiff off the scent.

It remembers this girl from long ago. She had exterminated their leader on another planet. He doesn't know how he knows it, it's just a hive instinct. And it enraged him. While normally a grenchler would be content to admit defeat and give up it's meal when it has been outpredatored (it may be a word, to Grenchlers), it wanted to punish this girl itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with a stream of lightning from his nose, he strikes a nerve center embedded in the same stone wall, which is part of the same large creature that is currently digesting samus. A shriek of pain is heard from somewhere within the wall, and the creature dies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus, thinking she has been saved by divine internention, struggles to free herself, but has trouble. pushing her chin and feet against the wall, she manages to free herself, but has trouble getting out the same body part she had getting in - her backside. After several minutes of struggling, she frees herself and falls headfirst into a patch of seaweed far below...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the oppurtunity to strike, the Grenchler leaps up towards the unaware girl, and with a snap that resounds throughout the lake, ensnares samus. She lands in between two massive canine teeth, which prevent the creature from closing his jaws fully and crunching her, however, rows of pointy teeth do cut shallow wounds into her tasty belly flesh on both sides. Her head is pressed hard against the predator's rough tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could swallow her and be done in less than 3 seconds or so, but takes special care to avenge the death of his fallen grenchlers at the hands of this wicked hunter. Finding a nice-looking plug near where the hunter's back legs connect to her underside, the grenchler thrusts his head-horn inside, amd unleashes it's trademark lighnting into the girl. She flails around, struggling harder and longer than the predator has ever seen. In return, he shakes his head vigorously, sending Samus's legs flailing like a ragdoll.Several minutes go by, before her thrashes become the occasional twitch, and he stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being one to savor his meals, the Grenchler widens his esophagus, and Samus's paralyzed form slides down into a cramped, tooth-filled stomach, one of a series of 3 contained within a Grenchler.</span></div></div>",

Feeling her way around, she ascertained that she was inside a very warm slimy chamber small enough that she had to stay half-curled in the fetal position. She figured it was the extreme heat that had revived her, that and the readily available supply of oxygen coming from who-knows-where. The bounty hunter stopped squirming and tried to take stock of her situation. Her zero suit was gone entirely now (this bothered her slightly; she could remember having at least a third of it still hanging on her when she fell unconscious). Her total nudity would be highly embarrassing when she got back to civilization and would make the trip across the planet's frozen surface much harder, but hardship and embarrassment could both be endured. No, now that she though about it, her biggest problem would be escaping from..wherever she was. In all her feeling around, Samus hadn't discovered an exit in the squishy folds of material around her. In frustration (and due to her legs starting to cramp) she pushed down with her feet and out with her back as hard as she could. She was rewarded by a slight movement on both ends. Summoning all her strength, Samus <i>pushed</i>.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ice-cold water flooded down through a gap above her head, bringing with it the faintest of lights. Encouraged but tired, she pushed her head and shoulders up through the freezing torrent and looked around the dimly lit seabed. A stream of bubbles left her mouth as she gasped, realizing her predicament for the first time. From the neck down her body was trapped inside a gigantic clam. The surface was dauntingly far away, and the water pressure was, despite her best efforts, driving her back into her captor's maw. After a few seconds she could hold on no longer. Samus let her exhausted muscles go limp. The freezing sea drove her back into the soft flesh of the clam which then closed around her. Within minutes all the water was drained and the tiny chamber was once again filled with warm moist air.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Samus settled back into the cushion-like flesh enveloping her, pondering what to do. She didn't know just what would happen to a person eaten by a clam, but she didn't fell like finding out.</span></div></div>",

Rather than regaining her strength, she seemed to be growing weaker and weaker by the minute. Unbeknownst to her, the clam was subtly adjusting the oxygen content of her air to keep its hot prey both alive and docile. The walls around her began to secrete large quantities of an unknown slime which quickly coated her and started to fill the chamber.

In the back of her fading mind, Samus realized she was being turned into a pearl. The covering around her would thicken and harden still further with time, perfectly preserving the image of her trapped, naked body for all time. A tiny spark of her little-used feminine pride was at least a little happy that if she was going to die, she would die looking beautiful forever.

Normally, this calms her meals and makes them easier to swallow, but today, Samus's struggles only intensify. Abandoning that tactic, the naga retracts her tongue and ingests her new victim up to her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, the naga realized something. Although sexual foreplay would not subdue Samus like it would other girls, the naga still had the desire to go through with it. So, ignoring Samus's unrelenting squirms, the slithering woman effortlessly rips open a hole in the crotch of Samus's nearly impenetrable zero suit and slides her tongue all the way in. Samus cries out in pain; the naga's tongue is large, sticky, and rough, like sandpaper. The naga, pleased at her discomfort, continues her assault by grabbing Samus's flailing left thigh in her clawlike right hand, and tickling her small round ass with her left-hand fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...The naga had meant for this to be a quick meal, but she was so enthralled by her exploration of Samus's body that it was a half-hour later before the bounty hunter's feebly shaking calves disappeared into the Naga's waiting gullet. By this time, Samus's breathing had become shallow and ragged; there was not much air left in her captor's stomach. Much to her chagrin, even after being swallowed whole, the naga continued to fondle her breasts through her skintight armor of scales. The stomach was too tight for Samus to struggle. She opened her mouth, hoping to cry for help, but instead got a mouthful of searing acid which she quickly swallowed, hoping her own stomach wouldn't burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus has finally resigned herself to her fate when...</span></div></div>",

She gives a quiet chuckle as she continues stroking the delicious woman trapped within her. She had known from the start that her meal would eventually give in and surrender. Sooner or later, they always did.<br>\r\nSamus lay curled helplessly in her captor's belly, oblivious to everything around her. The now overpowering sensations coursing through her softening body had obliterated all sense of awareness, of fear, even of self. All that Samus was is a woman-shaped bundle of orgasmic ecstasy. In some vague, forgotten corner of her mind she wished that this wonderful feeling could just go on..and on...and on.......and..on.......<br>\r\nThe naga felt her meal give one last great shudder, then go still forever. Giving way to a small burp, she gave her swollen belly a final pat and slithered off to a cave she used for a bedroom. A great deal of Samus meat was yet to be digested, and she wanted to have a good long nap to recover from such a vigorous meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the cave entrance, a young, naked humanoid woman cautiously stands up from behind the boulder where she had been hiding. It was she who the naga had been meant as the sacrifice, but she had arrived just after the naga had begun to eat, and seeing the ordeal that the strangely dressed woman had undergone, she had no desire to become dessert. Knowing that her tribe would never forgive the dereliction of her duty naga food, she flees out into the wilderness. In time, she would find a mate, have many children, and live long enough to see them become grandparents. However, every year, on the same day when her tribe would send another beautiful young woman to be devoured, she would do as she did this night. Looking up into the stars, she gave thanks for the  stranger from the heavens who gave her the most precious give she would ever receive: her own life.</span></div></div>",

It was dark, and fairly murky, just begging for some large creature to come, so that it could be hidden in shrouds of shadow as it stalked its unaware prey. Just the thought of being the meal of another creature this night put her on edge, so for the next 10 minutes, a paranoid Samus stealthily swam under the surface, searching for any creature that might make a snack out of her. To her surprise, however, she found no signs of any life down here other than herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next order of business was a way out. The sheer rocky walls surrounding the pool were too steep and slippery to consider climbing. Samus recognized a few viable grapple points, but that was a moot point.

Then, the ground vibrated slightly, making her sit up &amp; quickly scan her surroundings- a tall, almost thirty foot humanoid walked by in the distance! It was skinny but muscular, wearing a tough beast-hide trouser &amp; a weird-looking small back sack. Appearing like a massive humanoid male, with spiky ears &amp; four eyes, it was weird. Samus was freaking out slightly, but then knew that she'd likely perish laying here doing nothing. So deciding to get its attention, she shrieked as loud as she could. With this thing being more than a football field away &amp; able to hear the shriek though like a small squack, the creatures near night vision helped it look over the fields, swamps &amp; trees. <br>\r\nOnce again with a shriek, it knew she was more in the marshy area &amp; began walking that way. Only after a few steps that way it saw Samus, looking up quite scared &amp; battered. \"Kosimil?\" The thing spoke and walked over her, giving Samus a view up it's also-hide-covered crotch, thankfully..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then suddenly getting grabbed, she was thankful it grabbed her hips but yelped in pain from her legs movements &amp; it's hard grip on her. <br>\r\nThe creatures hand was easily covering her chest, the sticky-slimy smooth texture uncomfortable &amp; slightly painful as it moved her around with both it's hands. \"Oaho.\" Then grabbing both her legs to hang her upside down, she screamed from the pulling &amp; the creature quickly grabbed her chest &amp; stopped that. \"Speak english, please!?\" She yelled to it before it did something else, the creature scanning it's surroundings before looking back. <br>\r\n\"Poalk? Jeadar.\" She didn't understand a single word it said, but the smirk it gave was awfully human, not in a good way to her.</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes of silent walking between them, Samus was zoned out until noticing they had entered a large cavern going down huge stairs. This place was even more scary now as the <i>thing</i> walked into a dark corner, reaching into its pack with one hand &amp; pulling out a boulder-sized shiny rock.<br>\r\nThen striking it quickly on the cave floor &amp; making Samus disoriented with a hand-jerk, a fire started quickly around several big logs. How it spread quickly confused her, but the creatures hard stare was more pressing. \"Im Samus Aran, bounty hun-\" the thing gripped her slightly tighter, Samus gasping slightly &amp; not being able to speak as it brought her up to it's face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gnolox, seud.\" It spoke like a horn, she was frozen up in fear from it's size. It's mouth easily able to fit her &amp; its teeth looking dagger-sharp but small &amp; its tounge snake-like with little protrusions, that was not the place she wanted to be. She began to regret getting it's attention, as this could be worse than laying in a marsh.<br>\r\nAnd it got worse as it lifted her over it's head while sitting against the cave wall, the fire getting brighter. Not able to see down but immediately feeling it's sticky hot lips cover her hips &amp; below, she tried struggling but her legs couldn't do anything. Pain shot up her body with bare plasure as it started to lick her legs &amp; thighs, holding Samus's chest outside it's mouth. It would soon start sucking on her &amp; curve it's tounge around her legs, then easily suck her chest in to only leave her head barely sticking out &amp; her body in its tounge. <br>\r\n\"No! Don't- don't eat me!\" She yelled in fear, this really wasn't a way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately it didn't have those intentions now &amp; simply enjoyed the taste of her, constricting her body with its mouth. Despite it making her warm &amp; slightly pleasured, the pain &amp; situation made everything horrible.. After what was likely five minutes of this Samus gave up struggling, the creature <i>really doing this.</i><br>\r\nSuddenly flipped around &amp; feeling it's hand grab her out of it's mouth she felt even stickier &amp; warm, the fire adequate to do so even with how she was held. The thing smiled &amp; licked its lips, then just grabbed her hands.<br>\r\n\"No way, stop it!\"<br>\r\nIt's dark blue, slimy dick stood up, a two-foot opening at the top &amp; the entire rod pulsing slightly. It itself was five feet tall, she didn't want to go in there! Trying to struggle by kicking weakly it grabbed her legs lightly, muttering something as it lowered her over it's entrance. Samus held back yelling at it &amp; shrieking, as it wouldn't do a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of pudgy, sticky &amp; small bumps as the hole let her in was disgusting. The deeper she got the hotter it was, &amp; as her hips were brought in, the walls expanded &amp; dropped her in! As quick as that happened they contracted, Samus feeling her ankles being slithered on through another hole as the top closed &amp; she started being thrown up &amp; down.. Goodness it didn't really hurt to bad, but the slime, constant rubbing &amp; warmth was making her start to <i>enjoy</i> it. She knew she would never in any other situation, but there wasn't a choice here.<br>\r\nRelaxing as this creature sat back &amp; let its junk pleasure it, the sensation of pleasure caused by her skin to the creature was exhilarating. Samus's calves were soon in a tighter chamber as she got pulled deeper, many of the same appendages wrapping around them &amp; moving all over her.. Despite giving up she still didn't want to go in there, but any efforts would likely be in vain.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sensation of the fleshy tube around her began to become rhythmic, the appendages all squeezing onto her head &amp; moving downward. This slowly made Samus's legs go in more, &amp; if it she didn't have her water-breathing she'd likely drown under the sticky, warm liquids flowing around in this things dick. Thinking that might be better than going through this, she couldn't move at all, stopping her movements in defeat. The creature reached its hand down around it's junk &amp; then would lightly start stroking itself, amplifying the dragging-down on Samus as it moaned weirdly, like a gurgle.<br>\r\nHer thighs entering the hole she felt the appendages wrap around them, then suddenly this creatures dick swallowed her! Struggling against these things were useless, what had to be over a-hundred were restricting her body in this chamber that slowly got smaller. Unable to win &amp; regretfully moaning as this thing entered her two back orifices with a few 'appendages' &amp; started to move then rhythmically, every movement this things dick did transferred into immense pleasure for it.<br>\r\nSamus kept her eyes shut as one forced itself into her mouth, not biting down onto it because she thought she might get out. Unfortunately not, the appendage was joined by four more, &amp; soon Samus was gagging on these slimy things going into her throat, back &amp; forth. Then they hit her cervix &amp; started to plow her g-spots, Samus begrudgingly feeling pleasure beyond dreams, them not destroying her body but going <i>deep.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelpless as this continued until the appendages fully wrapped her up the one's covering her began to secrete sticky, hotter juices. This made some start to rub under the others, moving to her breasts with three different ones starting to squeeze them. It hurt a bit but felt amazing- then-!<br>\r\nThe appendages in her mouth all spurted, shooting out likely three gallons worth of sticky 'juices', Samus tried to throw it up, but the bitter liquid was forced into her stomach as the appendages didn't leave. <br>\r\nFeeling the ones in her ass &amp; pussy speed up greatly before pushing themselves deep, she would've yelled, but couldn't as they also released tons of juices into her. Breathing in this filth as the hotter liquid mixed in with the stickier ones from the tentacles, the tightness of them around her would intensify &amp; the liquids start to invade her pours. Mixed with her body being filled &amp; her mind too, the juices were acting as a powerful aphrodisiac &amp; numbing her pain greatly while intensifying the pleasure hundreds-fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature would've spurt out some white-blue sticky 'juice' on the outside into the fire, actually intensifying it some, &amp; bring its hand down to its underside where Samus was kept. Separate from the outside by nearly three feet of thick skin &amp; semi-bone the creature stroked the rough-&amp;-deep blue sack, Samus feeling the appendages on her back tighten &amp; stay like that as it did this.<br>\r\nAfterward it layed on the ground &amp; scanned the cave, &amp; seeing nothing, focused on the little person inside itself. Laying down caused the sack to shift Samus around before the appendages retreated &amp; dropped her onto a bed of them, her hands touching a soft &amp; slimy surface between the appendages, which went up to her elbow. <br>\r\nNo time to do anything the appendages quickly squished her body into form, many secreted hotter juices onto her as what looked like two studded-larger-appendages were appearing from the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo intoxicated &amp; weak to resist the one forcing itself into her mouth the studs were releasing a sour slimy liquid. It forced it's way down her throat, the foot-long appendage did.. A normal person would've perished by now, she knows. The creature was stroking itself slightly quicker as it's sack contracted around this prisoner, it's appendages forcing pleasure into her.<br>\r\nAs the one bigger one entered her pussy it hurt immensely, but the liquid it released was soon turning it into surreal pleasure. She barely had time to comprehend this before being dumbfounded by the feelings, the thing forcing it's way into her cervix &amp; starting to fill it up with the blue liquid..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the thing neared a second release the appendages began moving a several dozen thrusts every few seconds, breaking Samus's mind with the pleasure despite how much it would probably hurt. Her body being constricted, she'd likely cum many times as this all happened.<br>\r\n\"Ohaolk-oha-\" The creature muttered with one final thrust, causing a few gallons to it to fly in the fire &amp; the ones screwing Samus to fill her body even more with juices.. Then the thing was pleased. Still feeling pleasure from her &amp; loving it's new pet, the thing let it's body keep screwing her until it completely fell asleep.<br>\r\nSamus was trapped all night being screwed senseless by these appendages, a nonstop motion, before eventually passing out before the morning. Having euphoric pleasure as she slept from there, the thing woke in the morning ready to possibly find a meal &amp; wait for it's pet to wake, who it knew was alive, thanks to it's very keen evolutionary senses- &amp; continue what happened yesterday night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A Good End, If this beats death.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Generally, if you try, and make a decent addition, you get around 300. 500 for good chapters. It may take me a while to accumulate some of this money, so first come, first serve, and then we'll see what I can do. Reviews will also get points, but I didn't want to have auto-rewards for poory written cash-scams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, on with the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened so quickly Samus didn't see it coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been patrolling the snow-covered, rocky ground near a federation base when she heard an all-to familiar screech. Before she could so much as turn around, she felt sharp talons dig themselves into the ribs of her metallic suit. She could feel the  hot breath on the back of her neck through her suit as Ridley took into the dark sky with his prey. Naturally, Samus tried to escape by slipping between his claws in her morph ball, as she usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where things changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't see inside the morphball. but Samus was certain that she felt an immediate heat engulf her. For a few seconds, silence. The rushing winds of the icy planet had been muted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then came the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus attempted to drop a morphball bombs, but whatever the cause of this pain was, it had already disabled her bombs. In an attempt to understand what was going on, she deactivated her morphball and was met by sllimy, cramped wall. It was only then that she realized where she was: Ridley's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attempted every means of escape, to no avail. One after another, her systems were being digested and disabled by Ridley's acid. Her powersuit, suit, save her helmet, had been erased entirely. It was only a matter of time before the acids digested her zero suit. Samus, the powerful hunter, was reduced to kicking and screaming desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, something went right. She heard a loud screech of pain, and watched as the bottom half of Ridley's stomach literally tore open, sending her half-nude form plummeting through the night sky...</td>",
