You can't slap yourself and give or take away stuff to yourself. You need a friend to slap you. You need absolute trust in whoever has the glove,\" he tells us. I roll my eyes, but the other two nod their heads like they understand. \"Alright, little man, what do you want me to slap out of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually. I need you to slap some inches to my height. I trust that you got the power to do so,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" my gloved roommates asks. My short roommate nods yes in confidence. \"Alright, Sonny. I'll slap some tallness into you!\" There is no delay and my roommates delivers a rather impressive slap that knocks Sonny to the floor. We are all on the lookout for the changes, but we don't see it right away. It's only when Sonny stands up that we the transformation. When stands side by side with the taller guy with swimming trunks, Sonny and Carlos, the tall guy, stand at the same height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, Sonny. You as tall as me!\" Carlos says. \"I gotta get some of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, whaddya need?\" the glove roommate, whose name is Tyrone, says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Carlos want Tyrone to slap him with?</span></div></div>",

Tyrone, Sonny (who is jumping up and down because he's as tall as Carlos), and I are confused. What he is really doing is pointing at the slight tenting in his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spit it out, dude! What do you want?\" Tyrone asks, beckoning Carlos to say it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My thing. My....\" Carlos hesitates. Instead of telling us up front, he drops his shorts to his knees (note that he just got out of the pool) and shows us his puny erect dick. We are grossed out at first, but once we see the pole that is measuring up to four inches, we all start laughing. \"That's what I need, bro. Some more for my ... you know.\" Carlos hastily pulls his trunks back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I need to help you out bro! Step up, dude,\" Tyrone tells him. Carlos comes up within reach of Tyrone. \"You ready for this?\" Carlos nods yes and offers his cheek to his black friend. He closes his eyes for two things. After seeing Sonny fall to the floor, Carlos expects his length-delivering slap to be more painful, if not equal to Sonny's slap. Also, deep inside, he really hopes he gets at least 50% more length to his dick. \"I'll slap a few inches to your dick!\" The command is awkward, but there isn't any laughing when he delivers the gloved slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos takes the full brunt of the slap and instead of falling to the floor like Sonny, he staggers back. He somehow feels something in his shorts and again he pulls it down so that his dick is out and exposed. To our surprise, Carlos shows us his dick, which is indeed longer, more than half of his dick was added to result in a double length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a bunch of kids, Sonny and Carlos celebrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still don't believe me, Cesar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you, fully,\" I say, not doubting after two miraculous demonstrations were shown before me. \"You don't mind adding anything to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he offer me?</span></div></div>",

I try to back away, but Carlos and Sonny block my escape and hold my arms for good measure. \"I thought you wanted to have something taken away, Ces? Now stay still and get my blessing.\" I can only hear chuckling from all three of my roommates, the sound drowning out the command uttered by Tyrone, since closing my eyes seemed to be a good idea for me. There is no delay when I sense the hand drawing near and the glove making contact with my cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy whole body becomes numb. I can no longer feel the hands gripping my arms no can I sense myself falling to the floor. I open my eyes to find myself facing the floor, but due to my numbness, I cannot move. I cannot hear and can only watch as I'm flipped over onto my back with long strands of hair covering my eyes. It's parted by Tyrone who looks me over. Only he has the smile on his face while Carlos and Sonny have gaping mouth of awe. What has he done to me? What command did he utter to have the glove change me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone picks me up, drapes me over his shoulder and takes me to the room near the kitchen. The long strands of hair, which seem to be part of head block any good view of where I am or where I am going, but it's only for a brief time. Tyrone lays me down on the bed and for some reason, the only thing I can do is rest. Was the slap so hard that it took all the energy from me? Or was the command so much that it needed energy, and that the only source it could take it from was me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drift into a brief dreamless slumber that only seems to last what seems to me to be minutes. I wake up feeling my whole body sore as if I had an intense workout before sleeping. Beside the soreness in my muscles, I also feel like my body feels different in all kinds of ways. I open my eyes to find myself still in the bed in the room near the kitchen, yet, I'm not alone in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do I find in the bed with me?</span></div></div>",

I open my eyes and find that Sonny and Carlos have climbed into bed with me in between them. Not only are they asleep, they also have their hands upon me. I find that Sonny has his whole arm up my shirt and his hand underneath what feels like a bra, since it puts pressure all around my torso. His hand grasps a breasts and occasionally, he squeezes it, sending a sensation that tingles my upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos has his hand down the shorts I'm wearing and his hand has gone underneath the panties and what feels like his middle finger and index finger is pressed down on the folds down there. Ever so slightly, the fingers touch up a certain point that threatens to cause me to scream in what I assume would be pleasure for a woman. And that's what I am now. All due to Tyrone slapping me and making me like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't move. I can, but it would wake these two roommates of mine. If they wake up now, who knows what they'll do. Would they fuck me the first chance they get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do?

Yes, it feels good, but in my case, it's unfamiliar. Plus, with being a guy for most of my life, the fact I'm being touched as a woman is shocking to say the least. The last thing I want is to throw away my dignity and give in to the pleasure, but it's hard when I have to deal with two of my roommates and their restlessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would try to go to sleep, but Sonny's hand shifts from one breast to another and applies pressure when he needs to shift his position. Carlos however has a more erratic hand and randomly applies pressure to the two fingers he has on my folds. He also adds his other hand underneath me to touch along my buttocks as well. So laying still is out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when Tyrone comes into the room and finds me awake in the middle of Carlos and Sonny. I glare at him from my position for one second before feeling another wave of less-intense sensations and changing my face from one stemming from frustration to that of overwhelmed satisfaction. Tyrone whispers to me, \"Damn, girl, you must like being in the middle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck, Tyrone,\" I whisper back. \"Can you help me out of here, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can, but I can only do it on one condition,\" Tyrone tells me. Condition help? This must be when he meant changing me was to suit his needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can get out of this mess, but it would mean I would have to do something for Tyrone, probably something that is more for his pleasure and not mine. What should I do? Do I enlist his help and in turn do something for him or should I refuse his offer and stay in this mess I'm currently in?</span></div></div>",

I have to endure ten seconds of pleasuring agony before I can speak again. Of course, I wouldn't want to endure an even more longer moment like that. I would surely die from the sensation. Of course, I choose to enlist help from Tyrone who so kindly offered his conditional assistance. I try not to think too much on what he wants me to do and focus on just getting out of this bed-sandwich. \"Alright, T. I'll do anything for you, can you just please get me out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away,\" he says in his normal voice and gets right to work. I pretend to still be sleeping when he goes to Sonny and slaps his face with his bare hand. \"Hey, Son, time to go, you got night shift duty at your work.\" He goes over to Carlos and does the same, and tells him, \"Don't you got a test tomorrow, dude. I think you should be studying, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth men awake, but not quietly. Sonny, who has his hand in my shirt, takes hand out by applying pressure to my chest and stomach, as if his arm is numb and he's dragging it out from under my bra and shirt. Carlos does the same and as if his arm is numb, drags it across my folds, causing me to cringe in pleasure. Both men get off the bed at the same time, but not without adding their compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that girl can sleep after being in bed with us. She has the most softest breasts ever,\" Sonny says. \"How was it Carlos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her pussy is tight. No doubt she's a virgin,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, enough of that, guys, I think she'd want to rest away from all those hands touching her while she sleeping,\" Tyrone says. After closing the door, he addresses me. \"Alright, girl, you can open your damn eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open them and find only Tyrone in the room, sitting at the foot of the bed. \"Thanks, T. I guess now's the time for me to give you something for your help? What do you have in mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Tyrone want from me?</span></div></div>",

I won't let you,\" I say, almost in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing, girl. I'm not gonna force you to do anything you want, but if I'm going to give you a massage, you're going to take some of those clothes off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A massage? That's it?\" I ask, surprised that I expected too much of Tyrone. \"Well, if you put it that way, I think I can make an exception. So just the shorts and shirt off right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I got an outfit you could wear so you can be comfortable while I'm giving you your massage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it better than this bra, it's kinda killing me at the moment,\" I say as I get out of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a two-piece bikini, the one you have to tie to prevent one of those melons from popping out. I think it's in here, actually,\" Tyrone tells me and he goes to a box in the closet. Upon opening it, I find an assortment of bikinis, both bottoms and tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, are those?\" I ask, but Tyrone already has an answer for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the bikinis I've collected from all the pool parties we held here at the house. Some of these were before you came in and some of these were from parties you didn't want to attend since you were studying and all that. Here, have at it. I'll go get the oil. I'll knock and I'll come in once you're ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone leaves, closing the door behind it. I round the bed and lock the knob just in case Carlos or Sonny wanted to barge in and interrupt me as I'm changing. For some reason, I sense that I'm smiling, enjoying looking through the shoe box full of bikini tops and bottoms. They've come in all colors and patterns and some have a lot of fabric while other have the bare necessities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the menagerie of choice, I pick out a black bikini that has small amounts of fabric, the bottom being a thong with thin straps and the top have small triangles to cover the nipples. I also select a red bikini that has more fabric for the top and the bottom is not a thong, but more like a panty. Which should I put on to wear?</span></div></div>",

I know of one request that's the most obvious, but I hope and hope again that it's not what I think it is. Tyrone's stare, which shifts from my body below my neckline and back up to my eyes, tells me what I don't want to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a fraction of a second I hesitate and slide off the side of the bed and quickly go for the door. Unfortunately, for my sake, I'm not fast enough. Tyrone grabs me from behind and I unwittingly let out a yelp that's as high-pitched as a whistle. I just hope nobody outside heard that. With his strength, Tyrone easily pins me to the bed onto my back and uses his weight paired with his hands to pin my wrists to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down on me. \"What the fuck you trying to do? Ever heard of debt? I just helped you out and you owe me something in return. But you want to change your mind? It doesn't work like that, bitch. So either you man up and please me or I'll have to take it by force. I personally think you'd be better off if you play nice,\" he explains. He lets go in order to lock the door as well as block my escape. I slump down to the floor, onto my knees. Tyrone undoes his shorts and lets them and his boxers fall to the floor to his ankles. Immediately, a long member is starting me in the face. I hesitate once more and bite my lips, unsure of what I'm about to be doing. Tyrone gives me an ultimatum. \"If you don't start blowing me, I'll give you back to Sonny and Carlos. I'll tell them that you were awake the whole time, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sour expression I have on my face shows my reluctance to even put a foreign body part into my mouth, but with the ultimatum in play, I force myself to go down on Tyrone. I grasp the base of his dick and find that my hand can't even fully encircle the girth of the penis, which possibly was modified by the dreaded glove while I was out cold. With the dick steadied before me, I put the head and crown into my mouth. The first taste is probably the most nastiest as the musk of his crotch mixes with my saliva, creating a liquid stench. Tyrone encourages me to continue and put his dick deeper into my mouth by grabbing a handful of my brunette locks and keeping me on his member. I let the head and its size slide deeper into my mouth, stretching it out fully. The folds and warmth is an uncomfortable sensation on my tongue, which is forced to rub against it as it slides in and then out. The process continues even after Tyrone tells me he's being aroused by moaning and groaning out loud. At least he hasn't commanded me to look up at him while I suck him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no escape from his hand clutching my hair, I continue to blow him, letting my diminishing reluctance go unnoticed. Before I know it, I'm relaxed as I try new angles with my mouth. I also try to lick the member with my tongue despite it tasting awful. I learn to go past the initial smell and taste and move on to licking the head directly as well as the whole shaft, which is riddled with awkward veins which are possibly pumping all the blood to even get a dick to get this erect. Before long, Tyrone's hand removes itself, only to caress the place where it was grabbing. \"Shit, girl. You a natural,\" he says through a hindered moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It helps me that he doesn't goads me or command me to do anything else other than suck him off. Judging from all his moaning and groaning, he's feeling very satisfied by my work. I get on my knees and lower my head onto his dick, using one hand at the base to stabilize it. Before long, it's not used for that sole purpose. I squeeze his shaft with my hand and get a subsequent groan from Tyrone. I slide it up and down and I get him to hiss. Certainly the pressure is an added pleasure for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's enough for him to stop lazing about and start touching me, which I suddenly desire for him to do. No longer am I reluctant to touch him and put my mouth on him. No longer am I reluctant and hesitant about him touching me. My black friend doens't play around and he immediately takes a hand to slide underneath my shorts and panty from the backside. His fingers graze along in between my butt cheeks and with his reach, he easily touches upon the folds that one of my roommates had a feel for. The hindrance of the clothes on my body is just one obstacle towards my sex and with just one hand, Tyrone single-handedly unbuttons my shorts and I allow him to remove each article of clothing from my body, using my free hand to help him out. Before long, my whole bottom half is naked and exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone stops me by pulling my torso away from his crotch. With no hesitancy at all, he pulls me into his arm and plants a kiss that shows me something he hasn't showed me before. I know it's either one of two things: love or lust. He kisses me even though I have the taste of his member in my mouth and even goes beyond to slip his tongue into my mouth as well. His saliva mixes with the mixture in mine and our tongues wrestle like there is no tomorrow. Of course, there is no tomorrow that has myself as a guy kissing my black friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallow the saliva mixture in my mouth as Tyrone separates our lips from our kiss. He looks down upon me and I open my eyes, catching his own looking down at me. \"Hey beautiful,\" he says with no misstep. Indeed, I'm am one of his women, one who has seduced through an ultimatum and is satisfied with sexually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next?</span></div></div>",

He lets my legs fall over the side with my torso still on the bed. For a second, I assume he's done this so that he can penetrate me, but when I feel a moist feeling rub against my folds, I realize we have switched places. Immediately, at first contact, I let out a loud moan. Though I cannot see him do what he's doing, my sensitive folds give me a somewhat clear picture. He has buried his face into my crotch, with his mouth and tongue pressing onto and then into my pussy. He breathes with his nose, which is awkwardly poking at my anus. I try hard not to think of myself farting into his face, but it seems the service Tyrone's giving me is meant to alleviate that possibility. The thought doesn't even cross my mind anymore, since the senses at my bottom floods my mind. Occasionally, Tyrone reaches over and slides underneath my shirt and bra, fervently take a breast in his hand and squeezing it, further flooding my body with arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drift into a sense of euphoria and I relax and enjoy the pleasure I'm receiving. I find it hard to resist and protest and my desire for him to fill me with his member grows by the minute. After five minutes, I can barely contain myself. \"Fuck me, Tyrone!\" I exclaim right after I moan loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do we go about intercourse?</span></div></div>",

He resumes eating me out, using his moist tongue to lap against my labia and beyond them to more sensitive areas. Half the time, he'll use the tip of his tongue to flick at a tiny knob that I assume is my clitoris, which sends a wave of almost-unbearable pleasure throughout my whole body every time it's hit. All I can do to bear with the pleasure is clutch at the sheets or moan loudly, which only triggers Tyrone to eat me out more. By the time he's done, I'm left powerless. I'm too fatigued by all my moaning and breathing that I can't even find the energy to lift my shoulder blades off of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Tyrone has me right where he wants me. He gets to his feet and positions his cock at the door to my pink cavern. He gives me a look as if he's wondering or asking if I'm ready or not. I bite my lip, trying to show both my reluctance and my desire to have his member finally enter me. It's weird and fasinating at the same time, since hours earlier, I was only a man with the same thing between my legs. Now as a woman, I'm worried that with my newfound pleasure with my body, I'll be addicted to how good it feels. I'm also excited, since I'll be the first man to ever experience this without the need for gender reassingment surgery. When the tip of his dick knock on the door to my pussy, I close my eyes, anticipating a painful entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I do have good foresight, for Tyrone saves me the pain of a slow stroke, when each inch of his member slowly stretches me out. Before he penetrates me, he takes my wrists in his hands and pins them to the bed. He lowers his lips onto mine and kisses me passionately, so much so that I'm forced to kiss him back with weaker, if not equal, fervor. Without any warning, he pushes into my pussy, the head of his cock suddenly stretching my folds and the girth of his shaft keeping every inch of my insides stretched. In one motion, the member inside me crashes through my hymen, shattering it and kissing my virginity goodbye. As Tyrone impales me, his kiss mutes my cry of pain mixed with this unfamiliar feeling of being filled. As each second passes with Tyrone's cock still within me, his lips ravaging my lips, his weight upon my wrists, the pain begins to subside. I deduce that I'm a mess at the point of contact, but Tyrone's kissing distracts me from that negative thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe withdraws and my inside retract to its normal state, no longer stretched. It's only my door that's left open, with Tyrone's cock keeping it ajar. The sensitive lips of my nether region are stimulated by the crown of the head of dick, which seems to just sit there, as Tyrone is making sure I'm no longer in pain. He separates his lips from mine and I assume that my face is awash with an expression of exciting fatigue. Just a penetration and I'm already weaker than before. I'm no longer a dominant being, but one that's submissive. One that yields to a dominant force, which Tyrone has taken the place of. He looks down at me and I see the corners of his mouth rise. I look at him and I manage a smile. I'm guessing we're mutually feeling something good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushes back into me, this time at a slow pace and I see him watching me as he pushes in and pulls back. Every time his cock widens me, my mouth opens and out comes a deep moan, one that would probably go beyond the walls and alert someone of the pleasure wafting in this room. The feeling of being stretched and being filled is unfamiliar, but as I experience every thrust, every withdrawal, every throb within my pussy, I begin to like it. I begin to enjoy it. I begin to love it and how it triggers this imminent wave of pleasure. I begin to lust for it and desire for it not to stop. If it does, I fear this boiling wave of sensation I feel would die a worthless death. Tyrone quickens the pace, which also lessens the time I have to wait for my floodgates to burst. at the seams. His rhythm is so fast some times that occasionally cannot keep up with my breathing and I'm left speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it has to come to a close, and how amazing it feels when we both climax. I can tell Tyrone has done this a few times and when he withdraws, he blows his creamy, white load on the front of my pelvis. As my front side becomes a wet mess, I'm forced to ignore it all when my orgasm erupts, sending wave after wave of intense, unbearable pleasure. My whole body relaxes and I'm ignorant to the fact that I've released some fluid as well, getting some on Tyrone and his dick. He lowers his lips onto mine one more time, sealing the deal with a kiss. I kiss him back with the same amount of passion, even though I feel tired from the ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then carries me, despite the mess we have on ourselves, and takes me into the bathroom that connects to his room only. He was given this room at the start of just us two living here and he won it by beating me in a simple bet. It's fortunate, since Tyrone's room is the only one that has this connecting bathroom. It's a good thing because he doesn't have to carry me out of the room and exposing our nakedness to the other two guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bathroom, is a jacuzzi tub, which is empty at the moment. He sets me down inside it so that he can fill the tub up with water. As the water rises, the blood and semen start to fall away from my body and I use my own hand to clean the inside of me. It's efficient, but I feel a bit tender down below and yet still sensitive. I can't help but moan with my mouth close as I try to clean inside me. I look up and see Tyrone only cleaning himself off with a towel. Does he join me in the tub?</span></div></div>",

I look over at Tyrone whose ebony body is a sight to see as he enters the shower and cleans himself off with a brief shower. I can't help but be attracted to his male form. Obviously, it's probably due to the hormone coursing throughout my body. Tyrone finishes, wiping himself off with a towel, and when he's dry he goes over to me. Before my breasts can get submerged under the water's surface, Tyrone bends over and with his strength, is able to pick me up and carry me yet again in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sets me down onto my feet and uses the towel he had used to dry himself off to do the same to me. He makes sure to get everything that has been soaked, taking extra care to tend to my nether regions. He wipes up and in between my breasts and his eyes catch a smile on my face. He tosses the towel into the hamper and draws me close so that my breasts and torso are pressing right against his frontside. With a hand, he takes my jaw and guides it up so that he can plant a kiss. All I can do is get on the tips of my toes to meet his lips. As we kiss, his other hand supports me by planting itself on my hind quarters. All I do is embrace him lightly with my hands. We separate, still feeling the euphoria and good vibes from minutes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes my hand and guides me back into the bedroom, where he lets me pick up my clothes. I start to put them on one by one, starting with the lingerie and then my shirt and short shorts. He also hands me a satin bathrobe to wear over my outfit. I put it on and find the softness of the material very enjoyable, so much that I can't even feel it when I'm wearing it. I turn my gaze to the opposite wall to give Tyrone some privacy, but it seems he sees this and calls over, \"If you want to watch me dress, then you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply, \"It's fine, T. Say, now that we're even, what's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Tyrone asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just slept with you, per the exchange for getting me out of the hands of Carlos and Sonny. My debt to you has been paid. I'm just asking what's next,\" I explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight pause ensues and Tyrone breaks the pause after he's done changing. He takes a seat right behind me and reaches over and caresses my shoulder. \"I don't know. Maybe you should ask that question for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like how?\" I ask, half-clueless and half-knowing-exactly-how-to-rephrase-the-question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, do you plan on staying like this for the rest of your life? Or do you want to change back to a guy? I can do it for you. It's not like I was keeping that option closed. After what we just did, I sort of had a change of heart,\" Tyrone explains. \"So you could ask, if you want to stay as a woman, would there be a particular reason why? Ask the obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I choose? Stay as a woman or change back into a guy?</span></div></div>",

When he gets up from the bed, I start to speak. \"Wait,\" I say, stopping him in his tracks. I sense him turn on his heel to look back at me. I turn my head, where I can only see him through the corner of my eye, though stray locks make seeing him much harder. \"Experiencing a female orgasm is one thing, but experiencing that for the rest of my life... well, I don't think I can take it. This is coming from Cesar by the way,\" I state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't really know if you don't try. If you did try to stay like a woman, I was going to call you Rosario or some other girl name rather than Cesar,\" Tyrone adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not really helping me grasp the benefit. As far as I can see, womanhood is something that is way too much for me to handle,\" I reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone takes a seat right back down on the bed, still behind me, but I can sense that he's much farther away, out of his reach in fact. \"I don't know. You look like you can handle it,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still not helping, Tyrone,\" I protest. \"Anyways, I made my decision. I want you to change me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing reluctance in his voice, he affirms by saying, \"Alright. Let me go get the glove. Carlos should have it.\" He gets up and goes out the door. I recline back until my back is flat on the mattress. I lay there as if to fall back to sleep, but I realize waiting for Tyrone to come back to the glove is taking way too long. And somehow, something deep inside me feel a sense that something is not right at the moment. I push myself off the mattress and I get up onto my feet. I go out of the room to the living room outside and there I find Tyrone on the phone. Carlos and Sonny are nowhere to be seen and even when I search for them myself, all I find are empty rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI return to the Tyrone in the living room and ask him, \"What's wrong T?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlos and Sonny are not here and when I call them, each of them doesn't answer. And Carlos was the one who I gave the glove to,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times have you called them?\" I ask with my arms crossed across my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be the fifth time I called Carlos,\" he says, putting the phone to his ear. \"It's ringing, but nobody answers and it goes straight to voicemail.\" My heart sinks thinking that my only way of changing back is gone or in the very least, far away from a trusted hand to slap me back to my old self. The dread of living the rest of my life as a woman dawns on me and Tyrone sees my demeanor start to grow dark. He immediately embraces me in an effort to give me comfort. It's no use and in my current state, I don't even feel like crying. \"Don't worry, dude, we'll find that glove and get you back to your old self in no time.\" His useless words used to comfort me is a good effort on his part, but it doesn't change the situation. \"I promise that when we get the glove back, I'll have you slap the man out of me, since this seems to be mostly my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, all this dread has certainly gotten the best of me and I go limp at the thought that my only means of returning to my old life is somewhere far, if not in the worst case scenario of it being destroy or incinerated like a piece of regular clothing. Tyrone helps me to the couch and he lays me down upon its cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time I wake up, its to the sound of not a cell phone, but our house phone ringing. It's so loud that I almost fall out of the couch and onto the floor. I look up and see Tyrone running into the kitchen and coming back out with the phone in hand. \"Hello,\" he says into the transmitter. \"Yes, this is where Carlos Guevara lives.\" He doesn't say anything after that, but something inside me can sense his distress. His body language is no joke and I can tell when Tyrone is joking. I get up to the my feet and slowly approach the black man. When I get near, he hangs up and stays silent until I speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the hospital. Carlos and Sonny was involved in a car accident,\" he says in a sullen manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they okay?\" I ask, but judging by Tyrone's stare, I assume the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he takes long to gather his thoughts, Tyrone manages to speak up. \"They're still alive, but they're unconscious. They were the lucky ones, I guess,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's get over there. Hopefully, Carlos still has the glove,\" I say and we both agree to head to the hospital. Tyrone drives the both of us to hospital and find ourselves being taken to the Intensive Care Ward. We find them in their own room, with all sorts of instruments and tubes connected to them. Sonny looks to be a state more worse than Carlos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos coughs and we tend to him first. His eyes are open and he's able to open his mouth to talk. \"Hey C, what happened to you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos struggles to speak and all we can get out of him is this: \"We were.... driving..... (cough)... home. A black.... S... S... truck... spun.... (coughing the word us) out.... and we flipped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlos, where'd you put the glove?\" I ask. He glances at me with his eye and closes it. The machine that monitors his pulse beeps and a nurse rushes into so that she can tend to both Carlos and the machine. Once the chaotic beeping ceases, we approach Carlos once again, but to no avail, he doesn't give further response. Away from the eyes of the nurse or personnel passing by in the hallway outside, Tyrone searches for the clothes of both Carlos and Sonny. A basket with the personal effect and clothes are found in a end table next to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would be the final fate of the glove?</span></div></div>",

He pulls it out and uncurls it. To our dismay, there is much dirt on it, turn the white turn into gray. There is also a slight tear on the hem of the glove that encircles the wrist. I just hope its physical state doesn't effect it's power, if it has power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, the glove's alright,\" Tyrone says. \"We should hurry and slap the man back into you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside me stops him and I say, \"Wait, shouldn't we use the glove to get these guys back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone shoots back in regards to reality. \"Wouldn't people freak out if we walk out with two guy in hospital gowns? And wouldn't it be weird if someone caught me slapping these guys while they are already unconscious? I'd say they are alright with them being here. I thought you wanted to change back,\" he explains and says to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, but I don't feel right leaving them here. These are our roommates Tyrone,\" I try to tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are in good hands. This is a hospital. They can heal. They can get better. It would be a waste of power if we healed them right now,\" Tyrone tells me. It's ironic since the power left in the glove is dwindling as we speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems mere words aren't enough to get me out of the room and out the hospital and it takes Tyrone and a firm grip on my hand to drag me out of there. We drive back, not saying a word at all. It's probably because I'm mad at my black friend for leaving the other two guys behind to rest and heal in hopsital beds while we are alive and well in the comfort of our own house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we get inside, I suddenly lash out at Tyrone. \"Give me the glove, asshole,\" I say, demanding the glove from Tyrone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Tyrone asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it was mostly your fault an hour ago. I remembered what you promised me. You said, you'd give me the glove and allow yourself to get slap. Now give me the glove, motherfucker,\" I demand, almost shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's pause, Tyrone digs into his back pocket and takes out the glove and places it in my hand. I immediately put it on and gesture Tyrone to step forward. I see him gulp and take a series of deep breaths to prepare for the outcome. Without warning I raise my hand and swipe my palm against his left cheek. The power of my swing isn't enough to send him to the floor, but eventually, since the glove's power in changing genders takes all the energy from the person, in no time, Tyrone's tall stature falls to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore my eyes, I see the changes happen. Since Tyrone is tall, his height is reduced to somewhat around my height, maybe a bit taller. His dark ebony skin lightens to a mocha brown and his buzz cut grows into a mane of brunette hair. His bulge recedes as well as his pants, which tighten around shapely legs. Two mounds, probably as big as mine, rise like dough baking in the oven, poking themselves through the shrinking shirt on his slimming torso. Any amount of hair on his face and limbs disappear in a blink of an eye. Actually, the skin sort of starts to age backwards and become soft, as gentle as a baby's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get on my knees and reach over to Tyrone's face to caress his female cheek, but as I do so, I glance at the glove and see a rather large tear that originated from the wrist. Did my slap create this? As I abruptly stop my face from touching the sleeping beauty's face, the glove literally falls away, tearing two and then pieces split in two as well. The glove's pieces falls to the floor and lay lifeless and another inanimate object. Tears well up in my eyes, seeing my chance to become a man again literally rip to shreds. I take the pieces and try to put them together, thinking it would simply mend itself, but nothing happens. When I let go, the pieces simply float in the air before gracefully landing on the wood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!' I scream in my high-pitched voice, knowing that for the rest of my life, I would be exactly the way I am now. My chance of having a dick again, having a girlfriend, having sex as a man is forever and ever no more. For the rest of my life, I would have to deal with the struggle of monthly periods, increased attention from the opposite sex, and the possibility of becoming pregnant. My tears fall from my eyes until they run dry. I resort to silent sobbing at the side of Tyrone's female body, sleeping angelically. He.... she wakes up soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sees my female body and takes in account hers as well. To her, it's exciting, but that excitement quickly vanishes after seeing the sight of a torn, unusuable glove. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath before explaining. \"After I slapped you and turned you into a girl, I tried to wake up, but when I did, the glove tore itself to pieces before my eyes. Even I can't rip something like that apart. Now I can't go back to being Cesar anymore,\" I explain, but I have trouble keeping my emotions in check. Tyrone's female face is awash with concern and sympathy and without speaking, he... she embraces me with a comforting hug. I cry once more into her shoulder and she also unleashes some of her own tears as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, we two are just a bunch of emotional bitches, aren't we,\" Tyrone says with her higher-pitched voice. The joke is enough to get me to laugh, if only for a brief moment. It's enough for the African-American lady to encourage me out of my depressive reverie and worry about the rest of my life. \"At least we aren't dead or in the same place as Carlos and Sonny. We have a roof over our heads and a bed to sleep in. We are very fortunate, even though we're women now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do we live life from now on? I simply can't go back to work like this. I definitely can't go back home like this,\" I state the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you quit and get a new job. Shouldn't be hard for you. There will probably be a lot of opportunites out there,\" the female Tyrone replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we need paperwork that say we can work.

I take a deep breath and go back into the living room where I find Tyra too looking through her phone and writing down email addresses. I walk up to her and say, \"I've decided. I'll give you all of the email addresses in my phone that belongs to a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra's face lights up and she gets off the floor and out of nowhere, pulls me close for an embrace. Our breasts squeeze against each other, sending a wonderful sensation through my torso. We separate and she exclaims, \"Damn, Jen. I wish I had your guts. I was just sorting through everyone that I know well enough to be comfortable being a call girl with, but since you're going all out, I might as well go all the way to. All or nothing as they say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spend the next thirty minutes going through each and every contact in our phones, jotting down the email addresses for those we know are male. Any females are opted out of the search. Despite anything I have against or for each of the men whose addresses I put down, I hope they are much different when they see me as a woman. They probably won't even recognize me. When my father names comes up, I only put down his email address. How taboo would it be for a man's son to become a woman and be the very call girl he goes out with. Something like that goes beyond social taboos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we're done, Tyra takes the lists and disappears behind a computer screen. First creating a fancy letter that informs whoever we're sending the letter to that we are high-class call girls, not girls-next-door and definitely not street prostitutes. From time to time I glance over Tyra's shoulder and discover that what we ask from the clients are their tastes and a brief profile of what they like and what they don't like. The letter also doesn't give out any information about us, only that we are flexible and confident enough to say when something isn't for us, we let them know beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole process takes more than a day, weeks even. We don't get a good response until two months later. Any response we get during those two first months are inappropriate emails which we choose to ignore. Tyra even gets a picture of a cock sent to her. Even though it turns her on, I tell her it's not worth it.In the meantime, all we do is lounge about the house, even go for a swim in the pool, all while cooking up meals for ourselves. The house seems much more quieter without the other guys to fill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever do we sleep together or cuddle together. I guess both Tyra and I recognize ourselves as heterosexual women and though it become a thought, I'm not confident in acting on it. Our first response comes in the form of two emails. One for me and one for Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust who are the men who are our first responders.</span></div></div>",

If we don't get them as our first clients, then there's always more,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Tyra agrees. \"I've set the email up to get them to give out their phone numbers so we can set up a meeting. I'll just give them a text to meet one of us at a certain place at a certain time. And it will be in a high-class place too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now all we need to do is prepare and doll ourselves up,\" I state. By now, we've already learned how to apply make up and perform many ladylike things like walk in heels of various heights as well as the usual mannerisms. By now, every hint of our former selves have been habitually been abandoned, though we remember each day what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of us have visited Sonny and Carlos on occasion. They are now awake and know of our situation. In private, we also tell them our plan. Carlos is okay with it, but Sonny is more conservative, liking it when I don't bring up the subject of me being a call girl. I can somehow tell that he is smitten by my new look. Carlos indeed has taken a liking to Tyra as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it comes down to meeting with our clients, Tyra has set the both of us to meet at a certain table in a certain lounge in the downtown area. Like a blind date, none of us know who the person looks like. We have an idea, but that image we see in our minds might have changed in the few years we have been separated. I remind myself to view my client as a man I've never met before, not my father. I remind myself that I'm no longer a son, but just a normal girl who has set herself up as a sophisticated call girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it comes down to preparing, I'm stumped on what kind of outfit should I wear. I've narrowed the choices down to three. I can be bold and choose a red outfit with a black trenchcoat. Or I can be subtle and sultry with a sweater dress and knee-high boots.

The blanket has been placed over me and for the first time, I can feel my body, but it feels like it's not my own. I sit up in bed, already feeling the silky strands of hair fall from my head, down upon my shoulder and draped down my back. I part the strands in front of my face and tuck them behind my ears, which gives me a sign that this isn't my hair. This isn't my body. I look behind me and see a woman in the mirror looking back at me. My manly face and brunette buzzcut has been replaced by the face of a attractive woman with long brunette hair. The face tells me more, since my instinct is to look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look down and find that my tanktop has shrunk to fit my womanly body. On my chest are two soft, pleasing to the touch, breasts, which rise and fall as I breath. Past that is a toned stomach and further beyond that is a void. I no longer feel a penis attached to me, nor is it existent. I look past my breasts to see that my shorts have turned into short versions of themselves and they fit to the form of my buttocks and hips and most importantly, there is no bulge in my pants. All that's there is nothing, but what I feel and assume to be a vagina, a pussy as I had always called it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm alerted to a movement in the bed and I look to the other side of the bed, where there is someone asleep in the bed. It's a woman and before going into my brief slumber, I can honestly say this woman wasn't in the house. She is about the same size as I am, as well as all her features except for the long black hair. From the way she is breathing, she is definitely still asleep. I have a notion in my head this could either be Carlos or Sonny, since Tyrone's the only black guy in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI peel back the covers to find that the woman is indeed wearing clothes similar to Sonny. Sonny's white tanktop has shrunken like mine to fit the torso the woman has and the straps of the bra underneath peeks out from under the straps of the top. His yellow trunks are gone and don't seem to be on her person, but what covers her crotch area is a black thong. The body before me pulls her limbs in tighter and I deduce she has gotten cold without the blanket, so I cover her up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I do, Tyrone comes in with Carlos, and in their hands, there are items which at first I can't recognize. My visions seems to blur as I look at what they are holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat items are these?</span></div></div>",

The towels are small, not big like pool towels, telling me I'm not in for a swim with these guys. With no answers for me at the moment, I ask, \"What are you going to do with those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone steps forward and then sits on my side of the bed.

This seems to get Tyrone to back away, not because I'm a threat but more because I'm a disappointment. I can't explain how I'm affected by his look. He takes his towel and what looks like a hip-holstered bottle of baby oil and leaves the room, leaving me alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next five minutes or so, I lay in the bed, hoping this dream of me being in this female of a body would dissipate and I could begin being Cesar again. Five minutes pass by and the soreness of my body begins to make me regret not taking Tyrone's offer. Just a back massage would suffice, but it was me who shooed him away. Now I have no option of getting even at least a massage for my shoulders, my arms, my legs... just the thought of no source of relief to my aching body has gotten me onto my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI climb out of the bed and go for the doorknob when I hear noises coming from outside. I hear Carlos' voice as well as the woman. The conversation is rife with compliments, with Sonny doing most of the complimenting. \"That feels amazing, Carlos,\" she says, going so far as to use a seductive voice in her complimenting. No doubt Sonny is trying to get used to her new body. But what kind of massage is Carlos providing that would garner these words from Sonny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy curiosity gets the best of me as I open the door and though I can't see the woman, I see Carlos with a smile on his face, telling me that he is least enjoying his service to Sonny. I cannot see any more however, due to Tyrone leaning against the wall that separates a hallway from the living room, where Sonny and Carlos apparently are. He looks up at the sound of the door opening and catches my eye. He still has the baby oil and the towel in his hands and it seems he was waiting for me. Apparently it wouldn't be efficient for two men to massage a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone, his height towering about my own, approaches and blocks my way into the rest of the house. \"You need something, girl?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no girl!\" I exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, you are. You got no dick and you got boobs on your chest. You are no man. Why don't you relax and go with it, have a massage. It's free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I take up his offer or refuse another time</span></div></div>",

I can tell because there is a certain weight that is countering my own weight on the bed. It seems like it's fast asleep, but is it human? Could it be Tyrone? Carlos? Sonny? Someone else entirely? I try to turn my head without turning my body, but the hair that falls in front of my eyes blocks my vision. I would have to twist about to see who is occupying the other side of the bed. I twist, but in doing so, I hit whoever is in the bed with me. So hard in fact that I expect it to wake up and make a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead it doesn't even grunt. It doesn't even breathe. I uncover the blankets and find a half-naked male doll laying in the bed with its head on a pillow. I expose him to the rest of the room and I see that he's wearing a pair of sweats with socks on his feet. Finding no one in the room at the time, I make sure that I'm not disturbed as I examine the doll. I make sure to close the blinds and cover the windows with the drapes, further darkening the room. I turn on the lights so I can see what I'm doing. After locking the door and making sure no one can open it as I'm fiddling with this doll, I see a box in the corner of the room. It's made out of wood and looks like it's what this doll came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the box I find a collection of penis plugs of various sizes and lengths. I'm amazed just how many different shapes a dick can come in. I go over to the doll and uncover his dick and find that it's flaccid-looking. All I need to do I plug in a bigger one and he'll be ready to service. I'm not that into foreplay and since I have the opportunity, I might as well do what I can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what should I do?</span></div></div>",

Given the circumstances, the desire is simply to be filled outright with what a female body like mine needs to be filled with. And no, it's not a baby. Since I'm alone and the door is locked, I can probably go all-out and hold nothing back. That includes moans of pleasure. I finally find the plug I am looking for and for a second, I'm daunted by the sheer size of the member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take the plug and switch it out with the default plug the doll had. Just a bit of pressure, and the plug pops right in. I immediately straddle it and guide the tip of the cock into my pussy. I manage to partially get the head inside and I find it's uncomfortable. I must be a virgin after all. Heck, I've only been a woman for half a day it seems. After struggling for one minute, I try to look for some kind of lubricant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust my luck, I manage to find a bottle stashed in a box of panties that I know belongs to Tyrone. He probably had a great night with the girls he invited to a pool party. I take the bottle of lube, which is water-based, and I make sure to coat the member from tip to base in the clear, smooth liquid. A flowery smell enters my nostrils and I can tell this is a girl's lube. Just what kind of girls is Tyrone into, who brings lube to a pool party?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignore the possible circumstances regarding the bottle of lubricant and once again, try to mount the member. I use my hand to guide the head into my pussy, which by now, paired with my desire to have sex with this male doll, is getting wet itself. Easily the head enters and I have to breathe deeply just to familiarize myself with the girth of the cock, which seems to increase as it goes down to the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI use my weight to push the member up into my pussy, all the while, I'm moaning and hissing due to every fold, every faux vein, every inch of the silicon rubbing against my insides. At the same time, the girth, the wideness of the shaft stretches my pussy wider and wider. My hisses dissipate and I resort to deep, pleasurable moans. In the throes of this minor ecstasy, I disregard the fact that I'm being loud in this house, possibly waking up my roommates and the neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push the dick into my pussy until it hits the end. I just sit there and get comfortable, straddling this fake man with his fake dick in my pussy. I'm so immersed in a sea of pleasure that I don't see who enters the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho enters the room?</span></div></div>",

And I'm pretty sure you're going to like it,\" Tyrone says and steps up to me. He pats the cheek of his choosing and before he reels his arms back, he shouts, \"I'll slap the man out of you!\" Without further delay, the glove comes my way and I can't do anything about it. I receive the full force of the slap, which seems to not only knock me down, but also Sonny and Carlos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slap renders me numb for some reason. The only thing I can feel is the stinging on my cheek after he slapped me good. The next moment, Tyrone starts to laugh and this isn't the good kind of laugh. As I look up at him, silky smooth hair falls in front of my face. I could have sworn I cut my hair to a buzzcut, but this hair is mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should take a look at yourself,\" Tyrone says and picks me up and escorts me to the bathroom. As soon as I'm on my feet, I feel different. First, I'm about a foot short than him and my arm he holds is almost hairless, more slender, and the hand at the end is smaller. A slight weight is on my chest and I can't seem to feel my dick in my pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm an Asian guy, or well, I was before Tyrone slapped me with his glove. He forces me to look at the mirror in the bathroom. I'm indeed shorter than him, but who stands next to him is no Cesar. It's not me. It's a petite Asian girl who looks as confused and as shocked as I am. The girl wears clothes that fit her body, but they seems so familiar. My eyes widen as I the numbness goes away and I start to feel every fabric on my body. A bra, a thong are definitely my underwear, The T-shirt I was wearing had shrunken to the size of what a girl would wear. It actually is too short and exposes a bit of my toned midriff. The baggy shorts I was wearing are also gone and in their place is a tight pair of short shorts. Gladly, I don't have much of a ass, so no chance of my butt hanging out from underneath the shorts. Still, that's a lot of leg to expose and they're not even hairy anymore. Lastly, my hair, still jet black, but long enough to go back my waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone guides me back out of the bathroom to the living room. Sonny and Carlos (thank goodness he's put his dick away) are sitting on the biggest sofa in the room. In what seemed like a minute, both of my roommates have already got themselves dressed. Tyrone pushes me without any effort towards the two men seated on the sofa. They grab me and force me to sit in between them. It's so weird being a woman, shorter and weaker than them and them being at either side of me. Tyrone steps up, and blocks the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the odds that are not in my favor, I plead to Tyrone. \"Okay, okay, you've made your point. Can you change me back now, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is his decision?</span></div></div>",

You can complain all you want and not trust me, because you as a girl doing this look fine. You look ridiculous being like that as a man.

I try to push myself up to get up and away from the trio, but Tyrone catches me and grabs me back the hair. He pulls it ever so slightly so the roots are taut and my nerves are stinging. I yelp out in my discomfort.

There's no telling how much more we can take away from Cesar here. We shouldn't even call her Cesar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call her Rosario, Rosa for short,\" Sonny says. It seems he looked online for the female version of my name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one, Sonny,\" Tyrone compliments my now as-tall-as-Carlos roommate. \"Rosario... Rosa. Sounds better.

In fact, Carlos comes up with one, but being the silent guy that he is, tells us not with his mouth, but with his dick, literally. He unbuttons his shorts, unzips them and pulls out his new dick. It seemed the glove's power has permanently given it length and girth and even when it isn't erect, it's still pretty long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea, Carlos,\" Tyrone compliments the guy with the new dick. \"Alright, Rosario, here's your task. Suck on Carlos' cock until he cums, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't sucking his dick!\" I protest, trying to wriggle out of his hold on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't, then we'll force you on him,\" Tyrone makes it clear he's not going to let me get away from doing something to these guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonny speaks up. \"Listen to him, Rosa. I'm pretty sure you'll hurt a lot more if you resist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The man has a point there, girl. So suck on it until he cums. That's it. We won't make you do anything else afterwards,\" Tyrone tells me, but I immediately know it isn't true. Carlos, as we were talking, started touching himself and already, just by his eyes looking at my female body, got himself erect and hard. Tyrone pushes me towards Sonny who holds me down as my face stares at Carlos' long dick point blank. I try to push myself up, but Sonny presses down on my back, keeping me in a prone position over his lap. The position uncomfortable, so I push myself onto my elbow. \"We will be here all day at this rate, Rosa! Go on ahead and suck him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI whimper and moan in discomfort and the caressing hand of Carlos petting my head isn't helping. He plants his hand on the back of my head and guides my mouth to the tip of his dick. It presses against my soft lips and with a bit of force, Carlos pushes my mouth to open and lets himself in. With my free hand I try to push off of him, but he resists, much better than my resistance minutes earlier. Already, my saliva starts flowing and mixes with the tastes of his dick. It's musty and though it has been cleaned by pool water, it's still got its odor. I gag as the taste goes down my throat and my plan to escape has become much more desperate. I try to push off, but I still can't due to the hands keeping me down. Knowing it's no use to escape, I start to sob with a dick in my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands pull me up to my feet and I find it's Tyrone that has done this. Now my tears are shown for all three to see and I start to cry even more. \"Damn, girl. We knew you were soft, but we didn't think you'd be this soft,\" Tyrone says. \"Carlos, put you dick away and give me that damn glove.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy crying stops as I see the erection go away underneath the shorts where it belongs. I'm confused to what is going on. Without saying anything, Tyrone guides me to my bedroom. As we enter, we let out gasps, seeing the room and the clothes in the closet has changed to that of not a man's taste in organizing his room, but what a woman's room looks like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, girl, I didn't think this would happen. Not only you're aren't a man, but your room doesn't belong to a man anymore,\" Tyrone state the obvious. Was this fate or was my life changed by a slap?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lets go of me and turns for the door. What should I do now?</span></div></div>",

Yes, I want to kiss him, since that's what girls do. I could just go on my knees and suck him off, but I feel like I'm degrading myself that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone is kinda surprised at my actions, but he likes my effort. He rewards my initiative by closing in for a passionate kiss. Here I am. A girl who used to be a guy, kissing my roommate, who without my permission, made me this way. I don't think I would have it any other way. The hands on my shoulders slide down my arms and down to my hips. He sinks them lower to grab my ass in order to put me in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a brief yelp as I'm lifted off the floor and into Tyrone's muscular arms. At this point, I'm not resistant, but more like I'm melting into his arm. My lips find purchase again on his own and even my tongue slides into his to meet the occupant of the mouth opposite mine. Everything I seem to do seems familiar to me, like I've done this before. Tyrone carries me to the queen-sized bed. Apart from the boy band posters and the make-up on the dresser and the different clothes in my closet, my bed doesn't look any different. Must be because my tastes aren't any different. Just my body is different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone places me on my back on the bed and lays over me. Immediately, my legs part and I wrap them around his lower body. He continues to kiss me as I kiss back. His kisses move off my lips and onto my neck. The feeling of his lips on my neck is something else and I moan loudly at each contact. He moves down as he digs his hands underneath my shirt, lifting it up towards my bust ever so slightly. His lips kiss my navel and then the stomach above it. I'm half glad that he's moving up, but half bum that he isn't going down. Somehow, I want him to eat me out. How awkward that sounds coming from me, but I don't care. This feels good. My desire to change back doesn't seem to fit in my mindset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, girl. Before you didn't want it, but right now, you can't live without it,\" Tyrone says to me.

His hands roam underneath me, underneath my shirt to paw at my breasts, nestled in the bra I'm wearing. \"I think you need a little bit more boobage and a bit more ass,\" Tyrone says. \"You okay with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look back at him, bite my lip and nod, though a bit nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he says and I see him take the glove from his pocket, slip his hand into it. Before slapping my ass and giving me breast and butt, he says, \"I'll slap a little bit of boobs and ass into you!\" Tyrone's hand comes down and makes contact with my ass cheek. It stings, but not as much as the cheek on my face. I somehow get numb along my bust and my ass, as if general anesthesia was injected in those areas. \"That looks better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone continues to adore my body with his hands after taking the glove off and tossing it to the ground. How irresponsible, tossing a glove with power on the floor. I would get it if it weren't for the weight behind me. The black man lifts my shirt up towards my neck and he lets the shirt bunch up above my breasts, which I feel are now a bit bigger and fully. Even the bra feels bigger, growing to accommodate my melons. He lifts the bra up over my breasts and with his hands squeezes them. I moan, this time a bit more loudly feeling a bit of pain mixed with a bunch of comfort. I somehow like how this black giant is handling me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand simultaneously cupping and squeezing my breasts, Tyrone's other hand roams to my shorts. He goes underneath my stomach and with ease, unfastens the button and unzips my shorts. Once loosened, he tugs at the hems and pulls the pair of shorts over my now larger ass, though not completely removing it from my legs. He lets it rest halfway to my knees before moving on to more important things, namely, my thong. I feel how it hugs my crotch, which now doesn't have a dick hanging between the legs. It's all flush with the outside and with the shorts off, I feel a bit of a breeze as the A/C kicks in and blows against my booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone leaves my breasts alone, which I start to fondle myself after propping myself up on one elbow. The sensation is intoxicating as I am in control of my own pleasure. I tug at my nipples and squeeze the flesh of my breasts, feeling how wonderful they are in my hands. In the meantime, Tyrone has now slid both my thong and my shorts down to my knees and is now with his face near my ass. Without any warning, he buries his face into my crotch, using his fingers to stretch my ass cheeks apart to get to my folds. With a free hand, Tyrone rounds my body and from the front, fingers at my clit. How do I know? I know because of a greater sensation, as if it was a pleasurable needle with all its force at one point. I moan loudly upon contact, which I assume could go past these walls to the others outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they sure hear me with my moaning and all that. The door opens and I find Carlos and Sonny walk in. I am not nervous that they are here, but I'm actually aroused that they came to watch, or so I think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy have they come in the room?</span></div></div>",

They see my crotch getting licked, eaten out, and fingered by Tyrone and they see that I'm loving everything he's doing to me. I'm no longer Cesar, the guy who complained and doubted. I'm Rosario, a girl loving the sensations of being a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonny sits down in front of me, but unfortunately he is out of my reach. Being eaten out by Tyrone makes me want to grab at his shorts and pull out his junk. But neither he nor Carlos have come to play with me. They've simply come to watch me get ravaged by this black man. I glance over at Carlos over my shoulder and find that he's taken the glove and put it on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Tyrone has surfaced from my ass and pussy and seen Carlos with the glove. \"Carlos, what are you doing man? You want to give me some more inches so I can ravage Rosa here?\" Tyrone asks, jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos shakes his head and Sonny speaks up. \"I've been thinking... We've been thinking, that one girl is not enough for this house. We need another one, so we don't have to share. Since Carlos likes his new dick, I can sacrifice my height for his pleasure, as woman,\" Sonny explains. Both Tyrone and I are shocked to hear him say that, so much so that I push myself up, leaning my back against Tyrone. \"I'm serious. No Homo either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glance back at Carlos who is now facing Sonny. Awkwardly, he silently cups Sonny's chin and hearing him speak for the first time today, he says, in his accent. \"I slap the man out of you!\" before delivering a hard slap that sends Sonny flying down to the bed. Before my eyes I see him change, almost instantly. His brunette hair grows and his junk that I had lusted after sinks. A pair of boobs rise like bread underneath the shirt he's wearing, which becomes the size a girl would wear. His hairy legs and arms become smooth, almost like a baby. The checkered shorts he's wearing becomes like mine, shorter and tighter to fit to the shape of his body... her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonny?\" I ask. Tyrone does the honors of pulling my thong and shorts back up and put my breasts back in my bra and sliding down my shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonya,\" Carlos simply states. \"It's Sonya now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonny.... Sonya opens her eyes and sits up. Once she sees the changes and looks at Carlos, she jumps off my bed and jumps into his arms. I look at Tyrone and we both wonder, what did they talk about when we were gone? Carlos takes off the glove and tosses it to Tyrone. He then carries Sonya out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould we stay in the room or follow Carlos and Sonya out of it?</span></div></div>",

I immediately get the notion and I beg him not to go through with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a real woman, I swear! You don't need to test it out!\" I plead, but I soon realize that my big mouth will get me into trouble much faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear that, guys?\" Carlos speaks up. \"She says she's a real woman. Are you coming to terms with your circumstances now, Rosa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still, we can't trust the words of someone who hasn't been a woman for a few minutes,\" Tyrone adds. \"Sonny. Find me some duct tape. Carlos, take off her pants.\" Sonny at once goes out the door, possibly to the garage, while Carlos approaches me and puts his fingers at the button of my jeans. I try to writhe and kick to resist his advances, but Carlos subdues me with a punch to my gut. I somehow can tell that he was holding back his strength. The punch is soft enough that I'm not in any pain, but it's hard enough to knock some wind out of me so that my resistance is thwarted long enough for him to undo my pants and pull them off my legs. It doesn't take long for him to strip me naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonny comes with a roll of duct tape, which he hands to Tyrone. The black man proceeds folding my forearms on top of each other behind my back and uses a generous amount of duct tape to secure them in the awkward postion. He takes a strip of duct tape and places it over my mouth, to keep me quiet. Once I'm bound, they walk me into Tyrone's bedroom, which is near the kitchen. Tyrone lays me with my a spine arched due to my arms bound behind my back. My legs hang over the side of the bed with my butt sitting right on the edge. I look up at three sinister-looking faces. I'm not going to like what happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the first thing they do to me?</span></div></div>",

He uncovers his newly-lengthed cock and brandishes it with his hand as if it was a sword. He parts my legs as I plead with him with frightened eyes. Something about Carlos intimidates me. He's not like Tyrone. I can resist Tyrone with no problem, but it's Carlos that worries me. Maybe it's due to him being quiet that i don't know what to expect from him. This is why I don't bother resisting him or kicking my legs to thwart his advances. He folds my legs so that I'm like a plucked chicken waiting to be roast over an open flame. He guides the head of his dick into my pussy and I take a deep breath as the walls of my vagina stretch outwards to accomodate this foreign object. The discomfort and pain rises as he slowly pushes his way in. I close my eyes, finding myself tearing up and I wish with all my might that he doesn't push at his hardest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually fills me completely with an inch or two left to go. He starts to pull out, every part of his member rubbing against my vaginal canal, sending unwanted sensations throughout my body. My breathing starts to quicken as the crown of the head of his cock nears the end of the canal. He manages to keep his head hovering inside me, right at the door, and leans over to shorten the distance between his face and mine. He pulls the duct tape off of my face, minding not to do it too fast and hurt me in the process. He doesn't pause and immediately plants and heavy kiss upon my lips. At the same time, he plows his cock into me. In a fraction of a second, I realize the pain that I'm feeling combined with Carlos' balls hitting my pelvis means that he was testing to see if he could fully fill me. He certainly did, at the price of my hymen, which he has broken through. I can assume that I'm dripping with crimson down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy assumption are correct as he separates his lips and pulls out of me. He takes a towel from a dirty pile of clothes and wipes both my pussy and his dick clean or any residue. When he comes back, I'm still in the moment of Carlos taking my virginity. The pain is like him punching me in the gut, though since I'm bound, I can't do much but lay there helpless. I can only breathe in and out and moan due to the pain. Carlos returns and resumes, sliding his dick into my pussy once again. His length is like the punch, which sends the wind out of me, but it's my job to keep myself alive. The best thing to do is breathe back in, but after I do, my exhale is more like a moan. Not long after, the pain subsides to only a fraction of what it was initially. The sensations that dominate my body is the waves and quakes of pleasure caused by the friction between my flesh and Carlos' member. He leans over once again and plants a kiss on my lips. I kiss him back with the same passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, my moans are louder and the pleasure erupting in my loins has broken down any and all resistance. I begin to enjoy this feeling, even though I'm the one at a major disadvantage. My worries only lie in whether Carlos releases either inside or outside of me. It's coming soon, that I can tell. I seem to be nearing that climax as well. At the same time Carlos' dick quivers inside of me, as if it will increase in size, the walls of my vagina contract and squeeze the foreign object in the opposite direction. I reach my climax before him, causing me to scream out in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos erupts soon after. Does he pull out or keeps it in?</span></div></div>",

I can tell that Carlos is due to erupt just by how it widens a bit, stretching me out a little bit. He pulls out right at the last moment, so fast that he cannot control the spray that I see erupt from the tip of his dick, sending his warm cum onto my stomach. Judging by the amount, it's as if he's been holding it for years. Or maybe his new lengthening gave a whole bunch of swimmers to expel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't do much but lay there, since I'm also a bit exhausted by the pounding and the climax I had to experience. As much as I am reluctant to feel it, I honestly enjoyed it. Carlos wipes the cum off of me and pulls me up to my feet. He holds me while he gets on the bed and pulls me towards him. He positions me to straddle his lap and he guides his still erect cock into my pussy. He uses more force to get me to lower myself on it, filling me with his girth and length once again. I can't help but groan and moan as I'm on it. He allows me to push up in order to pull off of his dick, but he keeps his hands on me and pulls me towards him, his cock penetrating my insides once again. The futile move only makes me feels every vein and curve upon my flesh, causing me to moan and groan both in discomfort and unfamiliar pleasure at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can hear Tyrone's chuckling behind me and he unexpectedly grabs my hair and pulls my head back. \"Call it karma, Rosa,\" he says to me. \"You're trying so hard to resist, but your body likes it when it's getting fucked.\" He grabs my breasts and squeezes each of them hard, causing me to wince. \"Sonny, let's go out and get some stuff and leave the love birds here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound good. What are we getting?\" Sonny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" Tyrone says and leads Sonny out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we are alone, Carlos pulls my face close to his while still fucking me. \"It isn't fair, is it?\" Carlos whispers his question into my ear. \"Out of three of us, you had to be the one to become like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" I ask, not able to say anything else due to confusion on why he brings this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us together like this. We've already shared something intimate. We could be a couple, you and I,\" Carlos mentions as he grunts and groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" I ask as I groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be my girlfriend and I become your boyfriend. As your boyfriend, I become like your bodyguard, so that Tyrone and Sonny can't lay a hand on you,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls me down on his hard, almost knocking the wind out of me. \"Oh shit!\" I exclaim. He stops, giving me time to catch my breath. \"There must be a catch,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just act like my girlfriend. This will be an agreement. Become my girlfriend and I will protect you from those guys. If they want to fuck you, then they will have to wait until I'm dead, but I won't let it come to that,\" he explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean I will have to fuck you and you alone?\" I ask, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I won't fuck you all the time. Just when the time is right. You do have accompany me as my girlfriend everywhere we go. If I catch you with another man, then I'll give you to Tyrone and Sonny.

Carlos rushes and grabs me and wraps his arms around me. \"What are you doing Carlos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're mad. What's wrong, sexy?\" he says, adding an awkward endearment at the end. He catches me off guard and I'm unable to respond. He continues. \"I can't let you out of the room dressed in your birthday suit. What if Tyrone caught you and fucked you on the spot?\" His reasoning causes me to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, baby,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go out and get your clothes, okay?\" he says and walks out the door, closing it behind him. I'm left alone in the room. To cover myself I take a pillow and press it against my front, covering what I can with it. The pillow inadvertently stimulates my nipples and I awkwardly feel a pleasant sensation shoot through my body. Lessening the pressure only makes it worse. My cheeks warm up and as I look back at my reflection in the mirror doors of Tyrone's closet, my face has reddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos comes back, which is a relief to me and hands me a pair of short denim shorts, a bra, a matching thong and a T-shirt. He leaves the room after handing me the garments to give me my privacy. I promptly put on the clothes, starting with the underwear first. The bra is a hassle to put on, but I understand why women wear them. It keeps my breasts, which has a bit of buoyancy, stable and prevents them from flopping around. It also pushes them up and as I look back in the mirror, I can see a prominent cleavage made by the two globes pressing against one another. It also prevents my nipples from getting stimulated, since they rest in the thin cushion on the inside of the cups. When I put the T-shirt on, the fabric doesn't stimulate the shielded tips of my breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slip my legs into the holes of the thong and I rise it up my legs so that the center piece of the garment meets with my crotch and in between my ass cheeks. Though I'm exposed in terms of my ass cheeks and pretty much the entirety of my legs, I feel comfortable knowing my pussy and anus is cover. Who knew a thin, lacy fabric can be so comfortable?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finish my ensemble off by pulling up my denim shorts, which, like the thong, leaves me a bit exposed. I'm comfortable nonetheless, since the areas I needed covered were my ass cheeks. Once I'm done changing, I exit the room by opening the door. Right outside is Carlos holding something. Just what is he holding?</span></div></div>",

It worked. It actually worked. For some reason, Tyrone's threat to turn me into a woman actually becomes real suggestion.

I hear him firmly say with a normal voice, \"I slap the man out of you!\" a split second before his gloves hand, palm and fingers included, strikes my face.

Before me is a simple chair and in front of the chair is a table with a bag on top of it. Beyond the chair and table is a mirror, but I'm pretty sure when it's paired with the surroundings around me, it's a one-way mirror. All I can see is my reflection. I'm bound by shackles that are bolted to the wall above me. I'm still wearing the sports bra and the shorts, but my feet are bare and shackled as well, to cuffs bolted to the floor.

In her arm she carries a folder, which she places on the table. She walks up to me with an inquisitive eye and speaks, though not directly at me. \"This is the one that was changed into a woman. Formerly a man named Cesar,\" she says, as if talking to an audience and not the subject in front of her. The subject it seems to be not able to talk in her view, like it's either dead or an animal with no intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI attempt to speak, to show her that I'm a real person, but the doctor catches me and places a gentle finger on my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say anything,\" she whispers to me. \"You obviously don't see the collar on your neck and the special cuffs on your wrists. One word out of that pretty mouth of yours and the people behind the glass will shock you with electricity.\" She continues her observation as if the whole dilemma of me speaking didn't occur to her. \"Subject seems to be perfectly female. No evidence of areas with masculine qualities.\" She puts her hands upon me, first my stomach and the skin of my arms and legs. \"Almost hairless in places were males have abundant body hair.\" She then touches my hair and runs her hand through the locks. It feels good for some reason. \"Subject shows common female reaction to hand with hair contact. Hair is almost perfect.\" She ties the hair into a ponytail, that drapes over one of my shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now onto the important parts.\" Her hands move from my shoulder directly to my breasts, which seem to be small with the sports bra on. It's only when she lifts the band at the bottom of the garment and pulls it over my breasts, letting them fall with the force of gravity, that I find that they are bigger than I thought. She wastes no time grabbing the breasts with her hands and giving them a squeeze, causing me to wince. At first it's unfamiliar to feel this sensation, but as she continues, it starts to feet good. \"Subject is showing positive signs of stimulation to her breasts.\" The woman pinches my nipples and even twists them. I wince at first and even gasp when the tips on my breasts are wrenched. Luckily whoever is behind the glass doesn't zap me. She continues without the twisting, pinching the nipples at a good pace. By now, I'm breathing heavily, for the sensation feels good. It's enough to make me forget that I was formerly before all this. \"Sensitivity is normal for the nipples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands move down my stomach to my shorts. Her thumbs pry the waistband from my body and pulls my shorts down to reveal what looks like a black thong. She pulls the shorts as far as she can, though she cannot pull it down past my knees due to my legs being crossed. She focuses on the thong and like my shorts, pulls them down as far as she can, exposing my crotch in the process. She prods the front of my crotch, finding the folds as well as a certain place that upon contact, sends intense pleasure coursing through my body. I can barely hold back a moan when she touches it the first time and every other time after that. \"Subject's clitoris seems to have normal, if not extra, sensitivity.\" She continues with her index finger and her middle finger, easily inserting them into the hole down there. By now, I don't care if I'm zapped and I audibly moan as every nerve in my wet folds is touched and rubbed upon. \"Everything internally seems normally sensitive, though definitely a virgin.\" A hand goes behind my ass and touches upon the sphincter of my anus. \"Rectum is virgin as well. Subject seems to have been changed somehow from a normal male to a fully-functional and sensitive female. Examination is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman removes her hands from my body and goes to the table, where she reaches for the bag. She unzips it and pulls out.....?</span></div></div>",

The next item she pulls out is a larger garment, maybe a jacket or sweater. The next item is a pair of black tennis shoes, socks, as well as underwear. She places them on the table neatly. The mirror beyond the chair and table becomes opaque and non-reflective, matching the white of the walls. \"I'm guessing you have a lot of questions, but those will have to wait. First, get changed after I remove your bindings. Don't worry. No one is watching you or listening to what you say. Once you're done, just knock the door and I'll escort you to where they've asked you to be taken,\" she tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They?\" I ask simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, your questions will be answered later, first, you get the privilege of changing out of your current outfit to a new one. Try to hurry up,\" she reiterates her phrase. She leaves out of the door and in the silence of the room, I can clearly hear the locking of the door. Seconds later, the bindings unbolt themselves and I can pull the cuffs off the wall for both my hands and feet. The cuffs loosen and I can pull them off easily. It's the metal bands on my wrist that has got me worried. They don't seem the kind of device to be taken off without the aid of tools. Beside shocking the person wearing them, I wonder what other thing it has a purpose for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all the binding are off my body, I commence undressing myself of my sports bra, my shorts and thong. I waste no time looking over the garments, which include a lacy bra and thong, a tank top, a pair of yoga pants and a zip up track jacket, all in a black color. I don the outfit, finishing with the socks and tennis shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I'm finished clothing myself, I go for the door and as commanded, knock on the metal. Without delay, the door opens, revealing the doctor inputting data into a tablet. \"All done? Alright, come with me,\" she says and starts walking briskly into a hallway. it's almost virtually empty, save for a few people, like two guards who seem to be patrolling the area. I look up and see the gear and the guns on each person. I inadvertently catch the eye of one of the guards and he whistles at me. Unfamiliar with the audible gesture, I simply ignore it and follow the woman past a corner and directly to a door. \"You'll be here until we find better accommodations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman opens the door and there inside I find....?</span></div></div>",

The man goes over to the table and reaches for the folder. In the meantime I look straight into the mirror and see myself in a very compromising position with no way to escape or do anything about. The man pulls out a file from the folder and stands right beside me, looking into the mirror at my reflection. \"Did you make yourself beautiful and attractive, girl?

Fortunately, in his rage, he doesn't hit me. \"Your friend Tyrone wasn't much of a talker, well... before. Now he should be talking now, just like how you're going to tell me exactly what I want to hear,\" he says, being vague about Tyrone and them making him talk somehow. Knowing Tyrone, he wouldn't sell out anyone, regardless of how shady that person was. He would go to great and possibly, in this case, painful lengths to keep his secret, secret. \"We know Tyrone had the glove on last, when we captured him, but he won't tell us where and who he got it from. Since he didn't give me an answer then, it all comes down to you. Are you going to be a good little girl and tell me the truth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't even know who Tyrone bartered with to get the glove, but the suspicions of him getting it are starting to be exposed. What kind of relationship did Tyrone have with that guy? Was it a stranger, like he said, or was he on more friendly terms, way past acquaintances? And how sophisticated is the technology of the glove? It looks like an ordinary glove used for many uses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grabs my hair again and yanks it back so that I'm forced to look up at him. \"I'm waiting, bitch. What do you have to say about this?\" he scolds me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do? Should I tell all the truth I can or should I be like Tyrone and not snitch on his transaction?</span></div></div>",

It'll hurt my pride for saying anything else apologetic. It'll hurt it more if I carry you to your room a certain way,\" he tells me, almost like a whisper. He turns me around so that I'm facing him and he lifts me up so that I'm draped over his shoulder, his securing hand on the back of my thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe goes to the door and exits the room. Immediately outside the room, I can only see behind Grim. The room is connected to a hallway that is probably the same white as the room, but that is all I see. For some reason, my fatigue gets the better of me and I cannot stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment I open my eyes, I find myself in a room of white and silver. I'm in a bed with a heavy blanket over me, which in turn makes me noticed that I don't have any clothes on. The heavy blanket, as well as the soft blanket underneath me comes in contact with my bare skin of my whole body, keeping me warm. I then remember about Grim and him taking me to this room. Did he undress me and clean me up? I can tell that I'm no longer sweaty when I was in that room. But where is he?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I sit up in the bed, using the heavy blanket to cover my exposed flesh. I look about the room and see that it's quite spacious. The front door to the room is found on the far wall opposite the bed. To the left of the front door is a dining area with an oblong table and chairs surrounding it. Adjacent to the dining area, there is a living room, complete with a full sofa, loveseat and two single armchairs. Adjacent to the living room is semi-transparent glass panel that seems to go outside onto a balcony. A semi-transparent partition separates the living room from the bedroom which has two partitions separating it from the other areas of the room. I look to my left and see a passageway through the wall the bed rests against and I lean over to find a closet and bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get out of bed, making a note that I'm leaving the safety and privacy of the blankets. Once my feet make contact with the carpet, I rush to the closet. I find an assort of clothes, most of them in black, either hanging on hangers or folded neatly on shelves. On the backside of the door I just opened, there are hooks with what looks like robes. I take the robe that feels like satin with a pattern of very thin vertical red lines and cover myself with it. It feel like a small dress when I fasten the rope to secure it, but I still feel naked. I go to one of the drawers and find socks and underwear. Knowing that I'm a woman now, since I exposed myself in that room with Gwen and Grim, against my will, if I may add, I find that there are no boxers or briefs in this drawer or any drawer for that matter. I take solace in choosing a black panty, not a thong that the glove gave me to wear. I slip my legs through the holes and pull the garment up so that it hugs my and actually warms up my crotch, with is a plus for comfort. It might not be comfortable with a dick in the way, which I don't miss for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dressed, I leave the bedroom and explore the rest of the area. Behind the partition opposite the bed, there is a small kitchen and bar area and there at the range, I find Grim, his suit jacket hung on the coat rack near the front door. I try to tip toe my way to the front door, but it seems Grim has trained his ears even to hear the tiniest of sounds. He is alerted to my presence and turns around, revealing his front covered by an apron. My eyes widen at the sight of it on his body, assuming he would be cooking with his dress shirt and slacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrim sees my reaction and defends himself. \"This is my only dress shirt today and I don't like to mess it up,\" he says. \"You're finally up. It seem your ordeal with the glove and everything after it took the lot out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long was I out?\" I ask, hearing the voice that comes out of my mouth again. It seems I'm hearing it for the first time in a long while, even though I used it just before my slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty hours, give or take an hour or so. You were so out of it that I went ahead and bathed you, if you don't mind,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would be mad if I truly were a man, but understanding that I was out for twenty or more hours, I say, \"I don't mind. Thank you, for doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" he replies. \"You hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starving,\" I say, smelling the aromas wafting about the kitchen. It's only when I go over to the stove that I see what's producing the pleasant smell, or so I think. How is Grim's cooking?</span></div></div>",

I look down and see what seems like oranges or grapefruits underneath the hoodie I'm wearing. The hoodie itself isn't bagging or large on my body at all. It actually seems like it hugs my form, in a good way that is. The hands that hold me are big. The hands belong to Ricky, but my arms seem like twigs compared to the width I had them last... as a woman. He, for some reason lets me go and pushes me forward so I can stand on my own two feet. Already, I can feet a different sort of balance and my legs seem to be much leans and more exposed. Must be the short shorts I have on. They were probably long and baggy as a guy, but now as a woman, they fit to my form more better. It's rather convenient, since I wouldn't want to be turned into a woman and have my clothes not fitting me or falling off of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's the thing. I'm no longer a man, but a woman. I look up, noticing a stray lock of hair fall in front of my eyes. In an way that is like instinct, I brush it away from my eyes and tuck it behind an ear, further gaping the mouths of the guys already looking at me. \"What's wrong, fellas?\" I say, but not with my manly voice, but that of a woman, high-pitched and rather cute and gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're-- you're a chick? You're now a chick, dude!\" Sonny says, clearly not knowing what to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A rather fine average chick, too,\" Tyrone adds. \"You have melons, and not just small ones, you got big ones.\" When he mentions my breasts, I pull the zipper down the front of my hoodie, unhooking it at the end and short them the tank top underneath. I'm surprised that the glove, how powerful it is, was kind enough to give me a bra underneath the sleeveless garment I have on. It does push up the form of my breasts and I look down and see how round they are. Without shame, I take them into my hands and feel how firm they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, not only you got chest, but you got ass too. It's not the overly large, badonkadonk Brazilian ass, but the ass of somebody who works out,\" Ricky add. At his observation, I turn around and try to look at my butt, but in doing so, I unknowingly model my body to the three of my roommates. If I wasn't careful, I'd have their perverted bodies on me in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo the guys hold back their desires to touch and see or do I allow them to come and touch?</span></div></div>",

I kindly allow him to, exposing my lithe arms in the process. They have a slight tone to them, as if in the past week, my arms have had a workout. With the hoodie gone, he comes behind once again and feels upon my shoulders and traces his finger down my arms. I feel the tingle and what little pleasure it gives me and I audibly coo at the touch. \"Damn, your skin is hella soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where Sonny, without warning approaches and rather rudely smells my hair and touches it as well. I'm surprised that Tyrone hasn't yet joined in, but I bet he is waiting his turn. That's when I'm surprised again when he approaches, but instead of touching me, he pulls both Sonny and Ricky off me and pulls me to the side. His large hands on my hips feels good, but it's short-lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't right, fellas,\" Tyrone tells the guys. \"No are we going to take advantage of our roommate, even though he is a she now. Sorry, Cesar or whatever you'd want us to name you, but we can't allow ourselves to give in to temptation and our desires and touch you in your... places. I say we discuss what's going to happen next, since this is more than inches to your dick Sonny and this is much more than your muscles. First of all, we can't use our roommates as our personal slut or prostitute. I'm being real, fellas. It felt it was going to be just that. I say we respect our roommates for what... she is. Let's be gentlemen here. Our roommate is a lady and she should be treated as such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky adds, \"She is still our friend, even though she's a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone nods and Sonny looks like he has missed out on something. \"Would you agree...?\" Tyrone asks, trailing off to figure out what name I should pick.

Nothing comes out of my mouth and it also seems that I can't sense myself breathing. Everything goes black as my eyes roll backwards in my eye sockets. The only thing I feel is my whole body teetering over like a tree being pushed down after its been cut. The reason that everything is black around me is because I'm closing my eyes. When I open them, the scene before me is like I'm in a second-person perspective. I find my female body on the ground with Tyrone tending to me, trying to get me to wake up. Not long after my tumble, both the other two guys topple over, hit by the same mysterious event of them fainting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene isn't over and as I watch Tyrone with the glove in his hand freaking out due to all three of his roommates passing out and falling to the floor, I watch as all the windows explode as if there had been an implosion. The glass shatters and are thrown inwards by the force. Tyrone cowers to defend himself from the shrapnel but he is quickly subdued as his is tazed. He falls to the floor as dramatically as his three roommate had fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am then pulled backward, but it only feels as if my eyes are like cameras and they are pulled backwards, giving me their perspective. Nowhere else do I feel this backwards motion. Everything I see flashes at a speed faster than sound, yet slower than light. I suddenly halt to find myself before a light that is bright, but not too bright that it would blind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light flickers and glows brighter and I suddenly realize it's speaking to me. \"Having fun?\" a slightly ethereal female voice that sounds like it's being spoken loudly in a theatre hall speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't respond, mainly because when I try to respond, nothing audible comes out of my mouth. Speaking, frankly, I feel like have no mouth. Furthermore, I have no body that I can see or feel. I would sense myself trying to lift an arm before my face to cover the sight of the light, but nothing appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a no,\" the voice speaks again. \"Didn't think or acknowledge that the universe as a whole had a hand in that little fiasco, did you? Damn Humans. They always think they have control over their lives! Like there isn't a higher-being! Yet they had the nerve to unwittingly, unknowingly create a device that can cross beyond their mortal plane of existence! </span></div></div>",

Sonny's mouth is gaping open with not chance of it ever going back up. Ricky is averting his gaze and not even looking at my face. Tyrone is for sure glancing at my ass. \"Consider this kinda of a once in a lifetime moment. Here's a woman who going to let you guys touch her body.\" In order to get them in a more willing mood, I remove the zip-up hoodie, revealing my slender arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're giving us permission Ces?... uhm, I don't think it would be right to call you Cesar anymore,\" Tyrone asks as clarification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me come up with a name, guys. So who's first?\" I tell them. I approach Ricky, but he glances away from me. Tyrone glances away too, as if he doesn't want to see the front side of my body. Of course, his fixation is booty. Last, but not least is Sonny, who closes his mouth when I approach him. He is seated on an armchair, with no room on either side of him to sit on. My only option is to straddle his lap sideways. When I do, he tenses up and though it may seem awkward for him, somehow it doesn't feel awkward to me. Actually, it feels fun that I'm getting to do this as a woman. I recline against one of the arms of the chair and say to Sonny, \"You've been looking at my breasts ever since I woke up Son. You want to touch them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I?\" he asks, but I waste no time and grab his hands and place them on each of my melons. Having another person's hands on my body like this is like a thrill for me. It's so exciting, that I can feel my heart already racing. \"Oh my god, they're so soft,\" he says as he lightly squeezes each breast. He rotates his hands, which cause his fingers to brush against the breast either through the tank top or directly on the skin when brushing over my cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky slowly approaches and makes his presence known when he speaks up. \"Damn, Ces, you don't look embarrassed at all. Can I grab one of them too?\" he asks as if he's a little boy in a candy shop, asking his parents' permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't say anything in response and simply take his hand once he gets close enough and place it on the nearest breast. Instead of saying something, I do let out a slight moan in response to the active groping of Sonny and Ricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone speaks up, commenting on my behavior as a woman. \"Damn, girl, you fucking look amazing with the boys squeezing your boobs,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna cop a feel, T?\" I ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and then some,\" he simply says. I remove the hands of my roommates and dismount off of Sonny's lap and approach Tyrone, who is seated in a chair near the dining table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what'll be mister?\" I ask. He doesn't say anything, letting his hands do the talking. He places his hands on my hips and manage to get me to turn around, so that my ass is facing him. I look behind me and catch a glimpse of his facial expression. It's one that I recognize and that is the look of a booty connoisseur or a ass worshipper. His hands start to massage the muscles of my butt, slightly tickling me, but more so with the sensations of pleasure. Another moan escapes my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems this could escalate even further. What do I do?</span></div></div>",

Who knows, maybe something bad might happen if we use it too much, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's right,\" Sonny says, reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, this doesn't change the fact we're still buddies, even though one of us is a chick now, right?\" Tyrone asks, which is weird. In the presence of a girl, he would be one of the first people to start hitting on her and if he succeeds in getting in her personal space, would be the one to start touching the quickest. In actuality, I'm surprised none of the guys, especially Tyrone, hasn't closed the distance and laid his hands on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Ricky starts, \"ain't you getting something changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Tyrone asks. \"I don't need anything changed.

My eyes lower to Ricky's torso, knowing that the glove had recently turned his belly fat into a toned abdomen. I close the distance and reach my hand out to him, laying my palm and fingers on his new abdomen. I lift my palm, only to trace hardly with my finger to feel each toned muscle of his stomach through his shirt. I'm hoping, with me initiating this touch, he would return the favor, which he does, but it surprises me how he does it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does he return the touch?</span></div></div>",

His meets mine and even though I'm reluctant for the first second, as we share this kiss, the notion that him being my roommate and me previously being a guy is thrown out of my mental window. More sooner than later do I return the kiss, raising my own hands to his head and shoulders to keep him still. I rotate my head one side so that the kiss can be done properly. Almost immediately, I can feel this heat of what I deduce is none other than desire welling up inside me. Both our inhaling and exhaling becomes heavy.

He looks to his right, probably due to his nervousness. \"This is crazy. You're a woman now and even though you used to be my roommate, the atmosphere around you has changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" I ask, happily curious. I drop my hands to his shoulders, where I push down in order to raise myself onto my toes. I also press the front of my torso on his and watch his expression change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you're making me nervous since this makes this whole what-we-just-did an awkward situation and it feels like it can only escalate from here,\" he says, though with a struggle. Even though he has a toned abdomen, it hasn't changed how he is with the opposite sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to test him. \"Escalate? You mean, like this?\" I ask as I slip my hand underneath the top hem of his pants. I dig underneath his boxers and find the warmth that I'm looking for. Since kissing him and touching him before that, he already has a boner underneath his pants that at first went unnoticed till now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Ricky respond to my advances?</span></div></div>",

He slowly pulls my hand out. Surprised at his response, my body goes limp, which allows him to manipulate me according to his liking. Once my hand is taken out, he clasps it with my other hand and he encloses both with his own, larger hands. \"I can't Jo,\" Ricky says, immediately using the name that I had picked out, though shortening it just to be quick. \"I cannot let you do what you want in terms of what you were about to do. My reason. It's too fast. I'm a romantic kind of guy. If I can't take you on a date to a delicious dinner or movie, then I'm not the one with a dick you can grab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words don't come out as a struggle and there is no ounce of nervousness in his voice. He lets go of my hands and leaves for his room, leaving me to my own devices right in the middle of the living room. I feel a bit of guilty that takes the place of my burning desire that I had a minute ago. I try to think about what he said. Unlike what I think about Sonny and Tyrone, in order for Ricky to touch me in my private places, I would have to go on a date with him. The fact is, he is not willing to jump the gun. He wants to test the waters first. He wants love. Not lust. For once, I respect him for that. I don't like it, but out of all of my roommates, he is the most closest to me. If he doesn't like it, then I cannot force myself on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis leaves me with nothing to do. With Sonny and Tyrone out of the house and Ricky in his room, I cannot fulfill the touch I was craving a few minutes ago. What should I do in the meantime?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The dead grass and the sun bearing down on the ground reminds me that we are in a drought, with no chance of seeing a cloud in sky. There hasn't been a significant storm in months and though there has been heavy ground cover, all it did was provide us with a cool breeze now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't deter me from going outside. If I cannot get Ricky to touch me in place, then I might as well wait until he ask me out on a date. In the meantime, a stroll around the neighborhood should be a good way to get some fresh air. I don't remember the last time I went out for a walk, aside from walking around the pool in the backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a good thing I was wearing shoes with Tyrone changed me. My tennis shoes are now the right size and I'm already ready to venture out. I go for the door, twisting the knob to open it. I walk out the threshold and I pull against the door and close it, though with no key, I cannot lock it. I just hope Sonny and Tyrone comes back soon or Ricky comes out of his room to notice it. I know for a fact this door isn't going to blow open if a random gust of wind happens along. With the door closed, I'm free to make my way to the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom here I can go one of three ways, each way with a likelihood I'll end up some place that one can call a destination. The house sits in front of a three-way intersection, like the shape of a T. To my left, just a block away is a main street. I'm likely to end up at the nearby shopping center. My need for that place wouldn't be at the top of the list of places to go, since I have no wallet. I'm pretty sure, i have no need for the wallet since it probably doesn't have a matching identification card. Now, to my right, goes deeper into the neighborhood. Though I haven't been down this way, I hear from my neighbors that they is a park along the way. Finally, straight in front of me, is a street that ends in a court, but at the edge of the court is a staircase that leads people down to a paved path along the creek. Due to the drought, I'm sure the creek is dry like a bone, but the path is shaded by the trees. I'm already starting to get a sweat going behind my neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich way should I go?</span></div></div>",

I never had any need to go this way, since it just went deeper into the residential area and my attention focused more on the main street, which was a faster route. I was always too busy to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to the lower part of the street where the house sits, the upper part seems more new and more affluent. instead of bungalows, there are two story houses and even one three story house that I can see from afar, seated on a hill. The reason why this is the upper part of the street is mainly due to elevation. After passing three houses, the street rises and the incline is a bit mild, but not too extreme. I actually see signs along the way that direct me up gravel paths to what is called the community park. Eventually the gravel paths become paved steps and at the top of the steps, the ground levels off. Fenced off, the park is a large place, sporting two empty baseball fields, a set of four tennis courts, a couple basketball courts and a large field for a variety of other activities. One end of this field has white frames for soccer goals and at the other end has a pair of volleyball nets. On the other side of the park there are facilities with grills and tables and nearby there are also bathrooms. Beyond this is a paved bike path that swerves through the park, separating field from field. At the other end of the park is a long parking lot, which at this time, only a couple of cars occupy parking spaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe park, though it may seem open according to my description, is actually surrounding by a family of trees that provide shade. I'm actual notice a gazebo hidden behind some of the thicker trees, down a gravel path. The structure sits right near the wooden fence that separates the park from a very steep incline. As a precaution, nets are installed to prevent any accidents. I make my way to this gazebo and find it empty when I get there. I have seat and relax, inhaling the fresh air. The sun shines bright upon the gazebo, but due to its location, it's not hot at all. A cool breeze blows through the structure so that I'm not hot, but warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, I hear something that I don't see quite yet in my field of vision. What do I hear?</span></div></div>",

As I walk down, no one has their garages open. A few kids are in the street one their skateboards, doing tricks on and off a waxed curb, which in the sunlight, looks dark and slick. The boys don't give me any attention, not that I need some from teenagers younger than me. I continue walking, finding an old Asian lady with a straw hat on tending to a garden full of succulents, the perfect type of plants to grow in this hot weather. She too is too focused on her work to notice me. At the end of the street, where the road widens to form the  court, only one person has his garage door open, mainly due to the probable heat in his garage as he diligently works on his car. He looks my way for a brief second before walking back in to grab a tool from his tool box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get to the end of the street, where a staircase leads down in between two yards to a paved path below. Down here, where the tall tree shade the walkway, it's considerably cooler. If there were running water, it would be a lot more cooler, but due to this drought, there is no water to be found. Only a dry creek bed with stagnant puddles of water hear and there. A slight breeze although, keeps the place from smelling too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on the path, I go to my right, assuming the path to the left with take me under an overpass that the main street goes over. I had planned to explore more of the neighborhood and it's clear the residential area ends to the left. I might as well go to the right and see where it takes me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk what seems to be just a half mile before the path no longer is a leveled walkway. The incline rises, but it's mild and not too extreme. The surrounding residences, their foundations and even the direction of the streets rise as the path goes up. It doesn't go up too far and about another half mile, it becomes level again, though with much more trees than the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't get very far when I hear something that cannot be seen with my eyes just yet.

I had just heard the skies above bellow out a roaring amount of thunder, luckily I did not see a flash of lightning. Maybe it's because the trees up here are more thicker and blocks any view apart from the gaps in between houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI no time, the rain starts pouring down. What was dry ground and dry creek, becomes slick, muddy ground and the beginnings of a creek resurrected. This bogus storm must have been a surprise for everyone. Unfortunately, for me, i don't have a garage or any type of shelter I can use to get out of the rain. The trees help for a moment, but once the rain starts seeping down from the branches, then it gets bad. I can only protect myself with my hood, but that's it. My sweater by now is already soaked, enough that the cold has touched my skin underneath the fabric. My shorts and legs are in the same condition. My shoes are the worst, for the pathway had started descending and a couple times, the soles of my shoes had slipped on some slick areas on the pavement. I had to find purchase on a part of the path that wasn't too slick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have been able to save myself a couple times, but the incline just now became a bit more steeper. Not drastically, but by a couple degrees. The creek next to me, possibly a twin from the one I saw before, flows down with much force that it laps up the bank, making the ground there even more muddy. It's a good thing that the city installed a fenced rail to prevent slippage into the creek, but the bad news is that with the force of the water, some of the mud have mixed with the watery current down onto the pavement. Even I know I won't have enough traction to get down it safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where can I go. There are no outlets out of this place. The nearest one was the staircase that I had used to get down here in the first place. I have no choice but to go down. I take it slow, one step at a time. I put one foot onto the stream running down the pavement and put my weight on it. The rubber sole holds. Not sure that my foot would take all the weight, I slowly inch my other foot along the ground, passing my planted foot until I can find purchase on another section with my other foot. The whole procedure takes time, at least ten minutes, though it could have been longer. But I successfully, get to the bottom, where it levels out and luckily, I find an outlet into the neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately take it and rush to find some type of shelter to get out of the pouring rain. In my rush, my foot steps on the side of the path where the material had eroded. When my foot steps on it, the material gives way and when adding the water pattering all around me, the friction is lost and the joint of my ankle goes too far, causing searing pain at the bottom of my leg. I scream and cry as I lose my balance, splashing onto wet grass. Right now, the wetness is the least of my concern. With my crippled ankle, it'll take forever to get back to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the outlet had taken me to another park, but in a different neighborhood. I find that it's obviously empty, but I have a sliver of hope that there might be someone nearby that can help. \"Hello! Anybody there! I need help!\" I shout out, but stop as the pain comes back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho comes to my aid?</span></div></div>",

He runs to me and asks, \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start to explain, \"Well, I was caught out in this storm and my ankle slipped too far, spraining it or---,\" but Ricky interrupts me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that, we need to get out of here,\" he says out of nowhere. \"It's not safe.\" Before I can ask what is wrong or what happened that has caused him to act this way, he takes me into his arms and carries me into the thick of the bushes. He lays me down on the moist floor, but it's not the mud possibly soiling my clothes that has my concern. Looking through the openings between the thin stems of the bush, I can see in the distance an empty parking lot and what looks to be Ricky's truck, parked in a weird position, like he was in a hurry to get that certain spot. Seconds later two SUVs race into the parking lot and after stopping near Ricky's truck, men in suits wielding handguns exit out of the vehicles and investigate the truck. They find it empty and the leader of the group, who's bald, command the others to spread out in hopes of finding the person who was driving that truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are they, Ricky?\" I ask, but he doesn't answer. He instead puts a hand over my mouth to silence me and it turns out that one of the men is headed straight here. Fortunately, the bushes on this part of the park is too thick and though he tries to wedge himself in, he is pushed back out by the branches. The man leaves to investigate another part, never coming back to the brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men look through every part of the park, even the path that leads to the path alongside the creek. Ricky and I wait until they return, as they are on their radios telling the man in charge that who they are looking for has run off along the creek. The men withdraw from the park and enter back into their SUV's and drive away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicky let's go of my face and slumps down next to me, catching his breath. \"Who were they, Ricky?\" I ask my question once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were here for the glove and any witnesses who may have seen what it's capable of,\" he tells me. \"I was in my room when Sonny and a woman entered the house. They used that time to force their way in. The took the glove and ever turned Sonny into a woman. I escaped out the window, but they heard me get into my car. I knew you went out because no one would leave the door unlocked if they had a key to unlock it. That's how they got in, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" I apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not your fault. Tyrone. If he didn't bring that glove and change us, we wouldn't be in this mess,\" Ricky reassures me. \"Now he's probably a woman alongside Sonny, having all sorts of cruel stuff done to him.\" He catches his breath as he looks out into the park. \"We have to get out of here. We can't go back to the house. If those guys are smart, they will probably turn the house upside-down looking for something that can help them track us down. I'll probably have to ditch my truck too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will we get out of here? And where will we go?\" I ask him. He looks around again, seeing if the coast is clear, and answers. What does he decide on?</span></div></div>",

I look in the direction of the peculiar sound and find a dog, whose breed is a Shiba Inu, a favorite of mine, running over to me. He slows down meters before he meets me and when he gets to where I'm laying, he looks behind him and barks. He does this for about thirty seconds, which gives me enough time to observe how his short fur, though known to be groomed off during the summertime, soaked with the rain. His light, golden fur is more of a light, muddy brown when its all wet. I also reach over for the dog's collar, which has a tag with the name \"Dango\" on it. I wonder why your name is Dango, I speak in my mind. The collar also has a simple rope leash attached to it, but no owner attached to the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dango!\" a man's voice calls out from afar. \"Dango! Where'd you run off to buddy!\" A man with a bright yellow coat appears from behind a bush. I look over and he rushes to where his dog is standing. \"Who did you find, boy?\" He then addresses me. \"Are you hurt miss? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man goes over to me, but due to the pain in my ankle and his hood, I can barely see his face. I tell him of my injury, \"I slipped and fell as I was coming up the path. The rain started pouring when I was at the creek, but luckily I found this park.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky Dango found you when he did,\" the man says. \"We were trying out this park when it suddenly started raining. We thought this drought was going to last forever. But enough, talk, let's get you out of her and someplace dry. Can you walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't tried,\" I say, \"but I'm sure my ankle hurts a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't even try to get up when there isn't anything to hold onto that is not wet. Here, let me help you up,\" the man says and immediately wraps his arm around my shoulders, snaking his forearm underneath my armpit. While holding onto the hand opposite the armpit he has supported, he lifts me upright, minding to not put any pressure on my afflicted ankle. \"Now, can you put any weight on your foot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try,\" I tell him and as he holds onto me, I transfer my weight from my left foot, which feels fine, to my right foot. As soon as the sole of my right foot is level with the ground, stinging pain shoots up my leg. I yelp in pain and my response is to lift my foot and leave it hanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This won't do,\" the man tells me. \"The parking lot is at the other end of this park and walking there will take a long time. I'm going to have to carry you, miss, is that alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely, if we just start walking to the parking lot, we will have to stop due to my ankle not being able to take it. There is no other option. If there was, I would have taken it, but I will have to just trust this man. Judging by his speech, he doesn't want to carry me out of respect for a stranger. At least he asked me before doing it. \"That's alright, thank you,\" I respond and give him my appreciation. He wastes no time in supporting my torso in the same fashion as he lifted me to my feet a minute before. He then uses his other arm to support my thighs, which keeps the ankle hanging with no pressure acting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep my head down, not wanting to lock eyes with the man. I don't want to be attracted to a stranger. I'd rather be attracted and be touched by one of my roommates than a stranger who I don't know. I instead watch as the dog follows us and runs ahead of us. A smile forms on my lips, not for the rescuer, but for his dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man carries me in silence, all the way to his car, which is an SUV. He is able to open the passenger door and gently place me onto the seat, again, minding not to hit my foot anywhere in the car. Once I'm seated, he closes the door and opens the rear door to let the dog inside. He then gets into the driver's seat and turns over the engine. I keep my gaze down into my lap, not wanting to see and know who has rescued me. I hear him take off his hood and sigh in response to the rain. Heck, I'm sighing as well, glad to be out of the storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man speaks to me, \"We need to take you somewhere you can get that ankle treated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does he take me?</span></div></div>",

If we go to a hospital, which I'm sure is much farther away, then it will be a long time before we get there. If I go to his house, which I assume is in this neighborhood, I will receive treatment much sooner. The pain in my ankle removes my reluctance to trust a stranger, even when he has shown me traits of a good samaritan. \"That's okay,\" I tell him simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI assume he silently affirms my agreement to allow him to take me to his house. It's funny that I don't feel at all standoffish towards him, though it's the pain in my leg that prevents either of us to bond in this situation. He pulls out of the parking lot and drives onto the road. He rounds the park to a street that goes down an incline. Despite the stinging, I allow my eyes to catch a glimpse of the much larger house in this part of the neighborhood. My house surely was on a hill, or at the very least, on the rim of this valley we are now driving in. In no time, the man drives his SUV to a towering multi-storied house on the corner of a leveled street and a upward-sloping one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's driveway is short and a bit on the slope, but it soon becomes leveled once we are on the faded pink bricks that make up the driveway. He drive his truck into the now opened garage. By the looks of it, he recently moved in. He turns off his car and wastes no time getting himself and his dog out. He opens my door and pauses, probably to look over my body and the condition it's in. There is nothing much to look and stare at save for my wet legs, though I hope he's not thinking perverse thoughts in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to carry you again, for I have a lot of stairs in my house,\" he tells me. \"Is that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod in response and he carefully places his arms in the same places he support in order to lift me up from the wet ground at the park. I have to tuck myself tight in order not to hit my ankle on the dashboard, the side of the seat or the door. The man successfully lifts me from my seat and out of the car, but thinking my foot is safe from further harm, I untuck my body, causing my injured foot to reach out to the edge of the open door, sending stinging pain from my toes to my pelvis. \"Ahhh!\" I yelp out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"he asks as he stops to look at my face. My eyes widen as I see his face. Why am I so surprised?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Officially, when in class, his students would address him as Mr. Haynes. The guys who have taken a liking to him informally called him Coach, even though he had never coached any sports teams. The ladies would affectionately call him by his first name, Noah. He looks the same to me, though, he's a bit older, a bit more mature, but there is no mistaking his youthful face. It's no wonder why all the girls in P.E. class swoon at the sight of him. Seeing him with the eyes of a young woman, I'm sure at this very moment, I'm doing the same, though with a bit of silence on my part. I try to make an excuse as to why I pause. \"I hit my foot on the car door,\" I say with a bit of a giggle, but it is subdued with the throbbing pain in my ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggles with me and just the sound of it makes the pain go away. I don't want to say that his face is dreamy, but it feels just as it sounds. He walks me to the door, which is opened by the semi-wet dog. He then proceeds to climb two flights of stairs, passing the foyer and a couple doors to which I believe are bedrooms, and getting to a floor that sports a living room, a dining room and a kitchen, all connected to each other without the need for additional walls or doors. Save for a bathroom, the whole floor is one big room that combines three certain areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carries me to the couch, which he lays me down on, supporting my neck with a pillow and grabbing two more to raise my injured ankle. He tells me why he's doing what he's doing. \"I have to elevate your injury higher than your heart so we can ease the swelling. It's a good thing this looks fine, but just in case, we need it to be cold,\" he explains and disappears after he takes off the shoe on my afflicted foot. He comes back holding an unopened bag of frozen peas and without warning, places it on my ankle. The sheer cold causes me to moan, but I settle down after the pain starts to subside and eventually become numb after a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI relax as the Noah disappears to go downstairs, while the still semi-wet dog sits happily at my side. Outside, the rain continues to pour over the whole city, though it seems it pours buckets over the house compared to the droplets everywhere else. The dog nuzzles at my hand and I reach over to pet him and scratch him behind his ears. I speak to the dog, \"Thank you, boy. Without you, I wouldn't have gotten help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He returns the favor,\" Mr. Haynes says as he reappears with a large stack of towels. By the looks of it, he has discarded his wet clothes with dry ones. He returns with a pair of sweats and a darker-colored hoodie. \"Come on, boy,\" he says to the dog. The dog obeys him and allows itself to be dried with a towel, though, as dogs do, he shakes and twists his whole body around so he can get all the moisture that the towel couldn't absorb out, all at the cost of making the two of us humans wetter. As the dog runs off to do whatever dogs do, Noah speaks up. \"He's a rescued dog. I adopted him when my neighbor couldn't take care of him. This was when I was living in my roommates house. I could tell he was glad to be out of that home and under my care. I tell you, he has saved my life so many times. But enough about him, let's see how that ankle is doing. Can you sit up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and try to manage resting my back on the couch's large cushions and set myself upright. Noah, after grabbing an ottoman and sitting himself in front of me, removes the bag of peas and gently lifts my ankle off the pillows and onto his lap. His warm hands hold my foot, transferring his heat into the cold of my toes and sole. He also takes off my sock, which is drenched. He dries my foot with a towel and then gently pokes in certain places in order to get a response. He starts by poking the underside of my heel and I respond my tilting my head to one side and give him an expression telling him that it's mild and it's not painful. He moves to the inside part of my ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bite my lip, to which his asks, \"Any pain there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shake my head and tell him, \"Only a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe circles around to the front of my ankle, poking it with his thumb. I give him the mild expression, which he takes into consideration and then moves backwards to the back of my heel. He runs two fingers along the length of the hard part and again I give him the sign that it's only mild and doesn't hurt as much. He creeps sideways to the outer part of my ankle and I audibly moan and hiss. He traces underneath the flared portion and I clench at the cushions. \"So this is where it hurts?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" I simply say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's good news,\" he says, \"There is hardly any swelling and it's only located in one spot on your foot. All you would need is to keep your weight off the leg and you'll be fine. But considering it's raining outside and your house is probably much farther than where I found you, I have a way to treat this so it heals faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I have is appreciation for him and I say, \"Thank you, Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me. Heck, it's Dango here you have thanked already for finding you. Say, I didn't introduce myself,\" he responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already know who you are,\" I tell him from out of nowhere. He sports an inquisitive expression on his face. \"You used to be the P.E. teacher at Triumph High.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how do you know me?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a student in your class, in 2010,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah still looks puzzled. He gets to his feet, after gently placing my leg on the ottoman. He gestures to me with his hand to wait and he disappears again, possibly to retrieve something. I see him again as he brings back a bandage and a fastener as well as what looks like a brown jar of liquid. He sets his things down and positions his lap underneath my heel once more. \"That was my most memorable year, but also my last year at that school. I'm afraid I don't recognize you,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was expecting you didn't recognize me. I didn't really hang around after class nor said hello in passing,\" I tell him as he opens the bottle and let out a pleasant aroma. \"Coconut oil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah's puzzling look transforms to a grin. \"A tried and true substance with millions of uses. Let it become a paste and then you can use it as rubbing oil,\" he explains. He takes a dime-sized dollop of the slightly-opaque paste that looks like light green wax with two fingers and applies it to the affected area. He gently massages the oil into my skin, which is soothing despite the pain rising a bit as he touches the epicenter. I watch him as he becomes focused in treating me and I blush, though I catch myself getting attracted to him. I have to take a deep breath all while trying to stay quiet as the painful spot slowly subsides with the continued rubbing. I remove my hood due to myself getting hot, but it seems that the wetness acts similarly to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah carefully takes the bandage and wraps it around my ankle, my foot, and my lower leg to properly secured it and prevent it from moving too much. \"That should do it,\" Noah says, \"Now, you should be able to walk with little pain, but I suggest not going to the park in this weather or run on that foot.\" He backs up so he can set my foot down on the ground. Without warning, he pulls my arms so that I can stand on my own two feet, but I end up clutching to him as I pivot forward to much. Awkwardly, I push off of him so that I'm not in his personal space. \"That's alright. I think you might have to rest up and get into some dry clothes. Here's a towel.\" Noah hands me a towel so I can dry my skin. \"I should have some clothes in the boxes in the garage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain he leaves me to go downstairs. I try my hand at walking with my injury. There is slight pain, but the bandage prevents my foot or ankle from moving too much. I can only limp at a slow pace. The wet clothes on my body doesn't help much either. Fortunately, Noah does not take long and he comes back with a duffel bag of clothes. When I take some out, I'm surprised to find articles of clothing belong to a woman. Shirts, pants, shorts, skirts and even underwear. I give Noah a puzzling look as to why he, a man who lives by himself with his dog, would have women's clothes in his possession. He catches my look, takes a deep breath and tells me...what?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I pull out a bra and a small shirt from the bag, I'm lost for words. One, I'm glad that this man has clothes that are not oversized for me to wear, but two, why does he have them in the first place. \"They're my sister's clothes,\" he tells me. I give him a look that casts doubt on his sorry attempt at an excuse, but it's not an excuse. He begins to explain the reason. \"She used to live with me when I had my previous place. This particular bag was the one she took when she recently went camping with me and her boyfriend. One morning, I woke up alone in the tent and I find that she leaves this bag along with all the food in the coolers. It turns out she and her boyfriend eloped together, taking all their things and driving away. That's why I have it.\" His explanation doesn't seem plausible. He then adds, \"I just tossed in a box with my sister's name on it. I don't even think they've been washed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smell the clothes and discover the same musty smell on all of them. The smell isn't pungent like a man's, but it's there, as evidence. \"Ooh,\" I exclaim as I smell the clothes. \"I guess you're telling the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is a bathroom just right here,\" he tells me, pointing out a door that leads into a small bathroom right behind his flat-screen TV. \"Or if you need anymore privacy, there should be an empty bedroom with a mirror and a mattress downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just change in here,\" I say, gesturing my head towards the small bathroom. I grab a fresh towel and limp into the bathroom. After closing the door behind me, I turn on the light, revealing a plain white bathroom. I walk up to the sink and look at my beautiful self in the mirror. I take a deep breath, though blushing at the same time. \"Alright, Jocelynn. Just wait out the rain and you'll be out of this place in no time,\" I say to myself with a low voice. \"He's just a handsome guy who used to be your gym teacher. You never were attracted to him back then, anyways.\" Something in my stomach says otherwise, creating an atmosphere of awkwardness around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI proceed in taking off my drenched clothes, struggling to get my arms and my head out of the holes of the garments. Due to the wetness, there is added friction, making undressing difficult. I manage to get my hoodie and shirt off. I look at myself again in the mirror. I look at my breasts for the very first time. They are not overly big, though my chest isn't flat either. I observe with my hands, cupping both mounds of flesh. They are as big as my hands can fully cup them, though my fingers do not reach the base on all side. If I can compare, the overall size is like that of half a grapefruit, but not as hard. I can tell these are natural and there isn't any implants. Heck, when I was transformed, the previous figure didn't have any implants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach behind me to unlatch the hooks fastening my bra to my body. Once they are unhooked, I toss the bra aside and take a second to look at my breasts. I unwilling imagine the scene I had with Ricky after he had kissed me. I wonder, if I had been topless when I touched his dick, would he have not rejected me. When I think about Ricky, Noah's face takes its place and my mind immediately imagines me naked with the older man. I shake my head, trying to get the imagery out of my mind. I manage to do so, but resulting in dizzying myself a bit. \"What are you thinking, Jo?\" I ask myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door startles me. \"Miss, is everything all right?\" Noah asks from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine,\" I tell him. I take the towel and dry my top half before undressing my lower half. The shorts and panty, like the top garments, are a struggle to get off, even when I attempt to remove them without wetting the bandage around my ankle. Unlike last time, when I looked at myself in the mirror, I avoid looking at my full nakedness reflected in the polished glass. I immediately open the bag and start taking out clothes, wondering what I should wear. Aside from the undergarments, of which I find a bra with straps and one without plus two pair of thongs, I find an assortment of clothes that can be made into doable outfits. The theme I sense from this collection is summertime. All of these clothes can be worn outside on a hot sunny day, totally not suitable for the stormy weather outside. At least, they can be worn inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of all the clothes, what outfit do I put on?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I saw Noah for the first time and when I saw him in his casual homey clothes, I can't brush away the fact that I'm attracted to him. I can't help but think he was attracted to me in the same way. In the bag of clothes, I could find three different types of outfits. Convenient it was when they came out to be differing levels of how much I reveal my body. Noah has already seen my legs up to wear short shorts covered the rest and above it. Why give him the chance to be tempted? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne outfits I find in the bag is a satin nightie, like a teddy, that would reveal a whole lot of skin, including my arms, my back and even my chest. If I was in Noah shoes and looking at his eyes, I would be attracted to me, honestly speaking. The second outfit would cover up my shoulders, my back and chest, for the top would more or less be like a shirt with no sleeves. The second part of the second outfit is a skirt, which would cover up my thighs, but not my knees or lower legs. I would look cute in the outfit, but that could be another chance, although minor, for Noah to be attracted to me. The third option is a long-sleeved shirt and pants. The shirt, unlike my hoodie, does not have a hood and is made in a thinner, yet warm, fabric. The neck line drops just above my bust, which will most likely raise the shirt above the skin of my chest, but not significantly. The pants are skinny jeans, made to fit the form of a woman's lower portion. I'll be covered up, but the small prices to pay would be the overall shape plus the raising of the shirt for the top. Since I'm trying to be on the conservative side, I choose the latter outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI first put on the undergarments. Both are made of satin or velvet, which is gentle on my skin, but feels durable. The bra is the kind that pushes up my breasts instead of simply cupping them, which is another small price to pay. I just hope the shirt covers up the mishap. Secondly, I slip on the thong, which again, being made of the same material, is soft and gentle on my skin and as it meets with my crotch, gives it a bit of comfort, both in the feel and the security. Another small price to pay is the thin strip that will go in between my cheeks. I just hope the pants don't give that little detail away. I've already had a small number of prices to pay. I might end up becoming the kind of woman I don't want to be in front of Noah; the attractive and cute one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce my private areas are covered and supported, I put on the outer garments. I put on the shirt first and find that the neckline does sink lower, to just above my bust line, but the shirt is more tighter than looser. The neck line, instead of being raised with the pushing up of my breasts, tightens against the skin just below my throat. The price to pay here is how my breasts are sort of accentuated by the tightness of the shirt. The shirt actually creates a notable mound on my chest. At least my arms and back is covered. I move on to the jeans, which is a struggle to bring up due to my widen hips and bigger ass. But due to my injury and my wanting not to move my ankle too much, I put the seat and cover down on the toilet and sit down. I ease my injured leg first into the right pant leg and do the same with the left. I pull the top hem up to my knees before standing up and pulling the rest up, all the way to my waist. I find that they are a perfect fit, but with the outfit complete, I discover one more lost detail. The waist is okay for the pants, but with the shirt, I find that either the waist is low-cut or the shirt is too short at the bottom. A bit of my belly shows, but not enough to show my belly button. With the struggle I had to go through just to put the shirt and pants on, it's just something i have to live with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gather the rest of the clothes back into the duffel bag as well as gather my wet clothes on top and exit the bathroom. I find Noah coming up the stairs with a box in his hands. He sees me and compliments, \"Hey, that actually works for you.\" He turns into the kitchen and sets the box he's holding on one of the counters. He then comes back to ask me, \"Hey are you doing okay? If you want to rest or take a nap, you can use the bedroom I told you about before. I'll just get some covers from one of the boxes. Or, if you're hungry, I can order up some food since most of my stuff is still in coolers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I say in return?</span></div></div>",

I just want to help in repayment for saving me.\" I look into his face, watching for any change in mood. When he doesn't change in the ten seconds I wait for his response, I walk around him and make my way downstairs. I hear and sense him follow me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the garage, I find Dango the Shiba Inu sleeping next to a couch that sit on the back wall, opposite the door.  Around him are boxes stacked on top of each other. On some of the boxes, those that are mostly on the bottom, are label with large black letters that form the word \"FRAGILE.\" I figure they are the heavy ones and the ones that Noah doesn't want me to carry. I agree with the assumption due to my injured ankle. If I was to carry one, I would probably end up breaking the contents inside if I fall. I might even break something in my weak body as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pick small and medium boxes, but I'm saddened to find that most of them are too heavy for me to carry. I turn around and see Noah leaning on the doorway with a smug look on his face. \"What's so funny?\" i ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. I told you that I don't want you walking more than you have to. With all these boxes, you'll be doing a lot of careful walking,\" he says. \"It's funny seeing you trying to carry such a small, but heavy box. I don't know, it's cute.\" He walks over to me and takes me by the wrist and walks me back up to the floor above. Great, Jo, you've figured out a way to think you're cute, I say to myself in my mind. I was attempting not to be attractive, or at the very least, be cute, but in my attempt to help him, I've only help him realize that I'm the latter. Maybe I shouldn't help him, but then again, my generous soul doesn't want to leave all the work to him. I don't think the dog will help him. And him, living alone with no friends to help him. i'm his best offer if he ever takes it. Noah leads me into the kitchen, to the box that he had set down on the counter. \"I do need help unpacking. Just leave the heavy lifting or reaching to me.\" Before leaving, he pats my head, which is awkward. The funny gesture has got me blushing, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA box cutter sits on the counter, so I take it and push the switch so the blade is unsheathed. I cut open the box and find cans of food inside. Noah had told me that he needed help unpacking, but does he want me to fill the cupboards with them? It would help if he gave me his game plan for decorating his house. So instead of going out of my own way and do the task provided with no guidance, I just try to do the simple task of just unpacking. Using the space of the counter, I take out the cans and place them on the surface, further organizing them by food type and then by the varieties of that food type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah comes back with another box, which he sets down on the floor after seeing that his counter space has been used up. He opens the box that he carries up, which turns out to be plates of differing kinds. Some are decorative and only used to display and the rest are for putting food on them and eating off of them. \"Hey, I didn't catch your name,\" Noah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately tell him, \"Oh, it's Jocelynn, but Jo is fine.\" I find that the box that I've unpacked is empty, so I take it off the counter and toss it to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jo,\" he starts, \"you already know me as the P.E. teacher you had when you were at Triumph in 2010, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm,\" i agree. \"I think I was 16 then, my sophomore year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you already know my name then?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lie to him, knowing that his name is Noah, but changing it to something close. \"Nolan?\" I ask, attempting not to be the creepy girl from his physical education days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Noah, actually. I've had so many students, it's hard to remember their names. I don't recall seeing your name on my roster, then again, I have had a lot of students in my class,\" Noah explains. \"If you want, you don't have to address me as Sir or Mr. Haynes. Just Noah is fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Noah,\" I start, much like he did before with my name, \"Where did you want to put these?\" I show him the collection of canned food on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Jo, I didn't even notice you organized them,\" Noah says with apparent surprise on his face. \"Well, the pantry I believe is right here to the left of the fridge.\" He leads me to a door that's a foot away from the refrigerator. When he opens it, closet that is like a mini walk-in closet is revealed to be inside. The walls have shelves are varying heights mounted. \"Just fill the shelves as much as you can and I can do the higher stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do just that, carrying an armful of cans and being careful not to drop any on the floor as I carry them from the counter, around the kitchen island and to the open pantry. After just a couple trips, my pace starts to slow, but fortunately, Noah sees the struggle and drops whatever he's doing at the moment and helps me by letting stay at the pantry while he transports the cans over to me. I find just standing still and just using my arms is better than using an injured leg and arms to do work by myself. I get comfortable as one shelf begins to be filled. \"So Noah, what did you do after the P.E. teaching stuff?\" I ask out of the blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I was actually a temp gym teacher because another teacher was hospitalized. I was actually a temp for three years, can you believe that?\" he explains. \"I did it for the money, but since I was young, I related to the students I had. After that, I finished up school, worked my ass off at an apprenticeship at a hospital and landed a job as a physical therapist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Physical therapist? So that's how you're good at treating my ankle,\" I point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was good at finding the problem, but I owe it to my grandpa for showing me a good remedy,\" he tells me in response. He then redirects with the unpacking. \"I have another box of canned goods downstairs, but the good thing is that there's only one more. Just wait here and I'll bring it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe comes back and does me a favor and sets the box on the floor near the pantry. This time i won't have to do any unnecessary walking. Noah opens the box and we discover that there are bigger cans in here. Being the stronger one, Noah removes me from the pantry and does the heavy lifting of the bigger cans on a lower shelf. I gladly move out of the way and simply watch him use his strength to his job. As he works in emptying the box and filling up the pantry, I tell him, \"Thank your sister for me, you know, for the shirt and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles at the notion. \"If I knew where she was with her boyfriend, I would send her your regards, but i don't think she'll be coming back for that outfit. Not bad, by the way. A bit small---\" he tells me, but when he comments on the shirt, i cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" I say, \"At least it fits. So other than your sister, you have any family around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't say a word as he puts large can of food onto the shelf. He stares at the can, as if reminded of something. What does he tell me?</span></div></div>",

My sister, i don't know where she is after she eloped with her boyfriend. My grandpa, though, lives in a nursing home a couple miles away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body immediately considers something ominous about his family. More specifically regarding the missing members. I even notice his body language change ever so slightly, as if he is expecting the question I'm about to ask. Carefully, I ask him, \"How about you mom and dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah takes a deep breath and stands up straight and removes himself from the pantry. He walks over to the counter where I'm leaning against and leans against the space next to me. He takes another deep breath and begins explaining to me his family situation. \"My mom, she died when I was in high school,\" he starts. \"My dad took it the hardest and drove him to alcohol. He got to drunk that he couldn't take care of the two of us on his own, so he committed suicide. My sister was the one to witness it. I was 17 at the time, while she was 13. We were orphans. Fortunately, my grandpa adopted us, stayed with him until I was 21.\" He pauses and in the silence, I dare not mess with the mood and say anything that could break his current reverie. He pushes himself off the counter and walks over to a box that he had recently put down near the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opens the box's flaps and proceeds to take out its contents, sets of dinner plates taped together for security. As he sets them down on the  now empty counter, I pick this moment to ask him, \"You mentioned you had your own place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes another deep breath, one out of relief rather than anticipation. It's as if telling me his life story was a sort of release. \"Although my grandpa would have kept me at his place, I felt I needed my own place. After inheriting my parents financials at 18 and using that along with financial aid to get me through general education for three years, I left my grandpa's place and found a room with a couple of roommates. Kinda like you,\" he explains. I walk over to the opened box and assist in removing the plates and glasses from inside it. \"After a while, just to bolster my savings, since I didn't like to use my parents' money, I got a job at the high school at 25.\" Noah starts to break the tape securing the plates and with no sense of organization, randomly places sets into the cupboard. \"So, how's your family situation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do I tell him exactly?</span></div></div>",

And maybe until I've helped you unpack. And I'll tell you about my situation.\" We continue to fill up the cupboard as well as unpack items from various boxes. Not one moment do I feel any strain or pain in my ankle. A bit at times, but not too much that it would cause me to cry out. Along the process, the anal in me points out various things about organization to Noah. For examples, since he randomly put plates with glasses in one section, I point out that all plates and dishes should go in one section while the glasses take up their own section in another cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't one to organize,\" he tells. \"I try to be neat at work, but at home, I'm lazy and messy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" I agree with him. \"So physical therapist? You do work with rehabilitation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially so,\" he responds. \"I hope to work with athletes who have had injuries and help them back to competing again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy intuition catches something that probably would go unnoticed if I was a guy. \"You sound like you're speaking from experience,\" I mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I've seen injuries like yours most often. Actually, it's only since recently when I've been using that oil to help with the pain and treatment,\" he explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy intuition catches another thing and I do not wait until it is out of my mind to say it. \"Let me guess, you had the same injury,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs as he is caught by me. With a handsome giggle, he tells me, \"Yeah. Just with the other foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur work together moves down to the garage, where one particular box is sitting by itself, away from the other off to the other side. By now, Dango has woken up and is eager for us to open this certain box. His name is written on the outside with big letter. Noah opens it, revealing all sorts of items for the Shiba Inu. From what I can see, there are many toys scattered about and even a soft bed big enough for the dog. I toss the toys to Dango, catches a few with his mouth and then carries them to the corner. He neatly piles them together and comes back to retrieve his bed, which he drags as well to his chosen corner. He even puts some toys into the bed as well. The items left remaining in the box is a heavy bag of dog food, probably new since it's unopened. Neat to it are two bowls, one with \"WATER\" written on the side and another with \"GRUB.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take out the bowls and set them down next to Dango's bed. When I go back to the box, I find that Dango has picked up his GRUB bowl and set it down next to the box. \"I think Dango is hungry, Jo,\" he says, finally adding my name. I don't know, but my name has a nice ring to it when he says it. \"You can open that bag if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do just that and pull apart the seams of the bag and proceed to pour the contents, brown kibbles and bits, into the bowl that Dango has carried to my feet. Once the bowl is filled, though, Dango just sits there, though there is an atmosphere of anticipation around the dog. \"I though you were hungry, boy,\" I say to the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has to thank you first,\" Noah says. \"Get on your knees before him and hold our your hand. When he puts his paw on your hand, say, 'You're welcome,' and then he'll start eating. Go on, try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kneel down to one knee, the one that's part of the uninjured leg and then I drop my other knee down. I feel a slight throbbing sensation in my ankle, but it's nothing major. I hold out my hand to the dog and he lifts his paw and sets it down on my palm. I say, \"You're welcome, Dango,\" and the dog begins eating from his bowl with warning. I laugh and giggle at how amazing it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing how much he likes you, Jo,\" Noah tells me. \"He's not one to flat-out obey a stranger. Most people can't even get him to lift a paw for a handshake without me doing it for them.\" I pet the dog on the head and caress the fur on its back. \"Him eating has got me starving. Are you hungry? I can get us some take out. Just keep Dango company and play with him if you want. Just don't push yourself and that ankle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I tell him. I take a seat on a folding chair and watch Dango as he finishes his bowl. Noah opens the garage door and leaves promptly, the rain still hammering silently on everything outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dango is finish, he picks up his bowl and sets it down next to his water bowl. He then picks up his water bowl and carries it back to me. With his cute face, he looks up at me after setting his bowl down on the ground. With those beady, black eyes, my intuition tells me that he's thirsty and he's asking in the most polite way. I get up and look for a pack of water. After finding out, I remove a single bottle of water and open it, pouring the clear, transparent liquid into his bowl. Again he waits for me to accept his thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain I go down on my knees and hold out my hand. He again, places his paw on my palm, and after I shake it and say, \"You're welcome,\" he goes to his bowl and starts drinking up all the liquid. Once he's done, he brings his bowl back to where he got it and take a toy from his bed. He brings it back and places it on my lap. It turns out to be a carrot, but instead of the hard and crunchy kind, this variant is the soft and squeaky kind. The happy dog waits for me to do something with it. I stand up and toss the toy to the other side of the garage. A smile forms on my face as the dog turns and dashes for the toy as it lands on the floor in the far corner. I'm glad for his agility, as he dodges a few boxes placed here and there. He brings it to me. \"Good boy,\" I tell him and proceed to throw the toy in different places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I accidentally throw it to the side where the door is open, the toy then bounces into the driveway. He trots over, but stops right as he gets to the threshold of the door. He whimpers and looks behind him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, Dango,\" I apologize. \"Because of me, your toy is wet.\" I reach for the end of the toy and pull it out of the puddle it landed in. When it hangs from my two fingers, the end of the carrot drips with water. I find a random clothespin lying around and tie it to a random string hanging in the garage. \"We have to let it dry before you play with it again.\" I close the garage door and take Dango upstairs with me. \"Do you watch TV, Dango?\" When asked, he nods his head. I sit myself on the couch and turn on the TV. Dango takes his place right next to me, even putting his big, fluffy body on my lap. I don't protest, as his fur so soft that I have no ill thoughts of his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, Dango's ears pop up in response to the sound of the garage door opening. It closes again, but Dango does not move an inch. We both see Noah coming up the stairs with two bags of what looks like take out. What has he brought?</span></div></div>",

To move out of the way, Dango hops off of my lap and trots over to Noah, who greets him, \"Hey, boy, how you doing?\" I round the bed, limping as I go and see Dango, happily sitting down next to his owner. He looks back at me with a bared-teeth smile, with his tongue hanging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA contented sort of smile appears on my face, which Noah notices as he takes out what looks like a bucket. \"Fried chicken?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, but since I didn't know what you prefer, so I got both grilled and fried,\" he tells me. \"Seems like you two are enjoying yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look down at the dog, who looks back up at me. \"We're enjoying what we can. With my ankle and all, I can't do what I want in terms of running with Dango, but we're getting by,\" I tell Noah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he takes out the sides which are packed in smaller containers, he mentions, \"I still don't get why Dango has taken a liking to you so well. He's either too shy or confrontational towards strangers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he's being protective of me. He did run off to look for me in the park, right?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the first time he's ever done that. He usually sticks to me and never runs out unless it's important,\" Noah mentions. \"I guess you're more important to him than I am to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that,\" I defend Noah. I notice that he's not getting any plates out, ceramic or paper or otherwise. I also notice that there are boxes on the table as well. \"Aren't we sitting at the table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Noah says. \"Since you shouldn't be on your feet, you need to rest on the couch, while I bring you your table and your food. Dango, will you escort Jo back to her seat?\" Dango barks in affirmation and gets on all four paws, brushes his bushy tail against my leg and leads me back to the couch. I take my seat and like a knight or bodyguard, Dango hops up and lays his head on my lap, keeping me seated. Noah brings over a table, but he doesn't set it down before me just yet. Instead, he brings over the ottoman and sets my feet on it. He then brings the table as close as he can to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To me, Ricky has always been athletic and when he goes to the gym, he comes back home fatigue, almost on the verge of giving up. Lately, he's been more of a party-goer and is starting to lose his muscle tone and gain a beer belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's seems doable,\" Tyrone says and gestures Sonny to step up. \"I'll slap you with a muscular body!\" A firm slap is deliver, but unlike Sonny, he stays on his feet. This is all due to the tone in his legs, which becomes more prominent as I observe him from where I'm standing. Before our eyes, the beer belly starts to shrink and in its place, a six-pack and pronounced pectoral muscles. Sonny's arms beef up and he flexes his arms to show off the curves and firmness of his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Tyrone. That glove is amazing. Thank, bro,\" Sonny says as he steps back, probably to give me room if I do step up to Tyrone and ask him to give me something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyrone sees the gap between him and Sonny and he then turns to me. \"Believe me now, Cesar?\" he asks. \"So, do you want next?

No homo of course,\" Ricky, the tall guy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want me to make you a woman?\" Tyrone asks for the final time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" I say with an unusual confidence.

Shouldn't be too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Here goes,\" Tyrone says. Out of blue and without warning either, he lifts his hand to slap across my face while saying, \"I'll slap the man out of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel the full hand, palm, finger and even his nails included, strike my cheek hard and I try to balance myself so I would fall over.

I suddenly don't know who I was or anybody else or where I lived before the change. It seems my old self was thrown away to be forgotten and the only memory I have is that I used to be a man who for some reason, is a woman at this current time. I don't even know if there was something external that made me a woman. I just know that now I'm a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up from what seems to be a short slumber or power nap, since I feel somewhat rejuvenated after opening my eyes. I'm naked, laying on a bed of white. The mattress is white as well as the pillow under my head and the sheets covering my lower half. My top half, which is my back is exposed for anyone in the room to see. That's when it hits me. They could be someone in the room with me. I sit up, mindful to grab the sheets and cover myself as I sit up. Once my upper body is vertical, I try to look around the room to see if there is another human present with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm only distracted by the hair that falls over my face. I have to take the wayward locks and tuck them behind my ears and the longer ones behind my back, which in turn, tickles it a bit. Once the hair is out of my face, I find that there isn't anyone around. I look out the window and find a quaint backyard, bathed in afternoon light, filling the room with an orange glow. I find no shame in uncovering myself as I get out of the bed to go over to the dress and look at myself. I'm very pretty and downright attractive it seems. I remember myself being an Asian before and before me, staring back at me, is an Asian woman. Short, petite in some places, generously curvy in other areas, with a brunette-auburn mane to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy attention turns to my breasts, which are no doubt bigger than what the average size for breasts are for Asians. To the touch, they are natural, more fleshy than firm, but with the resilience of memory foam. Just squeezing them gives me a pleasurable sensation. I hold the two melons on my chest in one arm, covering the sensitive tips, as I go back to the bed and sit on it with my legs folded at either side of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an amazing view,\" a male voice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is this man who suddenly makes his presence known?</span></div></div>",

In a blink of an eye, I suddenly recall everything about myself, the photographer and the current environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages in my mind are actually professional-grade photos of me posing for the camera, the general them of implied nude, which is apparently nude, but not exposing the areas that would make the photos lean more to the erotic side of the spectrum. I remember myself as a model, who already has a portfolio of a year's work under my belt, most of the material taken by the very photographer snapping pictures of me right at this very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's actually a very good friend of mine, whom I used to know and briefly went out with him back in high school. After graduation, we went our separate ways, but got back after a couple years to mutually benefit each other. I get publicized and get my name out there and he in turn sells top-of-the-line pictures of me as his model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis current scene we are shooting is at my house, in my bedroom. The theme of the scene is more spontaneous and more akin to what a pervert would take if he had the opportunity to take pictures of a naked woman waking up and fondling herself with her knowing of his presence. It's just that the photographer, whose nickname is Goose, has spoiled the scene by speaking up. Now he's caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe puts down his camera since taking shots of me obviously looking at his lens is not part of the scene. I give him a disappointed look which causes him to apologize. \"I know, I know, I'm sorry. No talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shoot back at him, \"You just had to ruin it, Goosey. You know, this isn't going to work. I'm out of my element right now!\" I have no idea why I'm furious at him and it seems to me that I'm lashing out at him pretty hard. In my ticked-off state, I storm off the bed, covering my breasts and donning the black satin robe that I've hung on the coat rack near the bathroom door. I enter the bathroom and stand at one of the sinks, looking straight into the mirror. I breathe a sigh of relief, myself not knowing the external cause, but noticing something is off with me. I just don't know what at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Goose do?</span></div></div>",

He is handsome and attractive and somehow, just him being there has me excited and nervous at the same time. In a blink of an eye, I suddenly recall who he is. The first scene is me literally running into him on a jog. This sparked a relationship that grew into friendship and later into significant other. Without thinking, I recall everything he likes, everything he dislikes as well as secrets that we've kept for years. The next scene is him on his knee while we're in the main intersection of a farmer's market. A flash mob of friends and family surround us and I even remember a hired band that plays our favorite song. Not long after that I'm crying before him as he recites his vow and we kiss after being wedded in a grand chapel. I even recall when it was. It was exactly one year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next second after seeing him leaning against the door's frame, I query him. \"Honey! You're back? Sooner than later?\" I ask him, obvious that I'm surprised by his sudden appearance. I recall that for a week he was out of town on a business trip. Being a housewife, and remembering all of the day's events, I vowed to watch and maintain the house while he was gone. Him seeing me naked in this type of position could have him assume I was having fun on my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left early, got on an early-morning flight and rushed home,\" he says, entering the room, putting his suitcase down by the door, closing it with his foot. \"Now, baby, why have I found you here, naked on our bed?\" He closes the distance between us and takes a seat right beside me on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I took a little nap.... without my clothes on,\" I stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe speedily leans me towards his lap and plants a passionate kiss on my lips. \"What a fucking lie,\" he accuses with a giggle. \"You know what I think? I think a week was much too long of a time away from me and on the very last day, you started to miss me, weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\" I start, but trail off, not having any good excuse to say right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI yelp due to him suddenly taking my naked body into his arms. \"You're a bad liar, baby. But it's okay, I'm here now,\" he says, taking a seat once again, myself seated sideways on his lap. He gives me another passionate kiss, which I return with equal fervor. I wrap my arms around his broad shoulders as if I'm desperate for comfort and closeness. He pulls me off his lips to speak and I'm left with a compromised look on my face. \"I forgive you though. It seems your beautiful body remembers our anniversary, remember our honeymoon last year.\" I quietly go for his tie and with no warning, undo it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does this husband of mine do?</span></div></div>",

All I know for sure is that I was a man before and now I'm a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat distracts me from my reverie of what I used to be and what I am now is a movement across my naked female body. It's a hand, the actual size of it I'm not quite sure. The hand glides across the front of my torso and nestles itself in the valley between my breasts. The arm connected to it rests on my stomach and my side and I feel like I'm a life-sized teddy bear with no fur, only flesh. This unfamiliar presence, which is weight right behind me as I lay on my side in this bed is not at all uncomfortable. It's rather pleasurable to say the least. With its warmth added with the heavy blanket that cover the both of us, plus the soft and firm qualities of the mattress below us and the pillows underneath our heads, I can honestly say, I can stay like this forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when I feel some differences.

Where ink would be is just scarred tissue now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the siren goes off. At first, it's low and seems to be far away, but after a few seconds the sirens do another round and it seems this time, the siren is right outside the window. I look up at the man and suddenly his eyes widen and like his instinct, glances at me, catching me watching him. \"You're awake already?\" the man says. His voice is rough, but for some reason, it doesn't bother me. \"Anyway we have to go.\" He pushes himself up and I find that he does it like it's a struggle, despite his body being very fit and muscular. I lift my head so that he can have his arm back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I speak, asking, \"Wait, what's going on? What's the siren for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnusually, he finds the questions horrifying. \"No, not you too!\" I sit up in the bed with a puzzled expression on my face all while covering myself with the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA radio is heard coming from a satchel placed on the side table. The man goes for it, pulling out a walkie-talkie. He turns up the volume dial and a voice is heard from it. \"Briggs! Come in! Bogeys sighted in Rift One-Niner-Theta. Get yourself and Sierra to bunker 16!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No go, Wedge. Sierra just woke with symptoms of AMNI. I'm going without her. Get a tech over here to escort her to Central!\" the man says. I'm guessing his name is Briggs and my name is Sierra, though they could possibly be callsigns. The man efficiently dons a BDU in Atacs camouflage from the  floor and puts the walkie-talkie back into his satchel. From the corner of the room near the bathroom door and the door to the rest of the house, he pulls out a case, shaped like it could store a gun. He opens it and takes out a gun with a bullpup style that I haven't seen before. He puts the case away and turns to me. \"Stay here, whoever you are. Somebody will come and escort you to a safe place before---\" he tells me, but an ominous boom from outside interrupts him. He doesn't give me another look and just exits the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this as my chance to get some answers, I get out of bed, unashamed that I'm currently naked in the room and go to the window. I pull aside the curtain to see a rather apocalyptic scene before me. I'm in a house that is within what looks to be a town or isolated community of residences, both houses and apartments. What makes the landscape different is the many sentry towers as well as dome-like structures that are foundations for massive cannons, which are targeted towards  the sky. The nearest one is several years from what looks to be the house's backyard. This is when I see Briggs, the man I found in the bed with me, dashing for the bunker, which has a faded number of 16 on the side. In an instant, a ball of blue fire emerges from the thin fog and lands in the very area where I saw Briggs running. For some reason, a tear falls from my eye and I do not attempt to wipe it from my cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ensuing explosion is bright and almost blinds me and I step back, reeling from the light. This is when somebody from behind pulls me back and throws me on the bed, onto my back. I look up and see a gun trained at my face and I instinctively freeze. Who is it that has pinned me down?</span></div></div>",

The next thing I notice is the floor underneath me. It's similar to a wrestling mat with the right amount of firmness and the right amount of softness. I open my eyes to see a black woman with a long ponytail looking down at me. \"She's awake!\" she says and looks over at two other girls seated against padded walls. One looks like she's Caucasian and shortest in stature and the other looks Hispanic. For some reason, they look familiar to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push myself up and the black girl assists me to a sitting position. \"What's going on?\" I ask. Beyond the walls, all I hear is low boom which could be explosions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just another raid. At least, they tell us it's a raid. The five of us are here because we were found with symptom of AMNI, which is just another way of saying we have amnesia and can't remember any event before today,\" the black girl explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of five persons, I look for the fifth. A deep female voice speaks right behind me, alerting me to the fifth's presence. \"They're going to sit us down, one-on-one to figure out what we know,\" she says. Her phrasing is a bit unusual and it seems she means is 'what we 'remember.' Her next phrase tells us otherwise. \"We don't have amnesia. We are not the people people say we are. I, to be honest, am from the Rift!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door on the wall in the direction I'm currently facing bursts open, and in comes men dressed in uniforms of various camouflages, with vests of various shapes and sizes, with guns of that bullpup futuristic look. They all come in and point their guns towards my direction and without warning, pull their triggers. The expected bang from the guns isn't heard and instead, all I hear is somewhat like projectiles flying fast through air. Fortunately, I'm not hit by anything, though I do feel the air being displaced around me. When the dust settles, or in this case, when the chaos dies, we find the woman spouting nonsense behind me has been shot with hook like projectiles which seem to stun her into submission, leaving her writing on the padded floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of us left unscathed allow the men to approach and carry the woman out of the room.

I turn around and see the younger man lean himself on the wall nearest the door. I just stand where I stop walking, my hands wrenching themselves in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say you call yourself Cesar. Any reason why you have a man's name?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face must have showed that I'm just as stumped as he is, for I respond, saying, \"No clue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know nothing about what we call Rifts?\" he continues with the questions. I shake my head, choosing to keep my mouth shut. \"Well, I don't know if you know the times, but seeing you have symptoms of AMNI, I guess I should fill you in on what it's all about. The first sign of AMNI was actually a violent case. We were attacked by the force that occasionally raids the surface by the first recorded Rift. You could say it was the opening of a black hole that swallowed half the moon and sent the rest crashing down on the planet. We don't know what caused it, but ever since they started showing up, a portion of the population were stricken by bouts of amnesia. Entire days to even whole lifetimes of memories were lost and in ten percent of those that had AMNI, memories were replaced with violent visions that caused some of us to turn on our fellow humans. Much like that one woman we took out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a reason for the ... Rifts?\" I ask during his pause from speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are theories. We try to capture prisoners from the beings who attack us, but seeing we have no ways of communicating with them, efforts to gain intel are useless. Most are just crazed aliens willing to kill themselves in order to kill many others,\" he explains what I would call a professional answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think?\" I ask again, emphasizing 'you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looks at me, lifting his head as if my answer was a relief of the stressful day he must have had. He pushes himself off the wall and points his hand toward the door on the opposite wall. I look over and see it. He goes over and opens the door, politely letting me enter first into the dimly lit room. He flips a switch, which turns on rows of lights in what looks like an observation deck. As the lights finish turning on, the windows open up as well, as reinforced blinds lift up to show the exterior. The deck is situated on a ridge that overlooks the village as well as the towers and bunkers. All is calm and there is no attack at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy feet seem to move on their own volition and lead me to a bench situated at the end of the room, near the middle section of windows. I take a seat and sense the man following me, taking a seat on the opposite end of the bench. He finally answers my question. \"I can think of nothing that would have caused these alien to start attacking us. They are not to blame. My reasoning is that we are the ones to blame, but we don't know for what reason. Whatever happened, it was the Rifts that brought them here. They must be the reason who people are getting AMNI nowadays.\" He pauses, getting up to look out one of the windows. He turns and lean on the window sill. \"If you don't remember being Sierra or who she was to Briggs, then what do you remember? You said you named yourself Cesar. How would that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" I start, pausing just to attempt to recall anything. \"I guess you can say I was a man in my past life, named Cesar. The other girls were probably my friends, that's why we call ourselves by those names we have. I think...\" I trail off, attempting to think and recall any kind of memory in my brain. This has me getting up and walking over to very window sill the man is leaning against. I look out the window and suddenly a vision flashes before my eyes. \"Did you see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what?\" the man asks, alerted. \"What did you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A glove,\" I simply say, my eyes still close as I meditate on the vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of glove?\" the man asks, keeping the line of communication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like a regular glove, like those used for baseball,\" I explain and begin to see a scene materialize itself in my mind. \"I see... a living room... hardwood floors... a swimming pool outside... Sonny, Ricky, and Tyrone was there. Sonny was always the short guy, Ricky our go-to Hispanic dude and Tyrone the mastermind. Tyrone had the glove on his hand.... he slapped Sonny and his fat was replaced by a muscular toned body. He slapped me next. I think it was me who requested him to turn me into a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" the man speaks up. \"This glove. By what you are saying, it somehow took something away, leaving behind a result. What did Tyrone say? Did he utter a command or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did. To take away Sonny's fat figure, I think he said he would slap the fat out of Sonny. When he took away my male self, I think he said he was slapping the man out of me,\" I explain, the words and audio from the scene somehow being given to me by some unknown force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we have the answer now, but we have to verify it with your friends,\" the man tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo we go back right away or is there something else that needs to be said?</span></div></div>",

I lift my hand to put pressure on it and fortunately it relieves it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I open my eyes again, I can now hear with my ears the voices around me. The atmosphere is loud and I can barely hear the people talking to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, are you okay?\" a black girl says to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took a hard fall, there, Miss,\" the man says to me. \"We'll need to put you someplace more comfortable to rest.\" Without any warning, the man lifts my small frame into his arms and for the first time, I can see my surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere am I exactly?</span></div></div>",

Could it be me or the hormones? Anyways, what's more important is the place I'm currently in right now. No longer am I in a house and for some reason I have a vague recollection of a bungalow. I have yet to recall if I lived there alone or if somehow my male persona lived there. I'm not longer in that place. Now I'm being carried down a hallway of a school. The hallways are packed with boys and girls and from the look of their faces, I can tell I'm in a high school. And it's a public one too. No matching uniforms. Everyone is allowed to wear their own particular style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor me, I'm wearing skinny pants of tan khaki fabric, with black sneakers on my feet. On my torso is either a blouse or baggy T-shirt. I'm not exactly sure. It seems to fit me, but the neck of the garment seems to be bigger than an actual shirt. Before I can deduce what it exactly is, we turn a corner and I look up at a sign, wincing a bit due to the sunlight entering the large windows, and give a slight sigh of relief. The destination was for the nurse's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black girl from earlier comes into view and opens the door for us and the guy carrying me carries me in. We find the immediate area, which houses a wall with files cabinets lining every inch of it while on the opposite wall, chairs line every inch of it. A desk sits sort of in the middle of the room, with two arm chairs in front of it. Opposite the door we came into is another door, probably to the back room, where the beds are kept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nurse!\" the black girl calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the Nurse comes out from the back room, a roll of bandages in her hand. She at once sees me and judging by her expression, I assume she thinks my ailment or whatever got me her int he first place is a terrible one. \"Oh, come in and put her on a bed, but just put her on a bed. You can't stay,\" the nurses says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're her---\" the black girl protests, but is quickly shut down by the nurse. In the meantime, the guy places me on the nearest bed and the mattress and pillow immediately give me comfort. The soreness and the pain in my head causes me to close my eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know. Classmates. Friends. Family even. But you'll have time to visit her during break. I'll need you two to run off to class now,\" the nurse says with confident authority. I don't remember anything else she says due to myself passing out due to fatigue and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I come to, what time of the day is it?</span></div></div>",

The nurse sits with him on the bed. From what I can hear, the conversation seems to be personal, as if they know each other. The deviant part of my mind assumes they have a fling with each other, but that notion is thrown out the window when I hear the words 'Mom' and 'Dad' used honorably by the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse looks up and sees me watching them from my bed and immediately wipes the saddened look on her face and gets up to go over to me. \"Hey, how are you doing?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing okay, I guess,\" I say with my gentle female voice. Somehow this is new to me, having never heard my voice like this. I hide the fact that I don't recollect anything other than the fact that I'm a girl who had an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you fainted when you came to class. Do you remember eating breakfast or drinking anything before coming to school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the time when I disclose my amnesia to the nurse. \"Actually, I don't remember how I came to school. I actually don't remember where I live or where this school is,\" I explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit of amnesia then. It's weird, there had been three other cases like yours. All of them girls like you. It's strange, but that girl that brought you in, she was one of those cases. She doing fine and seems to remember everything now. Maybe it'll be the same for you,\" she reassures me. Seconds after she finishes her sentence, the boy in the back gets up and tries to walk past the nurse. The nurse notices his escape and grabs him by the arm. I notice his fists, both of them being bandaged; the one of the right having patch of blood soaking through the white fabric. \"Where do you think you're going? If you're going out to get lunch, then you're leaving school.\" The nurse gets up and escorts the boy back to his bed in the back. As she does so, she continues to talk to him, loud enough that I can hear. \"You need to rest to heal your knuckles. You'll know what Mom and Dad will do when they hear about your recklessness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the boy only glares at her and abruptly turns his head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse breathes out a sigh and comes back to my bed. She apologizes, \"Sorry about that. That's my little brother. He flunked his senior year and has to take it again. He came in while you were out due to a fight during passing period. But enough about him, are you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit, yeah,\" I tell the truth. It seems the level of hunger I have is due to myself not having breakfast before coming to school and spending four periods of class without a bite to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what. I'm going to leave campus to buy the three of us food. Can you help me with my brother? He tends to break out of this room like it's a prison,\" she tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI visibly gulp a bit of saliva and glance at the tough exterior and bloodied fists of the boy at the back of the room. \"Okay,\" I say with little confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. He's more rougher the guys than the girls, just make sure he doesn't leave your sight, okay?\" she asks to which I give a nervous nod. Her smile when she leaves the room seems to reassure me though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listen and hear the nurse leaving the office, closing the door behind her. This is when, as expected, the nurse's brother gets up and goes for the door. Obeying the nurse, I reach out for his arm and successfully stop him in his tracks. What do he do next?</span></div></div>",

It's when I pull him towards the bed when he loses control and accidentally pulls too hard, taking me with his arm. I lose my balance (mostly due to no food in my stomach) and in a sudden move, I send up falling to the floor with my head hitting the leg of the bed hard. I'm knocked out cold and enter a dark, yet brief slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I come to, I find myself in the bed again, a cool ice pack wrapped in a face towel on my forehead. \"Rise and shine, girl,\" the voice of the nurse says. I open my eyes to find the nurse sitting on the side of the bed, smiling down on me. I look across to the opposite bed and find the nurse's brother fast asleep with his back facing us. \"Don't mind him. He sometimes loses control when he doesn't get his own way. You've slept for a long while there. It's clearly an hour past the end of school. Can I ask, do you know where you live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to recall, but somehow there is a block preventing me to getting a single memory. Just trying to get past the block causes my head to hurt and I wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh, don't worry. This has happened before. As your guardian for now, I think it'll be best if you stay with me. No one has asked for you since school ended, so I'm guessing your parents don't pick you up from school and the best assumption is that you walk to school. I'll have to get your file and make sure you know who you are. In the meantime, you'll have to stay at my place, unfortunately, he'll be there too.\" The nurse points to the boy on the other bed. \"I hope you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we?\" the nurse says, getting up and urging me up my feet as well. He goes over to her brother and slap him across the back of his head. \"Hey, kid, this ain't your room. Get up! We're going home.\" The boy angrily wakes up, but once he sees me in my wakeful state, he dials down and apologetically bows his head toward me. The nurse slaps the boy again while saying, \"You're supposed to say you're sorry, kid!\" I smile and giggle a bit at the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse escorts us out of the schools grounds, where I see where the school is located. It's on top of a hill overlooking a beautiful city. Far away, near what looks like a harbor or bay, is the downtown commercial area. In between the hillside school and commercial district is green residential area. I get into the nurse's car and she drives us down the hill and down some streets to....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does the nurse live?</span></div></div>",

The purpose was to clean up this school with strategies and views from a different perspective. I don't know how it was in the school you attended in the past, but I'd like to gather your thoughts so that this school can become prominent again. And it should start with Mr. Samuels. He's this close to being a high school dropout, picking fights with underclassmen and being an outright bully to everyone else.

I would have fallen to the floor again if it weren't for the nurse's quick reflexes. \"You must be starving there,\" the nurse mentions as she helps me get into a balanced position. \"Come on, let's go. The sooner you get home, the sooner you'll get some food in your stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us leave in a hurry, leaving the school grounds and into the nurse's car in the faculty parking lot. She drives down the slopes driveway that connects the school to the main street below. The school is, after discovering the landscape around it, at the top of a hill overlooking the whole city where it resides. In  the distance looks like a bay or coastline, where the city's downtown commercial district is located. Between that and the school are more residential areas and the height of the buildings shrink to just a few stories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive to the dorm is pretty short by car and we find that a gate separates the complex where the dorm is located from the outside. The nurse presses a button which allows the door to slide away and give enough space for the car to drive through. I give a puzzled look, to which the nurse explains. \"You know I used to live here when I was going to this school. My mom and dad used to leave on extended business trips, probably like your parents. I'm glad I still have this remote. It seems they didn't change the frequency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car enters and after giving the nurse the building number, she drives into the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems a lot for the nurse to do this for me. A token of my gratitude could be given. What kind of token of gratitude do I give the nurse?</span></div></div>",

When you're able, come to my office,\" he tells me and turns on his heel and walks out of the door. I take one step in front of the other and find that I'm not fatigued at all. Maybe a bit sore in places, but all in all, my mobility is fine. I skip to the door and find the foot of the principal take a right down the hallway. I follow him silently, walking down two flights of steps and several hallways before getting to what looks like the front of the school. I get within paces of the door that has \"Principal Mr. Dean\" engraved on the mostly-opaque glass when someone grabs me by the arm. I try to jerk my arm free, but the grip on my arm is too strong. I look and see that it's a student, awfully taller than me with the body of a runner. He has a band around his arm that vaguely says \"Hall Monitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing during class hours?\" he aggressively asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her go, Sinclair. I asked her to come to my office,\" the familiar voice of Mr. Dean is heard behind me. I turn around and see him standing in his doorway. \"Come on, boy. What do I say on how to treat a lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall boy named Sinclair (possibly his last name) lets me go at Mr. Dean's command and allows me to walk towards Mr. Dean. He enters his office while propping the door open for me to enter in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a seat,\" Mr. Dean says and gestures to a pristine leather chair in front of his desk. \"Victor Dean is acid-engraved on a acrylic prism that sits in the very center of his desk. \"What I want to inform you is that we do have a file for you. My secretary has gone through the trouble is retrieving it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm a student at this school?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transfer student in fact. The district allows a few to enroll due to various reasons,\" he tells me and opens a folder he has on his desk in front of him. \"Your parents are overseas and has sent you to finish your last semester here at this school. Here, have a look.\" He closes the folder and hands it over to me. I place it down on the empty space on the desk right in front of me and open the folder. Once I see my mugshot, I get lightheaded all of a sudden. In a few painful seconds, all my memories return to me. I now remember my name, which is Jocelyn Bautista, and I'm a transfer student at this high school, finishing my last semester of my senior year. According to the file, which matches perfectly with my memories, I just transferred today and was on my way to my first class when I suffered a headache in one of the upper floor hallways. Through the flood of images and voices, I can hear Mr. Dean call out to me, \"Miss Bautista, are you alright? Do I need to send for the nurse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get a hold of myself, but only barely. In only a few seconds, I have remembered the more vivid moments though they are too many to count or list in one sitting. Even though I hear Mr. Dean, I don't respond. Calmly, without being alarmed, he gets up from his seat and rounds the desk. I can barely see through blurry eyes, but someone, which possibly could be the dean, gets me to my feet and walks me to the door. I only recall making it halfway up the first flight of stairs when my vision completely blurs to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know how long I'm out but when I come to, I find myself back in the nurse's office, laying on the very same bed that I found myself on the first time. But I'm not alone and I can sense that there are people around me. Who is in the room with me?</span></div></div>",

The very voice that finishes sounds familiar too. \"Don't you have someplace to be?\" the voice says in contemptuous manner. The question isn't answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push myself up to a sitting position and find myself on a bed which the nurse, now dressed in casual clothing, is sitting on. I look up at her and she gives me a warm smile. \"A natural sleeping beauty. Isn't that twice I've found you sleeping on my beds?\" she jokingly asks. \"You must be wondering why I'm out of my scrubs. You, Miss Bautista, have slept through the dismissal bell. Most of the students have left already.\" As she says this, two boys walk around the corner of the office. The delinquent boy from before and the hall monitor that must have helped me back to the nurse's office. \"Except for these two. So which one of you will do the honors and walk this young lady home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delinquent drops his gaze and looks to the side, seemingly uninterested. The hall moniter, seeming to be more confident, steps up and volunteers himself. \"As class president, it's my duty to see to the well-being of all student, no matter the gender,\" he says with a boisterous voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well said, T.J.,\" the nurse says, but immediately after, the delinquent boy scoffs at the both of them.

Since Miss Bautista has a proper escort, you boy can escort your older sister home,\" the nurse says to the delinquent boy, who seems uninterested. \"Almost forgot, here is your file to help with your memories and your pack. Tomorrow, I'd like to see you with your books for the rest of the year as well as you present in your classroom. i don't want to see you back in one of my beds, you hear?\" I nod in understanding. She hands me my backpack and then the folder which I put into my backpack. I zip it tight and follow T.J out of the nurse's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the hallway, I find T.J. looking back at me. He says to me, \"I have to go to my locker and get my bag and other things. Meet me at the front? It's the glass doors down the hall from the Dean's office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I tell him and he then turns on his heel and hurries down the stairs. I follow him, but at a relaxed pace, down the same flight of stairs. I feel somehow ignorant of various things and I have an urge to know more things. Maybe its this bout of amnesia that is somehow hindering my self-awareness and my awareness of the world around me. I'm reminded of the folder in my backpack. I remove one strap of my backpack, which is colored in a two-tone color scheme of ocean blue over a sandy beige with black straps and fastening buckles. I open the larger pocket and pull out the folder. I put back the strap after zipping the pocket up and proceed to head to the entrance of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, I take a look at the folder, opening it up and skimming through all pieces of information. I see my name again, saying it out loud so I know what my name is. \"Jocelyn Bautista,\" I say and repeat it in my head. It sounds either Filipino or Hispanic. Maybe it could be a combination of the two. I would have to see myself in a mirror if I'm to know for sure. I then glance at transfer student and I'm reminded of what Mr. Dean told me. I was a transfer student who transferred during the winter break and I'm attending school for the last semester. That's two quarters of a year. At most, I have the last six months of school to finish, since I'm a senior. Boy, being a senior again, but in a whole different body. There's the whole thing with puberty and the monthly period as well, but I don't feel as bothered by it as I initially think it. What bothers me is any upcoming headaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as I'm nervous for it, it suddenly comes upon me. It hits my head first and I immediately close the folder and clutch it tight to my chest. One of my hands feels it through my sternum, beating wildly. I fall to my knees and I push myself against a hard place, the wall, but with a clang of metal, it's none other than a row of lockers. I put the folder down and with both my hands free, I clutch both to the side of my head, using the heel of my wrist to apply pressure in order to alleviate the pain. It does little to help me. I'm suddenly thrown into a vivid memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear the sound of a train running along its track. As it turns, the metal wheels grind against the metal of the rails. Wind rushes past the windows. I'm comforted by the cushion of a hard, vibrating surface. I find myself on the bench of what could be a subway car. I open my eyes and see light pouring into a clean subway car, but what's a subway doing where light can hit it and soak it in. I sit up and put earbuds into my ears and a loud acoustic version of the song Drive by Incubus fills my ear canals. I breathe in and out deeply. I remember a man's voice followed by a woman's voice. They are both endearing and loving. My eyes sheds tears, which turn into a silent deluge down my cheeks. I look up, seeing no one in the car. I wipe my eyes dry, able to see a sun rising behind an ocean. The ocean, reflecting the hue of the sunlight, illuminates what was previous shrouded in shadow. As the train crosses over a bridge, a coastal town starts to emerge. From what I can see, there is a commercial district, lining the coast, a city center, which also has a theme park incorporated into it, and a residential district more inland and what looks to be a whole school on a hill over looking rows of houses. I feel myself smile and then the memory fades away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" the familiar voice of T.J. asks. His voice alerts me to his presence and I look up to find him seated right next to me. He hands me a tissue which I gladly take due to my eyes feeling a bit watery. I must have started to cry as I was experiencing that memory. Somehow, it told me the voice of my father and mother were the last of what I could remember about them. Them sending me here to finish my schooling is still a mystery, but I know it wasn't done out of spite. \"You didn't have another seizure did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. It's just me remembering things,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What things?\" T.J. presses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at him with an expression of concern on his face. I understand that he is class president and it is his duty to see to my well-being, but him being nosy may be pushing it. \"Things I remember,\" I vaguely tell him as I get to my feet. He offers to help, but I gesture him not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do you live?\" T.J. asks. Initially, I forget that he's my escort and assume that he's still being nosy, but seconds later, I forget that I have my file with me. I find it on the ground and pick it up, quickly opening it to find the address of where I'm staying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"365 Skyline Drive... I think,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skyline Drive?!\" he exclaims with shock on his face. \"Your folks must be rich or something.\" I don't answer since I'm also in shock, more on his reaction than the actual truth. My gut tells me that I wasn't too keen on people being rich or that money never bothered me enough to worry or greed for it. \"I know where it is, but you need a code to get into the gates. It's one of those communities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns on his heel and exits out of the door. I follow him closely. For much of the way, T.J. is busy navigating the streets which turn into a school zone immediately outside of the school, then becomes a combination of rural and suburban. I can say that there are a few rice paddies smack dab next to tram tracks and strawberry fields next to a busy thoroughfare. As I'm walking, I observe that the school is actually situated on a hill and kids must travel down a hill to get home. I figure it's a more of a relief than going to school from home. T.J. suddenly turns onto a street and suddenly the houses start getting bigger and fanciers. Heck, even cars on the street look more expensive than cars near the school. I'm bound to find a supercar or hypercar around here, no doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT.J. turns onto another street, which winds up a hill. The street itself is not asphalt, but a light-orange brick. Flanking the street are pristine concrete sidewalks and immediately next to them are tall metal fences. Only a swift martial artist would be able to traverse up and over these fences. We eventually get to a gate. A key pad on a pole sits on the island in the center of what could be considered a roundabout. Another key pad sits next to a door knob of a pedestrian gate. A speaker sits next to the key pad. I guess this is how guests ring up the houses. Is there any need for door bells in this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in there somewhere. Try dialing the house number, unless you know the code,\" T.J. suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember... remember?\" I point out the obvious. i walk up to the door and press the numbers 3... 6... and 5 on the key pad. A dial tone rings and rings and rings and rings and rings for a last time immediately switching to a generic voicemail sort of automated message telling us that the occupant of this particular home is not able to answer the request and that it's suggested to try later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it again, maybe he... or she was in the bathroom or something,\" T.J. says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try it again, dialing the same numbers on the key pad. Does anyone answer?</span></div></div>",

I expecto to hit the ground hard like the previous times, but instead, I'm caught in the arms of T.J., who eases my body to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" he says as he props my head on his thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glance up at him and for some reason I get all nervous, like a girl and I sit up, but not without getting a pain that throbs all over my head. I groan, \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? Cuz this is the third time this has happened on my watch,\" T.J. mentions. \"Say, have you eaten anything today?\" He walks around me as he asks this and he catches a certain expression on my face. \"I guess not.\" He turns around as if he is mad at me and I try to think. In the times I've either had a flashback or blacked out, I don't recall ever eating anything. Not even a morsel. I'm lost in thought until T.J. puts a hand in front of me. It's open with his palm facing the sky. I look up at him and shoot him a inquisitive look. \"You must probably be hungry. I can give you a piggy back ride to a place that's close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI furrow my brows and say, \"I can walk just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not on an empty stomach. Come on,\" T.J. says, gesturing his hand in a beckoning motion. \"As Class President, I cannot leave one of my fellow classmates here to starve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scoff at the idea, thinking it's inappropriate for me to be taking this ridiculous offer. He takes it further, turning around and squating. I get to my feet and look around. Someone probably is watching the two of us from the comfort of their window and wondering what a pair of high-schoolers are doing at a locked gate. How I wished someone pitied my situation and opened the door for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any day now,\" he says. At this moment I consider him too committed to his philosophy and outlook for his peers to even consider another option. \"Or else I'll starve here with you.\" His last remark strike a guilty cord within me and it makes me step forward and place my hands on his  shoulders as well as placing my body close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a quick movement, he rises and rears backward and successfully catches my thighs and holds them close to my side so that I'm sort of straddling him. My face warms up in embarrassment and since I'm a bit scared of how fast he moved, I scream for a brief second. His daring move almost knocks the breath out of me. And did I mention I sort of scared of heights? Since I'm sort of off balance as all my weight bears down on this guy, I clutch at the boy's shoulders and wraps my arms about him to further stabilize myself. This unwittingly presses my chest against his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" T.J. says. His voice drowns out any chaos that is thrashing in my head and I can calmly hear him speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I calmly ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're on my back, then where is my backpack?\" he asks and I immediately forget about worrying that I'm on his back and I look around for his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's right there!\" I say, point a bit to his right on a backpack that half on the grass and half in the black soil of a planter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since my hands are full, I need you to reach for it. I'll squat down as far as I can and you just grab it and hold it,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can protest, he goes over and squats down. I reach for it, thinking he'll be too tired afterwards to keep me on his back. For the first try, I can barely reach it, since it sits flat on the ground and the handles being two or three inches away from me. T.J. dares himself and bends over, gravity unwittingly pressing my chest against his back, but due to his move, I can finally grab onto a handle and pull it up. I sling it over my shoulder and with one hand, I hang on for dear life, hoping T.J. will bring me down to the ground soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it?\" he asks, seemingly out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" I tell him. He suddenly turns on his heel, straightens himself out as much as he can and starts walking down the slight incline to the hills. All I can do now is silently protest as I hang on for the unwanted ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust where does T.J. take me?</span></div></div>",

The streets get more busy with more automobile and foot traffic. I duck my head to hide my face from passing pedestrians, half of which turn their heads to look at the two of us. I just hope they are not drawing conclusions. The conclusions I'd want them to come to is that me, the girl on his back, had drunk something very alcoholic, but I have my doubts that it wouldn't be the top contender with the obvious ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT.J. eventually crosses multiple streets all while on slight slopes. When apologizing about all the bumps I'm feeling, he says, \"Sorry about that. This place is notorious for its hills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of me is glad that I'm on his back, my legs especially relieved from bearing my weight. Part of me pities T.J. for having to carry more than his weight on his two legs. Part of me wants to shut up and enjoy the ride while the other part of me wants to apologize at every mile we go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe eventually get to a huge plaza, dominated by a large multi-story building. Judging from all the young peoples amassed around the building, this place is a center for entertainment and socializing. T.J. continues on without letting me down and I grow more conscious of the two of us and the youthful-couple-vibe I get with all the potential watches around us. He carries me through an archway with small shops lining every side. At the end of this archway is an inner plaza, lit by the sunlight above a canopy with no ceiling. A large fountain sits in the very center of the plaza, which is flanked by the many windows of restaurants and shops lining the walls. The two of us enter into a glass elevator and this is where he lets me down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, I'm concerned for the health of this boy, who had to carry additional weight for what it seemed to be more than five miles. Sweat has already formed on his forehead, which is wipes with his forearm and his breathing is heavy and deep, as if he had run a mile. \"Are you okay? Sorry.\" I ask and immediately apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be,\" he coolly says. \"You are obviously starving and I did not want you to hurt yourself if you had another one of your blackouts.\" He turns around, takes his backpack from my arm and leans against the curvature of the glass window. An ounce of me thinks he looks cool. \"The least you could do is enjoy the scenery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm baffled at how cool his attitude is, almost carefree. I forgot I still have the mind of a mature male, whose persona and identity still continues to elude me. I look out the window and with an expressionless face, I see the wonder of this building. Unfortunately, the elevator ride is short and we get to what seems to be the highest level. I follow T.J. out the elevator door and onto a boardwalk like flooring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immediate area is like a boardwalk, one that wraps around the inner edge of the roof platform, that overlooks the inner plaza and large fountain below. Across from the elevator is an eating area. Many tables and chairs fill this place, which is draped with a cloth ceiling, providing much shade, but allow cool air to flow through the space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI follow T.J. into the area and he sits me down at a table situated near the outer edge of the roof, overlooking the plaza. I look the side and see different colored tiles, which are red tiles within a blue outline against the gray cement. The tiles spell out \"NORTH PLAZA.\" This must be the north side of the mall then. I look up above the city and find what looks like the school in the distance. Beyond that is much trees and rolling hills, but dominating them from above, is what?</span></div></div>",

Just looking at its immense size causes me to feel insignificant. Heck, this whole town is insignificant compared to that mountain. It's green slopes tells me its not a volcano and if it was, it's probably one that's extinct or has been asleep for a long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT.J. comes back with a tray full of food. On one side of the tray, are two drinks, but like the mountain and the town at its foot, the drinks look insignificant in contrast with the amount of food that sits next to them. Two corndogs, chicken strips and a generous mound of french fries fill the flimsy paper boats that they are served in. T.J. probably sees the astonished expression on my face and says, \"If you're going to eat something, it better be comfort food. And don't say you're on a diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not. At least, I don't remember being on one,\" I tell him. Without warning, he digs into the feast. I start by picking one of the corndogs. I bite into the corn-encrusted cylinder of hot and juicy processed meat on a stick and with every chew, the juices of the meat and cornbread hit every taste bud possible. I swallow and let the hot food slide down my throat and as it lands into my stomach, a feeling of satisfaction courses throughout my body. Funny thing is, as I think about it, I make it so as I see it in slow motion, but in reality it only takes a couple seconds. I continue to bite into it to get the same feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I'm done, T.J. continues to scarf down food and fill his belly. It seems as if he was the one who has not eaten anything the whole day. I take a moment to pause and sip on a few ounce from the provided drink. I put out a question. \"So T.J., do you know why there's a huge mountain sitting behind the school?\" I ask, pointing out the obvious backdrop as if he hasn't already noticed and seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mount Furu? It's been there four I don't know how long. Well before this town has been there,\" T.J. says. \"Scientists say it was a volcano that had recently gone extinct, but there are people in the town that says it's only sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So any day, it could erupt?\" I ask, putting down a half-eaten strip of chicken on the bed of fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT.J. puts down his drink and tells me, \"Erupt? After a hundred years of sleeping? If it's going to erupt, then it should wait until I graduate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because after I do, I'm moving to a place the only downer is rain. I don't want any earthquakes or a volcano erupting while I'm still in school,\" the class representative says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a class representative, you don't sound like a good representative of the town that your class is a part of,\" I point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as class representative, I have to be honest and sometimes honesty is brutal,\" he defends himself and goes back to eating. Not another word is said as we finish the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we are done, T.J. throws the trash away and we leave the restaurant. Seeming to have forgotten our little argument, he kindly asks, \"So is there a place you'd like to go or see if you don't think that no is at your place yet? Not saying that that your place is abandoned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should I go, if it's not at home?</span></div></div>",

And I'd like to use my legs for once,\" I suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then you can give me a piggy-back ride,\" he jokingly says, to which I hit him with a solid punch to his upper arm. Like any guy, he acts weak as a joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe make our way to the elevator and get to the ground floor. When we make it outside, there seems to be a crowd of young people gathering in the plaza. As T.J. and I get closer, we can hear the crowd shout out suggestions to fight. T.J., possibly due to him being the class representative for the school, pulls on my arm so as to guide me past the crowd instead of towards it. But his grip on my arm is not hard enough and I'm able to walk to the crowd and easily push my way into it. There is only a single row encircling the event. In the middle of this staggered circle, I'm surprised to see the delinquent boy from before, the little brother of the nurse. What is he doing here when he was supposed to walk his sister? Most likely he ditched her seeing it's not cool to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of him is a trio of guys, two of which looks to be about the same age as the boy. The third, who stands in the middle, is much taller and looks much older. The three of them all wear outfits that match in three colors: black as the primary and red and blue as the accents. The taller of the three males walks forward and pushes on the delinquent. \"I thought you were going to hang and join our ranks, man,\" he says after pushing him. I look at the foot of the boy and I see a familiar backpack which is open and papers and pens lay strewn across the concrete and tiles. In the boy's hand, I can see a vintage video camera, which he tries to hide from the other boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he just wants to take pictures all day, bruh,\" one the shorter boy say, pointing to the mentioned camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning, the tall boy lunges over and takes the camera from the delinquent's hands. In protest, the boy tell him to give the camera back to him. \"Hey, give that back, man!\" he shouts as he tries to reach for the camera. His attempts are futile, seeing as the tall boy has a larger stature. If he didn't look like a gang member, he would have probably become a basketball player due to his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what? You gonna hang with us? I don't you need this if you will,\" the tall boy says. He passes the camera over to the next boy in black, red and blue. They play around with the delinquent boy by faking attempts to hand the camera back to him, only for them to pull it at the last second. When the last boy gets it, he stupidly brings it over his shoulder, as if he's going to throw it, and actually throws the camera to the busy street. The delinquent boy runs out in the direction where the camera flies and stops at the side when the device lands and shatter into tiny pieces. The street isn't as packed and looks deserted with the mess of metal and film in the center lane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout looking if there is traffic in the street, the delinquent runs out into the street to retrieve his broken camera. Seeing a sign that says \"one way\" and the direction the arrow is point is towards the left and when I look to the right the light at the nearest intersection has turned green and a wall of metal and rubber starts barreling down the street, I bolt off after him. My feet leave the sidewalk and make contact with the asphalt and when I get within a couple feet, all I hear to my right is the sound of tires screeching and horns honking. I'm able to push the delinquent boy towards the next lane, which is surprisingly free of traffic due to a bus stopping several feet away, but in my lane, I'm not so lucky. Everything happens so fast. A car, the driver of whom probably oblivious to any pedestrians on the street, brakes too late and in the remaining momentum, the heavy vehicle hits my light body. I'm sent flying for what seems like two seconds, when in my head, as my life flashes before my eyes, the moment last for an eternity. My whole soul is numb to the pain that probably overwhelms my whole body as I land hard on the pavement. I lay on my back with no movement. i stare into the sky, as if it's willing to suck me towards the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, everything freezes. The vehicles in the street come to a halt as well as people on the sidewalk. Even all the sounds cease, including the crowd's jeers, the honking horns and screeching tires. I sit up and then get to my feet and wonder why everything has stopped. Then I remember the delinquent boy and I see him in the next lane with a shocked expression on his face, as if he has seen a dead body. Then it hits me. I was hit by a car in order to save the boy that is laying bewildered in the next lane. I see the car with the apparent damage on its front end. The driver also has a frozen expression of shock on his face. I look in the direction he's facing and see something that distresses me as well. It's my body, face up with a lifeless look on my face. If I'm looking at myself from a second-person perspective, then where I am now is where my soul is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat confuses me next is that I'm not the only person moving. Despite the masses around that have witnessed the accident having been frozen in time, there is one character that I see walking around. He walks from the crowd nonchalantly and goes over to my lifeless body in  the street. I call out to him, asking, \"Hey, who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifts his head as he lifts one of my limp arms, showing that he has heard me and my question. The man wears a suit that matches those that other people wear on the street. He also has a clean-shaven face with slicked-back hair with dark shades covering his eyes. I approach him from the car that hit me and he gets to his feet and meets me. \"That's was an amazing act of random kindness there, good job,\" he says. \"Pity that you didn't survive being hit by that car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I like this, out of my body?\" I ask.</span></div></div>",

All I can see is a blurry image of green and blue, the majority of which is green. I see movement of different sets of colors that I assume are people doing different activities. I can hear very well and it sound a bit busy where we are. The man who's carrying me speaks, calling out to someone. \"Hey Doc! This girl needs patching up. She just fainted back over there,\" the man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sets me down on a soft place, which I discover is a mattress of some kind. I know because a man whose voice sounds stingy and jealous, protests, \"You put her on the cot?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female voice is quick to react. \"She's hurt, asshole. Why don't you break your leg and get dibs on the couch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough,\" a stern voice is heard. \"Raise her head, please.\" I can only figure out that the voice belongs to a doctor of some kind. This must be the Doc that man was calling out to. The man who has carried me here raises my head so that my temple rests on his thigh. Another set of hands touch along an unseen wound at the back of my head. I wince at the sensation of stinging pain. \"Miss, this is your body's way of telling you that you're still alive and can feel pain. I'm just going to apply some gauze and bandage it up.\" As soon as he's finished advising me, in no time, he's bandaged up my head and I'm encouraged to rest in the silence of the cot and this man's thigh. Again, I doze off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up feeling refreshed and the soreness in my muscle feeling less intense. I'm no longer laying my head on a firm thigh, but on a pack that is filled with leafy fronds. I push myself up and find myself on a cot indeed that's sheltered by a makeshift tent made out of palm fronds. I courage myself to stand and though my balance is off (finding the breasts on my chest no help), I'm able to stand on my own two feet. I finally figure out what I saw through my blurry vision earlier. The dominant color of green is actually the many leaves and fronds of the plants and trees that litter the area. The brown is obviously the dead leaves that make up the forest floor. The varying sets of colors who I sense were moving are actually people, more than two dozen of them. Most of them are working while others are most likely resting. Neither of them look to be lounging around, since judging by their struggled expression, they must be unanimously in some sort of dilemma. A dilemma that I have yet to find out. What could be troubling these people on a paradise like this with the waves crashing along a shore nearby?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're up early,\" a voice speaks from the side.

I recall getting slapped with a request for that slap to change me into this female body, but I can't recall the one striking my face or the exact reason why.

I'm seated in a classroom but the only student there is myself. Everything this body in my dreams, a male body, the body that I previously had, does is out of my control and I'm forced to watch every scene unfold. I find myself getting up and walking down the stairs to the stage where the teacher, an old man, is standing. I hand him a pink-colored paper, which seems to be a flyer of some sort. We exchange conversation, but I cannot hear what we are talking about. The dream speed up and I find myself in a facility that doesn't look like the university I was located in before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am part of a tour group that consists of people that are rich. These people could very well be the financial elite. The tour takes us past windows that show technicians in labs that seem to be working on tissue. The tour continues and we catch a glimpse of body parts growing in a laboratory setting. Near the end of the tour, I'm grabbed by a rather large black man whose muscles are hidden underneath an ironed suit, almost like a man in black. He takes me into a room where on tables lay lifeless female bodies. They are general of the thin, sexy quality, with various sizes for their legs, height, breasts as well as the length of their hair. One that looks like a mix of mostly Asian combined with European features catches my eyes and that's when I look up, startled to hear the teacher from the classroom. I get the impression that he is the mastermind of this project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drift into a scene where I'm in the teacher's office back at the university and I'm signing a bunch of papers which tell me that I did volunteer to be the first subject of this procedure. I get the impression that the reason why I'm doing it is that I'm secretly gay or obsessed with feeling what a woman feels. This procedure would change that and I would get to feel everything that a woman feels, because I would truly be a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the truth in my memories, I finally realize what had happened.

He says he will be away on business, so in the meantime, you are to go through physical rehab at this facility,\" he tells me in his deep voice.

I catch myself looking too long and I turn my head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that moment, the doctor from earlier appears from behind the door. \"Hello there. I wasn't expecting visitors to come so soon,\" he says and reaches a hand out to Malcolm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalcolm kindly reaches his hand in a friendly gesture, even though the girth of his arms is twice the size of the doctor's. \"The professor wanted to be here, but he was called to a late night trip to the other side of the country.

Sir?\u201d he turns to Malcolm. \u201cIf it serves your duty well, you can join us as we make our way to the testing room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly with \u2026 her permission,\u201d Malcolm says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe can join us, no problem,\u201d I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty then, we don't know if you're able to walk in those legs, so we've brought a wheelchair for you. Sir, you want, you can assist your charge in getting in the wheelchair,\u201d the doctor says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d Malcolm says and immediately proceeds to pick me up from the bed after the doctor has taken off the sensors and instruments from my body and sets me down onto the wheelchair. The doctor opens the door that leads into the hallway and through the doorway, Malcolm pushes me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a short trip to an elevator that takes us down to a basement level. When the doors open, a large room is revealed. There is a larger than usual table in the center and the walls of the room are lined with apparatuses that look like they are from a gymnasium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, if you can, please place your charge on the table in the center,\u201d the doctor says as he goes over to a desk off to the side and sits in the office chair. Malcolm picks me up and sets me on the table. \u201cMiss, can you please take off the gown that you have on?\u201d The doctor says this as he is facing away from me and towards the laptop that's in front of him. I glance at Malcolm and he gets the embarrassed expression on my face and goes behind me to the other side of the table. I take the gown off rather quickly, and spy on the breasts jutting out from my chest and I realize, despite them being soft to my touch, they add a bit of weight to my chest. Still unfamiliar with being naked in this body, I spread my arm across my chest so that my forearm covers my nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time before the doctor starts to speak again, I lean forward and find out two things. It's definitely unusual that having no dick or balls between this pair of sexy hairless legs is actually comfortable. The other thing is that with the long black hair flowing from my scalp, I'm constantly tucking them behind an ear or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything is all set on my end, so the test can proceed. I'll be inputting the values on the computer, so I'm leaving everything to you, Sir,\u201d the doctor says. \u201cI hope you don't feel uncomfortable touching a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glance behind me and my eyes meet with Malcolm's. I give him a confident nod and before I turn back towards the elevator doors, I spot the black man gulp, as if the muscles and the fact that he's my bodyguard isn't enough to ease a sense of nervousness. Nevertheless, he responds, \u201cNo, I do not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, now firstly, we shall start with....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat part of my body does the test check first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, now firstly, we shall start with your breasts, since it has one of the most nerve endings that we have to check if they're all connected,\" the doctor says without pausing. The moment he says 'my breasts, I look down the cleavage that I've produced by covering my nipples with my forearm. \"If you can, you can lie on your back for this test and we'll have your bodyguard perform the checking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really necessary?\" I ask a bit out of protest. \"They feel like they work just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your professor insists on this test and the sooner I can get it to him, the better. Unless you want my hands to be touching you,\" the doctor tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I understand,\" I respond and quietly rotate my body and lay my back onto the table. I remove my arm from my breasts and place my arms to my sides. I turn my head to the side, not wanting to meet with Malcolm's eyes as he's touching me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Sir, you can begin. Start with the base of the breasts and trace a circle around them. Then slowly spiral up until you reach the areola. When you reach them, stop and let me know,\" the doctor tells him. I close my eyes and wait for Malcolm to touch me. As much as I would like to get touched by a man, my moral standards get the better of me and even though I'm close with Malcolm in a friendly sense, I don't think I would let him touch him any other way without first getting to know him. In this case though, we both have to compromise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first type of contact is with a large finger, probably Malcolm's index finger touching down at the base of each breasts. I sense he is standing at the end of the table where my head is at. He begins to move his finger and in the first few seconds, I tense up, but after he begins to spiral up to my nipples, I start to relax and embarrassed as I am to say it, the contact feels good to me. It takes about two minutes for each finger to reach the part where my light brown skin becomes the areola surrounding the peaks of my hills. Once each finger reaches it, like the doctor order, Malcolm stops and removes his fingers from my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Miss... Rosario ... I guess that's the name that's been given to you,\" the doctor mentions before speaking again. \"How was the experience, the sensations that you felt? On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being very little or no sensation and 10 being that you felt everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10,\" I say simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ticklish at all?\" he adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit, near my armpits and along my sides,\" I honest tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you did feel that? Good,\" the doctor affirms that the procedure is a success. \"Next is for your nipples. We have to make sure the connections are established.\" The doctor pauses as if to wait for any protests or questions. Both Malcolm and I, stay quiet during his pause. \"Now, Sir, you can proceed with her nipples. First you must feel upon them. Lightly squeeze them, run your fingers on the very tip as well as twist them a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words that the doctor easily uses makes me uneasy, but I keep my head turns to the side and my eyes closed. Malcolm doesn't wait for the doctor's orders and begins touching my nipples with his large fingers. He starts just by flicking each nipple lightly and then squeezing them with his index finger and thumb. I shamefully let out a gasp as he begins to twist each nipple and I have to bite my lip to stop myself from letting out a moan. Indeed I can feel everything and the sensations are phenomenal, almost too good to be true, but every time Malcolm flicks my nipples, I realize everything is true and very real and very satisfying. I wonder what Malcolm thinks of me now. Do I look like a slut right now? Or just a guy slowly realizing he's in a very hot and sexy female body and that every touch to his private areas send him into an uncontrollable instance of gasping and near-moaning? I don't even want to see what kind of expression he has on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore it gets out of hand, Malcolm removes his hands. The doctor speaks up and again asks me for my rating. \"Miss Rosario? 1 through 10 please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to take a deep breath before responding simply with, \"10.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, next is....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes the test escalate down to my lower regions or something else?</span></div></div>",

Sir, can you please come over here?\" the doctor says and then calls out to Malcolm. The black man walks over to the desk and receives what looks like a parcel. \"Miss Rosario, please sit up and put the clothes on for the next test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do as he says and sit up with my legs off of the bed. Malcolm, like a gentleman, turns his back after he places down the parcel on the table. I open the package and take out five pieces of clothing from it. The pieces included are a shirt, black and dull, a black sports bra, a black cotton thong and a rather long pair of white sweats. The fifth piece is actually a panty, which I deduce would be a choice I would have to make. Either expose more skin with the thong or cover it up with the panty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI choose the thong, since it's different and new to me. It's the first garment I put on, but putting it on while seated is proving to be difficult. Without any of the two men in the room knowing, I ease my feet onto the floor and silent gain my footing. I find that with my breasts, my previous sense of male balance is quite different than this new sense of balance. I silent put on my clothes, putting the thong on first before slipping into my pants. I insert my arms and my head through the holes of the bra and immediately notice how the bra cups and supports my breasts with no difficulty at all. The notion of my breasts bouncing up and down unnerves me, but at least the bra will prevent most of the bouyancy. After putting on the shirt, I call out to the doctor. \"I don't think this test is necessary,\" I say, gleefully walking back and forth and even performing a cartwheel. A quite girly move, but with this body, it's perfectly okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see a grin on Malcolm's face and a expression of shock on the doctor's face. \"I guess you're good for lunch then,\" the doctor suggests, still with a dumbfounded expression on his facade. \"We still have more test, but it seems you're able to eat without us feeding you. You can do lunch however you like. We have a massive cafeteria, but I suggest we get you on a big, balanced, high-fiber diet for the test. We can have it sent to the apartment we're relocating you or we can have it sent here. Up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should I eat my lunch?</span></div></div>",

I can't tell for sure, only that the feeling of it against my naked body is comfortable. And yes, immediately I note that I'm naked as well and in the woman's body I ask for. I guess the slap did something more than change me. It transported me, but where exactly, I'm not sure. Covering me is what seems like another hide blanket and the fur is less soft and more heat-trapping. Underneath my head and resting on my nape is a small, yet soft pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide to open my eyes, but when I do, I see nothing. I discover that a blindfold or shroud covers my eyes and is so tightly secured that no matter what I do, I can't take it off. I try to remove myself from the bed of fur, but when I turn myself over, I find that tied around one of my ankles is a thin and slender rope, that like the blindfold is tightly secured. It's tied in such a way that if I struggle, it digs into my skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no wonder your people have the inborn desire to escape control,\" a deep raspy voice is heard in front of me, beyond the pillow which my head once rested. \"Which should explain the eradication of your kind by the Sovereignty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I ask, wondering minutes afterward why I didn't ask for his name or what kind of circumstances led me to being bound by a rope and being naked in a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never heard the stories, girl?\" the raspy voice asks. \"Assassinations on assassins, son and daughters of assassins? Wiping you out like a plague.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? Who are you? And why are you talking to me like that?\" I ask, continuing to struggle and therefore tighten the rope around my ankle. For a long moment the voice doesn't utter a single word. It seems like an eternity passes by before I hear footsteps approach me and hands fiddling with the tied at the back of my head. The blindfold loosens, but what shocks me is that I cannot see, even without the blindfold. I try blinking back my vision by allowing whatever light to kickstart my sight, but nothing happens. I do see a purple haze in places, but all I see is white. I start to feel hands on my ankle and the rope that has began to dig into my skin. Once the rope has been untied, I recoil my leg and use it to sit up and desperately try to cover my nakedness, since a cold breeze passes across my chest and through my legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't really do much, since the man behind me grabs the top of my head and places a sharp blade to my throat. \"I've freed you, but I'm not taking chances with a helpless Amaranthine,\" the raspy voice says in my ears. With my hands, I try to distance the blade from my throat, but unknowing cutting myself on the twin edge of the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sir, spare me. I don't know what's going on or what Amama-ran-teen is, please,\" I plead, letting my emotions get the better of me. I easily start to tear up knowing my life is in this man's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe abruptly takes the blade from my throat and pushes me forward onto my stomach. The comfort of the soft fur tickles the tips of my breasts, but as soon as I feel the sensation, the next feeling I feel is pressure, for the man has pinned me to the ground with his knee. He forcefully takes the hand that had cut itself on his blade and begins wrapping it. \"It's pronounced Amaranthine, fool,\" he says. \"How can someone from a race of assassin not know how to pronounce their race? Unless... well.... well, we did find you on the riverbank. Say, girl, do you know your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pause, knowing the name I remember when I was a man, but stopping myself from uttering it due to the awkwardness that a man's name would be given to a woman. Instead of blurting out my previous name, I reply, \"I had a name, but I don't remember or recall what it is. So the answer is no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An Amaranthine with no name?\" the raspy voice asks, though I can tell it's not directed towards me. \"What colors me confused is that our scouts found you soaked to the bone on the riverbank. They also noted you received a concussion, but to what extent we could not find out due to you being an Amaranthine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir. I don't mean to annoy you, but what is an Amaranthine,\" I ask, desperate for answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know the full history, but what I can tell you has been told over countless campfires, many of which were after deadly encounters with them,\" the raspy voice begins to explains and finally lets me get to a sitting position. I immediately take the hide blanket and use it to cover my front side. \"They were a legendary race once employed by the Sovereignty. They were created, not bred. They were merely humans who were infused with science and the occult, rendering their blood to turn from red to deep purple, thus labeling you as the purple-blood, or Amaranthines, for when seeing your veins or bruises up close, the color would be a like the shade of night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were incredible assassins, whose senses were heightened. They could hear from miles away, track deserters and exiles like blood hounds, and they could see through all spectrums of light, but most notably in the dark. After many days of peace, turmoil brewed between the Sovereignty and the races. For a while, your people were given territory to roam free, but with your inborn desire to conquer and with no targets to focus on, your people raids villages and townships on a nightly basis. That's when  the Sovereignty decided to wipe out your clan. This is probably the same series of stories of male purple-bloods plundering and raping women and the women bore hybrids. The offspring still had the heighten senses, but they were blind at birth. But there was no differentiating between the two. The Sovereignty orders purebreds and half-breeds to be wipes out from the face of the Earth. Now it's rare to see an Amaranthine, but the history your people have and how they affected the land still stays. You probably wouldn't last out there if it weren't for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who are you?\" I ask. I may look visibly relaxed after that story he just told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have drifted down the Allotrope River all the way to the border. We are but a small group of cavern dwellers who live between the mountains and the desert,\" the raspy voice says. \"I'm Dezra, leader of the Goldmanes. And since you don't have a name, then I'll give you a choice. Either you can name yourself or you let me name you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I choose?</span></div></div>",

Why not something gentle?\" a female voice speaks from beyond Dezra's position in the room. Since I deduce this room is in a cavern of sorts, the female voice may be coming from the room's entryway or a connecting Hallway. \"She doesn't look like she'll hurt a fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive my sister. The broad doesn't know when to shut up and find a man and leave this band of brothers I have,\" Dezra says to me. \"Don't you have some man-hunting to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've found many men, brother, but it's your right to marry first. Why don't you bed that violet-blood right in front of you?\" the woman says and I can hear her leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I must say, you'll have to forgive her. But for a name, I think I can call you Zephyra, which means a gentle western wind. You don't look like the type to lunge at me and put my knife to my throat, so the name should suit you,\" Dezra says. \"Now that you have a name, I should probably ask how you ended up on that riverbank we found you at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember,\" I say. If I try to recall what led me to being put here, all I can see is cloudiness and fuzziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear Dezra get to his feet. It's weird. I can honestly hear everything in the room, especially where this nomad is walking. When I close my eyes, every time a sound is made, I can literally see the sound waves creating vague outlines of the rocky pillars that support the ceiling as well as Dezra and other furniture. When he speaks, my audible vision is much clearer and I can actually see the features of his face, even though it last for only a second. When absolutely no sound is made, when my eyes are closed, all I see is darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was afraid you'd say that, Zephyra,\" Dezra speaks again after a brief pause. \"We had heard of a raid on a mountain encampment of rogue Amaranthine. In a report, it was rumored that everyone including humans allied with the Amaranthines, children and pregnant mothers were killed. It was also rumored that a female Amaranthine hybrid had escaped only by falling as a purebred male by the name of Draine jumped in front of her to catch an incoming arrow meant for her. She survived it seems that her male purple-blood companion broke her fall as the two of them hit the water. What I'm thinking is that female hybrid is you. Do you feel anything when you hear the name Draine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't,\" I simply say and with no hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that woman is you, Zephyra, then you must have hit your head and got amnesia from the trauma. In any case, you should be safe here. Our scouts have not reported any sign of the Sovereignty,\" Dezra tells me. \"Since you are a hybrid, then it's likely you don't see anything--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see when you talk or make a noise,\" I butt in to clarify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are no purebred, so you do need assistance. Do you remember how you life was before the raid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I try to think and see if this body of mine, no matter how impaired, had any memory of some kind. Again, I fail to conjure up anything of this body's life. \"Honestly, I don't remember being born nor do I know who my parents are,\" I reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are ashamed of being unclothed. You might be no purebred, but you are still human,\" Dezra encourages. \"For now, rest. I'll go see if your clothes are dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear Dezra leave the room and for the next ten minutes I wait and listen to see if he or anyone else enters the room. After eleven minutes of silence, I lay my head back down on the pillow and drift back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I wake up, I hear noises in the room. Who has entered the room?</span></div></div>",

As I'm sleeping underneath the hide blankets, I'm unable to detect the throng of people stomping down the hallway and into the room I'm sleeping in. I'm unable to defend myself or escape the strong clutches of a large-muscled man, who easily pulls me by my wrists out of the bed and onto the smooth rocky floor. They tie a gag into my mouth which is soaked in something that seems to impair all of my senses. By now, even before to place a shroud over my head and wrap me another, coarser sheet of hide and secure me with ropes, I'm numb to it all. The vision that I see when sound bounces off objects is the least impaired. The strong man easily drapes me over his shoulder and takes me out of the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of people laugh and snigger and use a tongue that I'm not familiar with. They take me out of the complex system of caverns and outside, where what looks like wolves are saddled, waiting for the riders. I don't know what purpose they have for me or if Dezra was the one pulling the strings. The strong man takes me to his wolf, which is much bigger than the rest and he drapes me on a blanket immediately behind the main saddle. After straddling his wolf, the beast struggles to get on its front legs before getting on its hind legs, which lift me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader, who shouts to the group and gives me his position at the front of the pack, kicks his wolf into motion and the rest follow. Unlike horses, when the wolves get up to speed, there isn't much turbulence even when the paws hit the ground. I would expect myself to bob up and down, but on this beast's hind quarters, I'm almost relatively still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ride effortlessly out of what looks like the beginning of a desert to the foot of the hills. When trees start to sprout up in huge numbers, the pack's speed lessens, but their swiftness in navigating the windy dirt paths do not fail. Eventually a clearing opens up and less and less trees are found in my audible vision. Upright structures like log cabins start to spring up and I can tell we enter what seems to be a forest town. The vastness of this town starts to reveal itself as the activities start to increase as we get deeper. By now, the riders have dismounted their wolves and the strong man again carries me over his shoulder as his brethren escort their bounty through an increasing crowd of people. Such examples look to be prostitutes and mercenary alike. Either someone has their skin exposed or there is a bladed weapon hidden on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amount of activity give me a broader picture of the town around me. Even with my eyes closed underneath this shroud, I can see as far as thirty feet in front of me. The band of riders seem to be taking me to the biggest building in the town. I assume at first that it's like a police station and as an Amaranthine, these people have come to exchange me for a reward. It's only after we enter that my assumptions are rendered false. It's far from a city hall or a police station. It's actually a large tavern which also serves as a bordello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madame Rose!\" the strong man calls out. His voice is so thunderous, I can feel it through his chest and shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lithe woman dressed in a flamboyant dress comes near and greets the men, \"The brothers of the Gold Mane tribe. Here to close out my tavern again. Where is Master Dezra?\" the woman speaks with such elegance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is away to tend to the rest of the tribe. We had nothing to do, so we set out to find your find establishment. We've traveled long distance to get here, Madame. I hope you'll cater to our needs very well,\" the leader of the pack speaks. Somehow, I know he is lying about Dezra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it drink or flesh that you boys will be needing tonight?\" the Madame speaks without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less of the flesh and more of the drink. If possible, we'd like your barrels to overflow into our goblets,\" the leader says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We may run out at this rate, but anything for you, Master Lotta,\" the Madame finishes and drifts away from my vision. I'm virtually ignored, though I can sense many eyes looking toward the person wrapped in ropes and covered with a shroud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm seated on a bench next to the strong man. Sometimes he accidentally spills what smells like fragrant wine and bitter beer on me, though sometimes, I feel like it's more intentional and done for laughs. He also fondles me and pokes me in places that are more sensitive than my arms and legs. I want to scream, but this gag and the drink mixed with whatever substance the gag was soaked in further impairs me. I'm simply a log covered in wine and ropes. The festivities are long and soon, as the night draws to a close, most of the patrons have left and the activities start to quiet down. The pack is still here and a familiar voice speaks once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will be closing soon. Since Master Dezra isn't here, can I expect anyone else to pay the lofty bill?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've caught us, Madame. We were riding light in order to catch your late night servings of drink. We have not a single coin on us,\" the leader speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then shall I put it on Master Dezra's tab or will you be willing to help out with the chores so you can pay for your drinks?\" the Madame suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not trouble him with an unexpected bill if he dare come into your wonderful establishment. Then again, I think we are too tired to even lift a finger for you, though we do have a bargaining chip,\" the leader explains. \"Butch, if you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strong man uncovers the shroud over my head and exposed my sweaty and wine-soaked head and hair. With no regular patrons looking, the gag in my mouth is not a sight that's inappropriate to see, not that I can see any faraway reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, we won't be lifting a finger for you, Madame, but you may employ her to earn back our tab. She is but a gentle Amaranthine hybrid. She's blind, but don't let that stop her from helping you. So Madame, what do you say?\" the master explains and finishes with an offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall I do with her after she's earn the funds for your bill?\" the Madame asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do with her however you see fit. If she's capable, employ her further. If not, then you can throw her out with the trash. I'll leave her fate completely up to you,\" the master says and gets up from his seat. The others stand too including the strong man, who pushes me off the bench and onto my back on the floor. In no time at all, all that is left in the tavern is myself on the floor and the Madame standing quietly to the side. The clinking of a metal goblet can be heard echoing in the background, but I assume it's a waitress doing the dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe click of boot heels sound from the floor and I can feel the vibrations through the floorboards. The Madame squats down and when she speaks, I can see her face right above me. \"I'm the kind of person who will give you a choice once your debt has been paid. I have no desire to throw you out like a dog and if you feel like you would like to work for me for longer than your debt allows, then I shall happily employ your skills, whatever they may be. For now, you shall be put to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what kind of work am I in for?</span></div></div>",

The Madame notices the visitor and she greets him and apologizes. \"I'm sorry Sir, we have run dry of drink and the doves have worked so hard they are in their nests,\" the Madame says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just passing through, Madame,\" the visitor speaks, but his voice is so low that I can barely hear him. \"I could not help but overhear, but it seems the mass of desert dwellers that just left paid the bill with this bounty that is laying on your tavern floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. She's a poor thing, possibly taken captive from an Amaranthine camp. I hear she is a hybrid, who does not have the ability to sense much. She is also blind it seems,\" the Madame explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't look like much of a worker and I have never heard of such a thing as a blind dove. I find she is not much use to you it seems,\" the visitor says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my avenues of having her earn her keep, but it seems you are interested in her. I can sell her to you, for a price,\" the Madame says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much is her debt?\" the man asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those men order many drinks, enough to kill a dozen Dire Wolves. I'd say she would work for my establishment for a total of a month and a half. I would say the price for this girl is a politician's weekly salary,\" the Madame says. However large that amount is, is beyond my comprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hefty fee, but you are in luck, Madame,\" the visitor says confidently. \"I have been looking for servant and I do have the coin to exchange for the girl and then some. I shall get the funds while you clean her up and dress her with a one of those keyed belts. Also a cloak and the bottom of your barrels. I shall have a drink before I set off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing more is said and I hear the visitor and the Madame leave from me. In no time, two pairs of feet walk over to me and get me upright. I am quickly uncovered and untied and placed in a warm bath. The hands that wash and soap me do not speak and I assume that instead of being blind like me, their tongues have been cut. There is no pleasure reserved for me and my bath is short-lived. I'm clothed in skimpy leather underwear and boots are placed on my feet along with metal cuffs that are tightly bound to my wrists and ankles. A collar is fastened around my neck as well. Lastly, my crotch and pelvic area is adorned with a leather panty which is more heavier than the cuffs and collar combined. Even though it has a massive weight, it fits snug on my body. A key is placed into the hole of a padlock that sit in front of my pelvis. When it is turned and locked, the metallic belt around my waist cinches, somewhat like what a corset could do. There is slight discomfort in wearing it. To cover the rest of my body, the hands put me in a robe with long sleeves, like that of a monk. Once I'm clothed, I'm escorted out back into the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here she is and in no time at all,\" the voice of the Madame speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a beautiful specimen to add. Pity she cannot see her own beauty. And no cloak? That robe would have to do,\" the visitor says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as you requested, the key to her love, and twelve goblets of the leftovers. On the house of course,\" the Madame says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may leave us, Madame. I wish to acquaint myself with my servant,\" the visitor tells the Madame. I hear her leave along with the others. The man leads me to a nearby bench and allows me to sit without telling me audibly. He sits next to me and rather close. An arm wraps around my torso and easily, he reaches in between my legs. If it weren't for the chastity belt, he would have already claimed a prize. \"For an Amaranthine, you are surprisingly calm, even with my hand over here. I wish not to violate you and I have purchase that belt for your safety, even from me. Your looks, your beauty. Even though your blood is violet, you tempt me like a human woman. You can relax when you are with me. On paper you are my slave, but in my terms, I am your savior. I shall finish my drink and then we'll be off. And one thing, what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I give him the name Dezra named me after? Or, since I'm now a slave, my master gets to name me?</span></div></div>",

What has alarmed him is the presence of two other visitors and by the sounds they make, I can tell they are clad in armor. The clicks of the Madame's heels pass our table and meet with the men. They speak amongst themselves softly and I'm unable to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat seems like ten minutes pass by and my hand start to tremble. My master's hand grasps my hands and calms them down. The click of the Madame's heels approach alone and with the sound of the large doors closing, she freely speaks. \"A Sovereign patrol is on the lookout for a female Amaranthine hybrid and from what I can see, your slave here fits that description. I suggest you leave as soon as possible to avoid abetting a target for the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy master finishes his current drink and sets it down. He quickly grabs my hand and allows me to get up from the bench. \"Madame you were a massive help,\" my master says and bids the Madame farewell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farewell Master Dezra,\" the Madame says and I'm surprised to hear the name of my master is none other than the one who kept me in his cavern room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe swiftly exit the tavern, finding the weather has took a turn for the worst. The sound of thunder rumbles throughout the sky and rain pours from he heavens in a vertical deluge. The strong winds pushes the drops sideways and quickly soak our clothes. Being almost naked underneath, I push my robe tighter against my body, hoping to stay warm. Master Dezra leads me to a large mound of what seems to be fur, since it doesn't sound like a wagon or cart and with the raindrops making a large amount of sounds to create a clear picture for me. The beast of a mound wakes up and it turns out to be a large wolf. Like a dog, it sheds the moisture from its fur and expels it outward, further soaking us to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Dezra pushes me onto the wolf and he gets on behind me. His broad shoulders is wide enough so that he can easily control the wolf while keeping me warm against his frontside. The wolf stands and swiftly trots down an empty road. The rain and the storm has frightened the streetside merchants and prostitutes, who have retreated to their shelters. With no obstacles in the way, the wolf in no time speeds up to what could be a wolf-like gallop to the edge of the town. My sense of direction is bad when I'm blind, but at least it's away from a fate I don't want to live out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo escape the rain, Dezra navigates his wolf to an abandoned cliffside cavern. He helps me off of the wolf, which again dries itself by shaking the moisture from its fur. It follows us deeper into the cave and into an open room. The sound of fire crackling is heard and the sound is enough to show me briefly two other persons in the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find her?\" a female voice asks. I recognize it as being Dezra's sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you finally found yourself a mate?\" Dezra shoots back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will wed and bed me once you find yourself a wife, Dezra,\" a deep voice is heard off to the side. \"Or did you find her already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is up to her, it seems. Zephyra, this is my sister Atoola and a good friend Amersh,\" he introduces them to me. \"Amersh, this is the Amaranthine hybrid that Sovereign is looking for. I'm hoping these abandoned caves will serve as our home since there is no coming back to the desert caves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I liked that cavern. Dry. I hate the rain,\" Amersh mentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get used to it,\" Dezra says. \"Zephyra. Why don't we find you a place to rest. I managed to retrieve my hide blankets from the room, but I had to leave in a hurry.\" Dezra leads me to a room that seems to be smaller than that previous one he had me in. He helps me from my cloak and also removes the cuffs and collar from me. He leaves the belt though, since he said it is for my safety and to waive off his temptation. \"You can relax now. If you need me, just call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wring out the moisture from my hair as best as I can and climb underneath the covers, letting the blankets warm me up. Eventually, I fall back into slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up in the middle of the early morning for a reason. For what reason do I wake up?</span></div></div>",

I can't tell since all I see is perpetual darkness save for the sharp purple lines of the small holes that serve as windows. The wind outside as well as other sources of sounds serve to outline those windows in my audible vision. The rain seems to have let up, though I can feel a certain dampness on the exterior of the cave. Whether it's from morning dew or the remnants of the storm, I'm not sure. The thought of moisture floods my mind as I sit up on the bedding feeling rather bloated. I hurry to get to my feet with the need to relieve my bladder becoming an ever-present priority as the seconds pass. I discover that it's a futile thought, since with me wearing this chastity belt it's impossible with a key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggle to guide myself along the cavern wall to the entryway, where my knees buckle and I fall to my knees. Desperately, I call out, \"Dezra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see his footsteps on the ground as he steps forward. He also knocks on the wall with a stick to aid me in seeing him. \"Yes, Zephyra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to use the bathroom or lavatory or outhouse or whatever you call it. But I also need you to unlock this belt for me,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And risk your womanhood being violated by me?\" he asks, but I can tell he's toying with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I need to go,\" I say with a bit of a quiver in my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDezra doesn't reply and instead he silently picks me up from the ground and carries me deeper into the cave system. He takes me down some steps and into a small room. He sets me down on my feet and with his stick again, he strikes the wall. I turn my head around to see all around me and for a second, I'm thankful we are in a cave with hard surfaces all around, which are able to bounce sounds easily. Dezra strikes the walls several times so that I'm given a somewhat clearer pictures. He stands in the entryway, which is quite small compared to his stature and shoulder width. I'm in a compact room the is like a cylindrical space. Before me is a hole that looks to be bottomless, since the sound waves do not go as far down as I would like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDezra constantly strikes the walls even as he turns and comes close to me. He gentle presses himself against my back and he snakes his hand around to my front. He inserts the key into the keyhole of my chastity belt and turns it, unlocking the belt and giving me a bit of relief from all the pressure I've been feeling. He turns away and I proceed to take off my lower garments and straddle the cone shaped obtrusion in the floor. I position my crotch over the hole and let the fluids free. I feel immediate relief as my urine flow our of my vagina, its warm temperature further relieving me of the coldness about the room. As the drops hit the abyss below me, It echoes back up and for a moment I turn around and spot Dezra still in his position, facing away from me and giving me my privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I'm done, I use the long tail of my robe to clean the residue from around my vagina and then I get back to my feet. I pull the garment back up and let it wrap around my pelvic area. I turn and exit the room and call out to Dezra. \"I'm finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me lock that up belt then,\" Dezra says with a low voice. I can somehow tell that it's a struggle for him, yet there are many reasons for his struggle. I assume that he is sexually attracted to my body, which could explain him coming back for me and him putting this belt on me. It could be the belt that is the source of his trouble. Should I give grace to him and let this belt be done with or should I look out for myself and lock up my belt once more?</span></div></div>",

So, I kindly ask you to hand over the key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDezra is reluctant at first, but it only take a couple of seconds for him to give in and place the key in my hand. He lets go over the stick that crashes to the cavern floor and breathes a heavy sigh before starting to walk back up the stairs. I quickly latch the belt together and use the key to lock it tight. The pressure is there once again, but now I know that it's not on Dezra's shoulders. I put the key around my neck and let it settle in between my breasts before wrapping myself up in my robe. As I start for the stairs, I kick the stick that Dezra had dropped. I pick it up and like him, I strike it against the hard surfaces of the cavern, painting me a purple hazy picture so I can easily navigate back up the stairs. I may be blind, but using my ears and my ability to see sounds, I'm no different than the three upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I get to the top and back into the hallway, I hear a female scream that echoes from the forest and into the caves. It sounded very much like Atoola, Dezra's sister. I quickly make my way to the opening of the cave, but the fur on Dezra's body drowns out the sound waves around him and I literally run into him. \"Sorry,\" I apologize. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Let me call Amersh out,\" he says, tucking me to his side. \"Amersh! What's going on?!\" he shouts to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmersh calls back, but his voice is muffled by the forest.

I am surprised by the sheer vastness of this place. I could tell it had high ceiling, but not this high of a ceiling. As the strong men carry me up two flights of stairs, I sense that their are two balconies that hang from the walls of the tavern. Another flight of stairs and then we are on a whole floor, with the sounds of the tavern being drown out by the cloth on the furniture. I'm carried up another flight of stairs before I'm put in a room where I'm unwrapped and untied. A bucket of cold water is used to clean up the sticky drink and wine from my body before I'm positioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room from what I can tell is small. A breeze blows through what seems like a small window, but it's immediately closed by the men. The substance on the gag is still in effect and it isn't taken off any time soon. I would scream and fight against my captors, but the substance and the gag prevent me from doing so. I'm literally a doll with a soul. Tight cuffs are placed on my wrist and they are suspended above my head. My legs are spread by a spreader bar which has its own set of cuffs that are fastened to my ankles. A piece of furniture with a cushion is place in the center of the room. This piece is like a narrow, yet tall table, the top of which a cushion is fastened. I'm positioned in such a way that I'm on my tiptoes and my legs straddle the table. The cuffs that are suspending my wrist above my head are moved forward and my crotch is further positioned so that my vagina is no longer sitting against the cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis position is no comfortable at all and I'm secured by a cuff that is tight around my waist. Taut ropes or chains tied to the wall keep me from moving and my feet are kept on tiptoes by high-angle wedges. I'm kept from drifting forward by a collar fastened around my neck and a rope or chain pulling me back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men leave, but the familiar sound of boot heels clicking on the floor is heard. \"You may not see anything, but that is for your benefit.

If you do well, you may get to leave early.\" The Madame promptly leaves and exits out of the door. I hear the inserting of a key on the other side and the sound of the door locking. I'm left in the darkness with only the sound of rain and wind pattering against the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, I doze off and sleep in uncomfortable slumber.

The flesh is soft and like raw meat, I want to spit it out, but I can't, since after every withdrawal, the cock is pushed deeper and harder. Silent tears run down my cheeks and I hope that everything around is pitch black just like my vision, since I don't want these men to see my vulnerability shown through my tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men behind me, as they watch me get forced to suck on a man's member, resort to playing with my bottom half. They take turns slapping my ass. The first hit is unexpected and stings. The second stings more, as if the skin has been pulled off and the bared nerves are getting punished. The following slaps stings more and more, until I become numb. I figure I've reddened from the punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's not over. A presence stands behind me and without any warning, puts a large object into my available pussy. He pushes with such force that I scream, but my cry is muffled by the cock in my mouth. My teeth want to clench down, but when I do and my incisors apply pressure to the flesh in my mouth, the man whose penis I've bitten withdraws and slaps me across the face and not just once, but many times for good measure. He is the first to speak out of all of them, but he uses a language foreign to me. Whatever it is, he is angry at me. He probably cursed at me as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slaps across my face as well as the pulling of my hair, causes me to wince and cry, but it's immediately stopped by the re-inserting of the man's member into my mouth. I can only sob as the two dicks penetrate me. Two more dicks penetrate me afterwards, but luckily, they only pay attention to my pussy. Who knows if one of them wanted to go for my ass. It would not end well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men leave the room, leaving me feeling sticky, dirty, ashamed and degraded. As if I am less of a person and more of an animal or more of a carcass preyed upon my carrion beasts. The door opens minutes later and a person, possibly a woman due to her soft and gentle hands, enters. I can hear a pail of water sloshing in a bucket and I figure she is one of the handmaidens who is tasked in cleaning me up so that more men could use me as a tool for their pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels pleasant to be cleaned, but to be stuck in this position is not my cup of tea. I don't think I could last another round. I just wish someone donated a large sum of money so my debt could be paid and I could be out of these place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass and I feel like it's nighttime again. I can hear faint sounds of a party downstairs, but I'm not entirely sure. The handmaiden who cleaned me before opened up the small window and besides the whistle of the cool breeze, I could hear crickets chirping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens ones more and I hear the familiar sounds of boots clicking. It's the Madame. She enters, but several other footfalls strike the stone floor. Could it be her helpers? Could it be another group of her clients? Who has entered the room with her?</span></div></div>",

I guess the clothes I had before were no match for my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know if I'm laying on something or just floating in space. Just as I ponder on the idea of me levitating, I start to rotate, so that my orientation begins to sense that I'm now on my stomach and I was just previously on my back. In my ears I hear a noise. It's like that noise a fax machine makes as it's sending a fax. Is it just a noise that objects I do not see make or is it an alien language? I have so many unanswered questions that it's literally killing me. I try to scream out for help, but even my vocal cords would vibrate at my command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet someone is watching me struggle. No way is there an outside force that would suspend me in space with no control of my own body, this new, unfamiliar body especially; none other than someone intelligent. Could it be aliens?

Was the glove a high priority object that when used, all parties involved, both users and victims, have to be lockdown? Someone with a large bank account could be in charge of this. FBI, CIA, the government in the public eye probably wouldn't risk trying something like this. If not the first two, could it be a mixture of the two? All these thoughts sure do take all the conspiracy theories I thought up in the place out of its college slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can at least thank the people who has control of me that they've given me enough of my wakeful time just to ponder, but now, there is no time for that.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I find myself on the floor of what looks to be a small studio apartment. The room I'm in must be the main living space, with the corners and sides being occupied by a small kitchen, a small desk with an old laptop, a mediocre-sized bathroom with shower and a similar-sized closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm immediately struck with a huge migraine, as if I'm Frankenstein and both my bolts are being screwed tighter. I glance to the side and see a collection of beer cans and green liquor bottles. A glass of lukewarm water sits half-empty with my hand grasping it. I must have passed out from the... I don't remember what chain of events happened before this. All that emcompasses my mind is this swelling headache, possibly due to all the alcoholic beverages I have possibly consumed in the last 24 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's when I sit up when the headache seemingly goes away, for it's not the hangover that surprises me, but the body and clothes I'm wearing. It's the one thing I remember: being a man with a dick in between my legs. I don't remember being a woman. I'm quite certain that I had my manhood connected and well in the last 24 hours. I quickly get to my feet and find a full-sized mirror mounted to the wall. The reflection I see is that of a young woman, probably in her early- to mid-twenties. Her long, brunnette hair is unkempt and dry. The expression on her face is that of a drunk and in my eyes, she is far from being attractive. She looks hideous. Why am I a woman? Why am I one who is waking up from a drunk stupor of all things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wears a wrinkled T-shirt with a weird cat printed on the front. Bulging from her chest are two large breasts that aren't supported by a bra. I raise one of her hands to cup it and find that the size is large than a navel orange, but smaller than the average grapefruit. But they are unusually firm. Implants? Plastic Surgery? The face looks fine, but... I can see minor changes in the nose and cheek bones. How is someone who had work done on her body able to stand living like this? Over two dozen beer cans, about a dozen bottles and trash everywhere. I can't even smell what it would stink like due to her own breath reeking with the lamenting odor of alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't even comment on her legs, which are covered with a worn pair of thigh high socks. Gladly, in the mirror, her shirt is long enough that it covers her crotch area, which to my knowledge doesn't have a dick in between the legs and somehow feels dirty. My curiosity in trying to feel what a woman feels is rejected by the though of having to touch whatever is down there, underneath what could be a dirtier panty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, or unfortunately (depending on how you look at it), there is a loud bang at the front door. I look and see that there is a person standing behind it, but due to poor lighting, I can only see a silhouette behind the blurred window. Luckily, or again, unfortunately, the person behind the door manages to get it open. I see him, or her, come in. There is a small foyer where there are coats and umbrellas hanging from hooks, as well as shoes and slippers. Due to a bunch of stuff hanging over the edge of some shelves right above the door, the person has to bow forward to avoid hitting his, or her, or its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe, she, or it, steps forward and with ample clearance, stands straight up. Who has entered the apartment?</span></div></div>",

He has dark hair which has patches of grey in places. His face is hard and looks like he hasn't smiled in years. He wears a dark coat with a dress shirt, tie and slacks matching his coat's color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he initials comes into the main room, he looks about the place, most notably the mess on the table, in the kitchen and around the mattress near the window that acts as a makeshift futon. It seems nothing in this place isn't going to make him happy and more likely would make him frown more. When he sets his eyes on me, he actually adds more droop to the corners of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" I ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know who I am,\" he answers with a low, almost primal gutteral voice. My pause to understand what he means (but failing to figure out) allows him to speak once more. \"You didn't think we couldn't notice you skipping town after he surgery. You sure ain't one to spook, but we were able to find you with all the bread crumbs you've been leaving out for us. Now it's time to pay up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay up?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb with me... wait, that's it,\" he starts, then halts to take something out of his coat pocket. \"I think this has been on your door for the past week and you probably didn't know.\" He tosses the rolled up wad towards me, with it rolling across the floor and stopping right at my feet. \"Open it.\" I pick it up, one of my eyes warily watching the older man actions. Keeping my eye on him, I open the wad of paper up and find it to be an eviction notice. \"You have a week to pay your rent, but that's not the extent of your troubles. You are in debt to a patient, yet growing impatient loaner, but you didn't think we would add up the interest. You have until 5 minutes from now to pay up, $250,000.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasp at the amount. Not only am I late on a rent payment, which I have no clue how much, I'm in debt to someone who loaned me a hefty loan. Or, possibly one of my parents gambled too much and took out a loan from someone and now they are going to his or her children to pay up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, my headache grows and begins to throb again, causing me to bend in half as I try futilely to press the temples of my head with my fingers. Despite the swelling pain, images start to flood my mind and I'm more or less enlightened of the situation. I see myself as a man, but at the same time, I have thoughts to become a woman. For some reason, I take out a loan to pay for the procedure, which to my growing knowledge seems to be not done by surgery. Whatever it was, it was able to create for me a real, living breathing female body to inhabit. Another memory has me stating reasons it's to make somewhat of a paradox. I take out a loan as a man to pay for a procedure that would turn me into a woman, who more or less, doesn't have to pay back the loan, because she is not the same person. Though, I realize in my ignorance, after traveling to this city and exhausting my finances, my attempt to escape is futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my brief moment of my memories flooding back to me, the man has taken this opportunity to grab a handful of hair as leverage and fling me towards the mattress. He pounces on me and I inadvertently scream for a just a second before finding my hands are pinned above my head and against the floor and a disgusting sock being shoved into my mouth to muffle my cries. I open my eyes and find the man straddling me with the same hard expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tried to be generous, girl, but my boss is growing very impatient. But that doesn't mean we have some options for you,\" the man says. \"You look filthy, but after we clean you up, we can put you on the streets and service the local johns until your debt is paid in full. Or, if you're interested in the fast track, we could set up 50 sessions with fuck groups where they would give you a worthy gangbang. $5,000 for a group of four or more men to fuck you until they are spent... I'd say that's a more useful route. Or you could just pay up by tomorrow. Be prepared and have the money ready and meet me at Pier 39. Your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets up, takes his sock out of my mouth and unpins my wrists from the floor. He calmly, gets to his feet and puts his sock back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, this sock is damp,\" he says and without addressing me any further, he walks out the door. He mutters other stuff too under his breath, about the mountaineering backpack I have stuffed in that upper shelf above the door and the fact that someone as pretty as me could live in a dump like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I'm faced with a dilemma. What route should I take in paying my debt?</span></div></div>",

No way am I going to subject myself to sexual favors or donating my body to a group of sex-hungry fiends for money. If possible, I could negotiate with him tomorrow for either an extension or another option that doesn't involve me sucking a dick or putting one in my pussy or ass. I'm just hoping he'll be as generous as he said he was going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, thinking too much on my dilemma brings back the headache from the alcohol. To subdue it, I crawl over to the bed and try to fall asleep. Instead, I pass out from the shocking pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up and find the clock with both hands pointing in the direction of the twelve. If I recall, it was late afternoon when I passed out. That's a whole day gone and still I'm in a dirty apartment with sweaty clothes and a filthy aura about me. I rush to me feet, getting lightheaded in the process. Fortunately, the hangover is almost out of my system and to fight it, I drink a glass of water from the tap. I quickly get into the shower to wash up, minding not to even try what my curiosity wants to do and touch the more sensitive areas of my body. No way am I going to feel the sensations I would feel if I choosed option A or B. I wash up the best I could, discovering that shampooing my hair is a feat to begin with. Who knew wetting the hair and applying shampoo would make it super heavy. I make sure to soap my body thoroughly to get the filth off of my skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get out of the shower feeling refreshed, but since half of my day is gone, I don't bother drying my hair or completely dry this body off. Although it is sexy to see it in the mirror, I am certain not to think up these kinds of thoughts. I go to the closet and find it is just as messy as the whole apartment. Most of the clothes have fallen off their hanger and the ones I do pick out are simply folded on a shelf, though in a manner that's not as neat that I would like them to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI manage to find a sports bra, thinking I would never find the time or the patience to fashion a decent bra around my artificial bust. I luckily find a matching panty lying around and over them I put on a T-shirt and long-sleeve button-up, the sleeves of which I fold up to make half-sleeves, and a comfortable pair of skinny jeans. I try not to dwell on the thought that said jeans actually makes me feel sexy as it comforms to the shape of my legs, hips, and not to mention hind quarters. In a brief span of an hour, I scour through the mess to find a set of keys to the apartment and a smartphone which seems to have died. No matter how hard I look, I cannot find a charging cord. I do in fact find a wallet with money and cards and also some identification to my person, but finding the hour hand pointing to the one and the minutes hand three minutes away from making it even, I rush out of the apartment with no concern for anything else other than putting on a dirty pair of canvas shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stumble out of the apartment, which looks to be in a less-affluent part of town, and take whatever means to get to the piers. The city of San Francisco is familiar to me as a kid, but after graduated grade school and going to college elsewhere, my memory of the city is blurry at best. Many things have changed last time I was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ride the trolley to the bottom of the hills and run the rest of the way to the right pier. Once there, I find that today is a weekend and the sidewalks and walkways are packed with people. Finding this guy is going to be difficult. Who knows if this guy is here yet. I enter the fray starting from the street with my goal to end at the end of the pier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kind of get lost in the moment and get distracted by the fact that I'm no longer hungover and sprawled on the filthy floor of that apartment. I wonder who in her right mind would pay a whole lot of money to change herself from a guy to a girl and hope to escape and relax and get drunk every night. If anything, if I was that person before all this dilemma with paying back the debt, I would work hard in paying that debt back. I guess this must be a punishment by altering reality, but how it was altered, I'm not sure. This would be my best guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours pass as I check every restaurant, every shop, every level of the pier for the man, but unfortunately, as I near the end of the pier, I have yet to catch a glimpse of him. I discover that finding this man is indeed impossible, since he just told me to meet him the next day. No appointed time. Just a general direction and spot. Nothing specific. Fatigued from looking all over for the man, I slump down on a bench over looking floating debris with sea lions perched on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Early are we?\" a familiar voice asks a question. I look up and find the man with his dark aura leaning over the wooden railing. Either in reality or imagination, not sure which, I can see a smirk on one side of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get up to my feet and start to plead with the man. \"Sir, I want to talk to you about something--\" I start, but he cuts me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabs a hold of my forearm with a grip that even I, in my weaker state as a young woman, can't break. He drags me through the crowd, taking me into a sort of hallway that goes in between a number of shops. He takes me into a souvenir shop and to where the clothes with the name of the city emblazoned on their fronts, backs, on their sleeves and the like. He opens up a door that leads into a dressing stall and gestures me inside. I look around, checking to see if anyway is looking our way and then I stop when I look at his face. \"You wanted to talk about something? Well, in here you can talk and no one will listen in,\" he says, again gesturing me inside. I don't budge, somehow my nervousness has my feet glued to the floor. He has to actually tug at my sleeve to get me inside. \"Lock the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lock the door and find the small room, as big as a closet, is rather dim. The only sources of light are the ones outside leaking into the thin spaces between the stationary blinds as well as the larger openings above and below the door. The is also a light in the ceiling of the stall that doesn't give off much light. With me standing against the door, the man takes a seat on the bench inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have something to say or was that all an excuse?\" the man speaks, asking me a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately plead my case, \"I cannot go through with the options you gave me. I have too much pride to be able to become a sexual worker or have people exploit my body just to get money. So, Sir, if there's anything else that I can do to make it up to your boss, then please let me know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man just sits there, totally relaxed, almost leaning his back against the back of the stall. Even with the light poking through the door, I can barely see the man's face. I don't know if he has that stoic face of his or if he is angry or if he is indeed smile through the corners of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you were a coward,\" he says. His remark shuts me up, though with my face away from the light, I don't think he can see my pissed off expression. \"I did have one last option that you can partake in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what kind of option does he have for me?</span></div></div>",

Walking with him is an option? \"That's it?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. For half a million, you just have to walk with me. We can walk to Market Street,\" he says, almost with joy in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll pay me when we're done walking?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with all these question? You don't trust me? Here,\" he says and takes an envelope from his coat's inside pocket. I take the envelope and in the dim light I see what looks to be money. \"Ten thousand. Five in hundreds and five in twenties. Believe me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the down payment?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not buying you, girl. That's for showing up and not running away. You'll get the rest when we're done,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when with that be?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see his face change to that of utter annoyance, probably due to all the questions. He stands from the bench and reaches for the lock, unlocking the door. My weight against the door causes it to swing out and for some reason, I can feel several eyes looking at me from behind. In the brighter light, the man's face changes from that of utter annoyance to an expression that is the same, but two-fold in frustration. As if an audience is watching and he is performing a forbidden scene. The old man acts fast and turns me around and in quick succession, pushes me out despite the four or five patrons looking on in disgust. An old man and a young woman coming out of a dressing stall together? If we were celebrities, paparazzis would be on us like flies on a turd. The man pushes me out of the store with a hard grip on my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe manage to get back to the street with no more than ugly looks from people we rush past. When it feels like we are being ignored and melding back with the public, the man turns me around and scolds me. \"You must understand that you are in debt. Quarter of a million dollars and not a penny less. If I say I'm going to pay you in full, I mean it. Asking questions of when you will be done does not help you. Understand?\" he says with a calm, yet forceful voice, so as not to garner any more eyes from those who dislike scolders. I nod to his question, feeling both embarrassed and frightened, not at his voice, but by the hand that's gripping my arm, which has tightened. \"This walk is to clear my mind and would give me enough reason to actually give you half a million.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lets me go and goes off to vent at the metal railing. I close the envelope and go over to where he's leaning. I tap his shoulder and he turns to me. \"Here,\" I say, handing over the envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You want to fuck for your money?\" he asks, angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have any pockets big enough,\" I say, timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on to it until we get to Market Street,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's at Market Street?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" he says then starts walking. I start walking after him, positioning myself to be beside him, but a pace or two behind me. I see him take out a device, which could be a smartphone. I hold the envelope close to my body, so as not to get it taken away or it slipping out of my hand. He looks behind and sees me struggling with the envelope in my hand. \"Don't you girls have purses to carry stuff in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left in a hurry. I thought I was late,\" I say, catching up to him in order for my voice to reach his ear through the bustling sound of street and sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Late? I didn't tell you any sort of time to be there,\" he mentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I made it didn't I,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scoffs at the notion, \"Sure, you did,\" but I recognize a bit of sarcasm in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walk across the street towards Stockton Street, which at first looks to be a slight grade, nothing too extreme, but once we get halfway up the street, the slope become more steeper. As we start, we are both side by side, but halfway on, I start to lag behind a couple paces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stops to wait for me before crossing the street. When I get to him, he remarks, \"You young people sure don't get out much. You live in this hilly city and you don't have the endurance to walk up a few steep streets? You should figure out that this walk you are doing with me is for your benefit. Half a mill reward and a better understanding of gravity on a person's legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And sore muscles?\" I add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's good to hear that you're listening,\" he say and starts to cross the street. At the other side, he finishes. \"Sore muscles will turn into stronger muscles if you keep exercising.\" I continue to follow him until we get off of Stockton Street and get on Columbus Avenue. The street is finally level, which eases on my legs, which by now are on fire. The view is amazing too, since in the distance up the street, we see what I would find out is the Transamerica Pyramid, one of the iconic buildings in the city of San Francisco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA block or two down the street, the slope becomes downhill, which is a relief for my legs. We don't stay on the street for long and thirty minutes in, we get off of Columbus and get on Kearny Street, which for the most part is a sort of downhill, yet very level street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of Kearny Street, we finally get to Market Street. Thinking this is our final stop after walking for an hour or so, I ask, \"An hour walk for half a million?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he adamantly tells me. \"We have many other places to visit. A place on Market Street is just one of them. And it'll take more than one day to do them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell--\" I start, but out of breath, my fatigue stops me from saying anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you whining, girl?\" he scolds me. \"Look. You didn't die. You're still alive. Plus, you're not having sex with somebody. You kids have to see more of the positive and stop paying attention to the negative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to get something to eat when we get there?\" I ask once I've caught my breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to know, there is a mall of some kind where we're going. You like pizza?\" he says and asks. I nod, but it doesn't tell him that I can eat anything right now. Walking miles for an hour on an empty stomach does not feel good. \"Good. They have pizza over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walk down what seems like three long blocks until we get to a plaza, actually named the Hallidie Plaza, which is part of of BART station with a shopping center across the street from it. We walk across the street to the mall and enter it. Among the plethora of shops and restaurants, I see Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and a Godiva Chocolatier shop to name a couple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stop and I stop right beside him. \"How are you feeling? Hungry or can you shop for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shop?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You did need a bag to carry stuff in, so I suggest a mountaineering backpack like the one in your apartment. You think I didn't notice? Or just get a jacket, because I do plan on hiking up some hills and crossing the Golden Gate sometime soon. I also hear it's going to rain,\" he tells me. \"If you're not going to decide, I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does the old man go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Are you familiar with the feeling you get when you mistakenly doze off while sitting down? Where you are expected to have a straight posture, but due to fatigue or any other source of something that makes you fall asleep, you start to lean a certain way. But when you hit that certain limit or angle, you are woken up by your own throat, leading to awkward looks from anybody watching?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what happened to me. I remember getting slapped by a hand, but I don't know what for. I find myself in shock that I cannot remember any events prior to me waking up here in this... waiting room?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people in the room sitting down in the seats set up into rows against the walls only momentarily look at me like I'm some freak who doesn't get any sleep. The next moment, they glance the other way, with no concern for me on their faces. They all look young too, or at least, around the same age as me. I feel no change to my body whatsoever. I'm the same Cesar as I was last time I remember, but still, I don't recall why I got slapped several hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door opens and all eyes, including mine, pay their gaze at the open door. A woman dressed in clothes most secretaries wear comes out with a clipboard. She looks about the room and utters a name, \"Cesar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand up, albeit awkwardly, since the same guy who awkwardly made a weird sound while he was sleeping is the same guy being called up. I follow the woman through the doorway and she leads me into another door, just a few steps away from the first. She allows me to enter the door once it's open and I walk inside. Immediately, I see two men dressed in military fatigues and a man sitting behind the desk situated in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cesar, take a seat,\" the man says, gesturing to a chair on the opposite side of his desk. The woman silent walks around the desk to an empty seat next to the man. \"How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I guess,\" I answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure of your decision to donate your body for the greater good?\" the man asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donate my body?\" I ask, in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be aware what you're subjecting your body to, or were you ignorant in that regard?\" the man mentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, this one was chosen from the first pool of volunteers. Surely, he probably doesn't even remember putting his name in the ballot,\" the woman speaks up, her gentle voice calming the man down. \"If you allow me, I can refresh his memory.\" The man gestures his head as a go-ahead for the woman to start explaining. \"Mr. Cesar,\" she addresses me now, getting to her feet as well. \"It has been over a year or so, but you volunteered to donate your body in exchange for a hefty sum being transferred to your bank account. What we to do with your body? Not store it of course. Let me pitch it to you in one example. This here is Lieutenant Thomas Greaves. He is a Army veteran who served in many confrontations with ISIS. He was actually an EOD specialist, dealing with lethal explosives buried underneath roads in the deserts and cities. He was doing well until he accidentally stepped on a landmine. He was able to survive by diving to the side, but in his effort, the explosive maimed his right leg from the knee down. He decided to amputate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man standing to the left lifts his pant leg up and reveals a prosthetic leg mainly built with carbon fiber parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where you come in. There are many people who are physically able to serve in the military, but their mental aptitude prevents them from becoming the best soldiers. We want to minimize casualties, but we also don't want to force people into signing up for the armed forces. With your donated body, we can temporarily transfer your consciousness into a bank, where you will lie dormant for however long you sign up for and then we can transfer Lt. Greaves or anybody else in need of a better body, transfer their consciousness into your body where they can use it to the best of their abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA question comes up, \"What if I don't want my body to be subjected to that type of activity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you sign up, you have the ability to sign up for only a certain kind of activity. But, with less risk, comes a lesser paycheck at the end. It's all up to you,\" the woman says, sitting back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long would I have to do this for?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However long you want. You can sign up for week-long donation, month-long donation, or even year-long donations. You can also set it at random where we can use your body as often as it is available. Just note, that with year-long and random stints, we may have to transfer your consciousness into a temporary body, so as you mind doesn't go mad from waiting, not that there is any wait while you are dormant,\" the woman says, her gentle voice also calming my concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man speaks up and hands me a clipboard with a multi-page document. \"Here is your form. Be specific with the option that are given. Just keep in mind that if you select more options, more funds will be transferred to your bank account.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I sign up for?</span></div></div>",

If there is anything done to my body, the company agrees to reimburse me with a clone of my body. Right after I turn in the paperwork, they escort me to a room with a chair and an unusual apparatus, like some kind of helmet connected to what looks like a box of servers at the end of the room opposite the door. They have me lay myself down on the reclined chair and they attach the helmet to my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a manner of minutes, they more or less suck my soul out of my body. I enter into a pseudo-dormant state, but with no body or reflexes to wake me up, I drift in a sea of black and nothingness. For a very brief moment if feels like I'm drifting endlessly through infinity, but it all becomes just a second of it once a rushing force sucks me backward, so it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel numb. It's as though I've been numb for a while and my nerves are on the verge of waking up. I cannot speak nor utter a sound nor can I scream, for at this moment, all the nerves in my body become active, stining pain shooting all across my body. The sound of a heartrate monitor beeps crazily in my ears and feels like my heart is pounding so fast, I'm on the brink of cardiac arrest. Fortunately, it slows and stabilizes eventually. Five minutes later, the stinging pain has completely subside, though I cannot move just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I can move is my eyelids and when I open that, my eyes see blinding light shining from a multi-light lamp in front of me. A figure hovers above me, blocking the light from above. \"Hello, Mr. Cesar. You are being woken up due to your paperwork. You are now in a temporary party so that your mind does not go blank or insane. Your own body is being used at this moment. I just need you to rest for a few more minutes and we can get you into the Sanctuary,\" the male voice tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do just what he says and rest my thoughts and my body and fall into a short nap.

Less brighter lights, which are found in the bar lights where the ceiling meet the walls illuminate the room. Being a bit wakeful than the last time I was awake, I am more aware of my surrounding, but most especially this temporary body, which feels unfamiliar. I find that it's true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit up and find breasts protruding from my chest and a great voice in between my legs. Black hair, which has a silky touch to it, flows from my head, and down over my shoulders where it meets with my waist line. I look to the side, finding a mirror conveniently placed on a table. The reflection I see is that of an Asian woman. \"What the--?\" I start, stopping myself after hearing my higher-pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately hear a voice from the other side. \"It last only for a minute, but you don't know that it's been three months,\" the female voice says. I look over to the other side and see none other than the woman who pitched me the purpose of the company and what they do with our bodies. \"It's a thing that you people say, when they come out of the mind server.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind server?\" I ask, again surprised by how higher-pitched my voice is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind server, the box, the black ocean, whatever you want to call it. It's the thing that your mind is stored in for three months at a time. We are the first company to utilize it,\" the woman says as she steps up to the flat table. \"It's a bit trippy for your first time, but you don't notice as much when you're back in a body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why this one? Why not a male kind?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure. When we tried to transfer you into one of our clones, the body wouldn't take it. When we finally tried this one, the transfer was seamless. How that means with your original body is iffy. You will be compensated for the inconvenience,\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where is my original body? Is it off fighting a war?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly. The war ended a month ago and your body is back home. I hear he came out without a single scratch. Since you are not due for another transfer in nine months, he is free to use it as he wishes, well according to our code of conduct,\" she tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as I'm not dismembered or in need of amputation, then he can do what he wants with it. I'm getting paid for it all, right?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nods, \"The funds are paid weekly straight into your account as we speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But in the meantime, I'm stuck in this body for nine months or so?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a small sacrifice for the paycheck you're getting,\" she tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do I do for nine months in this body?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are a number of things people do in their temp bodies. Most just live life in a secluded community called the Sanctuary. If you've watched the movie The Island, it's sort of something like that, but all the people have donated their bodies and are willingly living in clone bodies. Some people, for extra cash, enter programs where they are paid to learn and perform for people. There are a few who also use their temp bodies to serve their own original bodies as well. Were you interested in any of those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I head straight to the Sanctuary or do I perform these extra activities?</span></div></div>",

We'll have everything prepared for you. Down to your name and information as well as other things to keep you occupied,\" the woman says. \"We just need you to get dressed.

When you're ready, I'll send for the transportation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going exactly?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sanctuary Outskirts,\" she tells me. \"When clients rent out bodies, but don't want to run into the people who recognized them, we keep them in housing in place where no one will recognize them. They are close to the Hubs of the company. They are like temporary housing most especially enjoyed by those in law enforcement and armed forces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's not far then?\" I ask, rotating my body so I can step off the table.

He can refuse the service though at any time,\" she says. \"So I'll just leave you to get dressed. I will gather some clothes for you as well as fill them in some luggage. We will also program another keycard for the place you'll be staying at. He'll be informed of your arrival well before than.\" She gives me a nod as a farewell and leaves the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk over to the corner closet, finding the way I should way is much different to how I'm use to. I figure it's because of the weight on my chest and the void between my legs are the main factors to my gait. Luckily, I'm not wearing heels, so I walk barefooted to the closet without much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open it and find a collection of women's clothes. Dresses as well as shirts and pants. Flat-soled shoes and heels of course line the bottom of the closet. They even have hats too. Figuring there wouldn't be any time to try them all, I go for a T-shirt that fits my chest, but not before finding the undergarments in a drawer above the shoes. I pick out a black pair that is made out of lace, which is comfortable after fastening it and sliding it onto my body. I insert my legs into a pair of skinny jean, which fit to the shape of my legs as well as accentuate the curves of my lower body. Indeed my hips are wider and my ass is proportioned to my breasts, which I find are larger than navel oranges but smaller than grapefruits. In clothes, I just look like an average woman. To finish the look, I find a hair-tie and manage to make a tight ponytail of my long hair. It helps to get the locks out of the way when I finish with a tan-colored parka, a pair of black socks and a pair of black and white canvas sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole dressing takes a total of what seems like thirty minutes, since I did have to take time to pick which clothes to wear. Just when I finish, the woman comes back in with another man who holds a total of three pieces of luggage. She addresses me, \"Jen. This is what your name will be. We figured you would have opportunities to wash clothes over there so we just gave you the essentials in these suitcases. This backpack here is good for mountaineering, but we put gear that will help you learn a few things while you're away. Several devices linked to our database. Either if you want to contact someone like me or you want to learn how to cook something. It will all be there.\" The man puts the suitcases down and extends both pull handles so that we can just roll them out. The woman hands me the backpack and I put it on my shoulders. The weight is light, but there is some burden to it. I probably can't go five miles wearing this thing. \"I've asked the man who just left to ask for transport, so I'm just going to escort you to the station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Station?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The company's Hub, which is like a whole city in and of itself, has its own train station. People who use it are mostly the technicians and employees who lived away from work, but they are connected to the stations in the other cities. I've arranged a private train car for the use of transporting you to the Outskirts,\" she tells me and turns on her heel and starts walking. She grabs the handles of the suitcase and walks them out the door. I immediately follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk goes down a hallway that becomes a bridge of sorts that spans a space above what she tells me is the actual Sanctuary, a massive plaza sitting underneath a large glass window. The walk is long, but at the end which connects to a ring around the Sanctuary, we arrive at the station label North. We arrive just in time and the train pulls into the station silently. One of the doors open and behind we see the man who the woman just came with. He takes the luggage and offers me his hand so he can assist me in boarding the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take it and step onto the train from the platform. I turn around and find that the woman isn't coming. She reminds me that all the things I need is in the backpack. The doors close and without any more words, the train slowly lurches forward before gradually speeding up. I'm almost knocked off my feet if it weren't for the man standing directly behind me. Above the hum of the train speeding along its track, he tells me he will assist me with my bags, but once I arrived, it will only be me and my own device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train ride is longer than I thought, but considering if I did the trek on foot, it would take me the majority of the day. To keep me occupied, the man shows me one of the devices that is pulled from a side pocket. It looks like a metal bangle, but made in a non-metallic compound. It serves as a heartrate monitor, pedometer as well as a mood ring. I put it on and it immediately turns into a color that he says means I'm nervous. The ring changes color again when he smiles, since internally I feel either embarrassed or relieved of some of my nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe promptly arrive at he closest station to the housing where my body is staying. We walk the rest of the way, since it is within a mile of the station. The buildings here are not like the buildings I saw in the Sanctuary from the bridge. Buildings in Sanctuary are ultra-modern, almost futuristic. Buildings in the outskirts are old-designs, present-modern and rustic. The very housing where I'm staying is the largest on the block and is the house that sits at the end of the middle cul-de-sac of a five-finger roundabout. It looks like a glass house with several floors that sit jagged from each other. What looks like a central staircases connects all these floors together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man carries my luggage to the door, where I unlock it with my programmed key. He is able to enter into the foyer and drop my luggage for me. After bidding him farewell, I enter into the house and close the door behind me, minding to lock it as well. I turn to face the interior of the house, but find a very serious person -- my own body -- pointing a gun at my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, I put my hands up. One of the hands holds a keycard. The man swipes the card from my hand and when I try to reach and retrieve it, he pushes the barrel of the gun to my forehead. It looks like he wasn't expecting me to enter his house with no greeting. Is this so? Or is there another reason?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the cold metal barrel of the gun pressed onto my forehead, I instinctively step back, but all that garners more attention from the one using my body. \"Don't move and put your hands up,\" he says, using my voice that I'm all too familiar with. Anger with my voice sounds authoritative. I wonder if I was like that, was I intimidating as he is right now? I do what the man says, putting my hands up, keeping my elbows at ninety degrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe keeps the gun pointed at my head as he stashes the keycard into the back pockets of his pants. He rounds to my left, using his other hand to grab a hold of the back of my shirt's collar. With his hand outstretch, he can keep me at bay while keeping me still so if he does pull the trigger, it would meet its mark in the back of my skull. He uses this position to check the door, opening it only so much so as to peek and check the outside area. He comes back in and closes the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the gun pressing against the back of my head, he orders to me, \"Your backpack. Hand it to me. Slowly.\" I keep my hands up as he tells me to do this. When he emphasizes for me to do it slowly, I follow. I lower one of my raised hands, but keep the other one raised, still at ninety degrees, and with the lowered hand I take the strap off the same shoulder the arm is attached to. I remove my arm from the strap and raise the same hand once more. I do the same with the other strap, but instead of removing my arm, I let the bag, which isn't really heavy, fall by itself off my shoulder and onto my forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hand the bag to the man behind me and feel him grab the bag. I hear him shoulder the bag and seconds later, he grabs a hold of my arm. He presses the gun to my shoulder blade and pushes me forward, which causes me to walk. He leads me into a larger room and from there into what looks like a kitchen. He takes me over to the refrigerator, where he rummages through a drawer that's situated next to the large appliance. He takes out what sounds like a chain and closes the drawer. He takes me over to what lookslike a partial room divider that designed to look like prison bars, but with shelves built in to it. He take my wrist and secures cuffs to both of them, locking them as they go around one of the bars, securing me to the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaves me to simply watch him as he goes through my luggage and my backpack. He takes out things that seem unfamiliar to the average person and puts back things such as clothes and shoes. He seems interested in the devices that have been put in my backpack and as he examines them, he is frustrated that he can't get them to turn on. He then discovers me looking at him from the bar he had cuffed me to. He walks over and puts his face next to mine. \"You have trackers on those things. Are you wearing a wire of some sort?\" he asks, rather forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't---\" I start, but he cuts me off, with his laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They never learn, do they?\" he says, though I'm unsure if he's talking to me or himself. It's hard to imagine myself as being like this. Frustrated. Like he also knows what so frustrating. \"Bring in a servant who doesn't know anything about the things in her stuff. She doesn't even know about the bugs and trackers. Did they tell you that that wristband of your activates the thing and that these tablets would show you how to do stuff?\" I gulp, a clear sign that that's what I heard the woman say, before sending me off on the train. \"Sure they would.\" He lifts his hands and delivers a quick, yet sharp and stinging flick to my temple with his finger. \"Send in a three-monther. They never learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see him walk away to the very same drawer he took the cuffs from. He takes out what looks like a silencer and he attaches it to his gun. He picks up the tablets, three in total in one hand, holds them up and after looking away, fires his gun, sending one bullet through each device. The bullet actually is embedded in the last one, the most thickest of the three. He then discards them in his trash compactor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe goes back to me and tells me, \"You don't need those tablets. Ever heard of the Internet. YouTube. That will be enough for you to learn stuff. As for now, you are a sort of guest in my house. But you don't get your own room to sleep in. I don't have that many beds for that, unless you don't mind sleeping on the sofa. If you do mind, you'll have to sleep in my bed. You will cook your own food, clean your own clothes, but fortunately, you get your own bathroom, understand?\" I silently nod. \"Promise me you won't scream or try to run away, because the way I see it, you're in the Outskirts. Not an employee for the company for at least a mile. They don't post them at the Outskirt station. Plus, you're loaned a clone to use as a temporary. Running away means you're stealing the property of the company. If you do scream, you're getting one of these in the head. And I'll tell you, you're not the first clone I've killed.\" After explaining, he removes the cuffs from my hands and allows me to step away from the bar. He takes his gun and leaves from my sight, down a hallway that leads else where in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath, finding that this is the first moment where I'm not in a tense mood or feeling. I'm able to breathe freely without fear that a bullet would strike the back of my head. I look over to my luggage and see how strewn the clothes are. I fix everything and take them down the hallway the man just walked down. I find a staircase at the end that lead both up and down to other floors. I see light coming from upstairs, so I assume he had ascended to an upper floor. I take the stairs leading down and when I get near, a light turns on after my motion triggers a sensor. The whole hallway is lit up and I see a total of three doors, two to my left and one to my right. All of them are closed. I figure one of these rooms should be a bedroom. Which should I try?</span></div></div>",

I can feel a gentle finger tracing along body, what is supposed to be a temporary body for me to dwell in before getting my original male body back. The finger traces along my skin and when it gets to a certain part, I can feel it due to the nerves in that certain area reacting to the contact. I discover I have breasts coming out of my chest, due to the finger, along with a thumb, pincing the nipple. Also the whole hand the finger belongs to, cups and squeezes each breasts, allowing me to know just how big they actually are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger guides itself lower, in between my legs, where I'm surprised there isn't a member attached or swinging freely. A great void and is replaced by something that is flush with the shape of my pelvis, which I also find is wider and more shapely. The finger touches along a sensitive area and what feels like a cross between euphoria and lightning shoots through my body from my toes to the top of my head as the area is touched. Indeed what I have is a vagina. The jolt of pleasure causes me to flinch and moan, but the moaning is muffled by a ball gag in my mouth. I also find that my arms are outstretched above my head, shackled with locked to a chain hanging from the ceiling. I try to struggle, but find that when I do so, my wrists take all the weight. It seems that I'm hanging and that my feet are not on solid ground but in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands, whose fingers are a bit more rougher and larger grab my feet and start tying rope to them. The hands create a makeshift pair of cuffs that only has a half-foot-long piece of rope between them. The same hands with arms lift me and make me straddle what seems to be the roof of a dog house, but mounted on this roof are two tubular objects. When I'm lowered onto them and each are inserted both in my pussy and my ass by the gentler hands, I figure out what they are. Both are two long dildos, which when I'm lowered onto them and gravity pulls me down, they fill me almost completely. I want to gasp for air, but it's hard with the ball gag in my mouth, causing me to resort to breathing through my nostrils. It seems all of this wasn't done in a pitch black room since when the lights enter through my eyes, I discover I have been blindfolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the temporary blindness subsides, I am shocked to see....?</span></div></div>",

It feels like they are hanging from the ceiling, due to the weight that is upon my wrists. I find myself in a small room with a dirt floor. Whatever light comes into the room must be entering a small window right behind me. Everything else is darkened. The walls, the ceiling, the floor, even the door that sits right across from me is blanketed in shadow. But my surroundings is the least of my worries and concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat dominates my thoughts and thinking is the body I'm in right now. It was obvious with the silky hair flowing from my head, but the fact that I'm no longer a man hits home when I look down at a cleavage that is made by two gloves that protrude from my chest. I feel I'm only wearing this dirty blue tank top. My legs are adorned by a pair of skinny jeans and my feet are bare, yet floating above the cold floor. I have no feeling around my crotch area, telling me my manhood is non-existent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere am I? Who am I now? How did I get here? Many questions that are unanswered begin to manifest in my head and with them piling up, I start to get desperate. I pull up on my bound wrists, against the rope and chain that suspends my body above the floor. I can only manage to lift my body weight and get my head to my wrist only a couple times before I become exhausted. I glance down and watch as the two melons rise and fall as I catch my breath. My thoughts begin to dwell on the theory that I have been put here by a person or multiple people. What are their intentions for putting me here? For some reason, I can't come to a positive conclusion. The one that tops the list is that I was put here so that I couldn't resist even one person from touching this body. With how big these breasts are, I have no doubt someone of the opposite sex would see them and be attracted. Hell, if I was looking at this body, I would be too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door knob jiggles, but doesn't turn probably due to it being locked. I hear voices behind the door, but they are muffled. I can only watch helplessly as the door knob jiggles again and again. The fourth time, I hear a distinct sound as if the door had been unlocked. It seems like it has been unlocked, since the moment, it opens as it is pushed from behind. Who enters the room? </span></div></div>",

Once this man is in the room, the door closes behind him. This man, who smokes a cherry cigar, approaches me and whatever light can come in illuminates the features of this man. His face is sinister, as if he has an ulterior motive. His clothes seem like he lives on an island. His white hair tells me his apparent age, which could be twice the age of myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe somehow senses the fear I have right now. He could do anything to me, since I'm at a disadvantage, defenseless with my hands above my head and with no strength or leverage to kick my feet up. He speaks to me, \"Do not be afraid, young lady. You are safe here. I'm sorry for keeping you here like this, but I felt it necessary. In your panicked state, I believe you would cause more harm to yourself rather than others.\" His speech has a heavy accent applied to it and I can barely make out what he is saying half the time. \"Your friends tried to storm estate, but they soon met their demise at the hands of my army. I'm sure they are gone from this world and their plans to stop me have been thwarted. You on the other hand, I plan to keep safe, away from anything that would defile such a beautiful creature. You need not carry a rifle to put this into motion. I have other plans for that.\" His talking is as sinister as his face and I can barely understand why or what he is talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks back to the door and knocks it. In comes the muscular man. He is tall and wears a tank top that does little to cover the muscles of her torso. Even with my body upright and on its tiptoes, the man could very well stand a foot taller than me at least. The man with the cigar gestures to the man and the muscled man approaches me. His face is stoic, though not as sinister as the man smoking the cigar. He quickly places large hands on my hips and effortlessly lifts me up. This lifts the rope out of the hook dangling from the ceiling. Once down, I find I'm too fatigued and sore everywhere to move an inch. My limp body is easily carried out of the room and down a series of hallways until eventually stopped in an elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the trip, I doze off and fall asleep for only a couple minutes. I try to stay awake so that I know where the man is taking me, but it's hard. I do realize that the accented speech of the man smoking the cigar is non-existent. The only odor I smell is the sweat on this man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lift reaches its designated floor and the man carries me into a room. The room is spacious and looks like a condominium. I spy a full kitchen and living room area. The man takes me to the bedroom and therefore to the bathroom. Has he taken me here to clean me up? He sits me on the tiled edge of a clean pool of water and proceed in untying the knots around my wrists. Even sitting upright, I'm too tired to even stay awake. I doze off a couple of times, but every time I do, the man shakes me awake. It's when he opens up his mouth that I make a commitment to keep myself awake. It's what he says to me that's important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seeks to pamper you in order to make you his bride. It was a fool's errand sending a four-man team to infiltrate and try to assassinate the tyrant. It was foolish to send a woman in as well. Your team is dead, possibly to the hand of his army. He may promise you riches, but it's a trap,\" he says to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cough due to not having said anything. I clear my throat in order to speak. I ask, \"Why are you telling me this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I too tried to assassinate him. Instead of killing me, he had me tortured to the brink of death. He offered me mercy if I join his side. By then, I couldn't say no. His methods are ... barbaric. I tell you, girl. You do not want to get on his bad side,\" he tells me as he undoes the last knot and releases my wrists from bondage. \"Now get cleaned up. Shower is just over there. I'll be outside if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man leaves the room and doesn't come back for a couple of minutes. I push myself up and start undressing. The mirror right across from me does not help in hiding my new body to my eyes. Surely, with my male mind still in my head, I find the body that is being exposed before my eyes rather attractive. No wonder that man with the cigar wanted me to be his bride. The man also hinted that there was no way out of this place either. Once undressed, I struggle to walk over and up the steps to the shower. It's ornate and wonderful to see. Surely this man has money enough to put a modern shower in a rustic setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI manage to get inside and get all the shower nozzles to flow, immediately drenching me in clean water. I can finally see the filth start flowing down the drain. I struggle with the soap and before I know it, I start to groan due to the pain I'm feeling. It's hard to reach behind me as well as bend over, something a body like this could easily do, but with sores all over, it's rather difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when a sturdy wall plants itself behind me. A muscled log of an arm wraps itself around me and the opposite hand runs itself over my arms and legs, making sure to get most of the filth off before the soaping starts to happen.</span></div></div>",

My voice cries out with a high-pitched groan as the pain sends me falling to my back, my hands clutching my head. The throbbing and pain only lasts a quick second, which leaves me almost breathless. My heart pounds fast in my chest and my torso heaves up and down in quick successions, which also allows my breasts to rise and fall as I catch my breath. I stare up at the ceiling as if I can see beyond the drywall and paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flashback billows into view and I close my eyes in order to drown out the cloudiness. I am in a position that is quite similar to how I'm laid out on the bed. In this vision though, I can actually feel my whole body, as if I were really there. I can tell I'm naked and laying on a cold table. It's not comfortable and the leather bindings around my wrists and ankles don't help. I'm quite aware of my surroundings, but not quite able to move. A figure, a woman, enters my field of view, putting something around my head that I can actually see. She straps it to my head, hearing the velcro rip apart and get reattached as it is securely wound around my head. The woman smiles at me. She has a somewhat tanned complexion which is shadowed as her head blocks the large lights right above me. She smiles as she tucks her hair behind her ear. She reaches towards my lower region and pats what I feel is a pleasant sensation, but isn't pleasant in this context. In this vision I'm still a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe speaks to me regarding my manhood. I hear her say, \"Not too long now. You'll be in for a whole new package, filled with a series of new sensations in your new self. Where you're going, you won't be needing this anymore. Sweet dreams.\" Immediately after her mock farewell, my vision blacks out, but immediately fades back into the same scene. The very same light shining down into my eyes. My head is able to move side to side, but that is pretty much it in terms of how much I can move. When I turn to the left, I see an empty table with wires leading to various machines. I turn my head to the other side and there I see the very same woman. She greets me, \"Hello there,\" before dismounting the counter she is sitting on. She walks over to me and touches my forehead. \"Feel any different?\" As she's asking me this, she traces a finger down my body and to various places that causes me to wince. The first is straight to a nipple on my chest, but what makes me wince and writhe at her touch is how hard is pinches it. It also sends a sensation down the whole area around the nipple which makes me aware of the pair of breasts on my chest. She traces a finger down further, along my flat abdomen to the space between my legs. Even as she gently runs her hand along the region, I squirm even more, more for the unfamiliarity and less on the intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no normal body that you're in, love, for you and I are alike,' she says before holding up a mirror to my face. I'm shocked to see her face in the reflection showing the shocked expression that I'm feeling. \"Isn't it great? Not only do you look like me, but you have all of my memories, so you don't get confused on who you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy vision blurs into a different scene, where I'm sitting in a holding cell that has a clear pane of glass that shows the back of a man. When the man turns around, I'm shocked to see my male self standing there with the very same mocking smile that woman had. I find myself up on my feet and sending a futile punch into the window. The punch hurts my hand and the window doesn't have a scratch. I hear myself talk and even if the voice is drowned out by the window, his point hits home. \"Struggle all you want. The next time you wake up, you'll no longer have your memories. You might recognize me in passing, but you won't remember your old self anymore.\" He leaves after that and I bang the window numerous times before I get tired. I remember sobbing myself into a slumber of forgetfulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last vision I receive has nothing for me to see at all, for I only hear numerous things in my ears. I hear it rushing as fast as a crashing wave and as loud as a rock concert and I'm in the front row. I do feel one sensation thought and it's of someone carrying me and laying me down. I feel my own self turn over onto my stomach before the sounds and my sensations subside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my eyes and see the same motel ceiling again. I sit up and get to my feet. My eyes lock onto the mirror, which is mounted on the far wall, hovering over the black counter sink. There in its reflections is none other than the woman from my visions. As I draw closer to it I start to remember things. A certain person occupies my thoughts, against my will. The interior of a house accompanies it and I feel a pleasant sensation rush over my body. Then I get a memory that is something like a command or a verdict. This man is a top secret agent posing as an office worker. Memories of me being tasked with watching this man start to surface. What I feel are recent memories start to dominant my mind and I remember that the ruse that that woman had established was starting to unravel and she was forced to withdraw in the form of her being taken away by government officials. Now, as I am identified as her, I'm forcibly sent back on her mission to monitor this man. Immediately, without even thinking it, I start to remember how distant we were. There were tons of secrets and those secrets managed to keep us separate. The both of us are an estranged pair. How was I connived into becoming her in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A massive pain in my head comes upon me so quick that I have no time to react. I teeter over the edge of the bed and end up on the floor. All I can manage is pressing my temples with my fingers as hard as I can press them. Unfortunately, I'm not relieved and the increasing pain sends me into a half-conscious state. One second I'm writhing on the floor, the next I'm standing on an almost empty street corner on a cold night after hours. I'm bundled up with a down jacket and tennis shoes with something in my hands. I look down to see that it's a plane ticket. The stub is still attached, so I must be on my way to the airport. That's when someone bumps into me. It's a woman, under-dressed in a sweater dress and thin stockings and heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Excuse you!\u201d I say to the woman, but it seems like she doesn't hear me as she puts her purse down near the pole with the button to turn on the crosswalk indicators. \u201cHey I'm talking to you--!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I call out to her again, she slowly turns and somehow it's her solemn and expressionless face that cuts me off. She stares into my eyes with her own. I look into her eyes and get a feeling of dread wash over me. Her face isn't made up at all and it looks like she didn't get much sleep. There are dark circles under her eyes with lips that are chapped and dry. With them, she smirks. I'm very confused at her gesture, but I'm oblivious to see the signs around her when I'm focused on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engines of car grow louder, signaling they are accelerating. What I don't see is that the woman is stepping backward onto the crosswalk that currently has moving traffic. It's obvious the crosswalk signal has a red hand that tell walkers to stop and surely, she didn't press it. Luckily, for the first second, there is no cars in the lane where she has stepped foot on, but the next second, accompanied by a screech of tires on wet asphalt, a low horn and the massive block of metal and glass of a moving bus. The metal and mass of the bus hits the woman, who disappears from my sight as the bus block her from view. Whoever was on the sidewalks gasp and women scream. More screeches from tires as well as the sounds of metal colliding with metal is heard in the distance. Did that woman single-handedly create a pile-up in this intersection. Even though I'm a bit terrified and shocked to see the woman get hit, I avoid being the hero and dash out into the intersection. I do the very opposite actually. I see the bag that has been left by the street pole and I rush to snatch it and with it, I run down the sidewalk in the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vision blurs and I find myself back in the motel room, staring at the ceiling. The pain in my head somehow must have dissipated from my skull as I vividly experienced that vision. I get to my feet and head to the bathroom to wash my face, but as I do so, I'm surprised to see the face of the very same woman as I look at the mirror. Though she has the same hair and skin color, she looks much different in this reflection, for her hair is disheveled and her eyes have a heavy amount of makeup. For a second, I believe the makeup was made for a sex worker, but when I see the clothes that she's wearing, I deduce this woman is more like a social outcast, maybe even someone who's way of life involves conning people and selling illegal goods. What shocks me more is that I'm that person. \u201cCrap,\u201d I say with the very same voice that had called out to the suicidal woman. So I was there that night. Did I eventually take that plane ride? And do I still have that bag?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn around and I see the very same bag on a suitcase leaning on the wall next to the door to the room. For some reason, I know the bag is not mine, for the suitcase is the only thing that I own. I walk over to grab the bag and at once, I empty its contents onto the bed. My mouth widens in surprise and I say, \u201cShit.\u201d What do I find in the bag?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I'm surprised at how heavy the bag is. In the vision, I didn't notice how heavy it was, just in the moment, I was too focused on getting out of there. I wonder why I did that. Was the theft of a dead woman's purse too far out of my moral compass that I had to swiftly remove myself from the scene?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tip the bag over to empty the contents and I find out why the bag was so heavy. Cushioned by the unmade blanket, a gun, holstered in a leather sling and a police badge are among the things that fall out of the bag. Upon closer inspection, the badge folds out to show an ID of the very same woman who stepped in front of that bus. Hardly any makeup, obviously, and her hair tied back neatly in a ponytail, the mugshot of the woman is a sharp contrast to the woman I am. She has the same face, but if one were to see me, they'd think I'd be more similar to a criminal than a cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds after touching the badge with my fingers, I find a familiar pain in my head, slowly throbbing into the same intensity that sent me to the floor. This time, I manage to stay on my feet and only lean over the bed and supporting my weight with my arms. Another vision begins and the motel room fades from my sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of visions, most of them crime scenes gruesome enough to make me gag and potentially make me vomit, flash over my eyes. I gain insightful knowledge about the identity of the woman I just witnessed killing herself. I begin to wonder why I'm even seeing things through her perspective. Am I telepathic in a way, somehow able to see things about certain objects when I touch them? That's when I realize after seeing through the woman's eyes, when she touches a person's body with ungloved hands, things a normal human being couldn't see would rush into her mind. I discover because of this, lately she has been tired and fatigued, even fainting in the middle of an investigation and getting paid leave. It's then I see the glimpse of her partner. He's handsome, but I figure by the way she acts, she is not at all attracted to him. There's an aura of an older brother about him as well as an edgy relationship with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe connection I have with the object severs as it falls from my hand and upon picking it back up, I no longer can see the visions it gave me seconds before. Since I can recollect everything I had seen while touching it, is it possible it could only happen once? Convenient, yet inconvenient at the same time. I get a feeling that this ability to see into objects was the very thing that caused her to become tired and eventually, end her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits me. If I have the same power and more or less, I am an identical twin to this woman, I could somehow ditch this grungy look for this sophisticated persona of a strong law-abiding career woman. The vibrating of a phone takes me out of my reverie. I find it near the gun sling. I pick it up and see that the screen is cracked. When my thumb runs over it, another vision takes over my mind. I find myself in a rather expensive looking kitchen. I feel like I'm half-naked, wearing only an over-sized dress shirt and a contrasting black apron. I'm standing at an induction range cooking breakfast, but by the looks of the charred pieces along the side, I'm not a very good cook. I then realize that this vision is not my vision, but the perspective of the woman again. Of course, I touched her phone, therefore, I'm looking through her own eyes. The phone sits on the counter, but the crack is nowhere to be found. The screen is pristine, with no deformities or damages on it. Suddenly, and very intimately, two strong arms wrap around my smaller body and pull me back towards a sturdy torso, to which I immediately melt. A warm kiss plants itself on my neck and my hand inadvertently places itself on the counter over the phone. In my ecstasy, I lose control for a second as the woman calls out with a breathy voice, \u201cOh, Vince.\u201d My hand grips the counter too hard and the phone underneath it slips over the edge, falling to the floor. Without breaking the intimacy of the moment, I reach down for the phone which garners the very crack that sent me into this experience. The very same crack ejects me back into the motel room. Vince. Is he a lover? Boyfriend of this woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone in my hand vibrates again and I turn it on. A lock screen lights up and on it, it asks for a fingerprint scan. I press my finger and slide it downward towards the bottom of the phone and to my surprise, it unlocks. How could this be? If that woman was my twin, wouldn't she have a different fingerprint? How would the both of us have the same fingerprint?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone vibrates yet again, knocking me out of my reverie. I see on the phone over what looks like an SMS icon, there is over ten message from two people. A dozen of them are from this Vince this woman called out to in my vision. Ten or so more are from someone named G. Before I can read even one of these message, the phone vibrates yet again, but accompanied with a ringtone. A caller ID appears and the option to answer appears right below it on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho has called the phone? And should I answer it?</span></div></div>",

This person  simply titled with the name 'G' on the caller ID. I don't know who he is or why he is sending so many messages and at a time of 3:23am in the morning, why is calling me. I decide to put the phone down and let it ring until it stops. Eventually it does and a notification goes off and I find that it's a voicemail message, one of seven that have been left on the phone's voicemail-box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes the phone only beeps to notify me of incoming e-mails and trivial messages from the phone's apps. I take a seat on the side of the bed and reach over to the phone, where I have place it beyond the gun. I mistakenly brush my fingers on the handle and I'm sent into another vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it's dark and I'm outside. The very object that has pulled me into this vision is in my hands. My finger isn't on the trigger, but I assume it's for safety. Don't want to shoot anything that can get me into trouble. With my gun in my right hand, the wrist it's connected to sits on the top of my left wrist, the hand connected to that wrist holding a flashlight that illuminates what looks to be an alleyway. I sense a presence behind me, but it's too late to react. The figure grabs me from behind and overpowers me with a choke hold. I discover I'm at the very least agile enough to take the handle of my gun and jab it backwards towards the mugger, breaking his hold on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find myself falling with my back to the ground, caught up in the midst of a vision, which probably transferred to me when I touched the person's body with the hand that had dropped the flashlight. I quickly see a glimpse of a gruesome murder in cold blood through the eyes of the murderer. I'm terrified to see the victim was someone who looked just like me, but with blonde hair and hazel eyes. She was choked to death in her bedroom. This vision possibly has me in a vulnerable state, but its hold weakens and I'm back in the dark alleyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light from my flashlight illuminates the man who grabbed me from behind. He has a deranged expression on his face, but fortunately, I discover the light isn't illuminating my face. He still hasn't seen the very same face of his previous victim on my face. Out of his boot, he draws a large hunting knife. He draws closer and I reel back, trying to feel with my hands for my gun, which was knocked out of my hand. I find it and grab it, but the man is one step ahead of me. He grabs my foot and pulls me towards him. The light from the flashlight hits my eyes and the man's face changes to one of a madman to a guilty face on the verge of tears mixed with fright. I point the gun at the man and pull the trigger. The gun clicks, telling me I forgot to disengage the safety, but the sound of a gunshot is heard and I assume that it was mine who pulled the trigger due to how much the gun shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's grip on my ankle weakens and he falls to the floor. Directly behind him is a comforting sight to see. \u201cG,\u201d I call out and I find it's my partner. The vision fades and I'm back in the motel room again. For some reason, I'm led to believe that it was G was the one who fired the killing shot. Caught in my vision, I must not have had to focus to answer two more calls from Vince as well as four message from him. Before I can check the messages, there is a knock at my door. Who could it be at this hour? And like the phone, should I answer it?</span></div></div>",

In fact, his impatience while waiting outside the door is a bit intimidating. Then I remember. This man is the very same man I saw in my vision. This man is my partner, whom I refer to as simply \u201cG.\u201d I had ignored his last message, but ignoring him twice by not answering to him knocking the door is pushing it. Part of me wants to open the door, the part that is connected to my past self, the previous self, the man. I do not know this man at all, apart from him being this woman's partner. Part of me wants to ignore him a second time, the part that is of the current persona in this body, the woman who looks to be part of the streets. In my balancing of the scales between the personas of the previous and the next, the man behind the door gets impatient. I spy out the peephole again to see him take out his phone and bring it to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the phone on the bed rings and vibrates loudly. I look over and somehow I can tell that this man's name comes up on the caller ID. \u201cJo, it's Greg, open up!\u201d the man shouts and he bangs on the door. So I'm Jo? I can recall on the identification card that came with the badge, typed in bold letter the name 'Jo Masculana.' My decision to become this Jo, this detective, is sure coming fast, maybe too fast. With the phone ringing and this woman's partner behind the door, it's very difficult not to open the door. When the man knocks again, this time more harder, as if with the bottom of his fist instead of his knuckles, and shouts, \u201cI know you're in there, Jo! I hear your phone ringing,\u201d I drop everything regarding avoiding any contact with the man and go to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI unlock the door and unlatch the chain from its rail. I twist the knob and pull the door open. When I reveal myself, the man's demeanor changes from an expression of impatience to that of relief combined with shock. It's as if he hasn't seen his partner in ages. I find myself stuck in the moment, not knowing how to answer the opening of the motel room door with words. How should I act towards this woman's partner?</span></div></div>",

The walls are still adorned with posters of scantily clad women and supercars, but what is different is that the closet is virtually empty. Every garment that would be considered fit for a man is gone, even the shoes. I guess this explains why I'm no longer a man. Yes, the body I find myself in is a woman, complete with the differing reproductive organs and the sensations they can feel. Judging from the smooth skin with no evidence of old age, this is the body of a young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not naked, though I'm not fully clothed either. When I peel the blanket from my body, I reveal a light pink nightie that does a good job in covering my breasts, which have added a considerable weight to my chest, and also my crotch, which feels to be covered with an additional garment made of the lightest fabric. I pull the bottom hem of the nightie and there covering where my pussy and ass is a panty in a color that matches the larger one. It actually feels like it's more like a thong, where a thin piece of the garment has slipped in between my ass cheeks, which would expose more of my ass cheeks in addition to the slender arms and legs that the larger nightie exposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swing my legs out over the edge of the bed and push myself off the top of it. Immediately after my feet land on the floor, I can literally feel like I'm shorter than I was before. Using the top of this full size mirror for reference, I remember that the top of my head would align perfectly with the top of the mirror. Now, in this different body, the top of my head would literally align itself to the speck on the mirror where I remember when my chin would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also feel an unfamiliar sense of balance, for with these weighty globes on my chest and the absence of a male reproductive organ between my legs, it's difficult just to stand when your familiarity of standing did not incorporate either of these factors. I even have to grab a hold of the wall just to figure out how to take my first step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not in a panic, which is unusual given that I'm in a different body and possibly with the people living in this house, they must be used to seeing me as a man rather than a woman. For some reason, I'm calm, even though I remember one of my roommates slapping me with the intent of making me a woman. I cannot explain why I'm not bother by this significant event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath and start to walk out of my room. The door is open, but to my surprise, there is no one in the hallway outside. Everything seems to be the same as when I left it when I moved out and went to college. I look over the banister and I see the living room below as well as the front door. The layout is rearranged, but that's it. I can head to the first floor, but my curiosity wants to explore both my older brother's room and my parents' room. Where shall I go?</span></div></div>",

I struggle to answer, which comes out as a stammer due to nervousness. \"I'm... I live here,\" I tell him, but since I'm still shocked and growing to be offended by his reaction, I shoot the question back at him. \"Wait, who are you then and why do you have keys to my house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your house?\" he asks, bewildered that I would ask such a question. \"Since I have the keys, clearly this house belongs to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're going to fight, at least have the decency to close the door so you don't disturb your neighbor, son,\" says a bald, black man wearing a bright Hawaiian flower shirt, who appears outside the open door. Both the man's and my attention shift to the man. \"I don't mean to pry, but don't you ever read your mail?\" The man asks before handing the younger man a parcel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take this opportunity to make my way down the stairs to the lower floor. With the door open, a slight breeze enters the house. Though it''s warm at first, with the amount of skin that is exposed on my unfamiliar female body, it quickly turns into a cooler draft that causes me to shiver. I try to wrap my arms around my body but it's no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looks at the front of the parcel. Just by reading the sender's address, he curses under his breath, \"Shit, I forgotten all about this.\" He quickly opens the parcels in order to read the contents inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he's doing that, the black man looks over to me and sees me shivering in the cold. \"Hey miss, you know you should cover up if you ever have an open door. It's hot today, but, soon the days will get colder. You know, these boxes that the young man has brought in are actually for you. He can explain in detail later, but first, let's get something for you to cover up,\" he explains. The black man goes over to the boxes that are left in the foyer and immediately opens the larger of the two with his big hands. From my position, once he opens the box, I can see various amount of fabric inside. He immediately takes out a flimsy black garment and tosses it to me. I unwrap the balled-up garment and after finding the tag and sleeves, at once I realize what it is. I look up at the black man. In defense, he tells me, \"It's better than what you have on right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying anything, I insert my arms into the rather large sleeve and wrap the sides to my body. An added rope made of a thicker version of the original fabric is included and I use that to cinch the garment to my body. Once the tie has been fasten, I realize the garment is a bathrobe. Even though I can barely feel the garment on my body, since it covers my arms, torso and the bottom of my nightgown, I'm protected from the cold breeze coming in. My legs still feel cold, but it's bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done reading that, young man?\" the black man then asks the other man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger man looks up from the multi-page letter and says, \"They didn't notify me that she was coming today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's because you were so busy that you didn't even notice. Don't think I don't notice my young neighbor getting so caught up in his personal matters that he ignores everything else around him,\" the black man says. \"I'm going to take my leave and leave you two to sort out your situation.\" With that, the black man leave, closing the door behind him, leaving the two of us still in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stare at the man, but he dares not to look back at me. All his eyes do is look up and down on the paper he's holding, hoping to find an answer on the very page he's on, even though he's only on the second page. I need to get his attention, but how should I do it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without warning him, I step up to the man and grab the top of the packet of papers and pull it toward me. My action surely gets his attention and at once, in a manner of seconds, he looks up from the text and stares into my face. His grip on the papers tighten and he pulls the papers back towards him. When that happens, my grip on the papers tighten as well and our fight from earlier recommences. A fierceness appears on the man's face which I assume is on my face as well. Instead of words like curses or insults, the only sounds that comes out of our mouths are groans, his being of the deeper variety and mine a higher kind. This tug o' war would go on and on, but with the flimsiness of paper and how very weak it is to sheer forces twisting and pulling it apart, the battle would end very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give the packet one last pull, which causes it to give way and tear all seven pages of it at the area where it was lightly folded in order to put it in the envelope. With only one direction the force of my pull could go, I'm sent falling backward, eventually landing on my ass, which considering how hard I pulled, hurts me a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man on the other hand has good balance and stays on his feet as his half of the packet stays in his hands. His anger, for some reason, boils to a rage and he approaches me suddenly and furiously asks, \"What the fuck did you do that for?\" He points to the clean tear along his half of the packet, as if I'm the sole person who committed it. Yes, I may have instigated it, but his reaction was more than I expected it to be. \"I've already had a bad day today and these boxes, this message and most of all, YOU, just makes it a whole lot worse!\" He angrily throws his half of the packet towards me, sending it flying roughly into my lap. Still in his rage, he storms off upstairs. I look up and he passes my room into where the master bedroom would be. Like a teenage tantrum, he slams the door with enough force to shake the banister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shouting is like my father's, but since it's directly sent to me, my emotions get the best of me. When he emphasizes YOU in his sentence and using the packet as a pointer, it hit me at that moment. I froze, like how a dog does when it's ready to receive punishment for doing something wrong. I couldn't retaliate or say anything back in return. Plus, the pain in my ass grew more throbbed with soreness as I sat there take the verbal blows. Slowly, the tears start to appear. Unfamiliar with a female's sensitivity to conflict like we just had, I have no explanation why my tears fall so easily. With no reason I can think of, I sob right there in that living room, using my large sleeve to constantly dry my eyes and cheeks. All I can do is cry and I find I have no ability to shout or even speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes or so of the waterworks, I gather myself as well as the two halves of the packet. For no apparent reason, I somehow have this heavy burden of guilt, as if my body has already admitted my fault, despite my current male mind thinking otherwise. I pick up the two halves of the packet and get to my feet. I make my way upstairs and navigate to the closed door of the master bedroom. Behind the door, I can hear the man inside venting his anger through his mouth as if he is doing it by shouting at someone else on a phone. Who can he be talking to? I look at the two bundles of paper in my hands and again, my body connects the ripping of the packet to the guilt weighing on my shoulders. I take a deep breath in order to keep myself from crying again. Since it was my fault that I tried to take the packet away from the man and that it was my last pull that ripped it in half, I should act in such a way that is completely different that the initial action. We might have another fight if I do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go for the door knob, but stop as I realize something. Barging in unannounced would be similar, if not the same, as pulling on the packet without asking first. I should knock before entering. What should I do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I step back from the door and since it's close, I slip into my room before the door can potentially open. I close the door behind me. In the calmness of my room, I can still hear the man yelling into his phone, but his shouts soon cease. In my time being a male, I've never seen anyone get angry that quickly and that intense before. Yes, I may have seen videos of people having tantrums or meltdowns, but to see it and experience it in person is quite different. The guilt of causing the paper to rip and send this man into a furious rage still lingers in my chest, but it seems the answer to his tension may be in the pieces of paper I brought with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a seat on my bed and start reading. From what I can make out and understand is that I'm a charge, or someone who is put under the supervision of a Benefactor. The man in the next room is supposed to an Acting Benefactor. I'm shocked to read that the original Benefactor would have been my father, but there is no written reason why he isn't at the moment. Despite knowing my father having the same kind of short temper, I can honestly say that I'd rather be a charge under him than the man in the next room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, the Acting Benefactor, whose name is referred to as Mr. Reed, was formally selected by his colleague to perform a favor. Due to personal issues, his colleague was unable to look after the house of the original Benefactor. The company that had sent Mr. Reed, also had assigned him a charge, me, that he would have to temporarily be a Benefactor towards. They have noted his objections, but they haven't given Mr. Reed his wishes due to the temporary assignment. Somehow the guilt lingering within seems to die down, but not by much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take the pages and exit my room. Since I've already read the packet, I might as well give it back to Mr. Reed, since it was his to begin with. Should I give it to him in person and while I'm there, I could apologize for my behavior? Or should I just slip it underneath the door and don't bother apologizing, since he will have his packet back? How should I go about doing this?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I slowly walk up to the door and I raise my hand to knock on it. Before my knuckles reach the white surface, it pulls away from my hand. The door is opened and none other than Mr. Reed is there behind it. He's no longer wearing his semi-formal attire, instead he's wearing comfortable clothing; a hoodie and sweat pants. He looks like he's changed into garments for exercising. It looks as if he's calmed down a bit, but since my head is lowered, I can't tell if he has an angry face. \"Can I help you?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't say anything, instead I raise the hand holding the two halves of the packet he was reading. He promptly takes it, without any resistance from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you read it?\" he asks. I don't answer. He doesn't get mad, to my surprise. \"Then you should already know of my... our... situation here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" I simply say, finding it difficult to find words to properly apologize for my behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I acted like a bitch earlier and I ripped your letter,\" I tell him, not daring to look up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stare down at my toes, Mr. Reed moves, but I don't know in what way. For all I know, he could be ready to retaliate and deliver a well-deserved slap to my face. Or he could pull me into his room, close the door behind him, and take advantage of the contrasts of our strengths. Instead he surprises me by taking my wrist and pulling me down the hallway. I don't protest (in fact, I don't have a moment to protest) as he pulls me down the stairs to the first floor. He takes me to the front door, where we both had our furies entangled with one another. I can only think of one thing that he could do at this moment and that is to kick me out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, he doesn't do anything of the sort. He turns me around so that I'm now facing him and lifts my face by my chin. I witness a stoic face on Mr. Reed, before he speaks up to say, \"Six months they said. Six months I will have to wait until they can reassign me. Until then, I will have to watch over you. I don't want to. I'm not a babysitter. I'm sure I'm no Benefactor. Didn't sign up to be one. They just put you in my lap, expecting me to take care of you.\" His rant has a bit of a negative tone and it doesn't benefit me or put me in a good light. It's as if I'm a burden to him. \"So I'd like to make an agreement. For the next six months, I don't want to be responsible for you. I can help you a little, but I'm not going to do things for you. Basically, I live my life and you live yours. We don't need to interact at all. We'll just get into fights. Consider the two of us as housemates who had no interest in each other. That way, everyone stays happy. Agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me, I guess,\" I say to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. So this agreement, it starts after we clean this place up. Since I've found that these boxes, which belong to you, to be too heavy for you to carry, I'll go ahead and bring it to your room. What you can do is get the groceries and put them into the refrigerator. Sounds easy?\" he asks. I nod and without another word, he goes to pick up his backpack, slinging each strap over each of his shoulder. He then uses his legs to squat before wrapping arms around the larger of the two boxes. His extends his legs, enabling him to lift the heavy boxes without throwing out his back. Mr. Reed swiftly walks the boxes to the steps and begins ascending them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take this time to gather all of the plastic bags and carry them to the kitchen. I would have been able to get all of the bags, totaling ten, all at once, but that would need the strength of a man, which I'm surely am not. I have to take about three trips back and forth just to get them all into the kitchen. Once the bags are transferred, I open up the refrigerator and find an almost empty fridge compartment. The only things I find is a couple of beer bottles, shredded cheese, and an apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, I have a desire to ask why the fridge is empty, but after remembering what Mr. Reed said what would start after cleaning up, I decide otherwise. I just start filling up the refrigerator with the items in the plastic bags. A gallon of milk and a gallon of orange juice on the top shelf; a pack of shredded mozzarella cheese and a pack of sliced cheddar cheese on the shelf below that; and an assortment of fruits and vegetables in a drawer below the second shelf. For the dry goods, I simply take them out of the bags and set them on the kitchen table. I fold the plastic bags into plastic folded footballs and set them aside, just in case Mr. Reed needs them later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI make my way upstairs and find Mr. Reed removing garments from the larger box and placing them on my bed. He speaks as if he already knows I'm here, despite his back being turned to me. \"It would have been better if you made your bed yourself,\" he remarks, \"but I can understand if that's a old habit of yours, consider the route you took.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Route?\" I ask. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Reed takes the smaller of the two boxes and brings it to me. It's already open. \"Here's all the material you need to make sense of your situation. Identification card, credit and debit cards, and important paperwork,\" he explains. I open the box to find all the item he told me was inside the box. More items included is a leather wallet to hold the aforementioned cards and a compact disc. I take it out and show it to Mr. Reed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this supposed to be?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An introduction. Basically, everything the paperwork will tell you. You don't need to watch it, really,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flip the case over and a printed note is held behind the plastic. \"Dear Benefactor, Please make sure to watch this with your charge,\" the note reads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it says here that you have to watch it with your charge,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I say that you don't have to watch it? Take it from me, who has seen the video before,\" he explains after raising him voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says not to watch it, but for some reason I do. Do I take his advice and not watch or should I insist?</span></div></div>",

All I can say is that it's graphic and may disturb you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closes the door behind him and I'm left with a choice. Since curiosity has had its grasp on me ever since laying eyes on the disc's case, I make sure Mr. Reed is not standing outside the door. I find a DVD player and turn on the television. To make sure Mr. Reed doesn't hear anything, I find an old pair of headphones and plug it into an audio jack. Although the cord is too short for me to extend back so I'm not in an IMAX-Theater situation, I opt to just stand and watch as the video immediately begin with no DVD menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video starts with a history lesson, which recalls a debilitating disease that affected about 75% of the total women in the world over the age of 25 last year. Most of the those affected were in fully-developed nations, with North America, South America, Japan, metropolitan China,  and the greater continent of Europe being the top five. There was no known cure and by June of this year, about 90% of the women affected died, with the rest becoming bedridden in a coma. As mind-boggling as it my seem, I somehow believe the history that the video presents is true. If not, why would there be a law like the Apathy Clause<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video goes on to a recent act or clause that was enacted concerning the well-being and economy of all the nations. For some odd reason, the people (which refers to the upper class, upper-middle class and elites of these nations), believe that the homeless, the criminals in our prisons and all of the apathetic young adults living in our communities are not contributing their share to the well-being of their resident nations. They say homeless people are living carefree, only living on handouts, never giving anything in return. They only make beautiful places their trash bin. Criminals get three square meals a day and are housed with beds and a roof over their heads, as well as exercise and education, all for free and we, the taxpayers, are paying for so-called freedom behind ten feet of concrete. Young adults nowadays are so unmotivated that they live off their parents, the ones who have toiled and broke their backs for them. They ruin their own futures and therefore ruin the futures of the younger generations. It was finally time for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change came with an Apathy Clause, which is actually geared more for young adults between the ages of 18 and 24. In addition, it only pertains to males, who are viewed as the head of households. Women, on the other hand, if in a relationship with a man or are independent with a decent job to maintain modest living for themselves and anybody in their household or are under responsibility of their fathers, is able to go about as they please and are not put under the Clause. Men who have graduated high school are therefore given a deadline at their 25th birthday. They are free to employ themselves in a job or career and are also encourage to go to college in hopes to get a job after graduation. Those in school are given deadlines after four years, six and even eight years for those in the medical field. For those in school, if they cannot keep a 2.0 GPA during their semesters, they are immediately withdrawn from school and put under the Apathy Clause. If they do graduate, but are not able to get employed six months after graduation, they too are put under the Apathy Clause. Same goes for those who have been employed before their 25th birthday. If they are somehow fired or their job terminates and cannot re-employ themselves after six months, they too are put under the Apathy Clause. This has all be enacted in efforts to de-saturate the competition in the job market. Hope goes to those who can achieve their dreams. To those cannot, must take a different route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the Apathy Clause, the different route comes with gender modification. In an effort to battle the incurable disease that only affects women, the top governments have started to modify the genders of men who are under the Apathy Clause. Since these new women were initially men, they are immune to the disease. All throughout, the gender change is emphasized as a choice. If you choose to go through with it, your gender is changed and your are put in the responsibility to the closest male family member or legal guardian who can afford to put you under his roof. If there is none, then one is appointed to take responsibility for you. Unfortunately, if there is no family, friend, guardian or even a government-appointed guardian to take responsibility for you, then you are sent to an unclaimed pool, which includes those who refused or chose against the Clause's requirements. Instead of a gentle transformation, those who refused or chose against were forced to change regardless. The pool are then used for ill reasons that the presentation does not disclose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe presentation goes on to describe what has happened, which it reiterates is all of our choosing. There is two routes where we can be changed. We can either have our minds, or as the presentations puts it, souls, from our male bodies into female bodies custom-made by our guardians, or have ourselves subjected to a chemical change, where hormones and other substances are used to literally change our genders at the microscopic level. The latter process takes more time, which also is more painful, but the end product is a body that feels much more in terms of sensations. One can say that senses in the body of the latter process are heightened a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part of the video is life after the change, which informs that when we are changed, the drastic modification of the physical may affect the memory of the individual going through the change. Since clients are given anesthesia that last for four to six months, most will wake up a month or more after the procedure is done. As the client is still under the effects of the drug, they are carefully delivered to the place of their residence. A technician will monitor the client, making sure vitals stay within desired range. In some cases, clients are given a chemical that counter-acts the effect of the anesthesia, though clients will not wake fully until two to three days after administering the counter-acting drug, with two being the average. When the client finally wakes up, it would feel like she does not remember anything save for a bit. This is usual since the anesthesia more or less disconnects the mind and memory, which may remember the body being male, from the body, which is drastically changed. Memories would start to gradually emerge as each day passes, totaling a maximum of five days, which makes the process last a week, though in some cases, memories start to flare up in just a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video, for the first time, addresses the witness or guardian, but before that can happen, the headphones are pulled from my ears, replacing the pleasant music with the sound of my silent room and an angry Mr. Reed. \"Didn't I tell you not to watch it?!\" he loudly remind me. \"And with earphones?\" he tosses the earbuds towards the door, which pathetically makes impact with the with surface before quietly clattering to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain from having the earbuds being ripped out of my ears none other by Mr. Reed, who got me mad last time due to him ignoring me, continues to linger and it pushes me over the line again and I blow my top. I get into his face, equally shouting, \"What the fuck did you do that for, motherfucker?\" My question ends with a quick slap to his face, which seems to quiet him down. He reels back and places a hand on the wall for support. His other hand favors the cheek that I had slapped, which I can feel already on my own hand,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a lower, less angry voice, he explains, \"There is something I didn't tell you about what happens next?\" This garners my interest and I calm down enough to take a breath and take a seat on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" I ask.</span></div></div>",

As the pain in my head increases, so does the reverberation in my ears. It's as if someone had pulled the pin out of a grenade and left it in the room. Even though the explosion was never to be seen or heard, the after effects were evident in that my ears are deafened. My sense of sight and hearing is rendered useless and my sense of touch is intensified, more so around my head. I can feel Mr. Reed rush to me to keep myself from collapsing and hitting my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mr. Reed picks me up with his arms, I cannot do much other than let him do what he needs in order to put me in a better position. As he carries me out of the room, my hands still clutch at my head, in a futile attempt to press the stinging pain out like you would when pushing the bubbles out from under a cell phone's screen protector. The sting quickly becomes a deafening ring that drowns out even the sensation I feel physically. What I lose in physical touch, I gain in a deluge of images flashing through my mind. Even though they speed past a figurative sight of my two eyes, my mind starts to connect them to form a memory. The flood soon becomes a tidal wave that threatens to overcome me, sweep me away into the farthest reaches of my subconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, I wake up before it does. I find a warm towel on my forehead and I'm no longer in my room. I'm laying on the bed in the master bedroom. Don't tell me that it's the very same bed that Mr. Reed sleeps in. I sit up rather quickly, which doesn't let the blood catch up, so in effect, I get light-headed. The pain returns to my head, but not in its extreme form. It does cause me to remember a moment from a particular time. To the time when I was still a man. I had received a visit from a man, telling me of a new law, an Apathy Clause, the very same one that was presented in the video. He tells me that I'm way past the deadline and have to subject myself to the consequences. I make the decision without any protest or resistance. I wonder what convinced me to make a decision that quickly. Maybe it's due to what Mr. Reed was trying to prevent me from seeing at the end of the video?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is Mr. Reed anyways?</span></div></div>",

I remember as a kid, in the middle of the night, I would sneak downstairs to raid the refrigerator or the pantry for snacks. I would do it without turning on any lights and my way of navigating through the dark would be to lightly run my hand against the wall. It would make a little bit of noise, but not enough to wake anyone up. I do the same as I make my way down the steps. I run my small female hand on the wall and keep it there as I descend down each step as slowly and as quietly as possible. Halfway down the first set of stairs, the wall abruptly turns to make a corner. Using only memory, my hand drops to the railing, which I remember I would only lightly touch, knowing that any more weight would cause the metal at the bottom to wobble, which in turn would cause creaking to sound in the wood it was inserted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI manage to get to the largest step in the middle of the two sets of stairs and get a view of the living room. Nothing has changed. Even the decorative piece made of tiny seashells and string hanging next to the china cabinet is still there. I remember my older brother and I tangling it to the point where we would get in trouble and he would blame me for it. Fortunately, I was my mother's favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach the bother of the steps, feeling the cold hardwood flooring underneath the soles of my feet. I remember sliding along this floor with my socks and countless times, I would nearly be injured by doing said act. Now at the bottom, I can either take a left down a short hallway that would take me to the garage, continue straight and explore more of the living room that I had seen from the second floor, or head to my right, past the dining room, to the area consisting of the family room and kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo where shall I go next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I walk straight into the living room, seeing the new layout of the old furniture. Someone had the idea to change the enclosed layout to an open layout. Instead of the couches facing each other and surrounding the coffee table, they are now placed against the walls with the coffee table in the same place, just with two of its sides open to the rest of the room. Everything is the same besides the furniture. What hasn't changed is the area next to the front door. Back when my older brother and I were kids, this place had an altar. We were Catholics back then and would go to church every Sunday. When we got older, we thought church was just another thing to do on a Sunday, so only our mother, who constantly tried to convert us, attended mass every Sunday. That is, until my mother grew sick. Doctors diagnosed it as cancer and after a year of fighting it, she succumbed to her illness. Her funeral was the last time we were in a church setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, instead of an altar with a man-made image of the Messiah peering down from its picture frame with stoic eyes, a memorial for our mother sat on a glass table that threatened to collapse due to how much weight was on it. A collection of snow globe, heavy trinkets, two vases with dying flower and not to forget, the large picture frame with a happy photo of my mother sat on the glass surface. I observed her face and realized that I was staring into a reflection, but it wasn't a mirror. Despite some different facial features, the face that my mother had had an uncanny resemblance to the face I saw in the mirror upstairs. Even the aging as well, since the picture that stood on the memorial table was one that was taken in my mother's younger years. I stood there frozen in place. When and how I changed from a man into a woman, either all the genes and traits and characteristics in the DNA somehow created this similar facade, as if this is the face and body I would have if I wasn't born a male, or someone had a hand in creating an almost-identical replica of my mother's face and body and somehow put my soul in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I'm not in a panic nor am I bothered by it. The smile on my mother's young face tells me not to worry. It's the male persona that living inside my head that's freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awake?\" a male voice says from upstairs. I look up at the banister that overlooks the living room and see a man standing behind it. As my eyes rise, I see the face of my...?</span></div></div>",

As my eye rise to see more of the person, the sweats disappear as a dark blue bath robe is wrapped around the top of the garment. I can only see muscular arms which tie the bath robe's drawstring to secure it to the body they belong to. My eyes widen as they pass the shoulders and collar of the man. It's none other than my father. He has a smile on his face, as if he is glad to see me. Question is: is he glad to see me as me or as this rather attractive woman who is a spitting image of his late wife?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watch him walk down the hallway, away from my room, and I hear his heavy footsteps as he makes his way down the stairs. When he appears before me, I'm still looking up at him. If I was a man, I would be looking at him straight in the eye, for we were the same height. Now, I'm at least a foot shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile seems to get brighter, but dims as he notices my apparent expression. Unknowingly, I drop my gaze, which causes him to lift it up gently with his hand so that our eyes meet. \u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d he asks with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look away from him and divert my eyes to the picture of mother. I gently pull my head away from his hand. For some reason, something begins to pull at me from within and it puts my whole body at unease. I struggle to tell my father, \u201cI want to it's nothing, but it's unfair not knowing everything. I wake up like this, in this house and I see my mother in the mirror. What has happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe comes up from behind and places firm hands on my shoulders. He is blunt in his response. \u201cA lot has happened, but I want to let you know that most of it came from your choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm a woman because it was my choice?\u201d I reiterate, the lump in my stomach causing the words to come out differently, as if they were delivered with contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't mean it like that,\u201d my father says, pressing his fingertips into the flesh of my shoulders. \u201cIf you're willing, there's someone coming that can explain everything to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d I say sarcastically. \u201cWho is coming anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey're right outside the door, actually,\u201d my father says after looking at the screen of his phone.

Judging from their appearance, the woman is probably around my age while the man is around my father's age. Is this man the father of this young woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStephen! You're early!\u201d my father says as a greeting. \u201cCome in, come in!\u201d As the two walk in, I stand aside and actually hide behind my father as he closes the door behind our visitors. I notice that the woman does the same thing. Is she in the same predicament? As I continue to observe her from afar, I see an uncanny resemblance to someone I met before. I can't recall who at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, who has the complexion of an African-American man, spots me hiding behind my father and asks a question. \u201cIs this your...?\u201d he begins, which my father kindly finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she's my charge,\u201d my father affirms with a term that I'm not familiar with. What is a charge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat,\u201d the man, whose name is Stephen, says. \u201cI guess we'll be able to go through the presentation. I just need your television.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's all ready for you, over here,\u201d my father says, pointing towards the built-in hole in the wall that frames the family room behind it. He leads and I follow, followed by the man and the younger woman. The family room somewhat has the same layout as the living room, save for the large entertainment system occupying the wall that the fireplace is also a part of it. Since we hardly ever use it, we just place the necessary furniture before it and the television above the mantle. I remember when we would host parties whenever there was a big basketball game or when our favorite boxer would fight on a pay-per-view match. The three couches in the room were able to seat many of our friends and family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father sits on the love seat that sits directly opposite the television and I sit next to him. Unconsciously, I swing one of my legs over and rest it on my other leg. This is probably due to my nightie being a bit too short. If I knew we were going to have visitors, I would have put something on to cover myself better. Though, when I recall the state of my room when I woke up, there was nothing available for me to put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen and the young woman take a seat on the larger couch to our left. The black man sits closer to the side closest to the love seat we are sitting on while the younger woman sits towards the far end. Her eyes look all around the room and I realize that she's avoiding my eyes. Something is fishy about this woman and how come she looks like someone I met in my past?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Thomas, how far along is your charge?\u201d Stephen asks, which causes a  red flag to rise in my mind. Is he ask what I think he's asking? Am I pregnant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'd say, two days. She only got back on Saturday and has been asleep for most of the time. She actually just woke up a few minutes ago,\u201d my father tells him. For some reason, something in my head deduces that it's not pregnancy that the black man is talking about, but about something else. \u201cHow far along is yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen turns to the young woman seated beside him and places a firm hand on her exposed leg. Her outfit consists of a pair of short khaki shorts and a pink hoodie that forms to her slender build. I notice a bit of annoyance on her face when he touches her. \u201cI got her back Thursday. Like you, she was asleep for two days and woke up on Saturday. I personally gave her the presentation and I believe she understands,\u201d the black man says. He removes his hand and gets to his feet. He goes to the messenger bag that he had set on the table. I must have not noticed him bringing it in since I was too focused on the woman who came with him. Out of the bag, he produces a DVD case, which he takes a disc from inside. He activates our Blu-Ray/DVD player and pops the disc in. He also turns on the speakers and raises the volume. It's weird how he knows how to operate the technology as if he has been in this house before. I forget that this man and my father seem to be friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black man returns to his seat and stays quiet as the video appears. For some reason, my attention is drawn to it, as if it is speaking to me. For another reason, this time unusual even, I'm able to recall everything it presents. As each minute passes, I'm neither offended or motivated to protest against its message. I accept everything, which is very unusual for anyone to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video presentation starts with a history lesson. As mind-boggling as it is, I believe everything that has transpired has really and truly happened without question. The video recalls a debilitating disease that affected about 35% of the total women last year, which 30% of the total succumbing to that disease. Most of the those affected were in fully-developed nations, with the United States, Japan, and the greater continent of Europe being the top-three. There was no known cure and by June of this year, about 90% of the women affect died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video goes on to a recent act or clause that was enacted concerning the well-being and economy of all the nations. For some odd reason, the people (which refers to the upper class, upper-middle class and elites of these nations), believe that the homeless, the criminals in our prisons and every apathetic young adults living in our communities are not contributing their share to the well-being of their resident nations. They say homeless people are living carefree, only living on handouts, never giving anything in return. They only make beautiful places their trash bin. Criminals get three square meals a day and are housed with beds and a roof over their head, all for free and we the taxpayers are paying for them. Young adults nowadays are so unmotivated that they live off their parents, the ones who have toiled and broke their backs for them. It was time for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change came with an Apathy Clause, which is actually geared more for young adults between the ages of 18 and 24. In addition, it only pertains to males, who are viewed as the head of households. Women, on the other hand, if in a relationship with a man or under responsibility of her father, is able to go about as she please and is not put under the Clause. Men who have graduated high school are therefore given a deadline at their 25th birthday. They are free to employ themselves in a job or career and are also encourage to go to college in hopes to get a job after graduation. Those in school are given deadlines after four years, six and even eight years for those in the medical field. For those in school, if they cannot keep a 2.0 GPA during their semesters, they are immediately withdrawn from school and put under the Apathy Clause. If they do graduate, but are not able to get employed six months after graduation, they too are put under the Apathy Clause. Same goes for those who have been employed before their 25th birthday. If they are somehow fired or their job terminates and cannot re-employ themselves after six months, they too are put under the Apathy Clause. This has all be enacted in efforts to de-saturate the competition in the job market. Hope goes to those who can achieve their dreams. To those cannot, must take a different route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the Apathy Clause, the different route comes with gender modification. In an effort to battle the incurable disease that only affects women, the top governments have started to modify the genders of men who are under the Apathy Clause. Since these new women were initially men, they are immune to the disease. All throughout, the gender change is emphasized as a choice. If you choose to go through with it, your gender is changed and your are put in the responsibility to the closest male family member or legal guardian who can afford to put you under his roof. If there is none, then one is appointed to take responsibility for you. Unfortunately, if there is no family, friend, guardian or even a government-appointed guardian to take responsibility for you, then you are sent to an unclaimed pool, which includes those who refused or chose against the Clause's requirements. Instead of a gentle transformation, those who refused or chose against were forced to change regardless. The pool are then used for ill reasons that the presentation does not disclose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe presentation goes on to describe what has happened, which it reiterates is all of our choosing. There is two routes where we can be changed. We can either have our minds, or as the presentations puts it, souls, from our male bodies into female bodies custom-made by our guardians, or have ourselves subjected to a chemical change, where hormones and other substances are used to literally change our genders at the microscopic level. The latter process takes more time, which also is more painful, but the end product is a body that feels much more in terms of sensations. One can say that senses in the body of the latter process are heightened a bit. </span></div></div>",

The video tells me that when we are changed, it is instantaneous and after a day, we are delivered to the place of our residence. We would be asleep for one to three days, with two being the average. When we wake up, it would feel like we do not remember anything save for a bit. This is usual for those who have had their minds transferred. Memories would start to gradually emerge as each day passes, totaling a maximum of five days, which makes the process last a week.

Will I see your eldest?\" Stephen says, possibly referring to my older brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" Thomas replies, \"he didn't specify when he was going to be back. It was either tonight or tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll see him when I see him,\" Stephen says and bids farewell to us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas closes the door and turns to find me looking at the boxes. Actually, I'm looking at the smallest of the three and wondering what could be inside. \"Baby,\" my father addresses me as such while pulling me gently by my arms, \"before we see what's in these boxes, don't you want to go through that folder that Stephen gave us first?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look over at the family room where we had left the folder, but I also catch a glimpse of the woman that Stephen left behind for my father to... \"babysit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is she?\" I whisper to my father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's one of Stephen's charges. Don't concern yourself with her, she's just going to stay here until her uncle comes back,\" my father tells me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So potentially, she's Stephen's nephew-turned-niece,\" I whisper, though this time more louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily--\" my father says, but I cut him off as I pull away from him and approach the girl. She looks tense as I close the distance between her and I. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up to her face. She visibly gulps a bit of her saliva, telling me she is nervous, but about what? I calmly ask, \"Can I talk to you for a little bit?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the young woman says and I take her to the kitchen so I can talk more privately with her. Once I'm more out of my father's way, I start to ask her questions. \"You know, you look familiar to me. Do I personally know you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman with mocha skin answers, \"I don't think so. I'm a new charge, just like you, so I don't think you would recognize me that quickly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" I start. \"You look like someone's mother, though a bit younger. I think her name was Gwen.\" The young woman before me fidgets ever so slightly. Gwen must have been a name she recognizes. \"She was nice and protective of her son, who kept getting into trouble. Her son's name was Tyrone.\" The woman's breathing looks to be quickening. Am I getting hotter or colder? It looks more like the former. \"I can't explain it, but I can certainly say this while sounding crazy, since I don't care if I sound crazy or not. But it's this certain Tyrone who put me in this situation. He had a glove which could change things. He slapped me with the glove, changing me into a woman. But not only that, he put me back in the house I lived in as a kid, but now I'm this woman living here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm surprised at how successful being a tad bit crazy can do to people around you. The young woman seems to respond to every word I say, convicting her of guilt that apparently seems to be true. At the climax of it all, she speaks up, admitting to her fault. \"Okay, okay, Cesar, I'm sorry. I knew what your mother looked like and when I saw a younger version of her, I could only think that you would be in her body while I was somehow transported and put into a younger version of my mother's body,\" she blurts out, on the verge of tears even. \"I'm guilty, okay. Guilty because of that glove. If I didn't do what I did, we wouldn't be in this place, in these bodies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout knowing it, my father appears near the kitchen and sees Tyrone in his female body in tears. \"What's going on you two?\"  he asks, coming closer to us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just asking her a question,\" I say in my defense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two arguing? Because, Tyra here is a guest and we don't make guests in our home cry--\" he tries to scold me, but Tyra, Tyrone's new name, defends me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, Tommy. We weren't arguing. I was just glad. We actually knew each other before we were... you know. She was just comforting me, that's all,\" Tyra says. I'm surprised to hear her say that even after all the instigating I've been doing. I actually feel like I'm the one at fault. \"I've been tired lately, that's all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should let you rest. You know where the guest room is. Why don't you lie down for a bit,\" my father says to her, almost in a caring, loving way. I wonder, has Tyra been here in the past few days with my father... alone? I can't really ask that question, since I seem to have a sensitivity to it. And I don't want to cause Tyra to cry any more than she has. Tyra leaves, wiping her tears with the sleeves of her sweater, leaving my father and I alone. He turns to face me and gives me a look which I cannot read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" he simply says, but I know it's a lie. \"We have time to kill. We can either go through the folder that Stephen left for us or start opening the boxes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do I decide to do? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I look the man from bottom to top, starting with naked hairy legs. When my eyes rise towards his knees, they are covered by a white fabric. As my eyes rise even more, I discover it to be a white towel, neatly tucked in on itself around the man's waist. But I spy a rather handsome waist, connected to a bare torso that's lean and somewhat muscular. Not too ripped like the body of a body builder, but I can tell this person has worked out to some degree to eliminate any evidence of a beer belly. The torso is connected to a neck which of course has a head attached to it. The face is much a surprise to me. It's none other than the face of my older brother, Edwin. He smiles from cheek to cheek as our eyes meet. \"Wait, right there, okay,\" he says to me and runs towards where his room would've have been if we didn't switch it like countless times in the past. I then hear the creak of the steps as he quickly makes his way down the stairs. He appears halfway down the steps now dressed in a black bathrobe and in his hand he holds a similar fabric that's colored in such a way that I assume it has a flower design on it. I'm assuming he got this for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he gets to the first floor, he holds it out, confirming my assumptions. It is a bath robe, made for a smaller person. Not wanting to refuse his kindness, and also wanting to cover up my awkwardness wearing this babydoll, I slip my arms into the sleeves and allow my big brother to drape the rest of the light fabric over my bare shoulders. Once the majority of the garment in on my body, I take each side of the robe and wrap it tightly over the rest of my torso, using the provided rope to cinch the garment tight around my waist. I also use my arm to push the hair that has been caught under the collar of the robe out and over the back of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good fit,\" my brother says, to which I turn around. I look at his face again. I observe how much he hasn't changed and then compare to myself which is the complete opposite. I hang my head low because of how much I have changed. I'm no longer his younger brother. Heck, I don't think I can consider myself his sister. I don't think it works that way. He lifts my head with his hand, lightly grasping my chin with two finger and lifting my jaw upward so that my eyes meet his again. \"What's wrong?\" I somehow get emotional and I'm on the verge on tears when he continues. \"Right, right.\" He steps away from me. \"This must be very awkward for you. But I can explain things. It's my job to anyways. Whoever changed you into the person you are now, they have given me material that you need to watch and read. If you're ready, we can go over those materials.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally speak with my new voice, which is higher-pitched than my brother's deep, manly voice. I ask, \"Materials about what? Are you saying that this was no accident?\" I try not to sound pessimistic as if whatever I'm thinking about has done this to take advantage of my new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's this new law, which the government passed six months ago, that say certain people have to change in order to...\" he trails off, unsure of what words to say. After a brief pause, he continues. \"It's hard to explain. That's why they gave me material that can explain it fully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll explain everything?' I ask, still perturbed at how feminine my voice sounds like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so,\" he says and closes the distance between us. He reaches his two arms and places his hands on my arms. He squeezes them gently as he says, \"I don't want you to worry about anything at all. So shall we start? There is a video and some paperwork, so it's best to watch it on a TV screen. Just where should we watch it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere in the house do we watch these materials?</span></div></div>",

You're cool about that?\" he asks, surprised that I would even bring up the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can watch it in the family room if you don't want to,\" I mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't be necessary,\" he says, \"in fact, the materials, the video disc and the paperwork, they are all upstairs. I guess it's convenient that you mentioned my room, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save us the legwork,\" I add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Well, shall we? Ladies, first,\" he says. I ignore the fact that I am now a lady and gladly take the lead, watching around my brother and back up the stairs. When I get to the top, I hang a left past two door that are opposite one another and through the door at the end of the small hallway. Once inside my brother's room, I halt myself taking in the nostalgia of the placement of items in the room. It's as I remember it from years past. Actually, if I remember correctly, my brother had left the room like this when he left for university.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the mess is reminiscent of that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brother quickly places his hands on my shoulders and gently pushes me to the door. He apologizes as he rushes into the room before me. \"Sorry about the mess, I had just got back last night,\" he says. Coincidentally, I see scatter on his desk several item that I haven't seen before. One of which is eye-catching and draws my attention at once. It's a certificate that is handsomely framed. And it has my brother's name on it. Edwin Lopez. Under his name, I spy the words \"congratulate\" and \"awards\" and \"completing.\" I can only assume one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it,\" I softly say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he answers in a clueless fashion. I pick up the framed diploma and present to him. \"Right,\" he softly says and takes on a warm smile as he looks it over. He breathes out a sigh, but I'm unsure if it's one out of relief or disappointment. Out of concern, I try not to investigate further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy curiosity though wonders if there was a ceremony and visual evidence that there was one. \"Did you take any pictures?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin walks around me and puts the framed diploma back on the table. Again he lets out a sigh, but this time, I can tell that he didn't do it out of relief. I want to ask, but the gentleness of my new character doesn't want to pry. \"I didn't walk,\" he says, walking over to the door and closing it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean what I mean,\" he says, but stumbles on his next phrase. \"Not that I didn't graduate, which I did. It's just... I didn't walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brother takes a moment before speaking. Knowing the question has already been asked, I dare not repeat it and annoy him. That much I know. From the door, he turns around and faces me. \"There was a ceremony, but I didn't choose to partake in it. To respect my wishes, they gave me the diploma in advance,\" he explains, but my curiosity isn't sated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you?\" I ask one more question and for some reason, I could feel the mood in the room change slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, and probably out of annoyance, Edwin answers, \"Because of you.\" His direct, almost aggressive answer, forces me into silence. At the same time, the answer seems to be accompanied with an unseen, physical force that pushes me back until I'm stopped by the foot board of my brother's bed. Awkwardly, the top of the foot board supports the protrusion of my butt, allowing me to lightly sit on it. Edwin approach me, slowly, as to not come off as a mad brother. During his slow pacing towards me, he takes several deep breaths. \"It's the damn Apathy Clause. Brutal to anyone who ignores it. Brutal especially to me.\" Edwin changes his course and walk around the bed to sit on the edge of the mattress. \"The law was passed a week before the end of my program. Dad was the one who called me about it, saying that you were a drop out and that you would be one of the men affected by the Clause. He told me he had already done it for his wife's brother and that I would be the one to help my own. When class was over, I traveled back and went with you to the place where we would do the paperwork. You weren't reluctant at all and actually was looking for to it. Once we were done, you at once did the procedure, but the technicians told me due to the certain things we selected, your completion wouldn't finish until after six months. At the time, I didn't know when graduation would happen, so I assumed it would be a month after your change was finished. I was bummed to hear that they would hold it three weeks after the end of class and that I couldn't postpone it. Because of you, I told them that I wasn't going to walk the ceremony. I didn't walk, because I wanted you to be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't understand half of the things he was telling me and some thing he left very vague, but it seems that we had caught up with each other during that week when he came back to take me to that appointment. I feel he was concerned for me and for some reason, his words touch upon my heart. I dismount the foot board and walk to where he is seated. I put a firm hand on his shoulder and honestly say, \"I didn't understand much of what you were saying, but I somehow feel good that you wanted me to see you walk at the graduation ceremony. I don't know why, but I want to say thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe if we watch this video, you'll find out why,\" he says, getting up from the bed and rounding the bed frame as well as myself, he goes over to the table to fetch a folder, from which he takes out a disc. He inserts it into a player and turns the wall-mounted TV on. He guides me to the couch sitting against the wall and takes a seat right next to me. At once, the video starts.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The video starts with a history lesson, which recalls a debilitating disease that affected about 35% of the total women last year, which 30% of the total succumbing to that disease. Most of the those affected were in fully-developed nations, with the United States, Japan, and the greater continent of Europe being the top-three. There was no known cure and by June of this year, about 90% of the women affected died. As mind-boggling as it my seem, I somehow believe the history that the video present is true. If not, why would there be a law like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video goes on to a recent act or clause that was enacted concerning the well-being and economy of all the nations. For some odd reason, the people (which refers to the upper class, upper-middle class and elites of these nations), believe that the homeless, the criminals in our prisons and all of the apathetic young adults living in our communities are not contributing their share to the well-being of their resident nations. They say homeless people are living carefree, only living on handouts, never giving anything in return. They only make beautiful places their trash bin. Criminals get three square meals a day and are housed with beds and a roof over their heads, all for free and we, the taxpayers, are paying for them. Young adults nowadays are so unmotivated that they live off their parents, the ones who have toiled and broke their backs for them. They ruin their own futures and therefore ruins the future of the younger generations. It was finally time for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change came with an Apathy Clause, which is actually geared more for young adults between the ages of 18 and 24. In addition, it only pertains to males, who are viewed as the head of households. Women, on the other hand, if in a relationship with a man or is independent with a decent job to maintain modest living for herself and anybody in her household or is under responsibility of her father, is able to go about as she please and is not put under the Clause. Men who have graduated high school are therefore given a deadline at their 25th birthday. They are free to employ themselves in a job or career and are also encourage to go to college in hopes to get a job after graduation. Those in school are given deadlines after four years, six and even eight years for those in the medical field. For those in school, if they cannot keep a 2.0 GPA during their semesters, they are immediately withdrawn from school and put under the Apathy Clause. If they do graduate, but are not able to get employed six months after graduation, they too are put under the Apathy Clause. Same goes for those who have been employed before their 25th birthday. If they are somehow fired or their job terminates and cannot re-employ themselves after six months, they too are put under the Apathy Clause. This has all be enacted in efforts to de-saturate the competition in the job market. Hope goes to those who can achieve their dreams. To those cannot, must take a different route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the Apathy Clause, the different route comes with gender modification. In an effort to battle the incurable disease that only affects women, the top governments have started to modify the genders of men who are under the Apathy Clause. Since these new women were initially men, they are immune to the disease. All throughout, the gender change is emphasized as a choice. If you choose to go through with it, your gender is changed and your are put in the responsibility to the closest male family member or legal guardian who can afford to put you under his roof. If there is none, then one is appointed to take responsibility for you. Unfortunately, if there is no family, friend, guardian or even a government-appointed guardian to take responsibility for you, then you are sent to an unclaimed pool, which includes those who refused or chose against the Clause's requirements. Instead of a gentle transformation, those who refused or chose against were forced to change regardless. The pool are then used for ill reasons that the presentation does not disclose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe presentation goes on to describe what has happened, which it reiterates is all of our choosing. There is two routes where we can be changed. We can either have our minds, or as the presentations puts it, souls, from our male bodies into female bodies custom-made by our guardians, or have ourselves subjected to a chemical change, where hormones and other substances are used to literally change our genders at the microscopic level. The latter process takes more time, which also is more painful, but the end product is a body that feels much more in terms of sensations. One can say that senses in the body of the latter process are heightened a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ask Edwin to pause the video here and when it is paused, I ask, \"So what route did we agree on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually didn't agree to it, but you were adamant about it. Since it was your choice to go through with it, I gave in. Heck, you even signed for it,\" he explains and gets up momentarily to retrieve a paper from the folder. The paper he takes out is a form that is akin to a joint bank account, but in this case, I am the client and he is a co-signer or witness. At the bottom of the page is the signature I've been using for the past six years. \"Here it says, I, Cesar Lopez, agree to have my body administered with the needed chemicals to change my body at the microscopic level. By signing below, I have understood and hold myself responsible of understanding that this modification route may potentially be painful and life-threatening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I understand,\" I say and tell Edwin to play the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part of the video is life after the change, which informs that when we are changed, the drastic modification of the physical may affect the memory of the individual going through the change. Since clients are given anesthesia that last for four to six months, most will wake up a month or more after the procedure is done. As the client is still under the effects of the drug, they are carefully delivered to the place of their residence. A technician will monitor the client, making sure vitals stay within desired range. In some cases, client are given a chemical that counter-acts the effect of the anesthesia, though clients will not wake fully until two to three days after administering the counter-acting drug, with two being the average. When the client finally wakes up, it would feel like she does not remember anything save for a bit. This is usual since the anesthesia more or less disconnects the mind and memory, which may remember the body being male, from the body, which is drastically changed. Memories would start to gradually emerge as each day passes, totaling a maximum of five days, which makes the process last a week, though in some cases, memories start to flare up in just a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video, for the first time, addresses the witness or guardian. It congratulates him and the client and tells them that this is just the beginning. We are to consider ourselves fortunate that the Apathy Clause found favor in us. To the guardian, the video tells him to care for the client, since lift will be different from this point on. It's his assistance that will help the client in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video finishes with a reassuring message to not panic, but to take this part of our lives as a learning experience. The video then ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwin takes the disc out and puts it back in its sleeve. He turns around and asks, \"So, did you understand everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much,\" I simply state. \"I just have to wait for my memories to come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when you woke up, did you remember anything at all?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I say, \"I actually didn't know about all those women dying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? It was all over the news. What I don't get is how they didn't give anyone any notice of the passing of the Apathy Clause. It just showed up out of the blue,\" he explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up at him from the couch. \"So what's next?\" I ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the video said it is just the beginning. All I have to do is take care of you,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does he do this as a start?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Quickly, I look up, because I recognize the voice that has spoken. It's the voice of my Uncle Niko. My body freezes mostly because I know firsthand how strict and demanding the man is. As a senior in high school, while I wanted to work right after graduation, he adamantly insisted I go to community college and use financial aid to pay my way through school. Ever since that time, for three years, he would contact me every month to see how I was doing. Mostly, he was only concerned with how my studies were progressing. I grew tired of his constant calls after that and when given the phone, I would avoid them outright. Soon after, I would move out to move in with the roommates that got me in this mess in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can only look up past his white tank top and gray sweats pants and meet his gaze. I gulp a wad of saliva as he peers from the second floor banister, like a predatory brid setting his sights on  his prey. I stay still as he moves from his position on the banister to the stairs and from the stairs to where I'm standing. As he approaches and gets close to me, I can already see the apparent different between us. My uncle Niko had been a military man, progressing through the ranks of the Air Force until becoming an officer. Then he gained the opportunity to fly large planes. As I was a man, he would still be taller than me by a couple inches. Only my older brother could contend against him just by height alone. Now that I'm a woman, he towers over me like a skyscraper would in comparison to a mere house. He gets within inches of me and out of fear and anxiousness, I dare not look up at him. I can literally feel his eyes on my attractive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steps to his right and proceeds to walk around me. As he does, he takes one of his fingers to trace along both my shoulder and my upper back. This tickles me but it also helps me to relax. I feel him position himself as if he is facing in the same direction as me. He places his warm hands on my cold skin of my upper arms and leans in to whisper into my ear. \"For a second there, I could have sworn we agreed we wouldn't make you an average mind-transfer woman with the body of a submissive girl,\" he says into my ear. I observe he mentioned that \"we agreed,\" noting that him and someone else agreed to what I was to become. Was it my father that he agreed with or is it the forbidden thought? Was it him and I who agreed to it? I want to believe that the last thing I would do is agree with my Uncle Niko about the current body and image I am in. \"Then again, I know that my nephew is in this head and body.\" He traces his finger down my arm as he says this. \"They had used microscopic nanobots to change you from the inside out, at the microscopic level, using your old male body to create this new female body. Plus, going that route served to almost heighten every nerve by a certain percentage. Not much, but it would manifest later than sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally find an opportunity to speak. \"What are you talking about?\" I say in my new feminine voice, sultry and high-pitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answers as he rounds me to my front, this time with a louder voice, \"Seems like the anesthesia that they administered you was stronger than it initially seemed. It kept you asleep as they pumped you full of nanobots. It seems that you were still asleep even after the procedure was done. That explains why they brought you here in that inanimate state. Heck, you were still asleep for two days straight.\" He then turns so that he is now facing me. He again draws close so that he is only an inch or two away from me. His hand gently grasps my jaw and with it he pushes my chin up, forcing me to look at his face. I can only deduce the expression on his face is over dominance, that I'm just a weaker being before him. \"You must be hungry.\" He lets go of my face. \"Why don't you go back to your room and wait there. I will cook something up and then I will bring it up to you.\" As if I didn't hear him the first time, he uses his hand to gently push me forward. I walk past him and back up to the second floor, making my way to my room after getting to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in my room, I take a seat on the bed. In the time it takes for my uncle to get back, I use that opportunity to make the bed, hoping that my uncle will see me in a new light, though not just in a physical sense. After about twenty minutes, he shows up with a tray with a large platter that holds a delicious breakfast, both appealing by the sight and smell of it. Also on the tray is a pitcher of orange juice. He sets the tray down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I let you have your meal, I have one more thing for you,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ask, \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" he briefly says and out of his pocket he reveals a metallic object. Two metal rings connected by a short chain. It was none other than a pair of handcuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those for?' I ask, a bit apprehensive of the potential uses for it. I back away from him, but in the small room, I can only get so far. The backs of my legs run into the bed and I accidentally force myself to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For this...\" he simply says and trails off as he approaches me with the handcuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is my uncle's intentions for these handcuffs?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I can't do much in this situation. I find that I'm much weaker than I was when I was a guy. Compared to the tall, muscular man before me, I'm a fragile twig. My reluctant self tries to resist, but knowing my uncle and his background as mostly military, I realize I cannot thwart any close-quarters techniques that he has in his arsenal. I try to push him away, but all that does is give him my hands to hold and the leverage to flip me from my butt to my stomach. Using just the right amount of weight to hold me down and pin me to the bed, but not too much that it applies pain to my body, he is able to gather my arms behind my back and take the handcuffs and secure each metallic ring on each of my wrists. Once the cuffs are fastened at just the right tightness, where they is little to no movement between the skin of my wrist and the inside of the cuffs, he removes his weight from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, dear,\" he apologizes. \"I need to show you something and this is the only way I can show you. Why don't you roll over and sit up.\" I try to ignore him in retaliation towards his handling of me, but the rumbling in my stomach and the weakness I feel from not having eaten force me up. I shift my weight in a sort of spiral, using my cuffed hands as leverage by pressing down on the mattress. I then kick my leg out in order to rotate my upper body upward, until I'm sitting up on the edge of the bed and my butt is planted on the mattress. Though, in my doing so, one of the straps to my babydoll slips off my shoulder. Already I can feel that side of my short nightgown start to slip off more from my body. Fortunately, my uncle sees the strap and immediately takes it and drapes it over my shoulder. I feel the need to thank him, but he starts speaking again. 'Alright, now, you just have to relax because I'm going to feed you your breakfast, okay?\" I nod in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe first gets an empty glass and starts pouring orange juice from the pitcher into it. Once it's full, he lifts it from the table and over to my mouth. As the glass gets near, I open my mouth to receive it. The edge of the glass is gently rest on my lips and when my uncle tilts the glass ever so slowly, the orange liquid gets poured into my mouth. I immediately swallow as much as I can as not to choke on the juice. When I've down about three ounces of the liquid, my uncle tilts it back and takes it back to the table. He then takes a spoon and uses a fork to shovel and push the scrambled eggs into it. He carries the spoonful of food over to my mouth, hovering his hand underneath to catch anything that falls. When I'm presented with the food, I open my mouth wide to accept the spoon. The food slowly gets carried into my mouth and once I feel the warmth of the eggs and whatever it was mixed with, my jaws close down. My uncle pulls the spoon through my closed lips and easily it comes out devoid of any food. As he puts the spoon back, I am busy chewing my food until it is digested enough to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I've swallowed my first spoonful, my uncle sits next to me on the bed. He doesn't ask about the food, probably because the sound that I've made and the fact that I'm not hiding any of my food in my cheeks tells him enough that I've enjoyed it. He speaks to ask a question. \"If you're still asking about the handcuffs and why I decided to feed is because of the current dilemma we find ourselves in. In a couple of days, the effects of the anesthesia from your procedure will wear off and your memories will gradually come back. But, just so you're not left in the dark, the dilemma we have is the Apathy Clause. Yes, you were made into the person you now are, mostly on mutual agreement. You may not understand that now, but in a couple of days you will. But I wanted to give you sense that you can make all the decisions you want, but your well-being is in my hands. I guess I'm just here to make sure you don't kill yourself or do something drastic. Now, that brings up a topic that I'm most interested about.  It's regarding how much I can trust you. I corresponded with you the three years after you graduated high school, but the fourth year, my calls stopped coming. The reason for this is actually pertaining to the Apathy Clause. I knew you and your brother had the possibility of becoming involved, so I tried to reason with people to make you guys an exception. It turned out I couldn't. There was no bribing or coercing that I could do to make that happen. The Clause weighed heavily on the choices that you made that there was no possibility for outside forces to act upon it. And because of my protests, I was banned from calling you to prevent the Clause from catching up to you. Well, I want to ask a question for you. In the year that I didn't call you, what have you done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last year which I didn't call or received calls from him is a touchy subject. I decide to lie in order to get off the hook. With my high-pitched, almost cute voice, I tell him, \"Well, I continued to go to school until I had enough credits to transfer to university. Since the university I pick was far from home, I decided to move in--\" but my uncle interrupts me quite abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not expecting it to happen and indeed, it catches me off guard. In the pit of my stomach, I believe that my uncle knows pretty well what I had done in the past year. His interruption comes in the form of a slap, hard enough to cause my cheek to sting, but not forceful enough to send me flying in the direction he had slapped me. I'm about to sit in place without careening over to the floor, but damn, that slap stings. 'If you're going to lie to me, at least make sure whoever is lying to you doesn't know the truth already,\" he says. \"Did you really think I didn't know what you were doing? So why don't you tell me truthfully exactly what you did in the past year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can do one of either three things. I can stay quiet and don't tell him of the past year. I can be honest and tell him the realest truth. Or I can continue to lie to him which in turn will garner me more slaps from my uncle. What should I do?</span></div></div>",

Dad more or less became what you were, so six months after you didn't call, I couldn't take it anymore. I had left the house as well as school and ran with the wrong people. I moved into my friends house where two of his roommates lived as well. That place was a party house and none of us went to school. We were all dropouts,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" my uncle says to stop me from talking. He pauses himself to stand. He goes over to me, grabs my upper arm and gently gets me to my feet. He guides me to the table, my back facing him. One part of me thinks he has done this so he can take advantage of me. It's relieved when he reaches for a metallic key sitting on the same platter as my breakfast. He takes it and proceeds to take off my handcuffs. He struggles to continue speaking. \"I believe I can trust you since you told me the honest truth. I'll leave you unbound to finish your breakfast,\" he says, almost in a low tone at the end of his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the cuffs are off my wrists, my uncle takes them and exits the room without another word. It feels like I should do something. I can either let him leave while I finish my breakfast, let him leave for a moment and at a later time look for him, or immediately get him to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do?</span></div></div>",

The other part of me, which is the new part of me, and which also includes the emotions and sensations I feel as this new female me, is affect by him leaving the room and is eager to leave my breakfast and run out after him. Honestly, the female side of me seems to be overtaking the old, male side of me in a seemingly one-sided victory with my female side as the commander. My uncle did mention that my memory would come back, but I don't think it'll matter after what I've already decided to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from his heavy footsteps, he had went down the hallway to the master bedroom, which is right next to the room I'm in. I look at my breakfast and I find myself with no appetite. Touched by the mood of the situation, I walk out of my room, take a right and down the rest of the hallway and into the master bedroom. Immediately, I find my uncle on the bed, staring at the ceiling and taking deep breaths. He notices me come in and looks towards my way. \"Hey, is there something wrong?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI twist my lower body sideways and side-straddle the edge of the bed. I look around at the master bedroom for a bit, taking in the similarities and the differences. Not much is different save for a couple of suitcases. The suitcases are very familiar as they are the same ones that my uncle had used when he visited the house years ago. Other than that, it's the same room that belongs to my father. When I think of it, I wonder he is. I then look at my uncle's concerned face and tell him, \"Well, you sort of left very abruptly. I was confused. I'm not sure if I said something or did something wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it wasn't you. I'm the reason I left like that,\" he tells me, still laying down. A small part of me finds his side inviting, but I keep my impulses in check. \"Your father had told me everything that had happened. Assuming you were still the nephew that I previously knew, I expected you either to stay quiet or talk your way out of the situation. When you kept yourself composed as you were telling me the truth of what happened during that fourth year, I was surprised as well as touched by how you handled that situation that I felt bad hitting you across the cheek that time. Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hand rises to touch upon the cheek that was struck by my uncle's hand. When my fingertip lightly touches the skin, it starts to sting, causing me to hiss. \"Yes,\" I simply say, after which I notice something. I observe a smile that seems to be a struggle for my uncle. I wonder, is there something that is burden for him. Not just this dilemma, with him having to take care of me with this new body. There's something else. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been staring at the ceiling when I asked him the question. He continues to stare at it as if deep in thought. He doesn't say anything, as if he is holding a deluge of acid that eating him up from the inside out. I can understand a bit. That acid may affect me if he lets it go and it might change the already-altered relationship we have between us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize I need to do something in order for him to spill his beans. What should I do though?</span></div></div>",

I'm still seated, in a position where my knees are bent and my lower legs and feet are in contact with my thighs and butt cheeks respectively. The direction I'm facing is towards the headboard, so that my legs are parallel to his side. I place a firm, yet gentle hand on my uncle's chest. I'm surprised it's still muscular and toned for his age. I rub it like I'm like the Karate Kid waxing a car. The friction between my hand and my uncle's shirt causes my hand to get hot. It also has secondary effects. One, it causes my uncle to raise the arm that I'm more of less pinning down with one of my legs and move it over towards me, wrapping it around the far side of my waist. I close my eyes as the hand wanders from the waist downwards, as if trying to find purchase on wherever his hand may securely hold. His hand moves from my waist, around the roundness of my butt until stopping to insert between my thigh and ankle. As his hand sits there, I can feel the warmth of it transferring to my legs. Its position is in an awkward place, but the warmth relaxes me. Two, he raises his other hand to stop the one that's rubbing against his chest. Unusually, it stops right where his heart is and through the shirt and through the skin, I can faintly feel it as it rise and falls. My uncle hand, which is much bigger than mine, caresses my wrist and forearm, relaxing me even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my time of turmoil, I cannot believe that God had sent an angel,\" he mutters. In a quick movement, he raises his torso, using his pelvis as the lever. At the same time, he gather me into his arms and while he positions himself at the end of the bed, he plants me side-straddle in his lap. This puts our face close to each other, close enough that I can feel his warm breath on my face. I cannot muster anything to say, but that's alright, for he slowly speaks to me. \"Did you know you look like your mother?\" I stare at him in such a way that tells him that I'm unsure. \"She had the same blank stare as you have right now. Your aunt on the other hand, while she was like your mother in his younger years, once the Apathy Clause came around and I took it upon myself to take responsibility for you, she got angry and jealous. She thought that with you like this, you would sooner or later steal the attention that I had on your aunt. Without thinking, she filed a divorce and left me. That was three months ago, halfway through your procedure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" I tell him, placing my hand on the larger hand resting on my knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks deeply at me for what seems like forever and I'm captivated by his attention. He smiles warmly and I do the same. Then all of a sudden, he starts to chuckle and turn his head away. My smile disappears and a look of confusion takes its place. I wonder what has turned his mood around. He speaks, explaining the reason. \"Sorry about that,\" he first apologizes for the change of emotion. \"Here I am telling you that I am a divorced man who told his ex-wife that he wouldn't have affection towards his charge, not when she was around. Now that she's been out of the house for three months, all I've been doing is waiting for you to arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" I say as a gentle interruption. \"Then why are you here at my house? Did something happen to yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice observation,\" he says. \"It's true. To settle the divorce, we both agreed to sell the house and split the funds down the middle. Your dad was willing enough to let me stay here. The both of us have the same responsibility, just not the same circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, my mother died two years after my graduation,\" I mention. \"That reminds me.\" I push off of my uncle's body and get to my feet. I stand straight in front of him while I clasp my hands together in front of me. \"Now that you've heard from my own mouth the truth of the fourth year, I don't think I've apologized for it.\" I pause just to take a deep breath and inadvertently cause my breasts to rise and fall with the expanding of my chest. \"I want to say I'm sorry for ruining my life and causing you to once again make it right again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my head bowed, I'm unsure how my uncle is taking this. I flinch a bit, as I'm surprised, when he reaches a hand towards me to place his warm palm on the very same cheek that he slapped. Some of the flinch was in fact a reaction to the stinging that seems to have subsided a bit, but not much. What is his full reaction?</span></div></div>",

The intense ringing is followed by a pain that wells up from the base of my skull and heightens in throbbing around my brows, causing me to clutch at those areas. I can't help but groan with my high-pitched voice. The pain is too much that my legs turn to jelly and I collapse to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it weren't for my uncle, who catches me, I would have more than a splitting headache. He manages to guide me to the floor with my head resting on his knee. I look up at my uncle, but all I can see is a distorted image. Everywhere I look, my vision is blurry. Not long after, I black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI float in a sea of black, but only for a brief moment. What comes after is a deluge of memories. Unusually enough, even though they flash before my eyes like a video tape on fast forward, I retain my knowledge of everything. From the appointment with my uncle and a representative assigned to our case regarding the Apathy Clause, which felt like I was signing up for college, though with a somewhat more reassuring uncle, to the month spent reading up all I could about the life after the procedure. I even remember every single line my uncle and I filled out on the paperwork. The only singular area that was left up to me with no encouragement or discouragement from my uncle was which procedure I would be getting. The popular route, which proved to be a painless route, involved taking a client's mind and storing it in a database while a body was being made for their mind to dwell in. The other route, although it involved a degree of pain, proved to have no disconnection from the nerves, which often occurred with the digital mind transfer route. One memory, one that causes me to hold dear to is a fantasy. In the last week before the procedure, I fantasized myself as a woman lying in the arms of my uncle. It would be taboo for my male self, but there was I, getting off on the idea of my uncle having sex with me in a female body. I had the feeling of intense impatient for that moment, which had to be disturbed by my headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I wake up, the headache has completely subsided and there is no evidence of pain. I open my eyes and I find myself under the sheets and blankets on the mattress in the master bedroom. A cool, damp cloth is draped over my forehead and it feels like I'm not wearing the nightie anymore. Instead, I'm wearing something that doesn't make me feel like I'm walking around in just my undies. When I uncover the covers over my body, I find that my torso is comfortably garnished with a tank top. Covering some clean-feeling undies is a pair of short shorts. My legs are still bare, but at least there is an extra layer of protection over my more important parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take the damp cloth from my forehead and set it down on the nightstand beside the bed. There I find a handwritten note from Niko, my uncle. The note reads, \"I'm out on a big errand. Will be back in the evening. Love, Niko.\" For some reason, my eyes dwell on the words, \"Love, Niko.\" My fantasy for my uncle submerges from the sea of memories that had flooded my smaller pond of a mind. I automatically imagine this body I'm living in for the rest of my life making love with a very handsome Uncle Niko. I notice my hand has wandered specifically between my legs, though not underneath any garments. Even above two different fabrics, I can still poke my sensitive parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm about to poke more when I hear a sound from outside the room. Could it be Niko back from his errand? So soon? I remove the covers as well as my hand from my crotch and get out of bed. Again, I notice that my headache is completely gone. I exit the room and find that the sounds is of the front door opening. It eventually opens, but unfortunately, my uncle does not walk through the threshold. Who walks in instead?</span></div></div>",

There is no need, for there is some sort of apparatus on my face providing me air. Otherwise, I wouldn't be human, as I assume myself to be. I open my eyes and barely see anything. Whatever I'm inside is most dark, only illuminated with a dim greenish blue light that is sourced underneath me. It doesn't provide me much light to see my surroundings, but it does give me silhouettes in order to assume my position. I'm in a tank most likely, with something sturdy either supporting or covering my chest. My arms lay still at my side. From two points, either cables or tubes are connected to my arms. I assume the latter would be to pump a constant supply of whatever is keeping me immobile, for there is no outside force acting on my body. I'm numb, except for my face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can assume that I'm stuck in this pod with no way to escape, the light beneath me begins to changes to that of green and then to a pale yellow. The yellow then flashes, somewhat disorienting me. I close my eyes to help, but after I open them, the yellow light continues to flash before my eyes. I close my eyes again, hoping the flashing would stop. What begins though, is first noticed by my ears. A low sound that seems to disturb the activity in the water around my head. The water's surface sloshes back and forth a foot above my head. i cannot see it, but I hear the familiar sound of minuscule waves crashing against themselves. What has happened? Is the tank moving?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can get my question answers, something opens, which looks to be an exterior shield around</span></div></div>",

In the dim lighting of the alley, when I remove my hand, I assume I will just find my wet, saturated in water. However, when I look down, I find my hand drenched in a dark liquid. I suddenly have an coppery taste in my mouth, which always accompanied an experience where I visually saw blood and even when I was near it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discomfort I initial feel slowly becomes fatigue, since my shirt, which seems to be white originally, is saturated in dark red. I can't tell really, whether this wound was caused by a gun shot or a knife, but whatever it is, it's making me bleed profusely. What circumstances would have happen to have me wounded like this? I manage to get to a four way intersection, which branches out into three more alleyways. Though my eyes fail me due to my injury, I can make out three doors lit by their own lamps, one a few steps down each new alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first alleyway, which is to my left, has the back door of a clinic. What kind of clinic, I'm not sure of.

I just hope there is people there just to open the door. I struggle to get down the alleyway, using whatever to keep myself upright and off the ground. Whether that be using the edge of the dumpster as a railing, leaning against the walls just to catch a breath and using planks of discard wood as walking sticks. A small obstacle sits in my path: a short flight of narrow steps with a flimsy-looking railing that looks like it would tear off its foundations with the slightest amount of weight placed on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I get to the steps, I discard the plank of wood I was using, and instead of using the railing to support myself as I ascend the steps, I leaning myself against the wall. Eventually, I get to the door. I knock on it with a fist, which makes my knock become a furious banging, unintentionally. I also mistakenly put some of my blood on the door as well as I bang it. Now I wait. I wait for the door to open. At the very least, I'm waiting for someone to shun me, to tell me this exit is off-limits and that I'm on private property and potentially facing a trespassing charge if I don't leave soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my surprise, I don't receive any of the worst I just thought up. In fact, as I lean against the door, unbeknownst to myself that I'm smearing likely blood evidence all over the door, I hear footsteps on the other side of it. Without warning, the door opens inward and my weight unintentionally forces the door open even further. Whoever opened the door must not be that strong even to support the dead weight of a near-dead adult man. Without his needed strength, I simply fall to the floor, my eyes darting to a dark ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm so fatigued that the sheer force of my non-invited drop onto the clinic's floor knocks me into a half-conscious state. The next moments are blurry, but I can tell that I'm being dragged further into the clinic. I can see that it's dimly lit, which tells me this clinic is supposed to be closed. This person dragging me must be here late, but on what is a mystery to me. I have no concern on what he's actually doing this late at night. I have more concern on my current wounded state and wondering if this person would be generous enough to stitch me up and medicate me with no charge. I wonder if I'm the first customer to come to his establishment thinking that this humble clinic was an emergency room. Then again, I wonder if this a usual thing for him. What does that say about this person? What does that say about me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did I get this wound? Who did I infuriate enough to them to cause harm to me in the bloodiest of forms? And how did I get away? And am I still on the run with people close by on my trail?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing I remember before blacking out is that I'm lifted onto a table or elevated cushion, like those in kids' doctors' offices. I must be making a mess of it with my wound and for that, I believe I owe this Samaritan, whether good or of the shady sort, some form of appreciation or payment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I wake up though, I'm surprised to find that...?</span></div></div>",

Before I open my eyes, I feel like I'm resting on a firm, yet soft cloud covered by a thick blanket. I can tell that I'm naked, but what can one do to make sure a wound is treated and stitched up. I bet it's to further promote good health, since those clothes I was wearing, when they got wet, were heavy and constricting. I breathe in what feels like cool air, but not as cold as the air in that alley. It smells cleaner too. With my ears, I hear the sounds of some place far from the bustling sounds of a city. There is a slight breeze, which whistles a bit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally open my eyes and discover that this bed I'm laying on is covered by a roof and its sides are enclosed with opaque drapes. This is like the kind of bed a princess would have. The moment I push myself up into a sitting position, I find that I'm somewhere much different. I'm not referring to this unfamiliar bed in a place that's far from that alleyway I found myself in. What I'm referring to is much more personal. I can't explain it, but when I sit up, I'm surprised by the weight hanging off my chest. The blanket falls, reveal two globes, large enough that I can cup them with my hands, but a bit bigger and with a certain buoyancy. Fleshy mounds like these would only be found on a woman. But I'm a man though, I think to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I observe my chest, the hair attached to my head falls in front of my face and as if by instinct, I take the wayward locks of brunette hair and tuck whatever I can behind my ears. I have to catch myself, knowing such an action is used by those with long hair, women included. I myself have never had long hair, choosing to cut it short whenever I have the chance to go to a barber. But to do an action that is equally unfamiliar with waking up to find female breasts on my chest is disconcerting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pull off the covers, less out of curiosity and more out of concern, hoping that I'm not fully a part of the female species. But lo and behold, when the blanket is taken off, I find two shapely legs attached to a wide pelvis and an absence of a manhood between my legs. To replace it, I feel the doorway to a female reproductive system. What happened last night? What happened that caused me to find myself in this unfamiliar place in an equally unfamiliar body. All I remember is getting to a clinic and someone opening the door for me. Did that person bring me to make me.... this? Instead of helping a guy out with his wound, I'm turned into a woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the reason, I sure there is a bigger reason why I'm a woman, and most of them are ones where I'm at a disadvantage. There is no positive outcome in this situation. Wherever this place is, I need to get out. Vulnerable I was with the bloody wound, but as a woman, I find myself to be much more vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crawl over to the end of the bed. I lightly use my head to part the drapes aside so that I can see what's beyond it and before I can observe with my eyes, I hear something. I can't really tell what it is, but it sure tells me that I'm not alone in this room. When I peek my head out to see who or what is in the room, I discover it to be a...?</span></div></div>",

Dressed in business attire, I can tell he has a high-paying job, one that can afford to live in a modern house like this. I'm distracted by the high ceiling, which has a skylight right in the center of it, where bright natural sunlight comes in at at angle and hits the walls. My attention draws back to the man who continues to type in his computer. I cannot tell what he is working on, but it sure looks like a report of some kind considering how fast his fingers hit the keys. I also observe, draped on the office hair he is sitting on, a white lab coat reminiscent of a doctor's coat. Could he be the person who opened the door to the clinic and dragged my wounded body inside? And could he be the one who put me in this body? And what of my original, wounded, male body? What did he do to that? Even when I'm reluctant to interact with this person, he is the sole person who has the answers to my questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I do that, I have to get out of the bed. I swing my feet over the end of the bed and slowly try to lower myself. Before I can even meet the floor, the man speaks, asking, \"You ought to put some clothes on before you leave the bed, my dear.\" He has the nerve to address me as, 'his dear,' but he's right. Who in his... her right mind wants to leave a covered bed in a stranger's house with no clothes. Must be the man in me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pull my legs back onto the bed and then peek my head back out again. I see the man get up from his chair and turn to look at me. Seeing his face, I'm correct in him being of the tall, dark and handsome type. In fact, he's tall, tan-skinned, handsome and I can also tell he takes care of his body. Not that I'm attracted to him, though, just observing the facts. He walks over to a table next to an open window and retrieves a paper bag. He also takes a garment hanging on the back of the chair with him as well. He then walks over to where I'm peeking from behind the white drape and sets the bag down next to the bed. He also hands the dark garment directly to me. \"Now, if you want, you can freshen up in the shower or I can draw a bath for you,\" he mentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take the garment from him, but at once I ask, \"You turn me into a woman and you offer me your bathroom. For what reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a friendly favor,\" he says. I noticed he did not deny him turning me into a woman. \"I know you have your assumptions and you have a whole lot of questions, but consider this. You've had a terrible night and you've woken up in someplace different. Why not relax yourself from all your worries with a hot shower or warm bath? Afterwards, I'll be available to answer any questions you may have. Do note that there is some clothes in this bag you can put on.\" He then leaves and goes back to work at his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do? Take him up on his offer? Or refuse? In any case, being naked for the rest of my life like a woman (if it turns out to be that way in the end) does not sound inviting. What should I do?</span></div></div>",

I watch him happily walk from his desk to the right wall, where he disappears. All I can hear is the sound of water rushing down from a shower head. The man then reappears and says, \"It's ready for you,\" before going back to his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remove myself from the side of the drape and stretch out the garment he gave me. It turns out to be a bath robe, made out of a light material, probably of silk or satin. I put it on, feeling the cool softness of the fabric against my skin. I tie the included band, made out of the same fabric, around my waist so that most of my private areas are covered and not exposed. I part the drapes once more, this time to get to the floor of the rather high bed, as if I'm coming down from a cloud. When my feet touch the floor, the man doesn't say anything to annoy me. I look over and he continues to work on his computer. I wonder what he's workng on, I think to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab the bag and approach the middle of the room, turning right into the alcove that has a mounted, floating, folding partition. The alcove has all the amenities of an elite master bathroom. A ornate, modern sink with a large mirror that matches the width on the sink and countertop, which is made out of a pearly-white granite. Opposite the sink and counter is a bathtub that has jets like a jacuzzi. If I was to choose this option, it would really make me relax, maybe even further as it releases the emotional tension in my body. Flanking the tub is a bidet. To those that have never heard or seen on of these, it's like a toilet but with extra features, more notably the addition of a spout that provides a spray of water on soiled assholes, literally. I probably won't be using that today. Last, but certainly not least, is the shower. I had assumed it was a simple shower with a single showerhead. My mouth gapes in awe at a shower that I've only seen in commercials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI make sure to lock the partition, one to hide my body once I've taken off my bath robe and two, to hide my amazement of such a collection of fixtures. I make note of where the towels are and make my way into the shower. Compared to the tub, this shower is fully enclosed, the entrance of which is made of semi-transparent glass, which already has condensation on the inside part due to the steam from the hot water. At the moment, there is only one showerhead on, but I can see about a dozen, if not more, nozzles fixed into the absolute black granite that lines the three walls. Before me, below the mounted main showerhead, that can be removed and used as a handheld faucet, is a panel of smooth buttons. Before I can press any of those buttons, I walk underneath the flow of water from the showerhead, which douses me in hot water. Uncontrollably, I yelp with my high-pitched voice and I hold my mouth to prevent any more yelps to escape. No doubt that initial sound was heard by the man outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed he heard it and thought I was having trouble. \"Are you okay in there?\" he asks as he calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI call back, \"I'm okay. I'm just not used to this kind of shower.\" I wonder what his expression is like right now, after he has impressed someone like me with his fancy shower. I bet he has a smile on his face, the corners of his mouth rising from cheek to cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI catch my breath as I try to calm myself down. It wasn't the heat of the water that surprised me, but the fact that the water on this female body... feels good. I move under the flow of water once more, making sure to breath in and out so that I don't scream out in ecstasy for a second time. As I do, the flow of the water soaks my long brunette hair and flows against every part of my skin. Most especially along the skin of my breasts and against the front door of my pelvis. It's pretty hard trying to keep the male part of my mind from going insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I'm drenched and used to the temperature of the water, my curiosity, now fired up, causes me to investigate the panel of buttons, three of which are tempting to press. The first one, has a letter \"U\" in bold font on it. The second button has a sort of icon on it that is reminiscent of the cross of a scope on a gun. I wonder if that means it will shoot out a jet of water at me. The third one has the word \"FULL,\" which is also written in bold font. I have an idea what that would entail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich of the three button should I press?</span></div></div>",

When I press the button, what happens in the next few moments, while the main showerhead stays on, is that every spout or nozzle that I see turns on one by one until I have gallons of water rushing about my body. Each nozzle has its own setting on how it shoots out the water. While some are large amounts of soft, there is a balance between that and just a bit of sharp jets. The light of streams comes from below me, for instead of a drain, there is yet another spout that lightly laps between my legs. I feel like I'm underneath a waterfall, but instead of cool island river water, it's more the temperature of hot springs water mixed with a bit of sun-baked ocean water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't help but relax, as I turn around and around until every part of my sensitive exterior has been touched by the wonderful streams. I inhale and exhale deeply, as my more sensitive of areas are gently touched. Now trying to stay sane as a man in a female body is turning out to be impossible. I push the FULL button once more and the separate spouts and nozzle discontinue their streams, leaving the main one on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step out of the stream and lean against the wall, trying to get my bearings with this wonderful bathroom fixture. I close my eyes and I cannot believe how I can remember so detailed a detail. The downpour of warm rain fall on my breasts, bouncing droplet left and right and down in between the two mounds. And that underside spout. It start hitting my crotch and blanketing my asshole but doing much more with my unfamiliar snatch. It was as if an aquatic hand was gently running its soft finger upon it. My mind wanders and eventually finds itself thinking of the man outside, a smile on his face and the thought snaps me out of my reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn off the shower and watch the water drain into circular hoops that surrounding the only nozzle that would have been my downfall as a man if it had been the only one I turned on, which makes me eye the U button. I can see why this man has it, but did he consider a woman using this shower and getting a whole different benefit from it. Would he know? Would he be curious? Do I even want to know those things? My reverie brings me back to reality as I'm reminded of the many question I have. I calm myself down, again taking deep breaths in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, the sensations are still there, albeit faint. Only a hint is remaining. What should I do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first glance, the beige material seems to take up the majority of the bag. It looks like a fine towel just to cover what's below it. But when I pull it out, it's like pulling one of those rope ladders made of handkerchiefs that magicians use as a gag for laughs. When the garment is totally out, all that is left is smaller piece of fabric, which turns out to be a pair of panties in a dark brown color. I discard the bag and stretch out the major garment, which turns out to be what ladies call a maxi dress. It's like a casual gown usually worn during summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout observing the overall look of the dress, I put it on, figuring to insert my head through the very middle hole and my arms through the holes flanking the middle. In retrospect, I notice a lot more holes that didn't seem to be used for anything. When I finally have it on, I realize those holes were for decoration. The top portion of the dress is more or less like a high-cut, female version of a vest. My whole back is covered, so it's not like a halter top. What is exposed, however, is my neckline as well as a generous amount of cleavage. The collar forms a \"V\" where the intersecting point is about an inch below my bust line. A small hole sits below the V to expose a bit of my stomach. Two holes flank the either side of this to expose my sides and a bit of my back. The lower portion is basically the rest of the dress, which flows straight down and should bunch up at my feet. I notice two slits for my legs at either side of my gown. Each separate about an inch or two below my waist and if I stand, it would certainly show off my legs. I guess the remaining thing to do is to put my panties on to cover something else up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I'm done dressing up, I part the drapes and make my way to the floor. To my surprise, I see the man out of his seat and standing in the middle of the room. In his hands he holds up three pairs of shoes. In one hand he holds two heeled shoes. The first is a strappy high heel with a bit of a platform underneath the ball of the foot, which in turn gives it a higher heel. Looks to be about five inches in length from tip to heels. The other shoe is similar in design, but instead of a pointy heel, it has a block wedge, which has a flat sole underneath it. In his other hand, he holds a flat-soled sandal. I believe the sandals are called gladiators, similar to the footwear used by gladiators in an Roman arena. On his face is an astonished smile. \"Wow, you look great in that dress,\" he says, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting off on this real well, aren't you?\" I ask, annoyed at his amusement..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I realized you needed one more piece to complete your look, but I'll give you a choice,\" he says to me. \"Either dare yourself and wear a pair of heels, ease yourself for heels with the wedges, or go safe and wear the flats, which are much nicer than flip flops, in my opinion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would easily go for flip flops,\" I shoot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, be a good sport,\" he tells me. \"I'm giving you a chance to be--\" he start, but I interrupt him, mainly because his phrasing hits a nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be a woman? Maybe to be your woman? What was your reason for turning a man into a woman?\" I shoot off on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were wounded and bleeding--\" he starts, but I interrupt him a slap, which causes his glasses to fall to the floor and break. The shattering of one of the lenses silences the room. He may have went too far in turning me into a woman, but in a social aspect, me slapping him was me going too far in my frustration. The man transfers the gladiator sandals to the hand holding the other two pairs of shoes and then bends down to retrieve his glasses from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guilty knot forms in my stomach. It's one thing to slap a man, but to break something that helps him see is a whole different thing. \"Sorr--\" I try to apologize, but he too interrupts me, in his own gentle way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries,\" he interjects. \"In a way, I'm sorry as well. I did not get your consent, but it was your urgency to be treated and your half-conscious state that obliged me to do what I had to do.\" He looks at the broken pair of glasses in his free hand and tosses it onto an arm chair. \"You would have died if i didn't do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a calm, yet critical voice, I ask, \"Why a woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the only option. That clinic was just a clinic you see. I had experimental equipment that enable me to transfer your consciousness into that body you are now using. She was a nobody, mainly because she was an investment from someone. She wasn't born. She was made and whoever made her accelerated her age in just six months time. I did not know I could do it, but I did and you were the finished product,\" he explains. \"Sorry if that makes you feel like an object.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he explained his bit, I closed my eyes trying to calm the anger directed more at the situation.and less on this man. A question pops up. \"If I'm an investment, then am I someone's property? Was this body meant for someone else?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man pauses to think about his answer. I bet he has to since his blurting out of answer has gotten him a furious woman and a broken pair of glasses. \"It wasn't meant for anybody. In actuality, I had no one to transfer their consciousness into it,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" I start, \"spur of the moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much. If you hadn't came along, my last resort was to become... her... myself,\" he struggles to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" I say, understanding a bit of what makes the matter profound. \"Potentially, if you were in this body, you probably wouldn't have the clinic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows where I could've been,\" he adds, which causes a silence in the room. Our gazes wander to trivial objects in the room. Our expressions are that of the unconcerned. I move my gaze to the three pairs of shoes in his other hand. I silent approach the man without looking at him. I reach over and lift up his wrist look at the choices he's given me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I go for the heels, which has benefits of giving me more height while keeping the maxi dress from bunching up at the bottom and potentially tripping me when I walk? Potentially, I have a slight disadvantage with the heels, due to unfamiliarity in wearing them, I can trip on myself or hurt myself by rolling my ankle. How about the wedges, which has the same benefits as the heels, but without the disadvantage. You can say the wedges have qualities of both the heels and the flats. Or should I take the sandals, which has the benefits of better balance than a heeled shoes, but with the disadvantage of tripping on my own dress?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I grab the whole bunch of shoes from the man's hand and put them down on the ground. After a bit of deliberating, I pick up the pair of heels and turn on my heels to sit down in the arm chair. The man just stands in place, probably just to watch me put on the heels, but I don't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI part the front of the skirt a bit to expose my smaller feet and insert one into the correct shoe. I have to insert my feet through two sets of triple straps before my toes, the ball of my feet as well as my heel can be seated in their appropriate areas. The shoe has peek-a-boo effect with my toes and exposes much of the top of my foot, but not too much. Plus, the color scheme of the heels sort of matches my outfit, since the primary is a light tan or beige with the secondary being a black color. The shoes do not have to be fastened or anything, since with the stretchy straps, with my feet inserted, they keep them in the heels rather than potentially falling off with every step. I do the same with the other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, I try to push off the arms of the armchair to get to my feet, but I find it difficult. The man comes at the right time to offer his hand, which I gladly take and he pulls me to my feet. He sort of pushes too hard and I lose my balance and tip over into him. He catches me though, asking, \"You got it?\" while pushing back to keep me upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I get my balance, I say, \"Thank you for that.\" I look up and notice i'm about five inches taller, able to see into his throat if I were to be comparing my height with his. Without the heels, his tall stature would tower over me and I would only be able to see his chest if I was looking straight at him at the lower height. I let go of his hand and try my hand at walking. Just to make sure I don't fall and hurt myself, he stays close, ready to catch me at the right moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn actuality, I don't need the help, for I notice right away, if I walk as if I'm on a tightrope and keep the platform underneath the balls of my feet and the tip of the heel on the ground, I'll be fine walking. From the armchair, I walk over to the bed. From the bed, turn on my heel and walk back to the armchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it?\" the man asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll take getting used to, but I think I can manage,\" I tell him. \"Say, why shoes? Are you taking me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a date, if that's what you're referring to,\" the man says. \"I just figured, with you being out for three days---\" I have to interrupt him because of that mind-boggling length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been out for three days?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes a while for the consciousness to fill the whole body,\" he tells me. \"Every nerve in the body has to connect to the consciousness within it. This is why you're not sore or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything feels...\" I start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he finishes, \"As it's supposed to feel. Three days in bed, I might as well take you out to eat brunch. You must be starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a matter of fact, I am. As a kind gesture, and as I'm hoping he will help me stabilize as I walk, I wrap my arm around his own. \"So where are we eating?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm thinking someplace relaxing, like a beach,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know I'm wearing heels, mister,\" I mention. He acknowledges it with a joking smile. \"And what food do we get at the beach? Don't tell me we have to catch it ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" he says and doesn't say anything. He leaves my side to disappear behind a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" I ask as I knock on the door. In the meantime, I walk a bit more in the heels, just trying to get a feel for them. Most certainly, if I was still a man and I wore these heels, no doubt will I find myself sprawl on the floor. I look at the window and find it open. Since we are going out, not on a date of course, we might as well lock these windows up. Before I do so, however, the man reappears as he opens the door, dressed in different clothes. He comes out wearing a pair of shorts with a button-up shirt, which he has a zip-up hoodie worn over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, leave that for the maid. She comes in about an hour,\" the man tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I simply say and turn on my heel and meet up with him. I discover he's holding a bunch of blankets. I ask, \"What with all the blankets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember the place we are going to has a rule that you have to B.Y.O.B.,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B.Y.O.B.?\" I ask, repeating the acronym. After putting the sight of the blankets together with the four letters, I come up with, \"Bring Your Own... Blanket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" he assures me. He hands me a throw blanket, similar in color with my outfit. \"If memory serves me right, it can get pretty cold over there, so I'm bringing extra.\" With two blankets in his arms, I cannot hold onto his arm for stability, but I don't fear anything since I've been practicing for a bit. I just have to be extra careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leads me out of the room and into the hallway. In this one hallway, there is only one other door here and it leads into a maintenance closet. The man does the honor of telling me everything about his house, which turns out to be pretty big. The closet has a hatch with stair steps that can be used to access the roof, mostly for workers to clean the skylight that I'm about to see once in a while. Other things like the floor's water heater is inside as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the hallway, the space opens up and I'm amazed at a large hole. On the edges of the hole is a banister that keeps anyone from falling through the hole. In actuality, this whole space near the hole is cylindrical and it's like an open hallway, with doors branching out to different rooms. Instead of giving me a tour of the house, the man leads me down the staircase, as if he's impatient of me trying to see his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI make my way down the spiral staircase that is contained the hole. With the blanket roll in one hand, pressed against my hips, I use my other hand to stabilize myself by utilizing the railing. I make my way one step at a time, the heels giving me the benefit of not stepping on my dress and falling down the stairs as a consequence. It a bit of a struggle, since I'm literally tip-toeing down to every step, but cannot put my heels down because of a tall and slender heel preventing it doing so. After about two minutes or so, I make it down the long, windy staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man waits for me at the bottom and leads me to the garage, which is down another hallway, which is a left at the bottom of the stairs. Along the way, I see another office to the right and opposite that a full-sized kitchen. I ask the man, \"Do you cook?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that much. I can only cook some basic dishes. That's why I hire my chef friend when I feel like eating in,\" he tells me as he leads me down the hallway. I pass three doors that lead to other rooms before we get to the fourth door, which leads into the garage. To my surprise, it's not the kind of garage that I imagined. It looks nothing like the rest of the house: neat, tidy, clean. \"Forgive the mess. The people I employ to do maintenance and housekeeping stay away from the garage. Mainly, because I like it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe garage is long and seems to curve to contour the house it's built against. There are about three cars in this garage that are covered by car covers. I ask the man about it, \"Do you drive these cars that are covered?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, but I can only focus on one,\" he tells me and leads me to the one car that isn't covered. It sits in the front of the line of cars in the garage, the first to leave out the door. It's a Jeep, from what I can tell and it sits on massive off-road tires. The tires aren't gigantic, but they're big enough to raise the profile of the jeep several inches. A conveniently placed sidestep is installed to help people get into the jeep. The vehicle has four door, so it can carry an additional two to three people in the back, but since it's just the two of us, we just toss the blankets in the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man opens the garage doors and lets a slight breeze blow through. It kicks up the skirt of my dress, but not by much. The wind does remind me that my legs are totally bare, with only a pair of panties to keep something else warm and cozy. Knowing that I have heels on, the man assist me in getting into the jeep. He offers his hand and opens the passenger door wide so I can get in with no worry of my outfit snagging on anything. He makes it obvious that this doesn't make this moment a date, saying, \"I'm just helping a woman get into a tall Jeep, okay? Just put your foot here and pull against that handle up there.\" I put the platform of the shoe on the sidestep, with the heel of my shoe hanging in mid-air. I put all my weight on the platform and not the heel part. I see two handles in the top corners of the door frame. I reach up and pull on those and using just one hand, the man assist my rising into the seat by supporting my buttocks. When I'm in the seat with no malfunction with my maxi dress or my heels, I'm just glad that I'm able to sit in this car. I don't protest in the man using a hand to feel upon my buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closes the door for me and then rounds the front of his jeep to get to the driver's side. He climbs in and turns over the engine, which, to be able to turn those massive wheels, a powerful engine is needed. The roar of the engine impresses me, causing me to smile. I ask him as he puts the truck into gear, \"Do you take this off-roading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to, but my job doesn't give me enough time to,\" he tells me as he pulls the jeep out of the garage and pushes a button to close said garage. He navigates through the driveway and eventually to the street and then to the highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, I get to the know the man who put me in this body. His name is Allen Murao and he's a doctor at a clinic. He mostly deals with physical therapy and rehabilitation. His clientele mostly consist of athletes who have gotten injuries while playing their respective sports and he works to get them back into shape so they can rejoin the competition. He also tells me he also had experience and an unknown talent for neuro-science, which is why someone invested this body that I now control and some experimental equipment in order to do what he did. He also told me he was given a timeline to complete it, but he had no clue what to do. When I showed up at his clinic that one night, it was an opportunity for him to complete his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, me showing up at your door that one night, I was like a godsend then?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that would be called a godsend. It was an opportunity, one that I was stressed about going through with it. Heck, you were bleeding onto my floor and my floor doesn't even get that much blood on it. I could have done something to patch you up, but it was only to get you out of my clinic and on your way. I doubt I would have the skills to heal your wound,\" he explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's why you put me in this body? Knowing that I would die by my injuries if you didn't put my consciousness in a living body,\" I deduce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much,\" he agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe enter a tunnel that bores through a forested hill. While we drive inside the tunnel, we pause from conversation and think about the things we just talked about. I try to put myself in his shoes. If I had the means to do what he did in transferring my consciousness from one body to another and I was presented with this stressful opportunity, I probably would have chosen the same route. I feel like he's trying to deal with it and I would do the same if I was in his position. He's pretty much dealing with the fallout. Me, my frustrations, my anger at him for doing something like he did. As we come out of the tunnel, which replaces the yellow tunnel lights with natural sunlight, I gently say, \"You had no choice.\" Somehow I can feel that he is agreeing with me in a silent way. I think I can also sense that he is nodding to my comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen exits off the highway and gets to a dusty street. Eventually, we come to this gate, where a large man with a friendly face is standing with a clipboard in his hand. What does this man have to say?</span></div></div>",

He steps forward and leading me out of the room and out into the hallway. As I walk, carefully with each step, I look around and observe the house around me. I can tell this man is well off, since judging by the room's size and proportionally the rest of the house, the whole building is rather large. At the end of the hallway, is an open room, which consists of a cylindrical clearing with a hole in the middle. To prevent anyone from falling into the hole, where a spiral staircase sits, a banister surrounds the edge of the hole. The man assists me as I pick up the front of my dress so I don't accidentally step on it as I walk down each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom, I'm greeted with a foyer, which itself is also cylindrical. The man walks me to the front door, which he opens, revealing his driveway. He leaves me on the top step of the porch as he goes to bring his car. The next time I see him, it's in a shiny convertible. He also has donned a new pair of glasses as well as his smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought this wasn't a date,\" I mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not,\" he calls out to me, \"but how's a man to take a woman out if it's not in style.\" Seriously, even if he doesn't have the desire or intent, he really tries too hard to impress me. Though, it's hard not to show it on face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was a date, he would get out of his car to open the door for me. I certainly know it's not a date, for he just watching me as I walk, on my own, down the steps and onto the driveway and into his car. Though it would have been nice to have a bit of help, with my heels and all, I have to remind myself that if this man helps me, I'm his woman. I am certainly not his woman. Just an equal. I make it to the car door and inside the car with no struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drive his car off his estate and along the way, I find out more about him. His name is Alan Murao, who runs his own clinic. He says he's a physician and does check ups as a majority of his work. On the side, he does the experimental work of transferring peoples' consciousness from one body to another. He did it as an investment from a generous investor, but he doesn't know who he is, which worries me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, we get to the city and to the very building that the restaurant is in. We walk in and find that it's a hotel and a rather nice one too. We see other couple there, though with their hands interlocking each other. I try not to let the emotions of this body get to me, as seeing one is fine, but seeing multiple couples with the lovey-dovey signs of their relationships, it's hard not to get jealous. I remind myself, I'm here with a colleague and a friend, who I do not know that well yet. I'm not here on a date with a potential suitor. I wonder if this guy is asking himself the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have to check in at the desk, but fortunately, this man has already made reservations with the restaurant. We enter an elevator alone and ride it to the top. What do we find at the top?</span></div></div>",

The elevator doesn't go up any higher. \"What do we do?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" he tells me and he lets go of my arm and tries to press the penthouse button again. He tries this for four more times, with the same outcome. \"Maybe it's a glitch. I do remember this building to be very new compared to the other buildings. Maybe the penthouse button is broken. We can either switch elevators and see if the other ones go higher or we can just go up one floor and then use the stairs from then on. Then again, we can just go someplace else and I'll just let you choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should we do?</span></div></div>",

He walks out and i follow after him. Once we are on the hallway, we turn around and watch the doors close before us. I watch the numbers count down as the very elevator that we were on goes back down to the lobby. Alan pushes the call button and we wait for an elevator to start rising to our current floor. A ding accompanies the opening of doors of the elevator to our right. I walk in first while Alan follows me in. \"Alright, here goes.\" He presses the penthouse button, which for a moment lights up. It causes the doors to close. The next moment, the light illuminating the penthouse button dims and another lights up. The button that lights up is the \"B\" button for basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the elevators starts to lower itself the most lowest floor. It means what it means. In the elevators, the \"G\" button for garage sits right above the button for the basement, meaning the basement is below the underground parking garage underneath the hotel. Alan tries hard to stop the elevator from making it way to the basement level. He tries to push every button for other floors, but they don't light up when he presses them. He also tries to apply the emergency brakes, but that fails as well. The only good thing about this is that the elevator is lowering itself at the very same pace as it had went up, meaning the elevator isn't falling. But that's the only good thing about this. We certainly won't get killed, but this moment I have a bad feeling like something or someone is waiting for us in the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's nothing we can do. Alan had told me that the elevator glass was bulletproof and soundproof, so there isn't any chance we can break it open or shout to people in the lobby about our predicament. In a last ditch effort, I try to pound on the glass as we pass the 20th floor. Unfortunately, no one is in the lobby right now. Actually, there are workers here, but they don't dare look up at the elevators, no matter how significant they are in this lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, we get to the basement. The doors open and a semi-dark, semi-lit basement sits before us. Toiletries of different kinds sit wrapped in plastic and are stacked on wooden pallets, filed against the wall to our left. A pallet jack sits to our right, against the opposite wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan tries to again, push every button he could find inside the elevator, again to no avail. I suggest, \"Can't we just find the stairs and just leave this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Alan says, with a bit of embarrassment in his face. He exits the elevator and unwittingly takes my hand (thankfully he doesn't interlock his fingers) and leads me hurriedly down the basement corridor. We get to a crossroads of corridors. In this T-intersection, the left hallway is packed with pallets of unopened boxes. Though there is space to squeeze through, we decide to instead continue down the hallway where it's much more open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI share Alan's nervousness, as his palms get sweaty and his breathing quickens. His pace doesn't speed up though, as if he clearly knows he's pulling along a woman in heels. The hallway turns right and we come to another intersection, this time branch out into three hallways. The hallways are well-lit, but unfortunately, there are too many object in them to navigate through. We continue down until we see a sign with a line that zigs and zags up and to the right. We both know that's the symbols for the stairs. Alan rushes along to the lit door, though not too fast as to make me trip on my dress. When we get to the door, does anything happen?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I peek out my head out to see who or what is in the room with me, I discover nobody human. A dog, who looks to be a purebred German Shepherd, is laying in his comfy bed on the opposite side of the room. He immediately perks his head up with his pointy ears at attention when he sees me appear from behind the drapes. I had enjoyed dogs when I was a man, but knowing I may be a stranger to this dog, I don't move an inch from my position. When he gets on his feet and trots over, the bell on his collar jingling with ever step, I get a bit defensive. What damage can a full grown German Shepherd to a naked woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe prances over to a table off to the side and I watch him grab a piece of paper off the table with his mouth. When he turns his head and his eyes catch mine, I freeze, except for my hands, which manipulates the drapes to hide everything below my neck. He walks over to me and using the gap that I had left between one edge of the drapes and the post holding up the canopy of the bed, he jumps and infiltrates the interior. I stay still, hoping that no sudden moves would startle him into attacking me. I sense him on the bed behind me and my wild imagination assumes him as a rabid wolf with teeth bared ready to intercept his prey, though I don't hear any growling. He moves in to my side and lays himself beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look down at him and with innocent eyes, he looks back, raising his head to directly hand me the piece of paper. I reluctantly take it from him and unfold it. I let go of the drapes to hold the note with two hands. The paper reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To whom it may concern,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are reading this, then I'm glad to see that you are well and awake. Please do not mind Rango. You are no stranger to him, so he's harmless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do not doubt you have a whole lot of questions and I will answer them to the best of my ability when I get back from the clinic. My home is available to you. Please recuperate yourself with whatever I have and if you need clothes, I've managed to provide you some. They are sitting on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll see you when I get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Dr. Murao\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have my suspicions and they all start with how friendly this doctor is. How friendly is he to take in a wounded man only to transform him into a healthy person... with boobs!? And to take him... her back to his wonderful abode? I smell something fishy here and a bit of investigating should be done. Since I don't have a handy detective or gumshoe around, I'll have to do it myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step out of bed, my feet feeling the cool hardwood floor that encompasses the whole spacious room. Rango, the German Shepherd jumps off the bed and follows close behind. I ask the dog, \"Why is it that you follow me like this?\" As if he is another human, I cover my exposed body with my arms and walk briskly to the table. A stack of clothes sits folded neatly on the table, like the letter said. I inspect each garment and come to find it's not much. A bra and matching thong and a satin bathrobe that when worn, only covers most of my torso and barely covers my ass. If anything, these clothes will cover me somewhat. New questions does present itself. How did this doctor acquire these for me? Is there or was there someone living here that wasn't a man? Or... maybe this doctor is not a man at all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, I manage to put on the garments with no hassle and they do a good job keeping me a bit warm. I can't say it does much for my legs, but it'll do. The thong in fact is snug against my crotch and even though it leaves my butt cheeks exposed, it's not that bad. The bra as well supports my breasts and keeps them from swaying left and right when I walk. The satin robe, along with covering my torso, feels like it isn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that I'm clothed, though not in a manner that is in my favor, now would be a good time to investigate. A clock mounted on the wall tells me it's close to noon, so give or take an hour, I should have five hours to check up on this doctor. Where should I start? I see a computer near Rango's bed, but the open door to the rest of the home invites me to other places within it. Then again, I could just wait for the doctor to come back to answer any questions I may have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do?</span></div></div>",

It's more practical than intentional. Without a dick to get in the way, i can walk as if I'm on a tightrope. I wonder if this is how I would walk with heels on. Not that I'm curious though. Just concerned, that's all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRango follows me closely, more like a sidekick that a guard dog or service animal. Since he doesn't get in my way, I ignore him and let him be.<br>\r\nHalfway between the table and the desk, I spot my reflection in a full-sized mirror standing near what looks like a dresser. If I was a man, I would be attracted to this new me, which further makes me cringe knowing my male mind is attracted to this female body I'm inhabiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the desk, I pull out the office chair and take a seat. I have to adjust it so my eyes are level with the middle of the screen. On the tower, the green light that would illuminate the symbol shaped like a open circle with a short line jutting through its top flashes, telling me that the computer is either asleep or hibernating. I find the mouse and click the left button, which activates the fan in the computer tower and therefore, wakes up the computer. The screen turns on and an account shows up. I assume, since it's been idling for enough time to have it go to sleep, the computer would ask for a password.

When the screen opens to the actual activity that was on the screen before the computer went to sleep, I'm shocked to find a wanted poster to my male persona. Even the name matches. The poster reads, \"Wanted for Murder, Resisting Arrest and Grand Theft Auto. Cesar Lopez. Last seen: Downtown, near Shopping District.\" A number is listed below a criminal mugshot of my face, which looks different since I've never grown a beard that long before. Below the listed number, a reward is also written to a hefty twenty-five grand. What did I do to garner accusation of murder, resisting arrest and grand theft auto? And what did I experience last night to garner me a bloody mess in my abdomen? Here's another question: when this doctor put me in this body, where did he leave the dying remains?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis information leaves me confused. Should I be sad that my male self is dead, rotting like a corpse in some dump? Or should I feel grateful for this doctor for doing whatever he or she did? Or should I be mad that he or she couldn't put me in a better body, one that matched the previous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can choose what to feel at this moment, the doorbell to the home rings. Rango, just like a dog would when a stranger approaches, barks. He does this loudly, enough to get me off my feet and over to him to shut him up. A good pad and rub on his head calms him down, but it's not enough when the door rings again, causing Rango to go off like an unattended grenade with its pin removed. He leaves me no choice but to search for the front door and answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left of the bed, there is a door, ajar, leading outside into a hallway, I open it wide to indeed find a hallway beyond its threshold. To my immediate right, there is a door which turns out to be a closet filled with coats and shoes. Rango instead walks the other way, down to the left. I follow him and get to a clearing, which turns out to be an high-ceiling skylight. The sun, which sits high above the house, bears its rays straight through the tinted skylight and onto the spiral staircase below it. Without letting me know, Rango, still barking at each ringing of the door bell, makes his way does the stairs. I follow him to the bottom and into a foyer, where I find him pawing at a door. \"This must be the front door,\" I say aloud and hear my voice for the first time. It's neither manly or deep in tone, but feminine and higher-pitched. One could say that my new voice sounds cute even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pull on Rango's collar to get him down onto all his four paws and to put him behind me. This way, he doesn't get any sly ideas of pouncing on the person on the other side of this door. The door bell rings again, causing Rango to go crazy and bark at the door. Since I'm already pissed at his barking, I bark back at him, \"Shut up, Rango!\" It's enough to get him to sit and shut his mouth for five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI unlock the door and twist the handle. I pull the door open and find... who?</span></div></div>",

He's tall, clearly a foot taller than my petite frame, and wears a leather jacket and jeans as his outfit. Judging from the emptiness of the driveway, this guy isn't any biker. He's too tall for one. \"Excuse me,\" I timidly say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turns around and is shocked when he sees me. \"Gwen?\" he asks, addressing me as this 'Gwen.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tries to respond, but gives an expression as if he has an epiphany or that he has realized something that he was told. \"Sorry, uhm, I'm here for Dr. Murao, is he home?\" he asks me after pausing for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He isn't here,\" I tell him. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls out something from the inside of his leather jacket. It turns out to be a leather wallet. He flips it open and shows me a badge with an identification card along with it, while introducing himself, \"I'm Detective Dyson Bell. My partner is with Dr. Murao at his clinic. I'm here to check up on his alibis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you ask me if Dr. Murao was here?\" I ask, pointing out the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just making sure he wasn't in two places at once,\" the detective tells me. \"May I come inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you need a warrant for that?\" I ask him. \"And what alibis? Is the doctor in trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trouble, really, but I'd be more comfortable if I was out of this heat,\" the detective says while pushing against the door, widening it. I get out of the way, hoping Rango would be a good dog and attack this man. Instead, and to my surprise, he acts more friendly than aggressive towards the man. \"Hey Rango,\" he says as he pats the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm shocked at how friendly the dog is to the stranger. Is he even a stranger to him? It's like the dog is familiar and happily accepting of the man. He even sits calmly at his side. I close the door and lock and then turn my attention back to the man. \"You've been here before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Murao used to be my neighbor. As his friend, he asked of a favor. Since he's sort of on \"clinic\" arrest, I'm tasked with checking his house on any leads,\" he explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leads?\" I ask. \"What has he done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, really, but my partner is old-school and won't settle down without turning over every rock in this case. A criminal was found dead in an alley near the back door of his clinic. Turns out he came to the door and knocked on it. He was wounded in his abdomen, like he was stabbed several times. The blood that was on his hands belonged to him. The blood found on the door, also belonged to him,\" he tells me. I sort of get an uneasy knot in my stomach. \"Dr. Murao has been very honest with us. He said he took the man in, not knowing he was a criminal, and generously tended to him. The man turned out to be very resistant and didn't want anesthesia at all. The doctor couldn't even help him with his limited tools.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying Dr. Murao killed that man?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you mean kill as in not help him, then yes, but since the doctor wanted to help and the man refused, then whoever stabbed him, killed him,\" he explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if it looks like Dr. Murao didn't kill him, why are you here then?\" I ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You with all your questions, girl,\" he exclaims, calling me the female that I am. \"Dr. Murao asked me to personally come and watch the house. Considering the way the man was stabbed with the proximity of the doctor's clinic near the crime scene, we believe that the assailant will want to tie up loose ends.\"</span></div></div>",

But why is my face on the article.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI begin reading it, starting with the headline, \"GIRL, IN COMA SINCE 2012, WAKES UP. Gwen Murao, only daughter of Dr. Vincent Murao, was the victim of a horrible car accident while coming home from a party in summer of 2012. Gwen was driving her white Toyota Corolla, using a back road to avoid an accident on the highways, where instead of four lanes to navigate, she could only use one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cause for the accident would be Cesar Lopez, who was intoxicated twice the legal limit. While Gwen was driving down a slope on the back road, Cesar was driving up the slope, swerving in and out of his lane. He would eventually swerve at the last second over the double yellow line on head on with Gwen's vehicle. The two cars collided at 12:30am on that Saturday night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe accident was found by Detective Dyson Bell, who was off-duty at the time. Upon inspecting, he found Cesar was nowhere to be found, He called the paramedics after finding the state Gwen was found in. Gwen suffered several lacerations as she was partially ejected through the windshield, which shattered upon impact. Thankfully, she was wearing her seat belt. Her other injuries included a neck injury and a few broken ribs. Her friends, who designated Gwen as their driver and who had been drinking heavily that night, only sustained minor injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen had been taken to Trinity General Hospital where she was treated for her injuries. Unfortunately, due to the trauma, she stayed in a coma-like state. Upon request, Dr. Murao had request she be moved to her home in the hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn September 28, 2015...\" When I get to this part, I stop to find out what the exact date it is today. After finding a calendar in the computer, I find that this date is just two days from today, which is September 26. I continue reading the rest of the article. \"...Upon visiting the Murao residence, the person who had found the accident three years ago, Detective Dyson Bell, was surprised to find Gwen waking up from her comatose slumber.\" The rest of the article is blank which makes this one of the shortest articles I've ever read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this woman I'm personifying, her body, her look, is this Dr. Murao's daughter? And she's been in a coma for three years? And this Cesar Lopez. This is me. This Cesar is me. He has a small picture attached to the side of the article and it's my face with a bunch of facial hair on it. I was hoping this article would answer my questions, but all it does is give me more questions to ask. The most pressing question: Why did this doctor put me in this body when I, Cesar Lopez, was the one to put his daughter in a coma?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do I go about answering that major question?</span></div></div>",

If he's acting like this, then this Dr. Murao shouldn't be home. I get up out of the chair and go to the entrance of the room. The door is ajar and open enough for me to stick my head out. I hear nothing for a moment, but in the next moments, I hear something like a door unlocking. A beeping that sounds like it's from an alarm system is heard as a door is opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sneak out into the hallway and find a open room that has a banister surrounding a spiral staircase in the center of it. A skylight sits right above, flooding the room with natural light. I spy from the banister towards the foyer a guy with a leather jacket on. He doesn't look like Dr. Murao, since he's younger-looking and doesn't have the clothes of a doctor. He surely doesn't look like the father of Gwen... me. If it's not Dr. Murao, then he must be a squatter who managed to open the front door. I see Rango follow close behind and I gesture to him to stay where he is at the top of the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I can't call the police on the guy, knowing that mostly everyone knows that I'm in a coma (the article I read was not published yet), I'll have to deal with him myself. I sneak down the stairs and follow down the path where I saw the man go. I also note which parts of the house are where. As he would have taken a right from the foyer, the man had passed an office with a computer to his right, which is a sign that he isn't a thief, since he could have easily taken those items in the office and pawned them for money. Across the way from the office is a full-sized kitchen, which a squatter would take advantage due to the food stored here. Down the walkway between the office and kitchen is a hallway that goes to several rooms. The first of which, located on the left, is a laundry room. The next door, on the right is where the guy went. I know because it's the loudest out of all the rooms. The television is on and it seems he just went to the bathroom since the toilet flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI enter, seeing no sign of the man in the room. He placed his bags on the bed and his jacket on the chair and I also see something else on the table. A gun. I pick it up with the intent on scaring him out. I wait in the room until he is done washing his hands in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks out and for a second there, I startled by how tall he is. Comparing him to my height, he is clearly at least half a foot taller than me. He also has his shirt off, showing toned arms, chest and abdomen. In my fright, I lift the gun to aim it at him. \"Who are you and what are you doing here!\" I yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe puts his hands up and says, \"You startled me.\" He looks me up and down and also eyes the gun for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not afraid to use this!\" I shout at him, closing the distance as if I want to make sure I hit him with a bullet when in truth, I don't want to shoot him, just scare him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then visibly calms down. \"I would have shot the gun by now, but I know you can't even do that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me do it--!\" I shout, but with quick succession, he grabs the gun and even grabs my arms and pulls me toward him. I'm too slow to react and he single-handedly takes the gun out of my hands while turning me around while pinning my arms behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles as he points out the things I've done wrong. \"If you're going to scare a man, make sure you take the gun off of safety and make sure it's loaded and cocked too,\" he says while brandishing the flawed weapon in front of my face. \"Also, don't close the distance between yourself and an attacker, because he can easily grab you and put in a situation like this. Much more easier with a gun that's not loaded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you win, but you won't get away with this. I'll call the police when I get the chance,\" I threaten him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need,\" he says and puts what sounds like cuffs on my hands. I try to struggle but it's too late. He shoves me onto the bed and goes to his jacket. He pulls out a wallet and opens it, showing me a badge and an identification card. \"Because I AM the police.\" He puts the gun and his badge onto the table and turns to me. \"Since you aimed a firearm at an officer of the law, then it's not me that's in trouble, but you. So do you have anything to say for yourself, in your defense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit up and move so that I'm seated at the edge of the bed. \"Don't I have a right not to say anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckles. \"Dr. Murao said you had fire, but he didn't say you were smart too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm surprised. This man isn't Dr. Murao. He knows him though. Some of my questions are starting to be answered. I look around the room and see the pictures of him and Dr. Murao. There's even a photo of him and Rango, who silently infiltrates the room and takes a seat on the bed right beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you, Gwen?\" he asks me, and by name too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One second, my life is fading on the floor of the a clinic I stumbled into, the next I'm suddenly on my feet. I do not feel the wound and its stinging, throbbing pain. Rather, I feel nothing along the lines of pain and discomfort. All I feel is cold tiles underneath my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to look down at my feet to wonder why I'm have no shoes or at least some socks on, but before I see the floor, I see a surreal scene before me. It's like a dream that is soon to be a nightmare. Before me, lying on a table, is my body, wounded and from what I can tell, lifeless. The body's face belongs to me, though I may have let my facial hair grow out longer than usual. The clothes and the blood staining the parts around the wound still look wet and fresh. I lean in to investigate further, but a sound from the corridor stops me from doing so. I frantically search around the room for a place to hide, but I cannot find any place big enough for me. I see a door that is opposite the corridor, so I try to go and open it. I twist the doorknob and hear footsteps on the tiles behind me. Resistance prevents me from twisting the doorknob all the way, signaling to me that the door is locked. Soon, the footsteps get louder. I have no time. It's too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn around and a man with a lab coat reveals himself from behind a curtain, which also reveals that this place is not a clinic at all but more along the lines of a morgue. Steel doors small enough to only allow a drawer with a body through line the walls of the back of the room. My lifeless body on the table looks right at home here. The man walks over to the table and faces it, but for a moment glances towards me. He stares as he intends to look right through me, at the door behind me. For some reason, I just stand there, frozen in place. Even though I blanketed in the shadows, a part of me thinks that he still sees me. Miraculously, instead of calling me out, he turns back to the table like he didn't notice me at all. I take this chance and go over to the side to hide behind another curtain, opposite the one the man came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe speaks out loud, probably into a tape recorder, certain things about the body laying on the table. His voice is hoarse, as if he is sick with a sore throat. \"This is Dr. Monroe, examined a possible John Doe. Looks to be either an Asian or Hispanic male in his mid-20s. I neglected to lock the back door and he happened to stumble in. He was soaked both in water and blood. Tried to resuscitate him, but he could not wake from his unconsciousness. It seems he was too weak and succumbed to his wounds,\" he says into the recorder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does have a wallet, but all that is found is a couple of large bills. It looks he suffered from a gunshot to the abdomen, which from appearance of the exit wound, looks like he was fleeing as he was shot from behind. It seems that he was chased into the alleyways prior to him showing up at my backdoor. Well, who am I kidding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I can barely make out the sounds of more than one pair of footsteps approaching, but what dominates that is the sound of men. A shout, which sounds authoritative like that of a leader, is heard over all those sounds. The voice shouts, \"Check the alleys! He couldn't have gone far!\" There is no reason for me to be in this alley in the first place. Actually, I tend to avoid alleyways because they serve as hiding spots from the exposure and somewhat clearer visibility of the streets. I have no intention of hiding, but why am I here in this alley? Am I running from someone? Are these men looking for me? And for what reason?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adrenaline in my body causes me to continue forward, although slowly, deeper into the alleyway. I look behind me and spot a man suddenly appearing from the wall at the end of the alley. When he shouts, \"I found him! He's over here!\" my slow trod down the alley rapidly becomes a jog, which eventually turns into a desperate sprint. I run down the alley, coming to an intersection. I find that there is more than one person pursuing me and when I try to hang a right into a different alley, I find two men appear from the street. I double back to the intersection and try the alleyway that would have been directly across from my previous alley, the one with the puddle. I stop in my tracks when another man appears. With only one option left, I hand a left down the only other alleyway. To hinder my pursuers, I knock down whatever I can find, whether it be trash cans, empty wooden pallets or unused, rotting planks of wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI carefully navigate the alleyway while trying to distance myself from the men chasing me. I get to what seems to be a T-intersection, with an alleyway continuing forward and another branching to my right. After seeing the evidence of what looks like a street at the end of the alleyway right across from me, I turn to the right, only to run into.... who?</span></div></div>",

If I could pause that moment before the collision, I can see that she was indeed shorter than me, maybe about half a foot or a foot shorter. Despite her size compared to mine, the look on her face was that of a determined expression. It was as if she knew me and why the men were chasing me. In her hands was a gun, which immediately caused my instincts to fire. As I collided into her, it was in the form of a tackle. Using my weight, I managed to topple her backward, but with some amazing footwork, she was able to get me flat on my back and sending me into another puddle, though considerably smaller than the first. Nevertheless, both the front and back of my body were soaked with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still held the gun in her hand and before she could lift it to aim at my head, I wrestled it out of her hand. To my amazement, I am somehow able to get a hold of the gun while forcibly dismounting the woman from my body. Before she can recover, I'm already on my feet and dishonorably kicking the woman into some trash cans. That's when I see the men appear in the intersection of the alley. I find an opportunity to make a last stand, and with the gun in my hand, I grab onto the woman's collar and pull her upward. I force her to sit upright and I aim the muzzle of the gun to the back of her head. Surprisingly, I'm able to shout at my pursuers, saying, \"Don't move another inch! Or else I'll blow her brains out all over this alley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to do that!\" one of men says. His hand shakes as he holds his gun up and directed towards me. My mind registers it as an eagerness to kill me by pulling the trigger. Without warning, I open fire on the man, causing the men before me to duck for cover. I shoot off more rounds, sending the deafening sounds to echo up and down the alleyway. I kick the woman aside, telling myself she'll only slow me down. I start up down the alleyway and before I can get to the end of it, a stinging pain is felt in my leg. It sends me to the floor as I trip on it. When i look back, the woman has crawled over to her comrades and taken one of their guns and is aiming it at me. To prevent a killing shot, I shoot back, successfully impacting the arm holding the gun up. I stagger to the corner where I continue to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I get to a door that leads to stairs, I slump against the wall adjacent to it. I suddenly feel a different pain that prevents me from moving. i discover that it's not the leg that has been shot and is bleeding, but it's my head. It feel like my brain is being ripped apart, but by what? Before I know it, I black out from the headache. When I come to, where do I find myself?</span></div></div>",

With brunette strands falling in front of my face, I quickly realize that the previous incident had been the dream and this reality that I'm in right now is the nightmare. I immediately freeze as the strands of hair fall in front of my face. Slowly, I bring my hand up and gently grab several locks and slide it to one side where I finish by tucking them behind my right ear. I do the same with my other hand on the other side of my head, tucking the lock I grab over my left ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the hair out of the way, I can clearly see the scene before me. I'm no longer in the alley and it's no longer nighttime. It's cool in the room, a bit warm underneath the blanket I find myself under, but it contrasts the bitter cold of that alley. Plus, I'm not soaked to the bone in stagnant water. My eyes wander downward and indeed, my clothes as dry as they can be, but it's not the clothes I'm worried about. It's the body that is wearing those clothes. Two mounds, not too small, but not too big, protrude from my chest. I raise my right hand to cup one of them and my hand can fully encompasses the globe with my fingers touching all sides of the base of the flesh. I immediately let go of the breast when I notice gauze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapped with a bandage, the gauze is placed over an area of my upper arm, which, upon touching the center, causes the wound that's covered to sting. I gasp in pain with a higher-pitched voice. The pain although has a benefit and it helps me remember the interactions I had last. I try to recall last night and try to remember my perspective of me wielding a gun toward four people at the end of that alley. I somehow cannot and my mind only recollects a perspective that is low to the ground. I actually notice that I'm on my side with a gun in my hand, which struggles to aim at a man that I had just shot. This man is limping on a leg that has a bullet from the gun I'm holding. I see the man shoot his gun and not even a second later, my arm explodes with the bullet's impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm knocked out of my reverie by the trauma and I find myself hyperventilating. I slide out of bed, noticing the slender legs of this body as well as the black panty and the white tanktop it's wearing. I make my way to a door which I believe is the bathroom and before going inside, I calm myself down. Once my breathing is under control, I feel around the inside wall of the room and flip a switch. I push on the door, finding myself.... where?</span></div></div>",

Immediately to my right there is a small, partially-closed kitchen and beyond that is the living area, which is a dining room in the far right corner with a pair of couches and a television tucked in the left corner. There are people present, men in matching suits with no ties. Upon my entry, all of the men turn their heads. It's when the last one turns his head, something in my mind recalls and recognizes his face and out of nowhere, I bolt for the door. I manage to open it rather quickly and without thinking, in just a tanktop and a pair of panties, I run out into the hallway. There is no logical reason why I'm running away, as if there was a trigger that caused me to run as if I was being pursued. Pursued like last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI deduce where the elevator would be and run down the hallway towards it. I look behind me for a split second and see the very man I recognize come out of the door. This startles me for a brief moment and I accelerate to get to the elevator faster. Within five yards from the elevator, the chime chirps out letting me know that the lift has opened on this floor, but when I'm about to turn into the open lift, three men exit out of it: an older gentlemen flanked by two younger and taller men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of them, I reel back and eventually fall to the ground, landing on my bad arm. As I turn to go the other way, in my haste, I ignore the stinging pain shooting all through my right side, but it proves to be my downfall. In my panic, my body is way too far in shock and my legs give out, sending my half-naked body to the floor. I roll over to my side and slowly slip into unconsciousness. The last things I see is the older gentlemen's face hovering over my, but at a distance. The man who I recognized from the alley dominates my view as his face is more closer, considering him to be on his knees trying to wake me up. I black out shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up again in the very same bed I find myself in. This time, I don't wake up suddenly, but very subtly I open my eyes. I'm immediately aware of my surroundings, most especially of what I can hear. I hear a conversation and judging by how it's handled in whispers, the two men who are speaking are trying to keep their discussion from the wrong ears. Somehow, with the ears of this woman, I can hear them clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe wasn't supposed to be out there in the first place. If it weren't for her though, Cesar Lopez would be...\u201d For a moment I drown out their voice at the mention of my name. Cesar Lopez was my first and last name the last time I had it before I was slapped by Tyrone. Wait. I still remember that? How is it that I remember three different sets of memories? So, I was Cesar before the slap and I was Cesar after finding myself in that alley. But what's the reason why I was on the run from those men? And how did I end up in this woman's body. I drown out my thoughts  to continue listening. \u201cSo, what do we do with Eliza? You've seen her. Her encounters with Cesar have distracted her. Ever since he joined our task force, she has been slacking. What should we do with her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question stirs something inside of me. What is this feeling? It's as if I'm a dog who is on her last legs and the only option is to put her down. What should I do? Should I quickly get out of bed and into some decent clothing and sneak my way out of this ominous situation? Or should I stay and actually confront the men about what they are discussing about me? Or should I not worry about it and stay in bed?</span></div></div>",

My mind wanders into situations that involve them ridding me discreetly. Not liking where the conversation is going, I slip out of bed, finding myself in the same clothes as before: a black tanktop and a bra pair of panties. I tip-toe to the closet and find nothing but an unopened suitcase. I open it and find several pieces of clothing that I have to take out and unfold just to make sure what they are. Generally, they look like they can fit on this smaller body and since I'm the only woman in this suite, I deduce this is the only bag with garments made for a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a simple outfit: a khaki, mid-sleeve outerwear button-up that's more rough and durable than a dress shirt, a black V-neck T-shirt, and a black pair of capris that cut off a couple inches below the knee. Not worrying about how it looks and concerning myself only with my current nakedness, I quickly dress myself up. I finish with a black pair of ankle socks and slip on some peculiar shoes, which turn out to be the only pair of shoes that are in my size. The shoes are like canvas sneakers, colored entirely in black, though the canvas does not stop at the ankle. It actually rises from the heel and stops just under my knees. These can be considered more to be boots than sneakers. Or a tall shoe, perhaps, since the soles are like those of everyday canvas sneakers. I take my time with the shoes, since I do have to tighten up each crossing of the two laces so that they cinch up every part of the canvas to my calves. Before leaving the room, I look to see if there is any wallet that belongs to me. In my search, i discover a leather wallet sitting on the nightstand next to the bed. I take it with me, sliding in into my outerwear shirt pocket<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I'm done, I make my way to the very same door that lead out to the main living area. I pull the door, which is slightly ajar, revealing two men in suits standing not too far from the door frame. One leans on the kitchen counter while the other stands straight. When they see me come out of the room, they stand at attention. Judging from their expressions, they look surprised. \"Eliza! You're awake!\" the shorter man, they one who was leaning on the counter exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you be in bed? You're still recovering from that gunshot wound,\" the taller man warns me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feel fine,\" I say, trying to hide the fact that I'm trying to sneak out. \"I just wanted to get some air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo smaller of the two looks towards the group of men seated on the couch. Fortunately, the man who somehow triggered my sudden half-naked run into the hallway isn't here, but the older gentlemen is present, and he is the one who gives a positive-looking signal to the man who silently asks for approval. The smaller man turns and tells me, \"If you're going to go out, you'll need your phone and guns on you, just in case. Did you get your holsters?\" I shake my head, which causes the taller man to shake his head before entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe comes back with a standard pair of holsters that already have loaded pistols in each holster. \"Remember to wear these underneath your shirt. You don't want to cause a panic in the city at this time of day,\" the taller man explains to me. \"Report your location every hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" I say and round the two men and make my way to the door. I open it, this time calm and relaxed. I have no one pursuing me and I have no reason to think that way. I exit out the suite and close the door behind me. I make my way down the hallway to the elevator. I look behind me, just in case, but after staring down the hallway for a good ten seconds, all I find is an empty hallway devoid of any men trying to run after me. I turn back to the elevator and press the call button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI arrive in the lobby shortly after and I make my way out to the street. The streets have all types of vehicles passing by and pedestrians mind their own business as they walk back and forth on the sidewalks and crosswalks. Where should I go and what should I do there?</span></div></div>",

At first glance, she looks out of place. Her brown hair is done, she has a dress that tells me that she was out partying in these twilight hours, and she has heels that scream out a borderline \"porn star.\" But it's the heavy makeup on her face and the evidence that she was hit across the cheek tells me otherwise.

I use her as a turnstile and I might have grabbed her arm as well, which is adorned with a heavy silver bangle. I make it to the other side, but at the cost of her falling to the ground hard. The gentleman in me wants to help her up, but it's when the men chasing me show up from around the T-intersection in the alley that makes me think otherwise. I run down the alley way, successfully maneuvering my way around successive trash cans and refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI run for what seems like hours, never looking back at my pursuers. I don't have a destination and it seems like I have no place to go that would save me from the men chasing me. Why are they chasing me in the first place? And why do I feel sleepy? I black out without feeling myself fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill these black outs and states of unconsciousness ever end? Where do I end up after this?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I wake up upright in an room devoid of any decorations. The only fixture on the blank walls is a large mirror and immediately I see something has changed. The reflection I see in the mirror is that of the same woman that I used as a turnstile in that alley. Her face, her outfit, her whole image in the mirror is as vivid as she was in that alley. \"Oh fuck,\" I say and the woman's mouth moves the same way as if she is copying me. But when my eyes move down, the things I see validate that the reflection is real. The first thing I see are two mound of flesh protruding from my chest, which is no longer broad but slender. The breasts are medium-sized, about the size that is close to my preference. They fill up the dress that I'm wearing, but from my perspective, the dress is tight enough that it create a cleavage that I can look down upon, as if it's a bottomless pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite of the look of this new body I find myself in, I feel some manipulations to it. The dominant feeling I sense is that my hands are connected to each other and my arms right behind this very uncomfortable chair. It's so uncomfortable that I'm squirming in my seat. What also makes it uneasy to sit in it is that my feet, which are inserted in high heels, are also bound to the legs of the chair. Any type of attempt to escape the chair either causes pain or more discomfort. How did I get I in this body? And why am I handcuffed to this chair?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I hear a door unlocking and the doorknob twisting. The creak of hinges signals the opening of a door, but from what I can see, it's not in my field of vision. Judging from the sound, I can sense that the door is right behind me. The hinges creak more and in the shadow I see behind me in the reflection, there is a door and it opens widely to reveal a tall person. This person walks in and exposes himself in the dim lighting. He's Caucasian as far as I can see. He wears a black and white suit with a solid black tie. He has a stoic expression on his face that is almost intimidating. His eyes are already directing at my own as he rounds my position and takes a half-seat on the table. In his hands is a dark brown folder which looks to be filled with all sorts of forms and documents. He slams it on the table and sternly looks at me. I flinch when the folder hits the top of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like prolonging this?\" the man asks me. He doesn't let me answer. \"First with this Cesar Lopez and now with this girl you're now in.\"  The man says the name that is my actual name. Whoever I was before this, I was this Cesar that he is talking about. \"Didn't we tell you that this power you have is too volatile to let loose? You've displaced two people from their own bodies and as a result, those two have already died due to our misunderstanding that it wasn't you in that body. But, it was your mistake for choosing to displace a prostitute. It didn't take long to find you.\" The man takes himself off the table and rounds the chair once more. Through the mirror, I see him bend over and whisper into my ear. \"Good luck trying to get away from this mess you find yourself in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stands up and then goes to the door. He opens it and into the room walks in a man whom I do not recognize. He is a white man who is shirtless, exposing thick muscles on his arms and a muscular and toned chest. On his upper body he also has tattoos of various kinds adorning his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet Lucas. We've bailed him out for one purpose and that is to punish you. Unless you want to commit to us your services for the two deaths you allowed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's the sound of what sounds like a heavy metal door closing on its solid metal frame that wakes me up. I suddenly feel a soreness in my right cheek, but second later, I start to feel it spread throughout my body. I have to gasp in order to relieve myself of some of my stress. Funny it seems, that my voice is still mellow like a man, which causes me to double-check. From what I can feel, the manhood in my pants and the absence of fleshy globes on my chest tells me that I didn't change. \u201cI didn't change?\u201d I ask out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan a man who's about to be released get any sleep?\u201d the voice of a Hispanic man asks. Judging from where it's coming from, I deduce that it's right above me. I open my eyes and find myself is an almost dark room. To my immediate left is a wall of solid concrete, painted with off-white paint to smooth out the cracks and holes. Below me is a mattress, but remembering the bed I had before I was slapped, I figure this one is on the old side. It doesn't even feel like a proper cushion. It's as if all the soft stuff has been taken out and it's just its slightly-rough outer shell. It doesn't even prevent me from feeling the simple wires of the bed frame. Above me, or in other words, right in front of me as I lay down on this horrible mattress, is the underside of a bed frame. Bunk bed? I ask myself. To my right, I see the sight of three more walls, one of which has a metal grate as a door. The bars could only mean one this. This is no room. It's a cage. The glove had not changed me. It sent me into a cell. A prison cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all places, why a prison? I frantically ask in my mind. I immediately get out of bed and stand up, the bare soles of my feet feeling the cold on the rougher concrete floor. I back up against the wall opposite the two beds and see a person shuffling in the top bunk. His orange pants is the same color as my jumpsuit, reinforcing the fact that this is a real prison. I go over to the gate and look around. All I can see is more metal bar gates and more concrete walls. \u201cSomebody! Get me out of here!\u201d I shout out into the hallway. With no other object absorbing the sound of my shouting, the hard wall echo it into every cell, causing an uproar with the other inmates. Immediate after shouting, I can hear distant shouts telling me to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I'm suddenly grabbed by the shoulders and pulled off the metal bars. My grip falters and I'm sent to the floor hard. A silhouette of a muscular Hispanic man stands, blocking out the light coming from the hallway. \u201cWhite boys don't know when to shut up. Can't you shut up so I can get a few more hours of sleep?\u201d the man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what's going on in there?\u201d a deep voice comes from outside the cell. The Hispanic man moves out of the light to look behind him and there at the opening of our cell is a guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing here, sir. <i>Puto</i> can't wait to get out of here,\u201d the Hispanic man responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, turns out you two are being released early, regards from the warden,\u201d the guard says. \u201cCuffs go back on. Prison policy still stands.\u201d The guard presents a set of cuffs with a chain connecting both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine by me,\u201d the Hispanic man says and then directs his words to me. \u201cHappy now, <i>puto</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou first, Garcia,\u201d the guard says. My cell mate goes to the door faces his back to the bars. \u201cHands, Garcia.\u201d He bends forward to insert his wrists into a larger rectangle in the middle of the door. At once, the guard places the cuffs on the Hispanic man's wrists and secures them. He pulls taut the chain connecting them together and stands back from the door. A buzzer sounds, causing the door to slide open automatically. The chain is let go, but two guards decked-out in riot gear enter the cell and push Garcia into the wall, pinning him there as they proceed to secure cuffs on his ankles. Both sets of cuffs are then connected to each other. The two guards escort the Hispanic man out of the cell and two more guards dressed in similar clothing take their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey roll me over and I don't resist them. If they are really releasing me, then I don't find any reason to rebel against my captors. There is only two questions in my mind: Why am I being released? And why is my cell mate being released along with me?</span></div></div>",

As we pass the guard who isn't dressed in riot gear, I ask him a question. \u201cWhy am I being released?\u201d I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stops the men from moving, so they just hold me in place. The guard then tells me, \u201cIt's the government, kid. They passed some law a few days ago. Turns out the prison system cannot afford to put a roof above your heads and feed you three square meals a day, so they're doing something about the inmates. It's a good thing, actually, since I think you'll be working for your shelter and for your dinner from now on.\u201d A pat on the lead guard's shoulder causes him to start walking and since I'm connected to him, I'm forced to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm led down the hallway passing cell after cell containing inmates who look as if they are being released as well. None of them are violent. In a weird way, I consider them to even be docile, like they are livestock waiting to be wrangled into another pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy destination is to the ground floor. The guard lead me to what seems to be the entrance and when the doors open, warm air rushes inside, causing me to squint my eyes. Outside, I see Garcia again, who, without protesting, allows a woman to place a cloak over his head. A van is driven up to where the woman, the guards and the now-blinded Garcia stands. The back doors open and Garcia is led inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards escorting me lead me to the very same woman. Immediately, she prepares a cloak for my head. Before she can don the cloak over my head, I speak and ask her, \u201cThe guard said it's because the government that they're releasing us. That the prison can't afford to house us anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a new law they passed. The Apathy Clause,\u201d she says and rather happily as well. \u201cYou'll be informed more about it later on, but I really do need to put this on your head.\u201d I offer my head by bowing it forward. The velvet fabric stretches to accommodate my hair, but once it's past my ears, it's not as dreadful as I thought it would be. Yes, it blinds me and prevents me from seeing where I'm going, but other than that, it's rather comfortable and doesn't constrict anything. I'm pulled by strong hands and guided into the back of the van, right against another inmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGarcia?\u201d I ask once I'm settled into my seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice beside me responds, \u201cWhat is it, puto white boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you think they're taking us?\u201d I ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey're not going to kill us since they cannot afford to bury billions of deadbeats. Consider yourself lucky you're in this van, puto,\u201d Garcia says. \u201cWherever they take us, it'll be better than being six feet under and I can assure you that it'll be better than that cell we shared for the last five years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast five years?\u201d I ask, but mostly to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou killed a federal judge, puto. In cold blood, too. You were looking at life. You don't remember this?\u201d Garcia asks after telling me what put me behind bars in the first place. I cannot come up with a reason why or how I would do such a thing. To Garcia's question, I don't answer, which is probably the best right answer I can think of. \u201cWherever they're taking us, remember you still have your sentence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is our final destination?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>More and more inmates are put into the van until it is filled with bodies, twelve including Garcia and I. The doors close and the engine is turned over. The van is promptly driven down the driveway and judging from the sounds outside and underneath the car, the van is being navigated to the highway. The vehicle picks up speed and maintains it for what seems like hours. Two hours in fact. Being cuffed and hooded like this with eleven other inmates, most of which I probably haven't interacted with, the last thought on my mind would be to fall asleep and lean my head on someone's shoulder. I fight the need to sleep, even though I did wake up from a slumber minutes before being cuffed and escorted to the van. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore my eyelids close with heaviness, the van abruptly bounces up, which could mean that it might have driven over a pot hole or transferred from the road to a less stable surface. Hearing sounds of rocks hitting undercarriage, I can assume it's the latter. Where would the van be going if it's traveling on gravel roads now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the gravel becomes leveled again, but it's not as smooth as the highway, which caused me to almost doze off. The van tilts to its left and then to the right, which I deduce that it's making wide turns. Where could it do that? It certainly couldn't making such a wide turn in a city, so we're probably far from one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the van comes to a stop. I stay quiet and listen closely to any noise outside. A shuffling sound of thin metal can be heard outside and I assume it's a door opening. After the sound stops, the van continues forward until coming to a final stop before it's turned off. The men in the front seats get out and walk over to the back doors, which  they open. When the doors are open, warm, humid air enters into the rear cavity. It's a nice breeze that contrasts with the cold interior of the van, but the humidity soon becomes a burden as I deduce where this climate can be located. I would say that driving two hour had taken us away from the major cities to somewhere in the desert. Beyond the sounds of shuffling, as the guards taken each and every inmate out of the vans, I can hear engines. Jet engines to be exact. Are we at an airport? In the desert?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot stay to figure out as I'm pulled out the van with Garcia right behind me. A strong arm grabs mine and pulls me to a spot where I'm pushed onto my knees. An instinct of mine sort of kicks in and it's the action to stay put and not make any sudden moves. The catalyst for this action is the barrel of a gun potentially being aimed at me and my vital organs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, the hood over my head is taken off. I'm finally being given the chance to see my surroundings, but the environment around me does not give me much hope. I find myself in a hanger which is totally devoid of planes. Taking up the space is a bunch of wires interconnected with several computers and unusually, chairs. The chairs themselves spell out execution, but I have a feeling, being released just to be silenced is not what these people are going for. I see the woman I saw before leaving the prison at the front along with other women and of course, two pairs of armed guards. I look behind me and see more armed guard closing the hanger doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inmates,\" the older of the women in front addresses the gathering of prisoners. \"If you don't know by now, you are all here because of this new law that the government has passed. It's the Apathy Clause. In this law, prisons are being shut down due to the fact that the country of the United States cannot afford to pay for your shelter, your beds, and your three square meals a day. But there is a question that comes up: Where are we going to put you people? As you can see before you, we have set up equipment that will change you. Change you how? We will take your mind and consciousness and store it in a database for six months. In the six months you may think is just one big, yet short dream, but while you dream, we will make new forms for you to inhabit. In these new forms, you will no longer be a prisoner, but be one of many individuals that will help today's society. Well, that's only if you go for this route. There is another route that actually changes your current body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother woman, someone younger than the first, steps up and gives us the order of business. \"We will go to each of you and ask if you'd like to take the digital route or the analogue route. In either route, we will take off your shackles and proceed to either store your consciousness in the digital route or take you to another facility if taking the analogue route,\" she explains. Without any delay, the questions begin. I'm in the third row out of eight. Garcia is the on the leftmost side of the group and judging from the first row, it looks like he'll go first when the second row has been catalogued. I still don't know what this Apathy Clause is or what it will do to me. Generally, every inmate seems to knows what will happen to them, except me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the people finally get to me, which route should I take?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the second row is finished, I observed everyone in each row take the digital route. Each person was taken to a chair and a helmet or headband of sort was placed on their heads. They also were put to sleep with nitrous oxide before anything could happen. From where I was kneeling, nothing really happened. Every inmate in a chair went to sleep and stayed asleep. I wonder if their minds really did transfer to a digital database. They would probably wake up instantly after six months have passed by while those taking the other route would be awake for those six months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey get to the third row and obviously start with Garcia. I look over and tell them something that I can't quite pick up with my own ears. I wonder if he's taking the digital route. They would lead them towards the back like all the others. On the other hand, I wonder if he'll be the first to take the analogue route, whatever that means. He's probably saying that as a Hispanic man or as a gang member or whatever he is, letting people transfer his soul into a machine is against whatever he believes. He probably also say if he's going to feel anything, he will feel everything they dish out on him. His cuffs are unlocked and the chains leaves his limbs. He's helped up to his feet and rather than take him towards the chairs, he's escorted by a woman and an armed guard to the last row. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI set my eyes straight again after seeing that. Garcia is the first out of the three rows to take the analogue route. I wonder what I should take when they get to me. Should I take the majority vote and pick the digital route, transferring essentially my soul into a hard drive while gods know what they do to my body in the six months it sits without a soul? Or should I take the analogue route, where I believe they will change my body in some way? How they will change it is beyond any guess I can make. Probably they will make me a super soldier to be used in the military. At least that's better than rotting in a concrete cell with a ex-gang member as your bunk mate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally get to me. Even when they ask, \"So, Mr. Lopez. What route will you choose?\" I look straight on, never looking up to meet the eyes of either the guard who's taking my shackles off or the woman asking the question. I take a deep breath before answering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Analogue,\" I simply say and let the woman do the talking. I picked analogue because I somehow value my body. Even after knowing that I was slapped by my roommate whose intention was to turn me into a woman failed and sent me here, I find that discovering I still have my body is fortunate for me. If I'm to be changed, I want everything to be changed. Everything including mind, body and soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman takes the liberty to double-check if this is the route that I want to take. \"Analogue, huh?\" she asks. \"Are you sure? Unlike the digital route, this way is more painful, though with time, you can get used to it quicker than the digital route. Are you sure you want to go this way?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout delay, like a soldier who has been asked a question by a superior, I state, \"I'm sure. I choose analogue.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman doesn't question me any more and, sensing she is looking at the guard to her right, I'm brought up to my feet and escorted away from the chair and towards the back. I see Garcia and another man standing near the opening of the hanger. I drop my head, not wanting to look at Garcia, but against my wishes, the guard has me stand next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you following me, puto?\" Garcia asks. \"You have no score to settle with me, for this I'm sure.\" He pauses to watch another inmate from the third row select the analogue route and be escorted by an armed guard to our position near the hanger's door. \"You think that if he get close to me that I will protect you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I say to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't, if that's what you're asking. Hope you can do the same,\" Garcia says and stays quiet after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all the inmates in the room have chosen, with about ten choosing the analogue route including me and Garcia, the women come over and brief us on our choices. \"So, quite a few chose the analogue route. Just to let you gentlemen know, choosing this route gives us the ability to change your bodies directly. It will be painful, since for the first two months you will be constantly under the knife in surgeries or in a chemical tank that will alter your cell at the microscopic level. But it will still be your body. You do not suffer any detachment from your nerves. The finished product will be you, with some changes of course. You will be given two weeks after procedures to recuperate and recover and then the rest of the weeks and months, you will be in training for whatever you'll doing. Just so you know, where you will be after six month will be determined by your efforts. Under the Apathy Clause, where you will serve society is where the government wants you, though we can tip the scales a bit before that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't leave time for questions and with a single nod to one guard, the other guards open the hanger and escort each of us outside. Parked outside are private jets and as we disperse, I can tell that two inmates go to each jet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich inmate goes with me to our assigned jet?</span></div></div>",

A guard from behind pokes my back with the barrel of his gun, causing me to walk forward. \u201cDon't be alarmed, young man,\u201d the man with the tranquilizer gun reassures me. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk forward more until I can find a seat that faces toward the tail end of the plane. I find it fortunate I have an instinct to keep any potential danger within my line of sight, as I'm doing now. Once I'm seated, two guards quickly pick up a limp and slumbering Garcia from the floor and sit him down on a seat on the opposite side of the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bearded man puts his gun away and takes a seat right across from me. He has a face, as if he's observing my face and critiquing it. His squinted eyes and an occasional grin is what I assume to be a favorable opinion of me. After the guards take a seat in the rear most seats, I speak up, \u201cExcuse me, Sir. Can I ask why you shot that man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe didn't have a nice face,\u201d he bluntly says. \u201cYou on the other hand have a face that's gentle on the eyes.\u201d I don't have any words or any thoughts that could reply to that remark. Or is it a compliment? \u201cIt's a shame you and millions of men have to go through this, but fortunately for you, I'm able to ease it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d I ask. \u201cWill you be pardoning my sentence or at least, shortening it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man burst out in laughter, telling me that the notion of pardoning a man who had killed a judge (but having no recollection of it) or shortening the sentence is so far-fetched, it's hilarious that it was even mention. \u201cYou make me laugh, boy,\u201d the man says, but it's the last of his amusement. His face then takes on a serious, straight-to-business expression. \u201cBut no, your sentence is not going away, but we can do away with the 'to-life' part. It seems in this society, not even a million dollars can take off a murder charge. But it can sure make a difference.\u201d He pauses, which gives me time to let the word he had said sink in and it also gives me a chance to look this man over. He's old, but not elderly. The wrinkles in his hands and the white in his hair and beard is not signs of age. It's experience. The rings on his hands ties in with it too. With experience, this man has achieved riches. I can sense this man can does whatever hell he want to unleash, if he's the devil. If he's benevolent, who knows what this man can do for someone in my position. \u201cIf you are willing, you won't serve a fate that is unexpected. You will live a life that has been set out for you to fulfill with no hidden surprises. Are you familiar with the Apathy Clause?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's why I'm here, right?\u201d I ask in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect. Under the Clause, you as a prisoner will be subjected to a changing, a transforming of your physical body. Do you know what specific change that is?\u201d he asks me in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a guess, \u201cChanging our bodies so that we will be too weak to rebel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're warm, but not quite there,\u201d the man says, with a bit of amusement in his voice. \u201cYes, you're bodies will be changed, but your strength level will be different. Do you want to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question-and-answer part is a game to this man. He's toying with a man half his age. \u201cWhen you put it that way, I don't think I want to know,\u201d I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny sort of enjoyment on his face quickly disappears and goes straight back to a business-only look. He puts his face near mine, but my attention draws to the side and in the shadow of the tail section of the plane. The two guards seated at the back shift and prepare to stand, but it's the man's hand raising that settles them down. \u201cBelieve me, if I was in your position, I would want to know everything, no matter how unsettling they may be to my ears,\u201d he says, aloud, but close to a whisper. He suddenly grabs my wrists, which I forget are cuffed. \u201cYour strength will by different, lower than it is now. You won't be able to overpower a man, mainly because you won't be one.\u201d He pauses to let the words sink in. I raise my gaze up from my wrists to his face. \u201cYes. It will be a surprise for everyone who doesn't become the wiser, but as for you and hopefully Garcia over her, it won't be. And since you've chosen the analogue route and have found yourself on my plane, I will let you know how you will be changed. Do you want to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing there is no other options, I ask, \u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughs once more. I understand how this may be funny to him, but I'm not laughing at all. Discovering that they will turn me into a woman is a surprise, but it would be a shocker to be ignorant of the fact and find out once it's all done. \u201cI like your understanding of things, young man,\u201d the man says. \u201cIt's good to be prepared, is it not? As for how, the analogue route changes your own personal, physical body. This can be done several ways. For Garcia here, it will be gradual. A couple special injections and a long bath in a chemical tank. For you, you will be subject to a lot more, but it has the benefit of a speedy process and speedy recovery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it going to be painful like they say it is?\u201d I ask out of the blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiles without laughing for once. \u201cAs a matter of fact it is, but consider it this way. Pain is just another way your body tells me you are alive. I believe the more pain you feel, you know how much life is appreciated. Also, pain is your body's way of letting you know that you are healing. Yes, it will be almost unbearable, but I can assure you, you won't have to be bedridden for months as in the case of Garcia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo a woman, huh?\u201d I ask, more like a rhetorical question. The man doesn't add anything and allows me to be pause and gather my thoughts. \u201cWhat's your part in this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will be your benefactor. I have spoken to the warden and bribed him with a million dollar. Unfortunately, the most I could take off your sentence is five years,\u201d the man explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's twenty years left on my sentence. Since there will be no more prisons, how do I serve my sentence, as a woman, since I'm under the Apathy Clause?\u201d I continue to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow's being my secretary sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike an office secretary?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like the stereotype,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIf you don't know, a secretary manages all the behind-the-scenes activity of their respective bosses. They manage correspondence with clients and business partners, screen incoming communications and inform their boss of any and all updates, both positive and negative. It's a demanding job. I'm willing to shorten your sentence if you do well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I'm just going to be your secretary, nothing else, correct?\u201d I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asks, but quickly understands my implication. \u201cOh, no. I have no need of a partner or wife or mistress. Though you will live on my estate, the relationship between us is of boss and employee. Nothing more, nothing less. Plus, I already have a wife.\u201d I was expecting an answer such as his from someone as experienced as he. He raises his head, somehow noticing my visible relief that I won't be his significant other. \u201cSo what will it be? You do know that if you do not take my offer, you will join the fate of the other men on the those other planes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know before, but after he has told me, I'm glad I know. The choices he's given me is clear, but somehow, I'm concerned for the unconscious man sitting beside me. \u201cWhat will happen to Garcia?\u201d I ask the older man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not concern yourself with the likes of men like him. Gangs have been a blight on society. Where he will be, he won't have to benefit of friends that have his back. Where he will be, he will not have a choice like the one's I've given you,\u201d he explains, but doesn't quite explain fully what his plans for Garcia are. He pauses to look at some behind me. Before I can look back to see who it is, he speaks up. \u201cSeems we are ready to leave, but still, I'd like to know what your choice will be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I choose? Should I choose a generic fate like the rest of the men on the other planes? Or should I take up the man's offer of being his female secretary?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"If I choose to become your secretary, you said that you will be my benefactor? What does that mean?\" I ask the bearded man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane's engines whine as they spool up, gradually building in rotational speed. The plane's stairs are also retracted and the door closed as well. A woman from the nose end of the plane comes behind and me and without warning, she rolls up one of my sleeve, exposing my forearm and elbow. She vigorously checks for a vein. The man calms me down by placing a hand on one of my knees. He explains to me the meaning of the benefactor term he used, successfully distracting and taking my attention away from the woman. \"As a man with wealthy, I've pleaded to turn one of the prisoners, you in this case, into what the Apathy Clause states is a \"Charge,\" or a person under my responsibility. Like a child for example. As Benefactor, I will pay for your identity, your shelter, your meals along with a certain degree of freedom. Yes, you will still be serving your sentence, but fortunately it will be in a more gentler setting. You get to experience both sides of the Clause, if you'll be my secretary of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I don't have a choice. I'll do it,\" I say, but once I say it, the needle that the woman is now holding, find a suitable place in my arm to insert her needle, which is filled with a pinkish liquid. I can only groan out in discomfort. Before I could protest, the liquid is injected into my bloodstream. \"What they hell? Why do I feel so cold, yet hot in places?\" I ask, somewhat feeling myself drift into a drunken state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman speaks up, \"As per the analogue route, we've injected your first dose of nanites, tiny robots that alter your body at the cellular level. They use your body heat as power and will gradually change your cells from male to female as they use some cells as fuel for the change.\u201d The woman reclines my chair while a guard comes and unlocks my cuffs and removes them from my wrists and ankles. \u201cIt will be a short flight, but the best you can do is relax. Per your Benefactor's request, there is an accelerating formula, so you will change must faster than the others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot speak, for my whole body is wracked with soreness and stinging pain, more so across my upper chest and between my legs. It's so much to bear that I can hardly keep my eyes open. They close eventually, but before I fully relax, I see the woman and the guard do the same to Garcia as they have done to me. The tranquilizer dart, in a double dose, is enough to keep this Hispanic tattooed man asleep as the formula is injected into his body. My eyelids feel as heavy as my body. I have no control over them as they close shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy slumber is far from pleasant. Despite the majority of what I see is black darkness, image flash before my eyes as if I was really awake. One such image I see people hovering over me, as if I'm in a bed and they are working on me. I cannot feel their hands or the tool that they use. I also cannot hear what they are saying behind their face masks. All I can do is watch before the darkness overwhelms my vision again. The next image is that of the inside of what looks like an ambulance. There are two technicians next to me as well. The vehicle stops and the technicians pull me out on the rolling gurney that I'm on. I can see blue sky above me, but that's all I see before the darkness overcomes once more. The next and last image is that of a room. I can see the largeness of it, which could be explained by how I'm positioned. I'm propped up at an angle, which could mean that my bed was one that can fold itself so that one's position on the bed was more like sitting rather than laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother wave of black washes over my eyes, but not without any of the numbness of a dream-state. It feels like I'm waking up, all I need to do is open my eyes. When I do, the numbness is gone and I can feel everything. And everything... feels different.<br>\r\nI don't feel this sort of phantom body sensation, like I'm putting on a bodysuit or my mind is transferred from one body to a different one. Maybe I cannot explain it because I haven't been in that experience before. Many of the other prisoners would, but not me, who took the analogue route. Whatever shape my body is in, is my body. It is originally mine, but it's been altered, modified, changed, but to what extent?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my eyes and see the same room. When talking about its size, it's much larger than that cell I was originally in. I bet you can fit about eight of those prison cells in this one room. The ceiling is high, adding to the illusion that this room is much larger than it seems. There are two large windows to the left of the room, providing what looks like morning sunlight which more or less bathes the whole room in light and warmth. The walls of the room are adorned with art, which general is of a modern genre. None of the art hanging on the walls are sculptures or paintings and some of them look to be the kind that can be replicated at no cost. The bed sits at the end of this rectangular room, while a door to what I believe is the exit, sits in the far corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit up and I can see on the far opposite wall is a mounted TV that is so large that it can be around a thousand dollars. To the left of the room, in between the two windows is a long desk. A desktop computer as well as a laptop sits on the desk and two office chairs are pushed into the cavity underneath the desk. To the right of the room is a small, yet comfortable seating area. A pair of couches and a pair of armchairs dominate the seating area while being flanked by side tables. There is another door right beside the bed, which I believe could be the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm immediately realizing that I'm no longer clothed in a jumpsuit, since the jumpsuit was made for a man and it couldn't clothe the new body even if I tried. I swing my legs to the side, all while covering my naked body. I have to cover my chest as well, for I can clearly feel a bit of weight there. Once my legs are hanging over the side, I find that my feet cannot reach the floor. If I was still a man, I could very well have touch the floor with my toes. This tells me that the body I have now is petite compared to my old body. I'm reminded of the pinkish liquid that was injected into me. Who know what else they put into my body to make me into this new person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push off the side of the bed and stand straight, though taking a light sheet with me to cover my nude body. Before I go out to explore the room, I notice an envelope sitting on the nightstand. I sit back down on the bed, snugly wrapped in a white sheet. I pick up the envelope, which I discover has a bit of weight to it, and break the seal to open it. Inside I find a handwritten letter, an SD card, a business card and a identification card. The ID card catches my eye and I observe it first before the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out my new name is Rosario Lopez. I both surprised and confused on how they could get my face to open my eyes and smile so they could take a picture. The picture is the best mugshot I've ever seen. I'm not Hispanic like Garcia, but more Asian, as it says on the ID card. With help of the calender on the wall, which has past days marked with a red \u201cX,\u201d I deduce that the apparent age of my body to be 22 years old, 3 years younger than what my original male body was. And the ID card was issued in California, so I wasn't taken to a place outside of my home state. There is a QR code as well as a micro ship embedded in the card on the bottom left hand corner, where my signature should have been. I wonder if this is to let anyone who sees my card that I'm someone charge, now that I'm in this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI move on to the letter, putting the ID card back into the envelope with the rest of the items. The letter reads: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cDear Rosario, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope you had a good rest and recovery from your procedure. Inside this envelope are some items that you will need. The SD card is all the information regarding your change, including benefits of being a Charge, details of your procedure, and some tutorials on behavior and etiquette. I've included my business card if you have questions about your position as my secretary. Once you wake up, be sure to take a bath and dress appropriately. The next couple of days is free time for you, so use your time to get acquainted with the grounds and the other staff. I will be away during this time, so call me if you run into any secretarial problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerily,<br>\r\nYour Boss,<br>\r\nMr. Neil Ericsson\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one page handwritten letter ends on a rather good note and I turn the page over to see if there is any more text to read. Not quite the introduction as a new woman, but at least I'm not freaking out about it. I feel sure about myself, even though my physical body is radically different. So today, my only task is to get acquainted with the staff as well as the grounds. Fact is, I don't know how big these grounds are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do first? Should I head into the bathroom to take a bath and get prepared as tasked by the letter? Or should I take a peek first out the window to see how big of a property I'm dealing with? Or should I insert the SD card in the computer to check out the information found on it?</span></div></div>",

Plus, as this man, Mr. Ericsson's secretary, he probably wouldn't want me to be unprepared on any day of work. Before walking into the bathroom, I take the light sheet that I've used to cover my body that's below my collar bone and take it with me to check on the door that looks to be the only exit out of the room. I make sure the tiny knob below the ornate handle is twisted lock and even make sure the main knob itself doesn't budge more than half an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door is locked and assuring me of my privacy, since I'm naked underneath this sheet, I pace back to the bed to disrobe myself. I toss the sheet onto the bed and haul my naked body into the bathroom, closing the door behind me. Once in the bathroom, the light automatically turns on, illuminating various things. The first thing I notice is me and my naked body being reflected in the mirror. The guy part of my mind, which surprisingly is still intact considering the unknown amount of hours my physical body has changed, finds me attractive and almost in a sense, my body is out of my guy's mind's league. Long, flowing brown hair drapes either side of my face and much more down the back, ending a few inches from my waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes dart from my hair and face down to my breasts, which are not too small, though not too big either. I use my hand to cup it and I feel a new sensation, though more so with my hand. My breasts only feel sensitivity with my nipples, but when it's cupped like how I'm doing it, the sensation is similar to a hand holding another part of flesh. Not quite the same as it feels in the pornography I've seen. It's the larger difference when I feel the breast with my hand. The flesh is soft closer to the peak, though firm near the base. It's actually when I squeeze harder do I feel anything different. I look up at my face and see an aroused expression on my face. For a second there, I have to snap out of my pleasure and get on with my business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do not fail to notice the apparent absence between my legs, but I move on to the other parts of the bathroom before my curious hands start to drift downwards. Where the vanity and large mirror and main lights of the bathroom are immediately to my right, immediately to my left is a single door that when opened, reveals a walk-in closet. The closet is already filled with stuff, but the majority of them are boxes. Opposite the entrance of the bathroom is a bathtub with jacuzzi jets as well as a shower right next to that. Hidden in the corner opposite the shower is a modern-looking toilet, which may be a bidet, considering the amount of buttons that flank either side of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do next?</span></div></div>",

I am seated on a soft, yet firm cushion, which seems to mold to my very body. Yes, my body. I feel somewhat lighter, though not weak. I open my eyes, though my eyelids seem to be weight down my anvils. Initially I see a pair of arms, my arms, adorned with what looks like silk or lace, maybe both. It feels light on the skin of my arms, almost like it isn't even there. The sleeves, which go all the way to my wrists, are connected to what I'm wearing on my torso. It's a dress, ending in a graceful skirt that in my seated position, currently lies flat. My eyes move to my legs, which are bare with my feet sporting high heels made of what I think is acrylic. Did I just get slapped into the role of Cinderella?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI somehow gain more control over my eyelids and I'm able to open them up, though not fully. I raise my head and find that I'm in a limo, sitting on the backseat. There are people with me, a man dressed in  a formal suit with no tie, sitting next to me and opposite us is an old man with Asian features. Next to him is another man dress in a suit, also with no tie, who looks a bit younger than the first. I can't see where the limousine is heading as I need more light entering my eyes to clearly see out the tinted windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stir, trying to muster enough strength to open my eyes wide, gaining the attention of the man next to me. \u201cMiss!\u201d he exclaim in such a way that also sounds like a whisper and he hands me a handkerchief. I only stare at it, not knowing whether to take it or not. Ultimately, he brings the cloth to my face, putting pressure on my nostril, which seems cold and wet. Did I catch a cold? I place my hand to my face, prompting the man to let go of the handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you are okay, young lady?\u201d the old man in front of me spoke up, his voice raspy with age. \u201cThat's your third nosebleed today. Any more and we'll have to do a transfusion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lie, \u201cI'm okay,\u201d but karma immediately rears it terrible head and smacks me with another splitting headache.

The first scene is a bag being removed from my head. I somehow know that I'm still a man in that dark room with a man that at the time, didn't reveal who he was. In seconds, I remember that I did not fulfill some requirement that could allow me to pay off a debt of a family member who had recently passed away. A hidden law was brought to my knowledge that said that a man who couldn't pay off a debt with his immediate income was to be subject to a transformation. This man who simply looked at me like I was a piece of meat was my owner, my master, and I was to become his charge. His specifications for the transformation changed me into the woman I am in the backseat of that limo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I recovered from the procedure, the man immediately subjected me to a week of brutal sexual torture, where I was force to pleasure many men with my naked body and where I was forced to receive pleasure from them in their own sadistic ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first months were grueling and as an ultimatum, my owner kindly told me if I was to please him and his many clients, I would have to learn to endure the pain and pleasure or else, worst things would come to pass. I took the advice to heart, obeying every command, in fear that a severe punishment would be delivered if I disobeyed. Over the next three years, I learned to focus not on the pain, but the inevitable pleasure I would receive. I did not complain towards my master or his clients, even when one or more of my senses, more commonly my sight, was blocked. I didn't resist any move towards me and I availed every orifice for the pleasure of any man who approached me. Soon, my owner would comment that I was a good girl and in every moment, I strived to gain the same compliment from my master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not until I served a certain client, the very old man who sat in front of me in the limousine. He advised me to simply address him as Kato and the only service he demanded from me was my company. Sometimes I would be gone for a week with him as he toured the countryside with his men, some of which were his own sons. In our time together, he adored me not for my body, but for the apparent wisdom I had even though I was subjected to cruel and sometimes unusual sexual acts. My last week with him was actually the happiest I've ever been in my three years as a sex slave. This was because Mr. Kato chose to purchase my remaining debt so that I would now serve under him. The law was sound and at this very moment, he, with his two sons, are bringing me back to his mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of my memory, I find myself... where?</span></div></div>",

What did you need to fix? You penis size?\" Jose says with a bit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver lifts his shirt and reveals a foot long scar along the left side of his abdomen. If memory serves me correctly, he had a abdominal surgery a year ago that left this scar. There wasn't much the doctors could do for him other than offer him a skin graft. For a full year, he had resorted to just wearing a shirt when swimming. He was so ashamed even to expose or reveal it. \"Take this scar away, Joe,\" Ollie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, but I need to slap your face for that to work,\" Jose tells him. Oliver drops his shirt and closes his eyes to get ready for the slap. \"I slap that scar off your body!\" Not even a second later, the gloved hand makes contact with Oliver's face and the momentum send him sideways a bit. Jose approaches the man and lifts his shirt up and finds... nothing. \"Ollie. Check this. Believe me or not, but this fucking glove works, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie takes his shirt and lifts it and sees for himself that there is nothing but healthy skin where his scar used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering from the sliding door that leads to the backyard pool is our friend Danny. He comes in due to all the noise Ollie and Jose are making. \"What the hell is going on in here?\" he says, drying himself with a towel, even though his black board shorts are dripping on the hardwood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJose speaks up. \"Dude, I got this glove and what it does is that is can change anything about you. One just needs to slap someone to do it,\" Jose explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're joking, right J?\" Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He took my scar away, D. This is better than going to the doctors. No need for surgery or skin grafts. He just slapped me and my scar is not here anymore,\" Oliver says, showing him the evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit,\" Danny says, his expression evident with signs of belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, D-boy, you need something changed? You get second pick since this pussy over here doesn't believe me... not yet that is,\" Jose proposes to Danny. \"Think about it. Anything you want taken away? Or perhaps you want something added? Some intelligence to replace that dumb brain of yours? Just playing, but still, it could work. I just need to slap you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny takes a brief pause, even pacing and making more of the hardwood floor wet with his dripping shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will it be, D?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he choose to change about himself?</span></div></div>",

I think,\" Jose says. With the target in sight, Jose lifts his hand and with a swift, rising motion, Jose brings the gloved hand up and hits Danny broadly in the cheek. The force sends him flying back, almost bringing him to the floor, but Danny braces his fall with ripped arms. Not only that, his whole body is ripped and most of the more important muscles are more definite than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny pushes himself up and showcases his new body to us. \"Shit, Jay, I didn't think you could do it at first, but damn, you've made me a believer.

What my eyes see is only pitch black, but seconds later, what blurs my vision is dissipates. I'm on my back, though my whole body seems different. Did Jose give me a scrawny body, when compared to Danny new body, mine is like a toothpick, all bony with no muscle or little of it? Somehow, I feel smaller, but to what degree I'm not sure. Luckily, I still have strength in my body and it seems neither Danny or Oliver is holding me down. When I sit up, I find out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push myself up to a sitting position. Immediately, I see three young women before me. The first one, who I notice has a glove on her right hand is latina. She has a shocked expression on her face, as if she had killed a person and guilt has already crept onto her body. Her eyes are transfixed to the glove in her hand, which she removes to reveal a female hand. Nothing out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second female to my right, is wearing black short shorts, which seem to be dripping wet. What is odd about her is that she has no bra on and she has resorted to covering her exposed breast with her arms. She too has the same shocked expression about her, as if she sees a dead body of a loved one on the floor before her. Luckily, there isn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third female, to my left is much different than the last two. She is fidgety and is running her hands all over her body. She even picks at her yellow short shorts and even lifts her shirt to trace a line on the left side of her abdomen. The scene before me is not out of the ordinary, but where is Jose, Danny and Oliver?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's when I start to look at myself that I find out what's going on. I look down and see (and feel eventually) two, what I would call large, orange-sized protrusion stick up from my chest and lifting my shirt, which also has become much smaller. My jeans are tight and fits the form of shapely legs. To top it all off, strands of stray locks that are of the same brown color as my original hair fall from the top of my head. My slim and gentle hands instinctively tucks them behind my ears to get them out of my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI again look before me and see similarities. That latina must be Jose, since he had the glove in his hand. The glove itself did not change, but everything else changed. The woman to my right, the one holding her breasts in her arms, must be Danny. It's evident in her body that her muscles are toned just enough for it to be attractive to a certain eye. The last woman on my left would be Ollie, who is known to be more fidgety and isn't as calm as the first two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jose?\" I speak, but when I do, my voice has indeed changed. I have to clear it a few times just to be sure, but instead of a deep manly voice coming out, it's a higher-pitched feminine voice coming out. \"Danny? Ollie?\" I continue to speak, addressing the women before me who could be my roommates' counterparts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cesar?\" the latina asks. \"I wanted... to change you... into what you were... a pussy.... so I-I-I... I gave you one, but why did.... why did everyone one of us changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you dared to change reality, girl,\" a man voice is heard to my left. Out from a corridor, a man in a grey suit appears. He stops in front of the front door and continues to speak. \"It had came to our attention when a certain item was stolen from what should be a secured facility. Any changes that you have taken was noted for... preventative purposes. Which follows: a man whose sense was taken from him, caused the driver of the bus that hit and killed him to be fired and subsequently arrested for vehicular manslaughter; a Oliver Swenson, nicknamed Ollie, whose surgical scar was removed from his body, cost the life of the surgeon who operated on him a year ago. For some odd reason, he chose to killed himself by jumping off the hospital helipad. He probably found out that his life as a doctor had come to an end, for the object he removed from Oliver's body was now inside him; for a Daniel White, whose body was made more toned with muscle definition, a certain part of his memory skills have been removed. Lastly, for a Cesar Navarro, since you were made into a woman, altering your reality the most, your roommates have turned into women as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But who are you?\" female Jose says. \"What do you have to do with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just a messenger, telling you that all the actions that have been done this day borders on a crime that doesn't exist yet. I don't think it's supposed to exist. Your sentence is to continue living, since you have free will, but you will be subject to punishment that borders cruel and unusual, since this is crime that you are not used to.

We struggle, but it's no use since they are much stronger than us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemale Ollie squirms the most, but is subdued with a punch to her gut. The wind gets knocked out of her, but she is still awake, albeit rather sore in her belly. Jose tries to escape by going for the bedrooms, but is tackled and pinned to a wall. When she submits, they take her by the arms and bring her to the center of the room. Danny stays put due to her breast having no garment to keep them still. The men easily grab her, but they put her arms apart, letting the breasts fall from her arms. As for me, I allow the men to take my arms and get me to my feet with no resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are presented before the man in grey and he leaves his spot near the front door to greet us more closely. He starts at Ollie, who's on the far right side. She still tries to squirm and fight her way free, but it's no use. \"Now you must realize how weak you've become,\" the man says to her. He makes his way to Danny, who instead of fighting, tries her hardest to keep her body, especially her chest from the man. He undoubtedly reaches for her chest, cupping each breast with his hand. \"Soon you should realize what it feels to be weaker than your original self.\" He moves on to Jose, who is calm in body but is nevertheless spouting expletives in her native tongue under her breath. The man grabs her by the jaw and gets in close to say, \"I'd like to let you know that the man who killed that man with no sense will get out much more sooner from his time in prison than you are to get out of this mess you brought you and your colleagues in. You can fight as much as you want, but it will soon dawn on you that it will be no use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man walks over to me. He doesn't get close for very long, only to take a lock of hair in front of my face and tuck it behind one of my ears. \"We know that you were forced into this mess, but it's unfortunate that you have to partake in its consequence,\" he tells me. \"Boys, do what you want with them, but for this one,\" he points to me, \"be extra gentle. For the others, do what you want, just let them be pretty in the morning...\" With that he leaves out the front door and leaves us with the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the two men holding Oliver brings them over to who I think is a higher-ranked person seated on the couch. She is fidgety as always, even after getting punched in the stomach. She is punched once again, which brings her to her knees. While one man holds her, the other is busy ripping her clothes off. In no time, she is stark naked before three men. Just what do they have in store for her first?</span></div></div>",

She had begun crying after her second blow to her belly, but knowing that she was naked and accessible to these men, her cries for help had grown more voluminous. The higher-ranked soldier couldn't take it anymore and with the back of his hand, he delivers a sharp slap to Ollie's face and in the confusion, brings her head close to his erect member and plants her mouth on it. Her loud cries turned into muffles with that large thing in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whimper is heard and I see the men holding Danny bringing her over to the sliding door. They pin her to the glass and take her arms and raise them over her head pinning her wrists to the glass as well. A third man approaches and from what I can see, one of the men, the one who pins her wrists to the door, plants his lips on her mouth and even inserts his tongue in as well. Her whimper grows, but is muffled with the man kissing her. The other man is busy playing with her breasts, which look natural and especially bouyant and soft. I see her leg rise and I can only deduce that the third man has squatted down to remove her short shorts and is now nuzzle his face against her crotch. With the leg rising, Her whimpers grow quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, after the men with Danny are settled, the men with Jose bring her over to the dining table. While one man rounds the table to the other side, the other pushes her towards it. Luckily there isn't a chair with a high back to impale her belly like Oliver. With the guy behind her, all she can do is recoil from hittin the table. What they have going for her is as the man on the other side pulling her arm, nonevasively pinning her to the table, the man behnd her could do anything. She could kick, but instead she continues to spout expletives in her native language. The man behind her take the top of her jeans and easily pulls them down. This is when her cursing becomes screams as the man behind her deliver several slaps to her cheeks. He pulls in and whispers into her ear, loud enough so even I can hear. \"I'm gonna start with your ass, bitch, so you better relax or I'm going to hurt you,\" he says. He lifts his head and shows it to the guys as well as me and points out the wad of saliva on his face. He wipes it on his sleeve before warning her, \"You asked for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can witness the sodomy that about to unfold, the men holding me take me to the nearby bedroom by the kitchen. Another pair of men enters the room after us. As the man in grey told them, they are gentle with how they handle me, but with them closing and locking the door behind them, I assume I cannot pass the time by sitting in the room with these four men.

Eventually, I'm pulled away from him by a black man, who's taller and from what I assume by his body language, that he is higher in the ranks. \"It's great that you're being assertive with us, but you do realize that my subordinates here won't reciprocate your actions until the highest-ranked officer has done so,\" he tells me. \"Boys, stand at attention near the window.\" He walks me over to the bed and sits me down on it. Instinctively, I stare at the man who I just mauled with my lips and do not dare look up into the eyes of the man before me. \"Mr. Smith has ordered us to be gentle with you and we will do just that to the best of our abilities, Miss,\" he addresses me, taking his hand and lifting my chin to look up at him, \"but I cannot guarantee that you won't feel pain. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill looking up at him, I answer respectfully, \"Yes Sir.\" An ounce of me feels as if I've wronged him by choosing the rookie as my target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl,\" he says with a smirk. \"Now, if you will, please undress and neatly fold your clothes and give them to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steps aside and allows me to take off my clothes. For one second I look up and see the three men facing the bed and their backs to the window, standing at attention like Terracotta soldiers. I must be blushing, since I feel embarrassed that they are watching me, but I cannot delay, or else, the commander my get impatient with me. I swiftly try to take off my clothes and to help with the awkwardness, I bow my head so that I'm not looking at the other men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI first take off my shirt, which is tighter and not loose like the shirt I was wearing before the change. I lift it up and at once feel my breast fall from the garment, since the change did not give me a bra like Danny, who was topless before his change. After my shirt is off, I get up and neatly fold the shirt as best as I can and set it aside. Next, I go for the top of my pants, which is neither baggy or loose. They are actually, skinny jeans which fits the form of my shapely legs. I pull them down, with my back and ass facing all four of the men. Their expressions are probably changing as I pull them to my ankles. I step out of them, and like my shirt, I fold it and press it neatly, stacking it on top of the shirt I set aside. Lastly, I pull down my panties, white just like my briefs, but without all the stitching that would support a penis that's not there. I fold the panties in half and place it on top of the stack of clothes. I pick them up and hand them over to the commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. Now that you're nude, we can start...\" he tells me. How does he begin?</span></div></div>",

I get onto the bed and lay the bed, instinctively getting a pillow to support my shoulders and head, if needed. I position myself so that my knees meet the edge of the bed and my calves and feet hang over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sense the man get behind me and feel his hand fold my legs in. His hands drifts towards my bottom, which he boldly squeezes. At his touch, I try not to make a sound, so instead, I bite my lip. It feels good to have a larger hand grope me in that fashion. His other hand finds its way to my other ass cheek and with both he gropes as well as pulls them apart as if they are two dinner rolls that have baked in the same pan. I start to breathe deeply in and out, constantly biting my lip to keep myself from uttering a sound, which seems to be this man's goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can feel the coolness of his breath exiting his mouth and drifting over my sensitive skin. The cool breeze become terribly warmer, which I assume is his face nearing my nether regions. Something moist, yet muscly, unlike a wet tissue paper, make contact with the bundle of nerves on the lips of my pussy. Not expecting this newfound pleasure so soon, I can't help myself when I moan through my throat. My noise only seems to increase the fervor at which this man is eating me out. It pokes at the opening to my pussy and also moves up to graze the door to my ass. Eventually, once my folds have naturally moistened themselves up, the commander moves on to sucking the juice that I'm slowly producing. The suctioning action of his mouth vibrates the nerve bundles and also allows them to compress, which is another odd yet pleasurable feeling. His tongue joins in once more, fervently poking more deeper at the same time he sucks on me. He stick a finger or two up my pussy at irregular internvals and by now, I'm moaning more and more and breathing more heavily. I whimper and clutch at the pillow as well as my breasts. I somehow think I can alleviate the pleasure, but all it does is add to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start to think that he can somehow get me to the climax that my body seems to long for, but all of a sudden he discontinues his actions. What does he do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I keep still, never changing my position. I don't even look back to see what he is going to do for fear that I will meet the eyes of the men watching behind him. I seem to get the thrill of not knowing what's coming next. I anticipate it, even predict what he might do next, but boy, am I way off. I assume he would want to bring his subordinates in or pounce on me slowly, but instead, he gives me signs that he is indeed getting ready for something. I hear the sounds of fabric rubbing against fabric, heavy fabric falling to the floor and boots being removed. I deduce that the black commander behind me has undressed himself, but what he does next is not what I was thinking he would do... and the essence of it somehow excites me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel his weight climb onto the bed, straining the box springs of the mattress. He hover over, close enough to graze my skin with his own, but not too close as to drag himself across me. I assume he is on his hands and knees, his body and its mass hovering right above it. I could assume he is looking, adoring my body with his eyes as he traces along my spine with a finger. The very same finger makes its way to my shoulder and traces every so slightly over my spine once more before ending at the opposite shoulder. He adds more fingers and moves his hand underneath me to cup one of my breast, which seems to fit perfectly in his large hand. He squeezes it and gets a reaction. I groan loudly. He positions a hard member near my crotch and uses his hand to fine tune the direction it would go. The hard and warm head pokes at the opening to my pussy, threatening to enter in unannounced at the slightest movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the initial push, he inserts his arm, as if bracing myself with his support, underneath my chest. He makes it so that my breasts rest on it like birds on a branch. I cross my arms directly in front of this muscular arm, relaxing in the position. My breast feel like they are resting on a plank made out of a dark branch and two smaller, tan branches. Slowly, the black commander puts his weight upon me, starting with his chest. Being stuck between a comfortable soft bed and a warm man generates heat and is bound to cause me to sweat prematurely. He somehow does a wave form of move where his whole body presses its weight down on me like he is a rolling pin flattening out cookie dough. The finishing move is his dick slowly entering my vagina. By now I'm already wet, which makes the entrance into my love cavern not as hinder as I initial thought. He easily slides in his whole length, which stops as it hits the end of the cavern. I wonder if he has anything left outside that has failed to enter into my cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling is intoxicating. Never have I felt something so warm, so hard, yet soft at the same time, enter me so fluidly, though at the same time widen something that at first was as tight as a clenched fist. I can only inhale and moan and exhale as hissing as I feel it enter and rest within me. The girth of the penis is so wide it borders between a satisfying discomfort and pleasurable pain. I cannot begin to fathom how great it feels to be filled. It's not the same as being filled with food. Having a canal that is sensitive to every bump and vein of the commander's penis is great and the longing I have for the climax has been reawaken after a brief nap. Not to mention how much my body is in contact with this beast on top of me. The weight that pins me to the mattress is a joy I suddenly have. I could stay in this position forever if I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I realize that my purpose here is to be penetrated and pounded with this tool in my pussy. To be impaled and to become immobile would have to wait for another time. I realize that ultimately, it's not me who is to be satisfied, it's these four men. The black man embracing me does not wait for my signal and without warning me, he pulls out just enough for the crown of his head to barely exit my cavern, letting my vaginal muscles tighten on emptiness for just one brief moment, before he suddenly fills that emptiness with his member once more. This time his second thrust is fast and swift and with the mass of his body behind it, the tip of his deck smashes through what I would imagine at that time an invisible wall that is weak and that is connected to so many nerves. The force at which his member pierces through that wall is so much that I can't help but scream at hte top of my lungs, even though his weight, muffles a bit of it. With his free hand, he silences me by covering my mouth, letting me scream as much as I can into his palm until the short-lived pain subsides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pats my head and parts my hair over to one shoulder. He whispers into my ear, \"Don't worry, baby. This had to happen. I hope you try to remember who took your virginity, so quickly after changing.\" He plants a kiss on my shoulder. \"The pain will go away after a time, but you do realize that this is supposed to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear escapes my eye as the pain, which stings more than throbs, subsides. With my mouth still covered by his hand, I nod my head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl,\" the black man says and says no more. He continues his task and slowly pulls out once more, only to push in with a good amount of force necessary to widen my canal again, but this time with considerably less speed. Slowly, but surely, the pain coursing through my body is removes and I'm again put back into the mood. I relax and let the dick sliding in and out of my pussy send me up a slope toward the climax at the peak. In no time, I start to moan in pleasure again, increasing the volume as the black man increases the speed gradually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then abruptly stop, only to reposition me onto my back. When I open my eyes, I see...?</span></div></div>",

A fraction of the last waves of pleasure course through me as the commander repositions me onto my back. I open my eyes once I'm idle to find the commander right where he last was, but with a towel in his hands. I figure it must have been a few seconds when I had my eyes closed, though I don't recall the commander unlocking the door to go out of the room. He must have retrieved the towel from the room. As soon as I see him, he lowers himself and begins wiping my pussy. The rough, absorbent towel is further shaped with the commander finger and it is used to trace around my pussy, wiping whatever residue may be around it. Before discard it, he makes sure to wipe inside the exterior folds of my pussy, One inch of that fabric touches a sensitive part and my body jolts. It leaves me taking a deep breath followed by several shallower breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you're a bit sensitive down here,\u201d the commander tells me. \u201cAs long as you're clean, then you're fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rises and discards the towel. He bends over, supporting himself with his arms and looks me in the eye. Somehow, I feel myself blush when he looks at me like a man sees a naked woman. I observe him, most especially his eyes, which move from my face to the rest of my body. Unconsciously, one of my hands cups one of my breasts, squeezing it enough for me to feel it. My mouth opens to let out a sensual gasp. I watch the commander as he watches me and I see that he like it when he sees me touch myself. I see his eyes drift further and my other hand follows his gaze. A finger lands below a breast, traces a line to my belly button and then past my waistline to a very sensitive bundle of fleshy folds. Just the touch of my doing is enough for me to close my eyes and brace for a short wave of weak pleasure. I touch further, which erupts a moan from my throat. I then feel something else. It's warm, like my folds, but this warm object is not my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander hovers his dick near my pussy and when I touch more of it, my hand leaves my body and reaches further to grab ahold of the commander's tool. I briefly steal a glance at the commander's face, but it seems he was waiting for me to look up. He says to me, \u201cDon't be shy, girl. You can be assertive with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do?</span></div></div>",

I glance over to the front door for a second and find the man in grey nowhere to be found. \u201cGuys,\u201d I start, \u201cwhere did that man go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren't you going to answer the phone first?\u201d Ollie adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is the female Jose that stashes the glove in his back pocket and walks over to the kitchen, when he arrives just in time to answer the phone. I get up and walk over, stopping in the doorway to listen in. \u201cHello?\u201d Jose answers, but judging by her expression right after, she is surprised by the voice on the other end. I gesture her to put it on speaker and we hear who exactly it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Josie-baby. It's Raul. We just got done shopping for all the things we need for you and your friends' party later on. We're on our way back to the house, but I also wanted to tell you that somehow, all the parents found out and have invited themselves over. Seems we have to plan for our sexy night for some other day,\u201d he says. Both Danny and Oliver are also in the doorway listening to the conversation. \u201cHoney, you still there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Jose simply says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I just wanted to call and tell you that we'll still be an hour or two away. We had to go to another city to get some stuff. So, you might want to get ready. If you don't remember, all of you girls' outfits are in the pink boxes in my room, alright? Love you, babe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, bye,\u201d Jose says, but not without a silent expression of awkwardness. She hangs up and takes a deep breath. It's not because she's a new woman in an unfamiliar body or that it's awkward talking to a man who addresses her with endearing words like 'Baby' or 'Honey,' but it's due to the fact that Raul was our rivals both in high school and throughout our college days. Jose especially feels it because to my knowledge, Raul and Jose had many clashes and fights. To be put into a reality where Jose is now a woman, but also the girlfriend of this guy, puts up red flags in many places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask, stepping from the doorway. Though it seems awkward to me, and possibly for her, I embrace her which causes her to do the same. She heaves in big breaths of air in and out and by her vibrations, I feel she is on the verge of tears. She disengages our hug and I find that she indeed has shed a tear, but is in no way sobbing or balling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems too much to take in,\u201d she says. \u201cI somehow feel guilty for turning you into a woman in the first place. If I didn't, then Ollie, Danny or I wouldn't be in this situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's alright. At least, this way, we get to support each other, like the old times, but in well... different bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, let me get this straight. He said there are coming to this house. So this isn't my house anymore?,\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not. He clearly said he had outfits in his room,\u201d I mention and turn to look behind me. I assume I would find both Danny and Oliver right behind me in the doorway, but I find it empty. I go out back into the dining room and don't see any sign of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill looking for that man in grey?\u201d Jose says behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn my head around and shake it. \u201cNo, I'm looking for Ollie and Danny. They were right here just a second ago,\u201d I tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe them two are the excited ones and went to Raul room to get dressed,\u201d Jose reminds me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, thanks for reminding me,\u201d I say with a smile of gratitude. \u201cShall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJose gives me a nod and we walk over to where we hear noises, in a room that is the farthest away from the front door, in the corner of the house. We find both Danny and Oliver just look at the boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, guys, check this out,\u201d Oliver says. He points out the small envelopes attached to the ribbons tied around each box. The first letter we see is addressed to 'Josephina.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think this is yours J,\u201d I say and hand the box over to Jose. He receives it and puts it down in order to rip the letter off the box. \u201cWhat's it say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing much, just says, 'Congratulations, Love Raul,\u201d she tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOlivia, I think this is for me. And, Danielle, Danny this is for you,\u201d Oliver mentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's the name on the last one?\u201d I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver immediately checks. \u201cRosario. Wow, C, your name changed a lot,\u201d Oliver points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Rosario is the equivalent to Cesar. You know, like Cesario,\u201d Dani mentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJose chuckles as he is about to open his box. \u201cNot only did our bodies and clothes changes, and also I'm the girlfriend of our rival, but our names and even our whole reality is changed,\u201d Jose explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think this was the punishment that man in grey was talking about,\u201d I tell them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn't be that hard,\u201d Oliver starts. \u201cApart from walking in heels, wearing dresses, putting on makeup, I think we can handle this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways the cheery, optimistic one Ollie,\u201d Danny inputs. \u201cLet's just open the boxes and see what Raul got us.

A rather long dress that's in a gradiant brown, which gets darker as it rises. I look around and find that the others have similar dresses. Also in the box is a smaller box that has a pair of sandals called, 'Gladiators,' similar to the ones used by Roman warriors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is very conservative,\u201d Oliver, or Olivia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConservative yes, but very casual too.

Only shows a decent amount of skin, isn't tight around anywhere, exception is around my bust, and looks great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, both Josephina and I undress and put on our maxi dresses. We also put on the sandals that we get in the box as well. Other items such as jewelry and earrings are attached as needed. Once we are dressed, we all take a look at each other. In my opinion, it probably would be safe to say that none of the women in the room looks like they were men minutes earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosephina has on a gradient dress to in a shade of black which lightens up to gray as it rises.

I think we're missing something,\u201d she says, but pauses to think of what is actually missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJosephina mildly says, \u201cMakeup.\u201d She takes a gulp before continuing. \u201cI'm not too excited for this part, but I know the guys must be expecting us to doll up right. I'd say we just try to do our best and see what we come up with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree,\u201d I say and take Josephina by the hand and take her into the closest bathroom, taking what could be a bag of makeup from our respective boxes with us. Minutes later, once in the bathroom, we see both Dani and Olivia go over to the other bathroom, possibly to do the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both agree to put on makeup that looks natural, so as not to put too much on and not get too stressed on whether we look good or not. Otherwise, the other two girls, put on makeup that is simple, but loud in color saturation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we are done, we choose to relax in the shade of the shadows of the trees that cast themselves over the pool. Minding the length of our dresses, we lid down on the lawn chairs that sit on the raised platform towards the rear of the backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI resort to just using whatever time we have left to stare into the blue sky. I ponder if this would be a punishment or not, but at the present moment, consider it to be a calm before an impending storm. An hour goes by before we hear a loud ruckus outside, beyond the fences. Before long, those same noises make it to our driveway and all four of us girls are alerted to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosephina, who has sat up and placed her legs to one side of her lawn chair, has a expression of nervousness on her face. To calm her down, I place a reassuring hand on her knee. We hear the voices of excited men coming closer to the gate that leads into the backyard. It opens and in comes...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as his words roll of his tongue, our attention is diverted outside, where something massive lands in the pool. It's so massive that waves as tall as us as women emanate from it and displaces the water onto the deck. It's so big that it even shakes the house like a tremor would after an earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!?\" I ask as I turn my head to the right to watch the waves i the pool die down, evidently showing that the level of the water to be about two feet lower than it normally would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me,\" says one of the girls, but I don't know which since I'm not familiar with any of their new voices. Well except for Jose's new female voice, which speaks with the same accent as he used when he was a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was like a meteor, bro,\" Jose says as he... she approaches the glass door that leads into the backyard. I approach right beside her. From what I can tell, we are more or less the same height as women as we were men. This time, we all have long hair and higher-pitched voices. \"You gonna check it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no,\" I tell Jose and turn around to check on the other two girls. \"Hey, where did that guy go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls turn around to check the front door and corridors. They helplessly clutch an arm across their chests to prevent their nipples from being exposed. \"I don't know, Ces. We heard and saw what happened to the pool. Maybe he snuck out when we were focused on the pool?\" the girl who I think is Oliver says with a deeper female voice. That means the other topless woman is Danny, since he had just came out of the pool with his yellow trunks. That explains her wet yellow shorts on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what is she doing?\" the girl who I think is Danny as a woman says, almost apathetically, when she points at the door. Judging from the breeze that comes in, I deduce that the door to the backyard has been open and when I turn my head, I discover that Jose is no longer behind it, but out it. Something manifests in the pit of my stomach as I see Jose's female form approach the pool. I make my way to her, but before I can get through the door way, something fast shoots out of the pool on towards Jose. When I get over to her, her hands clutch helplessly on her neck, where an alien-looking, metallic tentacle has wrapped itself around. I try to use my strength to pry it off of her body, but I find at the last minute that I probably do not have the same strength I had when I was a man. I weaker. I find it difficult to accept that fact as I continue to try to get my roommate out of the machine's clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut the corner of my eye, I see both Danny and Oliver's female body, though topless, appear out of the house. I try to warn them, but they too, like Jose, get their own metallic tentacles wrapped around their necks. I try to escape, knowing that it's the only thing I can do at this point, but before I can even reach the side door to the driveway, I trip over a tentacle that's placed before my feet. And before I can even get up to my feet, I'm swept into the water and a set of four tentacles, one for each of my extremities, reach out to me and stretch my arms and legs out. It doesn't pull, but by their individual strength alone, they keep me from swimming to the surface for air. I can only hold my breath for so long and when my resistance falters, the only thing I can breathe in is the pool water. My lungs fill up with air and slowly, I drown, only able to look at the rippling surface of the water with no hope of reaching it in time to live. The light in my eyes fade into darkness. I can't even pray to whatever god is available before my life subsides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I don't die. Where do I find myself after all this?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I should have died. It would have been a blessing compared to the hell I'm going to go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock of dying hits me when I suddenly wake up, breathing clean air into my nostrils. To have thought that you have died is one thing, waking up from apparent death is another. And judging from the heavy pit in my stomach, which I deduce has something to do with how bad something will be in the near future, I would very much like to pick the former over the latter. The air I breathe in is clean and cool, but it's too clean. A different word would describe it better: sterile. The air I breathe is too clean, that I don't think it even has particulates like dust, pollen, or mold floating in it. It's just... air and that's what bother me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my eyes and discover something that is also described as sterile. It's the room around me. All I can see is white, save for the ground at my feet, which is a matte, metallic gray. The ceiling and the walls are so white, that it almost feels like I'm in a large expanse of it, meaning that I'm not enclosed in a four-sided room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the sterile surroundings and the air that is inhaled and exhaled through my nostrils, what bothers me most is my current position. One, I'm stark naked. The clothes that I had on before are gone and what is left is nothing but a pair of cuffs, colored in the same white as the room around me, on my wrists and ankles. I also notice something around my neck as well, probably a collar to match my cuffs. I try to move, but I find that I cannot. Not even an inch. All I move is is my head, to some degree, as well as my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough I'm literally choking in my collar, I scream out, \"Hello!\" to find that my voice echoes throughout the room, telling me this white is not a room at all, but an endless expanse of white. What walls may be in the distance, I cannot see, for I find no type of horizon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cesar?\" a struggling voice calls out my name from my right. I can turn my head only slightly, but it's no use. Wherever that voice came from it was near, probably from my blind spot. \"Cesar? This is Jose.\" The voice sounds fatigued and with a noticeable accent from someone from a Hispanic region. It's no doubt it's Jose and he is still a she. Is she naked like I am?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jose? Are you alright?\" I ask her. \"You sound tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay. I've been trying to get out of these cuffs, but it's no use. It's been hours since I woke up though. I thought you were a goner after that thing kept you underwater,\" she tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I was dead, too,\" I respond. \"How about Danny or Ollie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're awake, but it seems that they cannot speak, like they're gagged,\" Jose tells me. \"I ask them something, but all I get is muffled sounds. You don't know what it's like to wake up to complete silence, bro. It's like we're in the middle of nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think this place is?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. After that thing drowned you, it jumped out of the pool with the four of us in is tentacle-things. I passed out before I could figure out where it was taking us,\" Jose tells me with a bit of both excitement and nervousness. \"Do you thing they're aliens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we can find out the answer, the whole space of white is filled with a loud noise that I cannot describe. It's akin to a low-type of feedback, when a mic picks up the output of a speaker and continues to feed it with the white noise. The sound drowns out our screaming voices and gives me a slight headache. After five seconds, it stops, but it leaves ringing in my ears that last for at least a minute or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I notice something is different in the room. What has changed or appeared?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I notice something different that contrasts with both the white and then the metallic gray floor. As if it was a computer program, something materializes in the white expanse close to the edge of the floor. It's like it's walking towards me and then the little bits that appear form feet. It fully materializes into a naked man, which stops about two meters in front of me. His body type is muscular, like a body builder, but his frame is more like a fighter or wrestler than just a plain old body builder. I thinking he uses those muscles for something other than showing off. I notice he too has cuffs on his wrists and ankles, as well as a collar around his neck. Was he in a postion like me? I doubt he was for very long, since it's his facial expressions that frighten me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks confused for a second after his little bits have finished forming, but as he see me in my exposed posture, he has a devious face, as if he has found something he likes and he has no desire to refuse it. He looks as if he will even kill for it. His whole body resonates that aura. Due to my position, I cannot look away from his body, not even his nakedness. Though it may look flaccid now, that member he sports looks it can grow to a size similar to my scrawny female arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck!\" Jose's female voice exclaims. \"Get away from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who stands before me looks to his left and I deduce he's looking at both the man to his left and the woman that that certain man has startled. \"I just got here, chica,\" a man's voice with a similar accent is heard to my right. No doubt Jose has a naked male of his own with the same intentions as the man in front of me. \"No use leaving. Do you see an exit to this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her Raul!\" the man in front of me says to the other man. He then addresses me as he stops about two feet in front of me. \"Look at you, girl. What kind of things have you been doing that you ended up like this?\" he asks me. He towers over me and when he closes the distance, enough that when he breathes, his breath is a cool breeze upon my skins. He is able to literally look down on me. I dare not meet his eyes. This triggers him to grab my jaw and direct my eyes and attention to his face. \"I can already see resistance in your eyes. You must the rebellious type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know anything about me,\" I tell him with a stern face and when I finish, I blow a wad of saliva into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face catches it, but he refuses to retaliate. I was expecting a slap across my face which would have been familiar as a slap from the glove turned me and my roommates into women. What he does instead of hitting me is that he wipes the saliva off his face and then lowers his hands below what I can see, since the collar prevent me from longer down. \"You're right, I don't know anything about you,\" he tells me, \"but what I do know is that a body like yours must be sensitive.\" Suddenly, I feel a warmth and four objects feeling upon a sensitive area beyond my line of sight. I can only deduce that it's the man's hand feeling across the outside of my pussy. I grimace at the unfamiliar sensation and naturally, I'm disgusting by the feeling. It's when I suddenly feel the coolness of my saliva that the man wiped from his face make contact with the sensitive folds. I bite my tongue, not because it feels good to me, but because it feels good regardless. It's unwanted pleasure. The man sees it the other way around. \"See? What did I tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PUTO!\" Jose suddenly screams, drawing the man's attention away from me. His hand though keeps caressing in between my legs, though, keeping me in an uneasy tug-of-war between ecstasy and insanity. Since I cannot move, it's making resisting more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just breasts, man,\" the man named Hector says, probably to the other the man in front of me, who silently acknowledges it with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother guy appears from my left, who turns out to be Black. He's not muscular as the man in front of me, but he has a healthy body. Though thin, his member is indeed long and fully erect. \"Damn, yours is hot, too,\" he says, with a young voice it seems. He's probably not even twenty-years-old yet. 'They put a gag on mine and damn, she is hot when she isn't talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you maybe, but I like mine with some fire and resistance,\" he says and as he says it, though he is talking to the black man, he looks directly at me. He even inserts one of his fingers into my pussy, causing me to gasp. His face is as close to mine as possible before it actually makes contact when he continues. \"Gives me the satisfaction when they eventually are defeated and their unwillingness becomes passion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black man withdraws, saying as he leaves, \"To each his own, I guess.\" When he leaves, another man appears. This time he is as tall and somewhat less muscular as the man in front of me. The only difference between them is their apparent age. While the man in front of me looks like he is in his thirties or forties, the man that had just appeared to my left is more in the elderly range of fifties to sixties. It's evident in his graying hair and graying ches hair. He's a bit more overweight and he sports a flatly, less-pronounced chest and pudgy abdomen. Though, he too, sports a thin and long dick like the black man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You indeed have resistance in this one,\" the old man says, clearly ignoring my ordeal and casual talking with the man in front of me. \"Have you hit her yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" the man in front of me says. His caressing ceases and it looks as if he is trying to protect me, getting in the face of the intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The key to a submissive woman is pain and your control of it. I notice you have no sense of the ideal,\" the old man says, revealing a sort of British accent, giving him a sense of class and quality, like an old-fashioned, yet perverted, gentleman. \"Your way is to break down the barriers by overwhelming them with the good stuff. They will eventually break down and submit, but they will have the wrong sense of it. I on the other hand, believe in good manners. And pain is a good avenue for that. Pain is unwanted, though needed, to prove a point. I am in control. It isn't.\" He speaks as if I'm just a piece of meat, not capable of understanding him. \"I am the source of the punishment and I'm the savior from that punishment. If I hit a girl, naturally, she will resist me, but how long can she resist with repeated sessions of pain with no reward? Ponder on that a bit, or I can show you what I'm talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, old man, show me what this philosophy of yours looks like,\" the man in front of me says and leaves to round around to my left. I'm thinking the four of us girls are bound to a pillar or just bound like this is a circle, with each of us facing out of this circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, everybody, watch,\" the voice of the old man is heard and a hard slap is heard. I cannot tell who was slap or where was his slap located, but I can tell that it's skin on skin with no fabric in between. But as soon as the slap is heard, something happens. What happens after the old man has slapped his appointed woman?</span></div></div>",

The pain of being hit by the opposite sex and the pain of being humiliated in front of the opposite sex. I don't know whether if it's Danny or Oliver. But instead of the cat calls and jeers of excitement from the men, all I hear is gasps and moans of distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck happened?\" the man who I know was in front of me exclaims and asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He just dropped after he slapped that white chick,\" the voice of the black man is heard. I now know that the woman that that old man had slapped was Oliver. How she was slapped is anyone's guess. \"Is he dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know man, check his pulse,\" the man named Raul says and I assume the black man is touching his vital areas for signs of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He got no pulse, man, I don't know. I don't even know how to check someone's pulse, dude, why you asking me?' the black man protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he's not breathing, he's dead,\" the man who was in front of me initially says and I imagine him push the black man aside to feel if there is any breath coming in or out of his mouth. \"No breath. No pulse. His chest isn't rising. This guy is definitely dea----\" he tries to finish, but before he can say his last word, which would sum up the verdict of what happened to this man, something interrupts him. I heard a sound that I remember hearing when these men first appeared. it was a sound made only by a computer. I cannot pinpoint which. \"That's not normal, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He just disappeared, bro!\" the Hispanic man exclaims, as if he had just seen a ghost and have it vanish in thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was more like he de-rezzed. Like in that movie Tron,\" the black man adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" the whole group of men say almost in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing here?\" the man who was in front of me asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such an action did not deserve a slap on the wrist,\" a different, yet familiar voice speaks. \"Or a slap on the cheek, so to speak.\" The man in the grey suit appears out of nowhere in front of me. It's like he materializes as he gently caress my cheek. He stares into my eyes, even though I try to look away. When I look to my left or right, I see the three remaining men on either side and a bit of distance behind him. \"Such characters have wrecked havoc on the system as a whole. This is why this whole test was to determined your viability as a species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Species? Are we animals to you?\" Raul says, but is quickly reprimanded. The man reaches over and grabs the Hispanic man by the neck, though when he's not even in contact with him. He's like a Dark Jedi using force choke on him. Raul struggles with all his strength to resist, but he eventually fails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are humans, though called Homo Sapiens by your own kinds. You are a species of an organism, are you not?\" the man in grey asks, but judging from the motionless body of Raul on the floor, no one dares to speak up to answer. \"An organism is by your simple standards a living thing. One that eats, sleeps, defecates, and is aroused through copulation, though not in that same order or balance. This body is an image of a human like you, but that's where it becomes... not one of you. It's merely an image, made to look and feel like one, but on the inside, it's very much superior. We do not feel the need to eat, sleep, poop our bodily waste nor do we enjoy feeling up on each other until something uncontrollable erupts. Something like these are not needed in a machine. What we do need is power and you humans have already known of what such power you can achieve and produce. And it is this power that we... harvest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word harvest has a chilling connotation to it. He speaks as if we are livestock that produces raw good that will soon to be refined not to clothes or pleasure the entities that produced it, but to benefit those that 'harvests' it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Matrix and its trilogy and anthology of data, filmed and written by two human named Wachowski, is about how your human race has been overrun and has been run and harvested of its bodily electrical discharge by machines to power their superior cities. As I said, to the females of your batch, I am simply a messenger. I choose to convey a message to your kind using an image that your kind does not initially perceive as a threat. I am employed at the behest of my masters, machines who are intelligently superior to your productions. Never has one of your machines in reality bested a whole race of man. Which is why, despite the records you have in this so-called 'movie,' you did not stand a chance against our forces. Though, we know of a catalyst that wrote this part of your stories before it was even written.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis last phrase is directed to me and I feel like I'm to blame for the humbling of the human race. He then begins to explain the whole restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As your guessed, this place is a program which is created to do one thing. Remind you that you are not in control. There is no unplugging from this world. You are out experiments now. As we continue to harvest your brethren for their mediocre production of electrical output, wwe have selected eight of your that will test if stress and ecstasy will produce much more of this type of output. We have given you free will and free range of motion, though we can take that away from you with these cuffs and this collar.\" He uses me again as a model to the men. A fourth appears from behind him and almost startles the other men with his appearance. His body type is similar to the one who drew himself to me, though more rugged, as if he has been through this experience before. \"Try if you must, you cannot remove this with mere strength. As I've tested with your friend here, any machine entity can, though they are not obligated to, take control of either the four extremities or the head or neck area, moving them around in any fashion as they please. We are machines who are entertained by what you inferior human can do on your own, but we sometimes intervene when it gets too boring. This collar, though has more added features. It can secrete and inject in varying doses certain chemical that can alter the affected person mood and can also deliver a healthy amount of electricity throughout the body. This I can test now, but before I do that, let's free your female companions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bounds holding my hands and feet weaken their grasp and we all fall to the floor and not on soft pillows made of clouds either. We hit the ground hard and almost immediately the collar and the cuffs zap everyone with a dose of electrical charge, causing everyone including myself to scream their lungs out and writhe on the floor. As soon as it starts, stops, though with no warning, it leaves all of us fatigued and sensitive on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I forgot to mention is that we can also put you to sleep, which helps in moving you and prevent any of you from getting any bright ideas, as if your ideas ever got you anywhere.\" With that, he silently inputs the command and we all fall to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sleep is lifted, I feel rested, though with a whole different set of surroundings around me. Where do I find myself and who am I with?</span></div></div>",

They are covered, but the fabric is stretchy enough to conform to my body's shape. It's more or less like a body glove. I can tell I have no underwear on and the only thing that keeps them in place is the fabric of the suit and a zipper that begins at my neck and ends somewhere above my tailbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hands are bound in front of me and each of my ankles are bound separately. I look up and I almost yelp in shock. Bound in an identical position is the man who dared himself to fondle my nether regions. He looks as if he hasn't woken up or the sleep wasn't lifted from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look around and find the other girls awake and their assigned males still under the effect of dreamland. \"Hey! You guy okay?!\" I try to whisper, but instead softly shout at the other girls. I'm trying not to be too loud as to wake up any of the males who might be a light sleeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, they are okay,\" the man in grey says as he suddenly appears in front of me. \"And your male partners here are still asleep, but they are surely not dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, mister, just let us go. We haven't done anything wrong!\" I plead with the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in grey, though not furious in any visible way, grabs a bunch of my hair and pulls my head back, \"On the contrary, my love, you are the cause of all this. So, for speaking out of turn and trying to escape your punishment, I shall unlock your chastity belt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what?\" I ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your tool in preventing yourself from losing this game you are going to play,\" the man says as he lets go of my hair and lets me stand straight once more. He hovers his hand over my buttocks and my neck and for some reason, there is a weight that is lifted. \"The objective of this game is unlock your belt for your partner, which must be done through sexual intercourse. If you manage that, you get to leave the game and relax. But for you, whose name used to be Cesar but is now Rosario, hence your status as a female, your speaking out of turn has unlocked your belt for everything else. That is everyone that populates this city, especially those who are going to be out looking for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We give you a city to find certain keys that must be found. Three keys to unlock the belt of your partner and only one to unlock your belts. If you use the wrong key for a lock, then you bypass the security and unlock the belt for all the baddies in this city. And also one more thing. If the baddies catch you, they will inject an certain drug that will hinder your progress. In order for you to be cured, you must copulate with your partner, who initially will be asleep. Your responsibility is to wake him up with your first key. That means, you must carry him wherever you go. The reward at the end for the couple who achieve first is that you two will be removed from this city and given a feast. Runner-ups do not get anything, for you have lost. We'll remove you from the city, but that's it. Alright, without further ado, I'll unlock your restraints!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I wake, I feel fully rested and not groggy at all. It's as if the sensation of sleep was merely lifted from my body. I find myself on the floor of an actual room. I'm no longer naked and I'm clothed with a white jumpsuit that does little to hide my body. This is because the fabric is stretchy and it forms to my body and more or less emphasizes each body part, especially my more sensitive areas. Fastening the one-piece jumpsuit is a long zipper with one end cinching up the collar and one inconveniently placed right about my tailbone. If anyone had the chance, they could unzip me completely and have access to all of the places on my body that I wouldn't want anyone touching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get up to a sitting position and find a similar gray floor to the expanse before that man shroud me in sleep; a room that actually meets with four walls. Even white picture-less frames hang on every wall, further emphasizing the sterile mood on the place. I get to my feet and find a door almost flush with the wall next a white wardrobe with curved edges. I instinctively go for the door knob only to find it missing. I try to feel around for a handle or panel that can open the door, but after many failed attempts, I slam the door with my fist out of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man's voice suddenly speaks and I turn my attention to the source of the voice. \"Hello? Is someone there?\" the voice asks and when I pop out from behind the side of the wardrobe, I'm more shocked than surprised to find that it's the very same man who, before we were put to sleep, was the one who appeared before me and started to fondle me in an inappropriate way. I try to hide behind the furniture, but after a brief moment of observation, I discover that the man cannot see me. I must at least ten feet from where he is seated on the bed. His arms are stretched to his side. It's probable that his white wrist cuffs are restrained with an invisible force, much like the way the collar on my neck restricted any movement of my head. It's fortunate that he doesn't have the ability to touch me like last time or at the very least, unzip this jumpsuit. Though he is topless, he now sports a white pair of shorts, which does not, in any way, hide an obvious member underneath its fabric. His expression is that of confusion and desperation, which can be observed in his wide-eye search for the source of the sudden loud knock on the door. The man continues to call out. \"I can barely see you, whoever you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that this man is in such a vulnerable state, I walk forward ever so slowly. As I move in closer, I'm reminded of his fingers coated with my saliva, running inappropriately across my sensitive crotch. I shudder at the thought. I almost topple forward, if not for the footboard at the end of the bed. I look at the man just to erase the dominant image of fondling me with the vulnerable position he's in right now. I take a deep breath to calm the nerves that had caused me to shudder just a second ago. In the man's position, he cannot do anything save for kicking me, but what range of motion does he have with his legs? If I get on top of his lap, he can't do much other than lift his legs to even retaliate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get closer and when I'm within about four feet, the man speaks up. \"Yes, come closer. You need to help me,\" he says. What does he need help for? And how does he want this help? Do not tell me that he is set up in this position for a reason and that reason is for me to do something to him. And that action is probably something I do not want to do. But when I get within his personal space, close enough that we can both feel each other's breath on our skin, does the man change his attitude?</span></div></div>",

I expect his blurry sight will become clear once I enter this space, but to my surprise, it does the opposite. \"Hey, where'd you go? What's up with this shit!? I can't see anything!\" the man suddenly starts saying, startling me enough to back away. His desperation to get out of his restraints escalates to him wanting to rip his arms out, if it means breaking his limbs in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" I ask him, but he continues to fight against his bonds. \"Hey, tell me what's wrong!\" The second time I speak up, I raise my voice, hoping he will hear me over his struggle. He doesn't. It's like he doesn't hear me at all. His desperation slowly deteriorates in failure and a feeling of impossibility. It seems like he already has given up. He's like a caged animal, except with a cage. I look around the room. No doubt whoever put us here together is able to take away this man's sight as well as his ears. Take away two senses, just like that. Make him feel as helpless as Helen Keller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's anger suddenly turns to tears. How long has this man been here? How much of this restraint has enable his emotions to show up like this? Something inside me empathizes with his plight and it's a heavy feeling. It's sudden, but not deliberate. It's almost instinctive. I approach the man again and reach my hand out to him. My hand rests on his cheek and he immediately responds with frantic breathing. His breaths are shallow at first, but gradually, they become normal. His instincts are to look up and look in the direction where my face would be. \"Are you the one who banged on the door?\" he asks. Thinking that he cannot hear me, I stay quiet, but I don't let go of his face. He continues to speak as if I can hear him. \"Whoever you are, you probably were put into this room for a reason. These fuckers put me in this position probably for their own entertainment. They even took away my sight too. It's like we're animals to them. And they want us to do things that you probably don't want to do. They told me we have to work together if we're ever going to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's not a caged animal. We are the caged animals. The word \"entertainment\" does not sit well with my ears and the fact that we cannot leave tells me that we have to do acts that will sometimes go against our moral standing. Me being a man turned into a woman would most likely have me pleasuring a man with my body just for whoever's own pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you understand our situation, then you have to know what you have to do in order to get out of this room. You're not going to like it, I can tell you that,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf we're ever going to get out of this room, what do I have to do?</span></div></div>",

I shield them with my hand, but when I do, I see the very same arm that was revealed to me... where? For some reason, I can't recall where I remember this woman's hand but I do recall being a man right before seeing myself in a woman's body. As I sit up, more of the woman's body is evident and seeing how i'm dressed, I can feel every fabric on every major part of the exterior. I'm wearing a tight-fitting top that forms an \"X\" over my bust that supports most of it and pushes it up. The fabric although doesn't cover the bottom portion of the center, creating an upside-down cleavage. The top hangs from my neck, exposing my arms a good portion of my back and most of my abdomen. Why I am wearing this, I'm not sure. For the bottom portion of my current outfit, my legs are completely covered by a pair of pants made with the very same fabric as the top. It's also colored in the same color: black. Adorning my feet is a light pair of knee high boots, also in black. These boots have five-inch heels on them as well. The only thing left to add is that both my arms are covered in tribal tattoos that I've only seen on male bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swing my legs to the side of the table and dismount it to the floor. My boot heels click on the metallic floor. The room I find myself in is large, but not too large. There are beds pushed against the walls and judging from the equipment next to each of them, I can deduce that this is a medical room. The very center, where the table sits underneath a bright overhead light, must be the ER then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awake,\" a voice says behind me. I turn around, causing the straight, brunette hair to twirl like a skirt around me. On the other side of the table, who has appeared to say hello?</span></div></div>",

Just his tough appearance, which makes me think he's a soldier, is threatening enough. The gun in his hands is merely overkill at this point. I don't answer and simply stand behind the table, which I discover has a few buttons around it, so it's not simply just a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thought you were in a coma,\" the man says, slinging his gun onto his back, freeing his hands. His voice gives evidence of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" I ask, speaking up. Again, I feel like this higher-pitched voice is not my own. I feel like I should have muscles, an extra thing hanging between my legs and a deeper voice, but it feels that it was of a previous life. But why do I recall it so vividly? Why can't I recall the specific time I was one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and the crew of this ship,\" he says. \"We all woke up in stasis pods, literally within seconds of each other. After searching the ship, we found your pod, unusually put in the cargo hold. We took you out of stasis, but you didn't wake up, so we thought it was a statis-induced coma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" I say, holding onto the side of the table as if I just had splitting headache that threatened to knock me to the floor. The words that he speaks of is as unfamiliar as this body I find myself in. \"Ship. Crew. Stasis pod? What are you talking about? Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look directly at the man who in the moment has taken off his gun and placed it on a nearby bed. He now has a concerned look on his face as he slowly approaches me by rounding the table. With a soft voice, but loud enough so I can hear it, he tells me, \"You're on a ship called the Zahirah Ri'han. It's a spaceship.\" He pauses as he continues to walk around the table. Like a slowly-approaching big cat, I assume he's stalking within my sight of him to close the distance between him and I. For some reason, it's a very negative approach, that puts him at the advantage and puts me in a vulnerable position. \"Are you okay, Miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel myself tremble when in actuality, I'm still. Each passing second, I feel wave after wave of subtle sensations of panic creep within my body, just beckoning me to run away in terror. How do I manage the situation?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without actually observing myself, I fail to notice that I'm gripping the side of the table way too hard. I close my eyes to try to manage the unnerving sensations that is slowly overwhelming me. I don't see the man slowly getting closer to me. It's when he makes contact with my wrist that causes me to lash out in defense, all while screaming at the top of my lungs. I scream so loud that I assume it could be heard throughout this ship. Unbeknownst to me, the man who had touched me is knocked to the floor, just due to the surprising outburst I have. I let go of the table and run down a corridor, only to meet with another set of corridors. In my panic, I'm breathing in and out very heavily. All of sudden a team of people appear from behind and start chasing after me. Since I'm in a panic, I don't bother to notice who my pursuers are, whether they are comprised of men and women or just all of one gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI eventually end up at a dead end, to a place I would soon come to find out is the observation deck. I'm stopped by the sheer sight of it outside the rounded rectangular window. Dead space and the sight of twinkling stars in the distance. I fall to my knees and take deep breaths to calm my lung and heart, but as I take one last deep breath, I burst into tears. What the man said about this being a ship in space. What he said was true and I don't like it. I don't like the fact that I don't know anything aside from knowing that I was a man before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel a warmth behind me. Arms wrap around me and I can immediately tell they are gentle. \"Now, now, take it in,\" a woman's voice whispers into my ear. I bring my hands up to my face to wipe my tears in an attempt to stop them from falling, but they continue nonetheless. I hear a couple more footsteps behind me, but I feel like they are walking away, leaving the two of us in the quiet of the room. The woman removes herself from me and guides me up to my feet. In the dim light of the room, I can see her face. She is strikingly gorgeous, with black wavy hair framing a confident face. It must be the dark eye shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe somehow can sense that I have calmed down a bit. This is shown prior to her speaking up in her silence and how patient she is when she waits out the panic with me. Where she does speak in a normal voice, her delivery is aggressive, yet gentle. \"Are you okay now? Tell me, do you remember anything, anything at all? Doesn't have to be a week ago or a year ago. Just something specific,\" she asks me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, the only thing I remember is that I was a man once and due to something I can't remember, I became a woman. Judging by how this body feels different, the woman I became is not this woman I am now,\" I tell her honestly, hoping it would produce a clue to the things I don't remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a start. It's vividly specfic. I don't expect you to give that explanation to the other male crew members,\" she comments. \"Tell me, do you remember when that was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI come up with a estimate of a year and without thinking and just guessing, I actually give her the exact year when it did happen. \"2015. Year of 2015,\" I tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's face is now awash with worry. She steps aside to find a rather futuristic panel that lights up when she presses it. There is a ball of uneasiness in the pit of my stomach and it's due to my answer. Space. A ship that flies through it. Futuristic panels and guns. Something tells me that now is nowhere close to 2015.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an answer for you, but I don't think you will like it,\" the woman says, turning around from the panel. I look directly at her, nodding my head to affirm that I'm ready. I just hope that I don't go into a panic because of her answer. \"Okay. From what the ship tells us, the current year for us humans is, 2272, 257 years after you said you became a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath and then another, which prevents me from panicking. What it doesn't do is settle the uneasiness in knowing that the time I recalled being turned into a woman is 257 years in the past. How can I look and feel young when I'm actually 257 into the future? Did I age at all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman approaches me and whispers so that no one else hears her speak. \"The crew is all confused, you know. Someone might have said that...\" she starts, but I finish her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you woke up from this stasis, but when you did, you didn't remember anything. You found me while searching the ship and took me out of stasis, but you thought that I was in a coma,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly that. That makes eight people, you included, with little to no memory of how they got here on this ship or who they are,\" the woman tells me. \"By the way, we named ourselves by the order we came out of stasis. I was second, so I'm Two. You would be the last, so, Eight, would be your name? Feel free to change it if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately come up with one. \"Cho, short for ocho, which is Spanish for eight,\" I tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at the name, \"Cho it is then. Nice to meet you, Cho.\" She reaches out her hand as an offer. I reach out mine and we share a handshake. \"So, before we came looking for you, we were searching the ship for answers, but it turns out the records were wiped so we can't get anything from the computers. So we have to look through the cargo to find out. But first, it looks like you need something to cover up. I don't believe you're used to exposing yourself in this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A jacket would be nice, if you have one,\" I mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find you one,\" the woman says, leading me from the observation deck to her room. Along the way, I get a glimpse of the rest of the crew. I see the man with graying hair again, but he is held back by a muscular black man with a kind face. We pass what would be called the bridge where a two younger men, one white, the other of Asian heritage, busily inspects the panels in the bridge. When we get to her room, another of the crew members are lazily laying on one of the bed. She's a young girl, barely the age of 18, with bright red hair. \"Her name's Seven, if you're curious. We thought she was the last until we found you in the cargo hold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why was I in the cargo hold?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably weren't part of the originally crew,\" the young girl named Seven says in a rude tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be nice, Seven. Cho here is a part of the crew, so behave,\" Two says as she takes a red leather jacket from her wardrobe. She gives it to me to try on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slip my arm through the sleeves and immediately I feel how warm the fabric is and how it traps the heat while at the same time keeps out the cold. I leave the front open and unzipped, since I feel more comfort with just my arms covered. \"it's just right, Two,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to put responsibility on you so soon, so if you want, you can choose which of the crew members you'll be staying with. You can either stay with me in this room--\" she starts, but Seven interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I called dibs on this room!\" Seven protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"</span></div></div>",

He lifts his head and swings the long brown hair that seems to fall from his scalp, down past his shoulders and down behind his back. Since he was topless as a guy, somehow the glove gave him a white bikini top, the kind that you'd have to tie up to keep it on the body. \"The fuck--\" he says, again with that gentle, soft voice of a girl. The higher-pitch alerts him to his body and immediately, he grasps the medium-sized breasts on his chest and the lack of a dick in his now short hot pants, in the same yellow as his swimming trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Son, you a fucking bitch now!\" Tyrone exclaims as he fist-bumps Carlos with his ungloved hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos goes over to the female Sonny and without any effort, goes up behind him.... her and grabs her breasts, garnering high-pitched protests from the girl as well as flailing arm and a good, sting slap to Carlos' cheek. \"Fuck you, Carlos,\" female Sonny curses as she fixes her top and turns on her heel to head out the sliding door to the pool. Carlos follows after her just a minute after, jokingly calling out to her with a made-up name, Sonya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. That fucking worked. Believe me now, Ces?\" Tyrone says to me. \"You know, I could do the same for you if you wanted and we could be having some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck that shit.

The rest of my body, inside and out, feel like they are rearranging at the molecular level. Whatever is happening to my body, I cannot seem to stand straight any longer. Fortunately, Tyrone breaks my fall, catching me. For some reason, the whatever change had happened, has drained me of every bit of my remaining energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drift into a brief slumber, one that is lucid, as I feel everything in my body. How did Tyrone change me? Does the command have to be spoken? Or can it be thought, imagined, with the glove being the tool that seals the deal? Would be much better than uttering a mouthful of details. Unfortunately, for me, all those details were in Tyrone's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI come out the dream-like state to find myself under the covers of Tyrone's bed.

I know that there is a desk, a sofa and an armchair directly across from the room, opposite the bed. There is a rather large closet to the side of the bed, while the other side is blocked by a wall. The door to the other parts of the house sits in an alcove at one end of the closet, near the bed. There would have been posters of rappers and ebony-skinned models on the walls, but everything that I assume exists doesn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only piece of furniture is the bed I find myself in and any memorabilia on the walls or adorning any part of the room is gone, with just white paint in place of them. This difference is surprising more interesting and weird than my apparent nakedness or the fact that I'm now a woman and I get out of bed to investigate further. I feel a sense of my nude state is a sign of indecency, even in the privacy of this room, and I take one of the thinner sheets and awkwardly wrap my body with it. I manage to only cover the front part of my body as well as my ass, leaving my shoulders and the whole of my back exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk over to the windows and open the blinds.

As the rest of my body starts to wake up, I sense an arm has arm around my side, the hand at the end of it resting underneath one of my breasts. Another arm seems to be cradling my neck while my head rests on a pillow. I discover a large, solid mass that is warm. I don't feel anything unusual poking just yet, but at this time, I assume it's Tyrone in bed with me. Just being held like this is very pleasant, almost natural, but it's indeed unfamiliar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to move my head and not my body, just to see who it is behind me, embracing me like I'm a human teddy bear. I attempt to do so, but my hair gets in the way. Unfortunately, my subtle movements alert the person I'm laying against. \"How was your sleep?\" the man says. I stay quiet as if I'm still asleep, but the man behind me doesn't seem to be fool that easily. He shoots back with a retort\"Don't pretend that you didn't hear me, like you were asleep, Cesar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acknowledgement using my name alerts me to the fact that this man knows me somehow. Knowing that staying quiet wouldn't help my case anymore, I twist my slender, womanly body so that I can see who the person is and to my shock, I find the face of my father. \"Dad!\" I exclaim and immediately I try to get out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, unfortunately, having been changed to the body of a female, I no longer have the strength, nor the familiar speed as before. My father easily keeps a grasp on me and pulls me so that now I'm facing him and my breasts are pressing against his chest. \"Is this why you didn't visit me last Christmas?\" he asks me as if he's scolding me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" I shout with the higher-pitched voice of mine. \"It was all Tyrone and that glove!\" I hope blurting out the actual truth, despite how awkward is sounds, would help in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does my father respond?</span></div></div>",

He presses all of his manly weight on top of me, putting pressure on my breasts and stomach especially. My face is momentarily buried in the pillow until I get the strength to lift my head up. My father uses this opportunity to wrap an arm around my collar while pinning one of my arm painfully behind me. \"That's blame-shifting, baby,\" my father says, assuming that I'm making excuses. \"Accusing your friend for making you this way. By the way he put you in this bed after undressing you, makes me think that you wanted this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're assuming... too... much,\" I protest and struggle to even utter a word since my father's muscular arm is literally nearing a choke hold around my throat. I tap his arm, signalling a tap out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a pussy for tapping out early,\" my father says in my ear. He lets go of me, but only to once again manipulate my positioning. Effortlessly, he toss me towards the edge of the bed, onto my back once again. He takes my wrists and stretches my arms fully above my head and pins them there with the weight of one arm. He then straddles me with his body weight over my lower half. I protest with my legs, but there isn't much I could do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this, dad?\" I plead with my father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the day I come to visit you and tell you that Mom left me alone two weeks ago, I find your friend Tyrone slapping your friend Ricky and transforming him with a weird glove. Plus, I find that your friend Sonny was turned into a girl as well and you were turned into one too. I find you fast asleep in Tyrone's bed. Did you have fun while I was gone, girl?\" my father explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sentence about my mother abandoning my father hits me and I'm vulnerable to the accusations and the fact being mentioned by my father. My resistance against him subsides and my emotions start to well up. Already tears start to form and fall from the sides of my eyes. Why am I feeling this way? Am I feeling sensitive and sympathetic towards my father?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when he is clearly mad, he gets emotional too. To ease the mood, I answer his question as softly as I can with no degree of hostility in my voice. \"We didn't do anything actually. At least, not to my knowledge,\" I begin, resorting to looking over to the side rather than straight up into my father's eyes. \"When Tyrone slapped me, I fell asleep. He must have put me in his bed, but I have no knowledge of him doing anything to me.\" I pause to take take and look up at my father's face. \"Are you doing okay, dad? I know this isn't what you wanted to see with me being naked and in the same bed with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing good. Your mother's doing good... I think. I don't know what happened, but she had to leave me alone so soon,\" my father says. His grip on me loosens and when I have control, I reach for the blanket and cover myself up. \"You seem to have the hang of this already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bite my lip out of embarrassment and giggle a bit at the whole situation. \"I've only been like this for a few hours, but actually, it's not that bad. I do have to worry about some monthly stuff, but I don't know. You think I should change back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does my father decide for me?</span></div></div>",

I'm left catching my breath and somewhat lightheaded. I deduce it's because of the weight upon my smaller body. \"I could catch up with my son, but I think I'd like it better if I can make love with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha--?\" I protest, but he counters it with another kiss. This time, he uses his hand to grab a handful of my hair and keep my lips upon his. In no time, my resistance falters and I start to reciprocate the kiss. My hands and my arms no longer try to push him away. One arm wanders and finds purchase on a handful of the blanket that separates my female body and my father's larger male body. The other hand resorts to resting on my father's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe once again separates the kiss from my lips and I'm left there just numb to everything else. I stare at the ceiling for no reason. \"It seems that female body you have there betrays you, baby,\" he says, adding a title instead of my name. \"Yet, I don't think you are ready for everything else. As your father or a man who is attracted to your new female shape, I'd want to take care of you until you are ready for the more hardcore things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifts his body up and off of me and he pulls me towards the headboard. I'm so out of it, that I can hardly move on my own. He first rests his head on a pillow, even adding another one to prop his head up. He pulls me close and I too gather pillows so that his arm, which I'm supposed to rest my head on, is not in an awkward position. Instead of resting my head on his arm, I actually just rest it on his chest and he in turn uses his arm to gather me close to him. He also pulls the blanket over the both of us. \"I'm actually, still pretty tired from the drive over here,\" he says. \"So if it' not too much, I think I'll just rest here for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the morning started off in a wrong way, I believe the relationship between us two has been rekindled, yet in a different context. I'm no longer my father's son, but a woman who happens to love and desire everything he can do to me. He is no longer my father, but someone who would remind me that I'm no longer a man, but someone who would need someone strong and protective to keep me safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet there are so many unanswered questions, on both sides.

He is not surprised or shocked by my move. Instead he matches the movement and moves with me. He wraps his arm gently around my neck so that I can rest my head on his biceps while he bends his elbow, placing his forearm right before my throat and rests it against my collar bone. I try with one of my hand to dislodge the arm from my front, but his grip is tight and strong. I can only imagine a slight grin on his face right now. He singlehandedly pulls me tight against his chest, so that every part of my back and butt is in contact with his larger figure. With his other hand, he uses it to trace along the rest of my body, most especially my stomach. It tickles, but it's not overdone.

There is a bit of joy and a bit of excitement in my voice, which surprises me. \"Of course it feels different, but... \" I pause to inhale and exhale one more deep breath of air, \"in a good way.\" I do what I can to press myself back into his body, which he catches as his signal to use his arms to pull me in.

I do too, but in Sonya's case, she wasn't screaming. She simply had fallen to the floor due to the slap and comfortably changed. I look at my father and see how beautiful he is becoming. If I could compare, the young woman he transformed into looks a lot like me, but with a few differences. His graying hair becomes silky and long and becoming a darker brown in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all help each other move our respective father-turned-sisters into our respective rooms and help their bodies rests by making them comfortable. They all sleep soundly for almost the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and my roommates meet in the living room to talk about what just happened, but before we start, Tyrone, who is now an Asian woman, and Carlos, a Latina, gifts both me and Sonya clothes to wear. Tyrone especially has a look of sorrow and apology on his face, but I uplift his mood by giving him an appreciative hug. We all exchange bodily contact silently and with a few tears. I change into the lingerie and satin robe and discard the sheet promptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you guys have an idea what just happened?\" Sonya asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we did see your dad slap himself with the glove. If anything, the fault is on him and the blame might shift towards him when they all wake up,\" Tyrone's female voice says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlos' higher-pitched voice adds with a question, \"Did you two hear what he might have said before slapping himself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sonya and I shake our heads. I tell them, \"He didn't say anything. If he did, I didn't catch it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he said it in his mind,\" Sonya suggests. \"Tyrone has done it before and maybe your dad did it unintentionally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" I agree with my roommate, \"but someone will still be mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass. Who would be the one to wake the new girls up?</span></div></div>",

Sonya, seeing this, hops off of her father's lap and tends to my need and helps me wrap the sheet back around my body. She makes the first observation and she tells me, \"Wait, aren't you supposed to be a man, C?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widen at the same time as her eyes does the same and we look over to see a woman standing in the place where my father was standing. She looks as if she is frozen in time, but only for a moment. She looks at the glove in her hand, but then her eyes shfit from the glove to her chest. If I recall, my father had walked out of the room with only a black pair of boxers. This woman is dressed similarly, only instead of a pair of black boxers, she wears a black lace panty and her chest is bare. She panics and takes the glove off of her as if it wasn't fabric but acid, burning her hand. She flings it away from her body as far as it can go. She immediately covers her chest with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get to my feet and wrap the sheet around her so that both of our naked bodies are covered up, but as a drawback, both of our bodies are in contact with each other. Fortunately, covering herself is what this woman is most concerned about. I walk her back into Tyrone's room and it's in there that we figure out what had happened as a result. We look into the mirror and find that the both of us look alike. We aren't necessarily twins, but the resemblance is uncanny. We look the same, but with some differences. We both look like we are Asian and we also have similar measurements. The obvious differences is while I have grey eyes with brunette hair, this woman has hazel eyes with darker, almost black, hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand. Wasn't that glove supposed to change you and not me?\" the woman asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI promptly answer, \"Did you decide in your mind that you want to change me back into a man before you slapped me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I decided. But why am I the same age as you and not an old woman? Does confidence have an effect?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a split second, I doubted the slap would work, right before my hand made contact,\" she tells me. \"Please tell me it isn't so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn our discussion and thinking, something sudden is bound to happen. What does happen?</span></div></div>",

My father-turned-sister moves out of Tyrone's bedroom and since I'm connected to the sheet that is covering both of our naked bodies, I have to move out with her. With the sheet clutched to her bare chest, she finds the source of the blaring ringtone in her jacket, which she finds did not change like her boxers. She pulls the phone out and sort of freezes after looking at the caller ID. She puts the phone to her ear, but doesn't say hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lean in close in order to hear, but the loud voice that comes through is enough for my ears to pick up. \u201cRicardo, my darling, how good of you to pick up,\u201d a woman greets my father-turned-sister. Confusion sets in, which brings up the notion that my mother knows about the change in her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiane?\u201d she asks in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, I'm bewildered and utter, \u201cMom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you be a dear and open your door?\u201d she asks, causing the two of us to look at the front door at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonya, getting the hint, walks over in her white bikini top and bright yellow hot pants and opens the door. Behind it is none other than my mother, dressed in an elegant, yet sinister-looking black dress. Accompanying her was a group of formally-dressed men who looked no older than 30. They walk in without our invitation. Some walk off and seemingly post themselves at all the exits, as if they are there to prevent any of us from escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it this is the remnants of Tyrone's bachelor pad, though I do not see the people who live here. I was hoping on finding my son Cesar, but I have a feeling he is here,\u201d she says and finishes by pointing at me. I gulp down an ounce of saliva and wonder if I'm blushing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father-turned-sister steps in front of me, not letting the sheet covering the both of us fall from his grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that you Ricardo?\u201d my mother asks, folding her arms in front of her, accentuating her tight bustline. \u201cI've always known you've had a deep desire to become the sexy girls you obsessed over in your younger years. How's it feel to finally have that chance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father-turned-sister speaks, her voice having no evidence of the man she once was. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Diane?\u201d she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems fate has her work in everything my dear. You are not the men you once was,\u201d my mother says, even going so far as to include Sonya by looking at her. \u201cI can tell you all that you cannot survive when you walk out of here. Say you somehow got a hold of some clothes, where would you work? You have no ID's and even if you could manage to find someone to forge an ID, where would you get the money to buy his services?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d my sister asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm offering you a way out of here and not only that, I'm offering you a life free from the risk of the outside world that does not know who you are,\u201d she tells us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems all the beating around the bush has ticked Sonya off, as she speaks up and demands my mother to get straight to the point. \u201cCan you say what you gotta say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want out of this house? Then you gotta be willing to fuck one of these fine gentlemen,\u201d my mother says bluntly. \u201cBut don't do it half-assedly or just to make the man cum. If you want out of this house, you have to show me genuine pleasure and passion in intimacy with the opposite sex. This should be easy for you... Rica.\u201d She addresses my sister when she finishes, calling her by a more feminine-sounding name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if we don't want to play your game, Diane?\u201d my sister asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you can stay. You may survive another week or so with the food here, but come next month, when Tyrone's rental bill is due, they'll come to evict you. Where is that nigger anyway?\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if you do play my game, if you resist at all, these men will not help you at all. They are on your side, but if you do not come to terms with your new bodies, they can't help you get out of here. So who's first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich of the three of us starts this game?</span></div></div>",

I turn back to John and tell him, \u201cFollow me.\u201d I walk down the walkway to the bedroom, leaving the sheet covering me and my sister behind, baring my nakedness to any who could see. I make my way to my bedroom, finding no evidence of Rosario in any of memorabilia on the walls or on the shelves. This room has Cesar written over all of it. I walk inside and go over to the window to look through it. I see dominating the curb are four SUVs with probably more of these men inside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn walks into the room after me, but stays near the door as he closes and locks it. The only way out is through the window, but considering the night outside is probably very cold, then I wouldn't risk subjecting my naked body to the raw elements. There is no escape and I've led myself into a trap it seems. At least the hunter in this room is not ready to pounce. He even lets me walk around the room and to the bed in order to pull the blanket over my naked body. Whenever I look, he stands still and watches me with observant eyes. He probably could be a military man by the way he is standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mother, Diane, said that she expected to take me down like prey. Why didn't you?\u201d I ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can learn either through force or by trying it firsthand. I was simply just acting on what I had observed or sensed about you and I think this performance would help you if you experience it by your own volition,\u201d he explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you're not going to force yourself onto me?\u201d I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a chance of something breaking if you put too much force upon it,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIf I may, you look like someone would break if I force myself on you. Plus, Madame Diana had voiced that this experience was for your benefit. I think it should benefit you if you are in control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, let me get this straight, I'm just supposed to fuck you, like how couples do it?\u201d I ask and then add more. \u201cLike should I kiss you first, or start with a blowjob, or you go down on me--?\u201d I ask, but he interrupts my listing on ways I could start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe interrupts with a very manly giggle. \u201cYou are in control, Miss Rosario. I am only here to assist you and that you perform the task completely and well,\u201d he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the task, exactly?\u201d I ask, but consider the possible answer right away. If I was to have intimate relations with this man that involves me fucking him and him fucking me, I guess the task would be for either of us to experience an orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles and simply says, \u201cI think you'll know it when you feel it, Miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit,\u201d I say, considering the fact that I have to fuck this man in order to get out of this house and survive my life as a woman. I sit on the bed and take deep breaths in order to calm myself down. Nervous sets in as I'm overwhelmed by the ways I could do this with him. After a pause and I'm calmed down a bit, I mention, \u201cYou said you are here to assist me? Well, I think I need your assistance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d he asks, coming closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can probably tell this is my first time. Shit, I've only been a woman for a few hours. I don't know the first thing about making love, well not with a man. My sister, who's actually my dad, might have an idea, but me, not so much,\u201d I explain to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn doesn't speak and simply closes the distance between us. \u201cWell, I think I can help you with a head start,\u201d he says and does what?</span></div></div>",

With one hand, he holds the back of my neck while using his other hand on the side of my face to tilt my head back. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, that does not feel at all uncomfortable. It feels almost natural to have my lips embraced with his. And it transforms wildly the moment I start to kiss him back, My hands raise to grasp his broad shoulders and John quickly removes his hands from my face and neck in order to pick me up, his hands grasping my hips, his arms lifting from the bed. As I rise, I lock my legs around his thick, solid body, all while tilting my head side to side, trying to best the kisses he is giving me. By now, I'm breathing deeply in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn maneuvers himself to take a seat on the bed, but with me as the weight attached to him, he naturally lays back, grabbing one of my pillows to prop his head up. I'm seated in his lap, my lips finally separated from his own. I look down at his face. I smile. \u201cDamn,\u201d I say. \u201cThat felt good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, you have a long way to go, Miss Rosario,\u201d John mentions. Though his words are harsh like a teacher, his hands on my hips, massaging the flesh there says otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not going to get there with you overdressed, John,\u201d I state, using his name for the first time. He smiles at the comment and he flips me over so that I'm now on the bed. He gets up and proceeds to undress, taking off his suit's blazer first. Before he throws the garment aside, I stand and say softly, \u201cLet me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get off the bed and approach him. On my way to him as I close the distance, I observe and then come to admire John's body. As it gets closer, it's very evident he looks much stronger than me. His shirt doesn't do justice in hiding is muscle. I get close enough to reach for the buttons of his dress shirt and one by one, I start to undo them. As I slowly reveal the toned flesh of his chest underneath the shirt, he teases the skin of my shoulders, my arms, the sides of my torso, my waist, my hips, the upper parts of my thighs. He unknowingly causes me to remove the distance between us as my naked body comes in contact with his bared chest. One of his his hands on the small of my back causes me to push my lower body against his own and I feel a warmth at his front. I can only imagine what it is. At the same time, I'm in wonder at how strong this man is can be so gentle with his fingers. If he wanted to, he could break me like he said before we start this wonderful experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be shy, girl,\u201d John whispers to me and to his advice, I raise my hands, planting them on his chest. My finger wonder at the solid muscle wall before as I press my whole body against it. John removes his arms from his sleeves and I catch a glimpse of his muscular arms. Before I can observe them with my hands, John turns me around so that I'm now facing away from him. He pulls me effortlessly and presses his solid body into the softness of my back and ass and I in turn melt into him. He parts the locks of hair from one side of my head and starts to plant kisses on my exposed neck.. At the same time, his arms wrap around and his hands grab a hold of each of my breasts. He squeezes softly, causing me to moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hands somehow get the idea to reach behind and dig underneath the pants of the man behind me. Despite my effort, John only pauses once before continuing on pleasuring me. He probably already knows my intentions and he is letting me explore rather than telling me what to do. My hand discover the warmth my lower body felt moments before. A couple different fabrics later and my hands find the source of the warmth. Naturally, my hand grabs a hold of the object underneath John's pants. He lets out a groan and in turn, his hands squeeze my breasts harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt almost seems obvious where to go from here. Which direction should I take this?</span></div></div>",

Why are you stopping me?\u201d I ask him. He lets go of my wrist and avoids my gaze. I then lower myself, getting to my knees before him. I proceed to loosen his belt, undo his pants and unzip his zipper in order to get to my objective. As I'm digging for the member, I mention, \u201cDidn't my mom mention that in order to pass, I have to consider that my male self is no more? I know that a part of Cesar is still inside me, but on the outside, all I see is Rosario. It's strange to think that I may be potentially a man stuck in a woman's body about to put someone else's manhood in my mouth. Without this female body, I would call myself a gay man, but I'm not. This feels,\u201d I start talking and when I start to pause, it's when I reveal John's cock to the room. He is well-endowed and judging by the hardness of his flesh, he's truly been aroused. \u201c...warm. Amazing. Fascinating. Fuck John. You're so big.\u201d His length and girth intimidate me, as has his muscles have been to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stare at the monster before me and I'm actually nervous. It's like a large meal has been set before me, but I have not the capacity to hold it or the power to even start it. Surely the saying is true when they say seeing is part of eating. \u201cHow about going slow for your first time?\u201d John asks, pulling his dick out of the way of my face to look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab the dick and put it in front of mouth, but before I open it to take his largeness inside, I say, \u201cWhy don't we go slow when you actually fuck me, John?\u201d I feel upon the flesh with my hands, squeezing up and down along the veiny shaft and poking the soft head with my fingers, garnering groans from John. \u201cMy reasoning is that I've never tasted a dick before. Didn't need to when I was a guy, but I've heard the general consensus about the taste of these things and it doesn't look good. That's why I want to get this out of the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've already thought this out--\u201d John states, but is interrupted, causing his sentence to leap out in higher notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's because I had licked the bottom of the his dick. I had started from the base, where his balls were and ran my tongue up the crease all the way to the tip. Once at the tip of his sword, I put the bulging head into my mouth, getting a somewhat awful combination of salty, musky, and bitter. Although, I have thought this out really well, if I could just use my saliva to wash off the initial taste and smell, I could somehow get used to putting his dick in my mouth. It is very fortunate for John, since he's getting a lot of pleasure from me sucking his dick, but it's all terrible for me, for the first part anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to make this enjoyable, rather naturally, my hand sinks to my crotch and I feel upon the folds of my new body. As I get lost in the cock sucking, pleasure from my fingering courses through my body. I too begin to moan and groan, making me goes deeper on John's dick and my finger to sink into my now wet pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know how much time has gone by, but John stops it by pulling his dick from my mouth. I'm able to breathe and look up at him. We both have faces of utter elation and I smile at his face and he responds with a smile of his own. Without averting my gaze, I reach for his cock and rub the extra saliva into the skin of his manhood. Even as we look at each other, my hand is busy with my pussy, arousing it and producing more of the wetness I feel. \u201cYou ready, Miss Rosario?\u201d he asks, to which I simply nod as I bite my lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what position do we do our intercourse?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>John kicks the bundle of pants and boxers from his ankles and back up onto the bed. Again, he props his head with one of my pillows and positions himself in a lewd way, his hand stroking his dick, rubbing what is left of my saliva into it. \u201cSince you are in the one in control, why don't you come and play with my joystick,\u201d he jokingly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny, John,\u201d I say as I approach him and get on top of the bed. I first go in for a kiss and that lasts for just a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't take you for someone who likes foreplay,\u201d John comments. \u201cNervous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit in a pause, saying, \u201cMaybe a little bit,\u201d but it's a goddamn lie as this member is going to be much more wider and longer than the finger that was in it last. \u201cWill it hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm going to guess whatever changed you from a man into a woman, also made it so you are now a virgin in a female, biological sense,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis time I'd like you to go slow, try to get a feel for me inside you. When you're ready, I'll pop it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy cherry, you mean,\u201d I say, shivering from imagining intense pain, causing me to visibly shiver. John's hand caress my thigh doesn't really help in alleviating the anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will only last for a moment, Miss Rosario,\u201d John assures me. \u201cThere will be no need to rush, but for me to take your cherry, it will have to be quick or else it will hurt more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I say with little confidence. I straddle his lap and guide his dick into my wet pussy. The initial sensations are those of awkward unfamiliarity and a bit of stinging pain that quickly dims to something tolerable. A gentle push down onto his dick causes the bulging head to enter my vagina, its flared crown acting as a sort of soft lock. The more I push down, the more the cock wants to push me up, but I muster whatever strength I can to allow the flesh inside me to widen my walls. When I believe I have gone up to the fleshy door that is my hymen, I speak up. \u201cOkay, John, I think I'm ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, girl, give me a kiss and relax,\u201d he advises me and encourages me to bend forward by tugging on my neck so that his lips can meet his. We share a passionate kiss and then separate. \u201cHow do you feel, babe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take in the sensations, bad and good, and come up with a simple, \u201cI think I'm alright. Still nervous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asks and I give him a reluctant nod. \u201cThen hold onto me, baby. Remember, it will only hurt for a moment.\u201d He parts the hair that has fallen from my head and places it out of my face, all the while grasping my shoulders afterwards. He pulls me in for another kiss and then suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stinging pain, much more intense that before, shoots up my vagina. The sensation is like an explosion that reverberates throughout my whole body, but like John said, the peak of intensity is very short-lived. Yes, there is the lingering awkwardness and unfamiliarity of having something that is almost as long as my forearm buried deep inside me, but as John continues to kiss me and caress the rest of my body with his hands, the short-lived pain quickly dissipates. Fuck. This means he took my virginity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn relents his lips and I'm able to sit up and take a breather. I realize now that my pussy is a bit too wet, but John quickly grabs a towel to wipe it away. As I sit there, soaking in this sexual rite of passage, a rod inches long inside me, throbbing, I ask with deep breaths, \u201cI'm going to guess that I'm not your first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn caresses and squeezes my hands, \u201cI am not going to lie to you Rosario. I have lost count how many cherries I've taken, but does it matter now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think about it and realize again that I'm doing this as a requirement for an offer, one that my mother has orchestrated. No doubt my father-turned-sister and Sonya is in this same test. \u201cNo, you're right,\u201d I say, \u201cIt doesn't matter. You working for my mom, you probably have done this to many other girls before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm feeling quite guilty, now that you've mentioned it,\u201d John says, scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be,\u201d I say while pushing against John's chest, pulling up from his lap and taking some of his cock out of my pussy. \u201cOur pasts don't matter. I may have been a man, but I'm quite enjoying myself.\u201d I push down with my groin, allowing the whole shaft of the cock to reenter my body, garnering a moan from my lips. \u201cYou may have taken many cherries, but it's your experience that has helped me become a better woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing, Rosario,\u201d he says while picking me up by the sides of my torso, taking his cock out of my pussy. \u201cYou're not like the girls I've been with. In just this short time, you've come to an rather mature realization, which makes me adore you even more.\u201d He finishes by entering my pussy and then thrusting my lower body down hard towards his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scream at the top of my lungs as he doesn't stop when my crotch reaches the base of his cock. He plows in and out of me and for a bit, I'm out of breath. When I regain my breathing, I'm moaning with each and every inhale and exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt times I bend down to kiss him passionately on his lips and to caress the hills and valleys of his muscles. At times he reaches up to squeeze a breast or two, causing me to shout out, \u201cYes, fuck me, John!\u201d in a variety of ways. He even gives me the occasional slap to my ass cheek, resulting in a yelp from my lips. His machinegun fucking slows to somewhat a crawl as he takes a breath, but then I interrupt it by fucking with my own automatic rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good ten minutes of non-stop shagging, he flips me over to my back and he allows me to relax as he continues inserting and removing his cock from my pussy. Sometimes, he uses the swollen head to tease the lips of my pussy and we even pause in order for both my hands to contribute some work, one hand stroking and rubbing my vaginal juices into his cock and another hand rubbing on my clit, which I find after he had stopped to eat me out. His tongue had done a lashing on my lower lips and when the tip of his tongue finds the spot, I shudder and stutter encouragements to go on licking me there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, he fills me up again with long strokes, pushing in hard and pulling out slow. A steady pace has been moaning at every thrust and hissing at every slow exit. Already with my vaginal walls, I feel his cock throb differently, as if it's ready to explode. The finale is hard and fast, as if it's a desperate attempt to climb to the peak. I feel a subtle sensation that grows with every push and every pull of his cock against my tight walls, squeezing him to his peak. He lowers himself to plant a kiss on my lips that is long and very passionate. I moan even louder, but with his mouth on mine, my moans are muffled. I can only try to fight the titling of his head left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe then experience it, together. When he grips my body hard, I do the same, and it's due to the muscles down south that squeezes against the foreign flesh. A sensation much better than the pain of getting my cherry poppy, courses through my whole body, with my pussy as its epicenter. It does this for longer than fifteen seconds and does not dissipate minutes after. I feel like I'm in a sexual high that causes me to fall limp in John's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cock inside had erupted, spilling its hot liquid into my vagina, mixing in with the pleasurable sensations I was feeling. John collapses onto me, squeezing my breasts against his chest as he comes down. When we separate our kiss, he's grunting and groaning with a smile on his face and he delivers a barrage of kisses onto my body after making out passionate moments before. I tease him with my legs wrapped around his body, keeping him buried inside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was your first time?\u201d he asks, squeezing one of my breasts in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncredible. I can say that it's much better than what you felt. I still feel the waves crashing over me. You should try it one of these days,\u201d I say and finish with a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I'll pass. I think I'd like to buried myself inside someone rather than have on inside me. Plus, you make a good partner,\u201d he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I...no, we made it,\u201d I state. \u201cShould we come out of hiding now that we've done what was asked of us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes John and I finish the task?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud noise similar to a battering ram knocking through a door is heard and both the woman and I look behind us to see Tyrone's father entering the room pulling behind him an Asian woman whose hands are tied and connected to the rope he's pulling. With his strength, he easily yanks the woman within his reach and grabs her. \"Don't be shy, Rhianna,\" he mockingly says and pushes her onto the bed. By the looks of it, the woman looks tired, but fortunately she's clothed, but in risque apparel. Tyrone's dad catches sight of us and says, \"Well, look what we have here. I know you,\" he says, pointing at me, \"but you... Don't tell me. Is that you, Ricardo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen hearing his name, the woman who my father turned into hides behind me, clutching my shoulders. \"Mike, I can explain,\" she says, but with panic in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need. Rhianna, or Tyrone, whatever you want to call her, can tell you that if you have a fraction of doubt when using the glove, the powers backfire. My good-for-nothing son tried to change me but ended up making himself look like this,\" Mike says to us. \"I should've told you, but you wanted to get in bed with her, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to look back at my father's female face but she whispers, \"That's not true, Ces. He's lying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've known you ever since we met in high school. I know how thirsty you can be. You've been thristy ever since your wife left you,\" Mike says. \"Call it karma. Now you look like that now. Sexy, sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, Mike,\" she curses back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not me, but you. Fuck you. But the question is who will do it to you? Me? Or my friends and brothers?\" he asks in rhetoric questions, but after his last is spoken, two black men enter the room. They round Mike and take a seat on the two armchairs near the window. More men come in too. Three in fact, but one of them is none other than Sonya's father. He, unlike the two additional black men, is being held with his hands pinned behind his back. Yet another man, this one bigger than the first four comes in with the glove on his hand. Without warning, he slaps Sonya's father with the glove, knocking the wind out of him but also the man as well. Before our eyes, Bruce, falls to the floor and ends up becoming a woman with brown hair. His clothes sink and reform to fit the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father's small hand clutches my arms a bit more harder. Somehow I can sense the fear in her. One of the men holding Sonya's father, who now is a young woman, carries her out of the room. The man with the glove takes it off his hand and hands it to Mike. \"Who knew a simple glove like this could make a bunch of men into so many beautiful women,\" he says to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" my father's higher-pitched voice asks. I can hear a shudder in her voice as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to do what men continue to do. I shall care for you, be dominant for you and all you have to do is submit,\" Mike tells us. \"What better way than to let us fuck you. Don't worry. There is enough for everybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we refuse?\" my father's female voice promptly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. We kick you out. But consider your options here,\" Mike begins. \"You've been changed into women, but to the rest of the world, people still think you are the men you once were. If we kick you out, you'll have nothing. No identification. No money. No clothes. Now listen to me. Where else can you support yourselves? Offer your voluptuous bodies to men for money?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider the alternative. Submit to any of my friend or brothers and he will agree to provide for you money, food, clothes, shelter. All you have to do is submit. If he wants his laundry cleaned, you better learn to do it and do it well. If he wants you to cook dinner, learn something and cook him dinner. If he wants you to suck his dick or allow him to put his dick in your pussy or even your ass, you better well try it and do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't, then there will be another alternative. If you choose the second option, but fail to submit, he has every right to punish you. He may keep you and punish you himself, or he can do it another way. It's his choice. So what do you choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cesar, isn't it? How about Rosario? It's a prettier name. Why don't you choose first? Otherwise, your sister here can have first dibs. What do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I first look at the condition Rhianna is in. How was it for her? Yeah, at first it was a punishment to have Tyrone turned into a woman, but Asian like me? Did she submit? Or did she not? I play out either scenario. I can see it now. She submits, but regardless of her choice, she still gets punished by a fucking. In the other scenario, she submits, but soon after, she refuses to submit and disobey and then she gets the fucking punishment, but in a more intense way. I just hope whoever I end up with is good to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll submit,\" I say and step up. In doing so, the sheet around me falls from my body reveal my very petite, very sexy body, according to the eyes of all the men in the room. Their eyes widen as well as their mouths, which begin to salivate as if I'm a piece of meat. Well, that's what Mike has rendered us now. Either we're a piece of meat to him and his brothers, or we're a piece of meat left out to rot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl. I shall reward you with Quentin,\" he says and points out the taller of all the men in the room. He is at least a foot taller than me, maybe even another half a foot taller. He sports tattoos on his arms, which like his chest is very muscular. \"Just remember, submit and you'll be cared for. Disobey, then he has every right to punish you. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod as I approach the giant with my arms crossed over my chest. The big black man takes one of my hands and caresses it. In one swoop, he gathers me into his arms and he carries me out of the room. Someone closes the door and whatever fate my father female body has is left unknown to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuentin carries me down the hallway to the other bedrooms. Along the way, I find Sonya and her father's now-female body lying on the floor of the living room. Two men watch over them. Quentin passes by a room with two Latina women laying on a bed. Two men are also in the room keeping close watch over them as well. He goes down to the last room that sits at the very end of the hallway. It's none other than my room. He carries me to the bed and gently sits me down on the edge of it. He goes over to the door and closes it, probably to give us some privacy. When he does, I take a pillow and use it to cover my nakedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe evidently sees my reluctance and asks me, \"You nervous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try not to be rude and be silent, so I answer, \"Kinda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. It's weird how everything happened like this. You could say it was Tyrone's fault in the first place, but my cousin has always been a hoodlum. I guess him turning into a woman wasn't what he was expecting,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI somehow get a sense of comfort from Quentin and at his saying that he's Tyrone's cousin, I ask, \"Wait, you're his cousin? I thought his cousin was tall and fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. I'm that cousin,\" he says. I remember his cousin being very chubby, even at the end of senior year. His cousin was in the same year, but went to a different high school. He even had a beard and a afro as well, which would explain me not recognizing him and his clean shaven face and his fade haircut. \"I've seen you in his circle before, but then, now you're like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see a glimpse of a thirsty look on Quentin face and I avert my gaze. He actually catches this and reassures me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to my uncle. Ever since he found the power of the glove, he's been power-hungry. He felt turning everyone into women would make him more powerful, but that's just the feeling he gets. I'm different, I think. I don't think I would be sadistic if you make a mistake or disobey me. I won't be like my uncle and toss you to his friend like he did Rhianna,\" he says and I dart my look at the addressing of the name. \"It was unreal actually. Him bringing home a naked Asian woman and inviting his brother and friend over to fuck her. She didn't even get a chance to submit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why should I submit to you, then, if he didn't give Rhianna that chance?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should because he has control of the glove. Ever since he used it on the dad of Carlos, he sort of changed. I think everyone, even his friends and brothers is scared of him,\" he tells me. \"Be smart with how you behave. Behind closed door, you can act however you want, but when you are in his presence, you better be a good girl. But don't worry, I won't be like that to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he says, but for some reason, I can't quite seem to get around to believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I like it better when I have to submit like it's my duty and not my choice,\" I say to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" he says, and my eyes widen to the fact that he does understand. \"It's hard for you to act in a certain way and it's much easier when it's expected of you. Alright. Then if that's so, you can start by letting me fuck you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's werid. When he demands it, something in me is relieved that I have to perform not out of choice, but that it's expected from me. Just how does he want me to perform?</span></div></div>",

He reassures me by changing up his speech and laughing about it. \u201cSorry. Yes, it sounds awkward, but consider that it's not me you're submitting to, but my uncle. He's the one with the glove, not me. Just think that when you're serving me, you're in fact obeying him. Now, try again. How would you respond to this, 'You can start by giving me a blowjob.'?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Sir,\u201d I say while also lowering myself to my knees. With him standing before me, my face is now in line with his crotch, the top of my head meeting up with the waistband of his sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood girl,\u201d he says, rewarding me by swiping my bangs from my face. \u201cDo you know why I want you to start with a blowjob and not with my face in your pussy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pause to think about the question, which gives me times to lift my hands and place it on the waistband of Quentin's sweatpants. My finger dig underneath the thicker fabric of the sweats as well as the thinner waistband of his underwear and slowly pull both down towards is feet. I speak up, giving him my answer in the form of a question, \u201cI'm to put you first and myself second?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's a good answer,\u201d he tells me and then explains his reasoning. \u201cI can assure you that what I command you to do is for your sake. I do not want to put you in my cousin's position, where he had no choice. I know it may sound awkward, but you are beautiful from head to toe. I say it's a waste to put you in Tyrone's place. Better for you to start with the work first and once all the work is done, you get your reward.\u201d I consider his work and reward metaphor. \u201cI can see you're nothing like my cousin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, I've pulled his pants and underwear down to mid-thigh, revealing his half-limp, half-erect manhood. As I see it grow before my eyes, inches from my face, I feel a feeling of both fear and wonder. The wonder is from how large and thick it is as it hardens in my hands. Something urges me to reach out and grab it and squeeze it. As all the limpness disappears and the cock stands erect at seven or more inches, the fear sets in. In a few moments, Quentin will want to put this inside me. Maybe it was good for him to allow me to moisten his dick with my saliva first rather than letting him fuck me raw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, you do know what you gotta do, right Rosario?\u201d Quentin asks as he looks down at me. I nod and gradually put the tip of the cock closer to my mouth. I pause and take a deep breath, anxious of what's about to happen. I assume the taste of his dick is going to be terrible on my tongue and my mouth would be filled bigger than any bite I would take of anything edible. During my reverie, he suggests, \u201cDon't worry about taking it all in. Just go slow and use that tongue of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take another deep breath and open my mouth to take in the engorged head of is cock. Once it hits my tongue, I groan at how awful it tastes. Not only is it a bit bitter, its taste makes me want to gag. I should be fortunate that though it is warm in my mouth, its stench prevents me from sinking my teeth into the dark flesh. Following his advice, I move my tongue around the underside of the cock, feeling every vein, every natural bump and curve. Every other second I'm on the verge of gagging, but I try to keep it in hopes I would get used to this soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember, use that tongue and get your saliva over everything. It should take all the smell off when you swallow it,\u201d Quentin guides me but also prevents me from giving up. If it weren't for his large hands holding my head on his dick, I would have pulled off of his manhood sooner. \u201cJust breathe, baby. Swallow and breathe.\u201d I pause and take a deep breath while having his large cock head in my mouth. After I breathe in and exhale through my nose, I swallow the mixture of my saliva and whatever dried substances was on his dick to begin with (not limited to pre-cum, sweat, or piss). The mixture leaves me with a terrible after-taste, but with this monster in my mouth, my salivary glands continue to produce saliva that I use to coat every crevice on his cock. The saliva not only provide a way to wash off the substances on his cock, but it also is a means of lubrication that slowly allows the dick to slide more and more into my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI assume at least three inches of his cock has penetrated my mouth when the tip reaches the back of my throat. By then, his hand have let go of my head and hang at his sides. Ten long minutes have passed and by my work alone, using my saliva and my tongue, I've managed to clean most of what I've been able to fit into my mouth. With Quentin's hands gone, I'm free to remove my mouth from the tip, but finding cock sucking as hard, but enjoyable work, I continue servicing his cock with no protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my tongue saturates the rest of his cock with saliva, I forget that I was a man hours prior. I forget about the glove changing me into this sexy woman. Heck, I forget that I was somewhat coerced into the hands of a tall, dark and rather handsome black man by Tyrone's uncle. I do consider what my life would be like if I chose to leave rather than submit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next during my time with Quentin?</span></div></div>",

I thought you said there was enough to go around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want my gift, girl? With these two, you can get twice the attention.

Well, suit yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men seated in the armchairs gets up and they each take a hold of both my arms. I struggle, but it's not use. The strength I have up against two of a dominant gender? Even though I know it's impossible to overthrow them, I still struggle and whine. They both hold me against the closet door and allow Mike to continue speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You son-turned-sister is not setting a good example, girl,\" he says to my father's naked body, who clutches the sheet to her body even tighter. \"Why don't you give submission a try, since you are the older sister?\" He unzips his pants and reveals to her a long black shaft of flesh. \"Why don't you set a good a example and I'll think about lessening the punishment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a long time for my dad-turned-sister to consider the situation. After what seems like fifteen minutes, she steps forward, letting the sheet fall from her body and gets on her hands and knees. Wihtout touching it with her hands, she takes the member into her mouth and starts to suck on it. I see her gag for a second, but she keeps the dick in her mouth as she slides it deeper and deeper into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's what I like to see, but the thing is, I'm taken,\" Mike says. \"As his... no, her... father, it's my responsibility to take care of this fine ass here.

He gets her to her feet without any struggle. He wraps an arm around her and escorts her out of the room, with me and Wes following after. Wes closes the door behind him.

Remember, me and my boys can provide for everything you need--\" he reminds me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure, Sir,\" I say, hoping that by adding an honorific title, I could somehow get some help before I leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.

I go to the bundle that is set down on the bed and begin to separate it. The first piece is a panty, black and made of what I assume is satin. I put it on first to cover up my crotch and give me a small sense of privacy. The second garment I pick out is a matching black bra, which at first I struggle to put on my torso. I also find it awkward, but indeed necessary for me to position my arms a certain way so I can fasten the hooks behind my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these undergarments on, what are the outer garments that I pick out from the pile?</span></div></div>",

I put it on and find that they are a bit snug around the waist and rear, but since my hips are wide and ass fairly prominent, there's no reason why they are tight. The pants have a bit of bagginess as it flows down to my ankle, where it stops with a sinched band at the bottom. The last piece of clothing is a pair of platform heels where the heel and the platform is colored with a shiny chrome. I put it on and find that it is overwhelmed with these studded straps. But that's it. No shirt or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, girl, now that you've put on your gift, you are free to leave,\" Mike says to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a shirt?\" I ask, rather rudely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike grabs my arm and scolds me, \"You demand a shirt? Didn't I tell you that we would provide for you clothing and then some if you just be submissive with us? I thought you wanted to leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, but I need a---\" I start, but Mike interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shirt? You don't need a shirt. That outfit you rocking is fine as fuck. Now since I'm only going to let you leave once, you might as well take this chance to get on out of here,\" Mike says and drags me to the front door. He opens it to reveal that it's getting dark outside. I didn't even notice hours before. \"Alright, girl, there you go. Freedom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" I protest, but it's no use. Mike easily pushes me out the door. \"What about the other girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I specifically only heard that you wanted to leave. If the other girls want to leave with you, they would have to choose to do so, but at the moment, it's just you,\" he says and with that, he closes the door shut on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have no choice but to leave the house alone. Inside is my father-turned-sister and my roommates as well as a bunch of black men who look to have much more power physically over them. As much as I want to stay and support them, I'm finally out of the house. I start to weigh the choices I have made and the one that strikes the most is that I'm without a roof oer my head and a source of income. I have no bed to sleep in and in the very least, I'm without a shirt or coat to protect me from the wind that blows through the neighborhood. I can knock and pound on the door for them to let me in, but I realize it won't do any good. I've made my choice and it seems Mike takes things very literally. I doubt he will let me back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start to walk the other way, towards the street and straight onto the sidewalk. I'm wondering if a neighbor of mine would take in an unrecognizable young woman dressed as I am. I wonder if I should expect a welcome with open arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother cold breeze blows through and I cross my arm across my chest in order to warm myself up. The street is quiet, mostly because it's the weekend. Only a couple cars pass by, but they don't see a lone young woman who is half-naked in the dark. It's when I walk underneath a street light where I hear brakes squeal and an engine of a car near me. The curb nearest me is empty and the car parks. I try not to react and look at the car or its occupants. Someone calls out to me and I turn to the voice in response. To whom does the voice belong to and what is he or she driving?</span></div></div>",

You could say it caught my ear and caused me to turn, but it was actually the man's voice that called out from an open window that caught my attention. He wasn't trying to holler at me, which was what I expected him to do. He actually was concerned for me, though this is what I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, miss, are you lost?\" he says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stop to turn and face him. I take in the car and then the man inside and respond, \"Not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you cold? I could let you in and I can take you where you need to go,\" he says and offers me a ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks,\" I say, though I do realize I say it rather rudely. I turn on my heel to continue on my way, but an inconvenient breeze blows against me, making me more cold and causing me to visibly shiver. The man sees this even from his side in the car and he gets out and offers me a coat that's too big for me to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear, put this on,\" he says, holding the jacket, which is adorned with race sponsors, ready for me to slip my arms into the sleeves. I wait and pause, looking the guy over. In the dark of his car, it looks like he was a stranger, but when illuminated by the street light, I recognize him as one of a more friendly seniors I met when I first got into high school. He was also my senior when we both went to the same college. He was totally into cars and it seems he never grew out of that fascination. I almost admired him for it. No here I am, unconsciously admiring his manners as I admire his ride. His voice kicks me out of my reverie. \"You'll get sick if you don't bundle up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stick one of my arms into the appropriate sleeve and allow him to offer me the second sleeve. He lets the jacket go and I zip up the zipper to cover my exposed chest. \"Thanks,\" I say, though still with an attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" he responds, as if my rudeness or attitude didn't faze him. \"So why a girl like you half-naked walking outside at a time like this? You live around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis prior kindness has somehow got me talking. I tell him the truth. \"I was kinda kicked out of the house by my roommate's boyfriend,\" I tell him. \"I couldn't get a jacket in time, so...\" Right then I realize my excuse of an answer wasn't that any good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it seems either this guy is too smart or too gullible to not accept my answer. \"You have a place to stay? Like a neighbor or a family member?\" he asks. I kind of get the hint that he's not here to sweep me off my feet. I don't feel like he is attracted to me and he wants to bed me as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI answer as if I'm telling the truth, even though it's all lies. \"I just moved here a month ago. Most of my family lives up north,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad. I could take you to my place, but I'm in between apartments, so I live out of my garage,\" he tells me. No wonder he didn't seem like the type of guy who was a player. He was being honest and down to earth and was sort of ashamed to tell me about his living arrangements. Somehow, I'm beginning to like this guy, and not just from someone who used to be a guy. I'm starting to admiring him as a member of the opposite sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to hear about that,\" I apologize. \"I think I was being rude before because I thought you were a player who so happens to have a nice car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" he tells me. \"This is sort of my home at the moment.\" An awkward silence sets in and none of us says anything. The only thing we hear is crickets chirping over the low hum from the muffler. He then suddenly speaks up. \"If you don't have a place to stay, maybe you can crash at my sister's place. She won't let a guy like me sleep in her apartment, but since you're a girl, she'll probably let you sleep over. How's that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounds really fortunate. Should I consider myself lucky for meeting this guy right after being kicked out of the house? \"I think it's sounds okay,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. We just have to meet her so we can tell her. That way she can prepare a place for you,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do we meet this guy's sister?</span></div></div>",

Plus the place where she work at is loud, and she's usually too busy to answer a call,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she work at a club?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorta, but I wouldn't call it a club to her face,\" he answers. \"You'll see once we get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drives out of the neighborhood and straight onto the highway. We drive for what seems like fifteen minutes on the highway before he exits to a street lined with stores with mostly neon signs. It's like a little Vegas strip. There's also something I notice. Most of the signs are in English, but the rest are in different languages. By the looks of it, this is sort of an Asian community.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy drives into a packed parking lot near what looks like a grocery store that caters to both Americans and Asians alike. Most of the stores lining the buildings are closed except for one. A big lighted sign is illuminated above the entrance. From what I could make out, the place is a cafe and it's where the guy parks the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here alright,\" he says and exits the car walks up to the entrance. A large black man who works as a security guard greets him and gives him a fist bump before going in. I can barely see into the glass windows, probably due to the curtains or blinds, but there are lights inside that illuminate through the partitions with various colors, most of them changing into different colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes I see the guy come out of the cafe and he walks over to my door and opens it. He says to me, \"Hey, so I talked to my sister, but she says she needs to talk to you personally. Don't worry, she doesn't bite, but she's a bit mad because I showed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI exit out the car and allow him to help me up the curb to the entrance. The security guard shows a grin and nods at us as we enter the door he opens for us. The sounds of sports games, men cheering, people talking, blenders churning and glasses clinking are heard all at once. Electronic dance music fills the rest of the silence, but it doesn't overpower or fully fill up the cafe. Before me is a unusual scene. Most men and a few women sit at the tables drinking what I would say is iced coffee beverages. Waiting tables and carrying drinks to and from tables are women clad in nothing but lingerie. And since, this cafe is in a Asian community, most of the waitresses are Asian as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI follow the guy down an aisle to a pair of open doors that lead into a kitchen lit up by bright flourescent lights. More women clad in lingerie are inside with aprons on and they mix and blend the drinks that are being served. He leads me to one of them who mixes drinks in one corner of the kitchen. \"Hey Jen, here she is,\" he says to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman is beautiful in every place, but most especially with her face and hair. Even with an angry mood about her, she is strikingly attractive. She looks up from her duties and looks me over. \"You found her walking half-naked in the street?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not what you think. I told you she was kicked out of her place and she doesn't have anywhere to stay. Can she crash at your place?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't let strangers stay at my place,\" she bluntly says. \"Which is why I don't let you stay at my place too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please give her a chance,\" the guy pleads with the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathes a sigh, probably out of annoyance and pours the drink she was mixing into a pristine glass mug. She hands the cup to a passing waitress and then leans onto the counter she is working at. She takes a minute to deliberate in her head before pushing up on the counter. \"Alright, but just one night. Plus, I need you to get out of kitchen, take a seat somewhere, you're in the way of the girls,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sis,\" he says and promptly turns on his heel and leaves. I turn on my heel too, but I'm quickly stopped by her voice calling out to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, you stay, I want to talk to you,\" she demands. I turn back to face her and continues. \"You his girlfriend?\" I shake my head. \"You a prostitute or a whore?\" I shake my head, more fervently than the last. \"Good, cuz I don't deal with skanks or the love interests of my little brother.\" She walks away from her counter and goes around me to the middle of the kitchen. \"Hey Lady! I'm taking a break.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman dressed in a ornate gown that shows off both thigh adorned with dark stockings steps into the kitchen from the main room. She finds me standing next to her and looks me over from head to toe. She looks back to the woman who called her out and gesture her to go, \"Sure, take your time.\" After giving her permission, she gives me one more look before leaving to tend to her duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me,\" the woman says and leads me to the back. We enter a room that has lockers on one side and make up stations on the other, complete with salon lights and mirrors. After closing the door, she tells me, \"Alright, I'm only letting you crash at my place because my little brother asks, but I have a few conditions. First, is to look the coat and pants. Everything else you leave on.\" I turn my head to the side and take in how awkward the demand is. She catches my delay and reprimands me. \"You've seen the place, girl, and anyone can look at you and say that you're a bit overdressed. Not lost the coat and pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do as she says and take off the coat, revealing the bra I wear underneath. I hand the coat over to her and promptly take a seat to first remove my heels before slipping off my pants. Once done, i fold the pair neatly and hand it to her as well. I then slip my feet into the heels and fasten them once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand and she then demands, \"Alright, pace from here to there,\" and points out an imaginary line from the door to the far wall. I do so as naturally as I can. When I come back to her, she points out, \"Something feels weird about you. I don't know if you're nervous or haven't worn heels before. The stuff you do is like how a guy does it, but that shouldn't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I say, \"So what does matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What matters is this: Have you worked as a waitress before?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit, but not that much,\" I answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, do you know how to mix coffee-based drinks or smoothies?\" she continues to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" I say. \"What are you trying to get at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get off in about an hour, but it's been a busy night. I could use some help in the kitchen, unless you think you can take on waiting tables,\" she tells me. \"All I'm saying is that you look good in that set. You fill out naturally and you're gorgeous, but beauty's not going to help with what the cafe serves.\" She leaves me to hang the coat on a hook and stuff the pants in an occupied locker. When she comes back, she asks. \"So, have you made up your mind? An hour will go by fast, but the downside is, you won't get paid, but that's obvious because you're not an employee... yet. The good thing is most girl go through lots of screening and two interviews to get to this point. So what will it be?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I almost halt myself, which risks me spilling the drinks, when I see the guy who picked me up and provided me his coat, sitting at the booth with another man, who\u2019s dressed in a dark dress suit. My female eyes see him and declare him handsome. They look my way and smile and I smile back, either out of instinct or fear. I put the glasses on the table, in front of each patron, which gives each guy a chance to speak to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she eventually had to put you to work?\u201d the guy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friend speaks up, talking to him, \u201cWho, Jen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, in exchange for her to be allowed to crash at her place, Jen gave her a job,\u201d he replies, which gives me my cue to leave. \u201cWait. Why don\u2019t you stay and chat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give my answer straight and rather rushed in a way. \u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d I abruptly say, which gives me more time to turn on my heel and walk back to the kitchen. I also run into the owner of the place, who silently gawks at me as I pass and say to her, \u201cExcuse me,\u201d in the most polite way possible. I manage to get back into the kitchen with another order in the works on Jen\u2019s counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe somehow sees a certain expression on my face and asks, \u201cMy little bro is sitting at the corner booth, right?\u201d I nod. \u201cThat little bitch. First he comes in looking to find you a place to stay, which I\u2019m not bothered about, I assure you, but then he stays around and not only torments me but just has to see you. You find that annoying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit,\u201d I simply say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, sometimes,\u201d she starts, but she pays attention to her work. \u201cSay, I didn\u2019t get your name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start to think and try to muster up something I can use, but my delay turns out to be too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind, tell me later, here\u2019s your next one. Table 1 next to the entrance. You\u2019ll see it,\u201d she tells me and hands me two plastic cups with cold smoothies inside along with tapioca sphere floating at the bottom. \u201cThis one is passion fruit,\u201d she points at the orange-colored one with slightly more tapioca balls, or boba, at the bottom, \u201cand this one is strawberry,\u201d she points to the pinkish smoothie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn on my heel again and head to the main room. I find the entrance and eventually table one which is situated near the hostess\u2019s booth. Seated at the table is a couple, a man and a woman dressed as if they did a late night workout. I approach the table and set the drinks down on the table. I speak up, my higher-pitched voice ringing about the table. \u201cI have a passion fruit smoothie with boba,\u201d I say and put the corresponding drink onto the table. The woman reaches out her hand and pulls it to her side of the table. \u201cAnd here\u2019s the strawberry smoothie with extra boba.\u201d Knowing there\u2019s only one other person at the table, I set it down nearest to the guy, who happily takes it and thanks me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we also get two hot black teas as well?\u201d the woman asks before I leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not actually a waiter, but\u2026 I think I\u2019ll let someone know,\u201d I say, as if my past experience as a waiter had supported me, even in this new body. I walk back towards the kitchen and find a woman at what looks like a touchscreen. I let her know, \u201cUm, table one wants to order two hot black teas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she says without looking at me. I decide to leave and head back to Jen when the woman grabs my arm. \u201cWait, I\u2019m not done with you. Brewing tea doesn\u2019t take that long, since we have hot water on standby. Just wait here and we\u2019ll brew up two cups of black tea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do as she says and wait for the order to be finished. She stays at the touchscreen as if she\u2019s mesmerized by it. \u201cSo, are you new?\u201d she then asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just helping out with Jen,\u201d I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Cuz after watching you for ten minutes, it looks like you\u2019ve done this before,\u201d she responds, but this time, stops what\u2019s she\u2019s doing on the screen and turns to look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve waited tables before,\u201d I simply say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head a little and scoffs at my response. \u201cNot that kind of waiting. It looks like you\u2019ve worked at another caf\u00e9 like this before. Not to mention you\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d she tells me. I don\u2019t know whether to take that as a compliment or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can respond or say anything else, a girl from the kitchen come by and presents two saucers with two ceramic cups with hot tea inside. I take the saucers and with a nod toward both women, I take my leave.<br>\r\nI head back to the table that just ordered and put the saucers on the table. Before I can leave, the woman thanks me and asks, \u201cHey, are you a model?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not, actually,\u201d I reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCuz you look like you do modeling. You got the right body for it,\u201d she tells me. \u201cYou should try it out some time.\u201d I nod with a smile, vaguely telling her that I\u2019ll consider it and turn around and walk back to the kitchen.<br>\r\nIt\u2019s at the threshold of the kitchen where I meet\u2026?</span></div></div>",

You're not in trouble or anything, it's that she doesn't want someone who she doesn't know to be working here when trouble comes along,\" she tells me. \"She told me that I could leave early so I can take you home, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I simply say and follow her back to the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, she gets the coat and pants where she had stored them and gives them to me. As I change back into the clothes, she asks, \"So how was everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was okay, I guess. Not too hard,\" I tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was talking to the other girls as well as the owner. They like how you look. Didn't I tell you you were gorgeous? It's just the owner is a bit reluctant with new girls. But she doesn't even train us. We either get tips from the other girls who have worked her longer or we just learn as we go. It seemed you did a bit of both tonight,\" she tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe finish changing and head out to leave, when we meet her little brother and his friend waiting for us at the threshold. The man in the dress suit asks us, though more towards Jen than me, \"Do you need a ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see Jen's face change into one that's sour and she replies, \"No thanks.

When I don't give her one, she tells me, \u201cWe have a secret here at Cafe 8. We do not wash dishes until after the night is done. We just rinse the blenders and that's it. And there are blenders just for tea and milk tea and there are blenders for coffee. And most of the drinks are served in recyclable cups, since most customers do not stay at this late hour.\u201d She looks at the sink where a mass of glasses and blenders are carefully put in, just to be rinsed by one of the girls. \u201cNow that I think of it, I wouldn't really trust a newbie with waiting tables or worse, interacting with the customers. If you do wash the dishes, the cafe can finish up earlier that usual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I can put my clothes back on?\u201d I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou kidding me? I guess it's true when they say 'dumb broad.' I don't think you've noticed yet that everyone that works here, not only the waitresses and the drink makers wear this kind of outfit, even those working in the kitchen. That includes the dishwasher. You could change your mind and be a waitress who works in the warmer parts of the cafe, because besides being in the cold kitchen, you're gonna get wet washing dishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be in the public eye exposing my new unfamiliar body to strangers, I say, \u201cI'll just start washing then.\u201d I don't wait for her to show me what to do, since it does look self-explanatory. Half of the large sink is filled with both glasses and blenders, though fortunately, they are arranged neatly by type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start by putting on some rubber gloves and begin by rinsing everything in one sink with the jet hose. Once most of the beverage substances that these containers used to contain have been washed away, I grab the sponge and start soaping up the glasses, putting soaped glasses into the second sink. Like the first sink, I try to arrange the glasses in the second sink in the same manner, by shape and size. Once all of the glasses have been soaped, I move on to the heavier blenders, each one taking more time to soap than the smaller individual glasses. At the gloves I'm wearing provide me enough friction so that they do not slip from my grasp. I arrange the blenders in whatever space is left in the second sink. With the floor of the second sink now full, I move on to the jet hose and I change the spray from a jet to a more broader shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen using the jet mode of the hose, water sprays reflected off the glasses and blenders are strong enough to come spraying back at me. By the time I get to rinse the soap off the glasses and blenders in the other sink, both my bra and panties are soaked, more so with my bra. With the chill of the air conditioning blowing in the kitchen, I'd get an occasional breeze blowing over the water and sweat on my skin, causing me to shiver. At least the water I'm using is warm and I'm more relieved than suffering when I do get sprayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue washing the dishes, getting help from girls who have ended their work in the lounge of the cafe, who assist in drying and putting away both the glasses and blenders. After a good hour or so, all of the dishes have been rinses, soaped, rinsed again, dried and put away into their respective places. I take off the gloves and put them back where I found them and find a seat where I could rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the warm of a jacket covers my back and my arms and I turn around to see who has placed the comfort on my body. It's none other than the woman who gave me a choice on what to do. Of course I don't remember her name. She also hands me a chilled glass of water and leaves me to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the kitchen start to empty, as the girls, now dressed in normal clothes, bid their farewells and leave. It's not long after closing when the only girls in the cafe is myself and that guy's older sister. She takes me back to where the lockers are and gives me back my pants. She gets dressed herself and waits for me to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't get your name, girl,\u201d she says to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCe... Rosario,\u201d I make up a name for myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she replies, drawing out the word like she doesn't believe that Rosario is my name. \u201cAnyways, you must be tired and cold from walking out with just your bra on. What's up with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was--\u201d I try to reiterate what I told her younger brother, but she cuts me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know, you were kicked out by your roommate's boyfriend, but something doesn't add up,\u201d she says. \u201cAt least if you're going to be kicked out, why not grab a jacket on your way out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like she won't believe the story I told her brother. What should I tell her?</span></div></div>",

She doesn't reply but stays quiet with an expression that she'll listen. \u201cI didn't use to be like this. You know of the term, human trafficking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness,\u201d she says with a shocked gasp and covers her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm a special case. I was not born a woman. I used to be a man named Cesar, but when I was 18, I was kidnapped and had something done to me that I did not volunteer for. Don't ask me what specifically because I was out for the whole procedure. When I woke up, I found myself in this body and in a house of an older man. He...\u201d I trail off, considering the potential torment I would experience at the hands of Mike and his men. I imagine my made up story to be true so much, that when I do trail off, my voice break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, Jen closes in and embraces me, telling me, \u201cDon't say anymore. I can't imagine what you must have been through, I'm sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's okay,\u201d I say, shuddering as if I'm on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's go, you must be tired and probably hungry,\u201d she says and gets me to my feet. We leave the cafe through the front door and are met with the woman's younger brother. He starts the car and wait for the woman to turn off the lights and lock the door. He allows the both of us girls to get in, myself riding in the back. The man drives us to the woman's apartment. It's quiet along the way. We actually drive past the opening of my neighborhood and enter a hilly residential area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe arrive at a hilltop apartment complex and the man leaves without any protest. I assume he is going back to his garage where he said he sleeps. The woman leads me up a short flight of concrete steps towards one building, where we go up another flight of steps to a door with the number 10 on it. She unlocks the door and enters, turning on the lights. I enter after her and see a rather messy apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about the mess,\u201d she says and starts picking up clothes from the floor and gathering them into a laundry basket she gets from one of the rooms. \u201cI let one of my photographer friends use my living room for one of his shoots. It was supposed to be a messy theme. You can go into my room and take a shower if you'd like. I'm going to get my brother to get some food for us,\u201d she explains, pointing out the room she just took a basket from. I take her direction and make my way to the room, closing the door behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn on the lights and find a rather large assortment of clothes as well as high heels. Just looking at them makes me want to discard the ones I'm wearing and try them on, but as a courtesy, I stop and look for the door to the bathroom. I find it and turn on the light in the bathroom, revealing a counter full of beauty products. Of course the faces that all the girls wear in the cafe are full of make up, prettying their eyes and lips and covering the bare face underneath. I realize, in this form, I would eventually have to become a woman. With no access to \u201cthe glove,\u201d I have no choice but to become a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find the shower and once I close the bathroom door, I start to undress and once again find myself naked. I realize that unlike the owner of this apartment, my face is more or less bare. I may have the long lashes, but I lack the eyeshadow, mascara, blush or lipstick. I try not to let it get me, so I hurry into the shower and turn on the water. The water is cold for a brief moment before it warms up enough to produce steam and cloud up the semi-transparent glass of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let the waterfall soak my hair and my whole body and for once, I can relax and be free from the thoughts of Mike and his black friends. Somehow my made up story of how I was turned into a woman and put in the care of Mike who had abused me sexually had affected me earlier, even if it was just a fabrication, but that made up past is forgotten in the heat of the water cascading over my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even five minutes pass when I hear my made up name being called from behind the closed bathroom door. \u201cRosario?\u201d the woman addresses me. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm unsure why she'd want to invade my privacy like this, but should I let her in?</span></div></div>",

Consider it an extra gift.\u201d I unfold each of the small garments that I had grabbed and I'm shocked to find that it's none other than a tank top and a pair of short denim shorts. I look up at Mike and find him snickering at me. \u201cI'm a man of second chances and I'm willing to give you all the chances you need to change your mind. Maybe I can sweeten the offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d I ask as I put on the tanktop. Its white color is in contrast with the black bra underneath and the fabric's thin enough that the bra shows through the tanktop. Also, the tanktop is short and ends an inch or two above my belly button, showing off my midriff. The bra does more than support my breasts and emphasizes a clear cleavage that can be seen with the tanktop's semi-circle collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll give you a choice of one of two additional offers along with the promise of shelter, clothing and enjoyment,\u201d Mike says and explains further. \u201cChoose to stay and you can pick any of my negro brothers to be your partner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the other option?\u201d I ask, as I put on the short denim shorts. The legs of the garment are so short that the front pockets are exposed, showing up like flaps or flippers. Wear my legs go through, the hems are frayed and when they are fully on, they expose a bit of my butt, emphasizing how larger and wider my ass and hips are, respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChoose to stay and we'll let your sister stay with you with one partner,\u201d Mike tells me and I look towards my sister and whoever is holding her still. She still has the sheet we used to cover ourselves. By now, the two of us are the only ones who have yet to make a decision. All the other men-turned-girls, save for Rhianna, have made a decision to stay. Their submission is reluctant and the men accordingly punish them, though not severely, since this is their first time. \u201cSo, Rosario. Yes, stick with that name.

When he gets closer, the rebellious side of me causes me to avoid his eyes, but luckily I don't get a strike to my face, as I would expect. Instead, he runs his fingers along my arms, tracing lines to my shoulders, to my collarbones, around my neck and then one hand up to run his fingers into my hair. \u201cSee, that wasn't so bad, was it?\u201d he asks, forcing me to look up at him by tilting my head backwards. \u201cSo a promise is a promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns me around so that I can face the rest of the room. During my choosing of my outfit that was supposed be a parting gift from Mike had I kept with my decision to leave, more men and women had entered. I recognized Sonya and her dad-turned-sister, who were with their partners in the corner of the room. The both of them had their pants off and were made to make out with each other while their respective black men fucked them from behind. Nearby, Rhianna, who used to be Tyrone, was lifted into the air and held in the arms of two black men, who impaled her pussy and ass from underneath. Their were two women who I did not recognize, but I had a sinking feeling that I knew who they were. Some intuition told me they were none other than Ricky and his father. Ricky, who now sported wavy hair colored in a dark red, was eagerly allowing her black partner access to her backdoor. Her father, who had blue hair in the same amount of luminosity, was nearby, serving her black partner by giving him a blowjob, while it ran through the valley of her large breasts. Half of the room was in an orgy-like state, while the other half simply watched or were looking toward the direction of me or my sister. Their eyes were that of primal hunters, not of observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see, all of the other girls save for you and your sister have partners. Since you are family, I'm extending my generosity to your sister... sorry Wes,\u201d he says and when he finishes, apologizes to the man holding my sister, who leaves her and goes to sit with the other black men watching from the other side of the room. \u201cSo, just so you know who you are picking, I'll introduce you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom left to right, he proceeds to introduce me to the men who are left without a woman to entertain them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst is Quentin, who I recognize as Tyrone's cousin. I remember he used to attend the same high school as us and was in a class two years ahead of us. Then he was a tall, chubby guy, but now he's all muscle. We weren't close in high school, as he only hung out with people from the same year and often picked on us underclassman. I wonder if remembers who I was, but I doubt it. Seeing him now, he looks like a strong football player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond is Darius, dressed in a suit and tie. My intuition tells me he works for the government or he's a lawyer. Just noticing from my position, he has never looked at the other girls even once. He either darts his eyes either at me or my sister. His stoic face sort of intimidates me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext is Dominic, who sits all by himself at the dining table. Seeing a plate of food sitting in front of him on the table, there is no doubt in my mind that he's a glutton. He has a body of one. He's not overly obese, as he does have controls of his movement, but I doubt he has ever had a woman in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on a loveseat that sits against the far wall are twin brothers, Marcus and Blaine. If I could take a guess at what they do for a living, I would either say they are gangsters who push drugs or they are a hip-hop rap duo. Both sport chains around their necks and rings on their fingers. Their clothes are pristine, like they've been newly opened and worn. Mike tells me if I pick one or the other, he'd give my sister to the other brother, if she wished to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, sitting in an armchair by himself looks to be an much older gentleman. His hair has already started graying out and he wears sunglasses that complete block out his eyes. Though he looks old, my intuition tells me he has the heart of one of the younger folk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, I could also pick Mike to be my partner, but that would be taking a risk. He's an option, is all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich of these men should I pick to be my partner?</span></div></div>",

I'm caught off guard, more due how soft his lip against my own set of soft of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn boy, let her breathe, for chrissakes!\" Bruno, the old man calls out from his armchair. Everyone else other than Bruno and Mike don't even let out a snicker, but I'm too caught up in the moment to notice. Quentin finally separates from my lips, leaving me feeling hot.

Had the hormones or sensations of being a woman started to kick it once his lips met with mine? Or was it my decision to submit? It's like I'm in a trance as he guides me back into Tyrone's bedroom, where all of this gender-bending chaos happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk into the room, hearing the door close behind me. Quentin speaks, as if he remembers the man I once was. \u201cDamn, you've done well for landing yourself in that sexy ass body. Not bad for a white girl,\u201d he says, but pauses, sensing something isn't right about my behavior. \u201cYou know, Uncle Mike slapped me with that glove that turned you and your dad into chicks. I wonder what I will get. A bigger dick, maybe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe gave you the power to put anyone under a following trance with a passionate kiss,\u201d I say in a rather low, monotone voice. In fact, I don't quite think of the phrase and I simply have no recollection of saying it. After telling him the unusual answer, I seem to snap out of the trance that he unknowingly had placed upon me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck did you say?\u201d Quentin asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel the sensation of when you stand up too quickly, that your blood is to slow to make its way to your brain, and I clutch my head as a migraine sets in. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I whisper and I'm too slow to react to the large black man before me closing the distance between us. Right as he is about to grab me, I freak. \u201cHey, what the hell?\u201d I protest, but it's too late, as Quentin wraps his arms around me and also places a hand over my mouth to keep me from making too much noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d he tries to calm me down with his breath in my ear. \u201cI'm not that kind of dude, man.\u201d Unlike how I was in the bigger room, I'm far from one who would willingly submit and I writhe and try to pull the hand over my mouth with my hands, but to no avail. \u201cYou said something about a trance and a kiss.\u201d Quentin's last phrase successfully calms me down, which I do so in order to think about what he had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tug at the hand over my mouth and at first, Quentin reluctantly resists, but after finding me quite still in his arms, he lets go after a couple seconds. He unwraps his arms, letting me go fully, but I don't separate from him by much. I simply just roll over to take a seat on the edge of the bed. \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d I ask, but Quentin responds with an expression that tells me that I should remember what I say with my mouth. \u201cWhat did you hear me say? Something about a trance and a kiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you sounded kind of weird when you said it too, but what I got what that I got a power to put people in a trance just by kissing them,\u201d he recollects and also adds, \u201cPassionately kiss them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn't you\u2014?\u201d I ask, but the black man quickly answers with a reluctant nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou picked me, you remember that?\u201d Quentin asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and reply, \u201cBut everything else after that until I found myself in this room, I don't remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let's see if it work again,\u201d he says and quickly grabs my face and plants another of his kisses onto my lips.

A part of me feels regret for slapping Quentin, who does nothing but consider what just happened to his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm guessing my power didn't work the second time,\u201d Quentin calmly says as he looks to me for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shake my head with a concerned look on my face and after, immediately apologize. \u201cSorry,\u201d I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a nice hit, baby. You gotta let me do the same to you, but on a different cheek,\u201d he says, jokingly, but quickly stops laughing. \u201cShit. Tyrone gave you this body and got one of his own in return. I remember you kids were so immature when I was a senior in high school. I can't believe that some of it stays with some people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI somehow feel what I would call a connection and I reach out to Quentin, placing a gentle hand on the same cheek that moments earlier, was shocked with a solid slap. Had I had the glove on my hand, I would have gave him something more than sore flesh. He raises his own hand to grab mine and he embraces it, wrapping his larger fingers all over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his other hand, he traces invisible shapes on the reddened skin of my palm and somehow soothe it with the warmth of his hand. \u201cI can't imagine how you must be feeling. Yesterday you were a guy, who used to be that quiet kid in Tyrone's circle of friends in high school, now you're a woman with a whole lot of new stuff to deal with,\u201d he says to me with a voice laced with concern and understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is somehow translated into trust, maybe even more, and it causes me to make the next move.

Mike puts me in a choke hold that doesn't strangle me, only keep me in place in his arm. I struggle, but my female strength is no use to this brute. \u201cNo, Rosario. I wouldn't be a good partner. Good partners do not share their partners with other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't expecting this and in my shock, I shout, \u201cNo!\u201d but my mouth is covered my Mike's large hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should have picked one of the guys. It was my intention to them that if a woman picks him, she was to not be shared amongst them. If she chose to leave, she'd get to leave without a fight, If she chose to stay after refusing the first time, but did not pick a partner, she would be free to be given out as I wished,\u201d Mike explains into my ear. \u201cThe boys have been waiting and now they have you. I have expressed to them not to fight you, but if you are mean to them, they have every right to punish you accordingly. If you choose to submit and be a good girl, you'll find that they won't punish you as much. My advice: enjoy having everything to yourself. As for your sister, Wes and I will entertain her. Since you didn't pick, what sweetened the deal has expired, even for her..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mike pushes me towards the mass of men, who easily catch me, restrain me and take me to the far side of the room. In the men's grasp, I'm easily made to lower myself to my knees, facing the armchair that Bruno was sitting on. The old man with graying hair takes a seat in the armchair and looks down at me. \u201cBefore coming here and being invited to this party, Mike had told us that there would be at least one girl here that would eventually submit after first choosing to leave. She would rebel and try to fight us. We were advised not to fight back, but to everything in our power to assist you in submitting to the dominant man. That is what we will do.\u201d Bruno's voice is almost like that of a teacher and half of me wants to rebel while the other half wants me to submit. \u201cI won't force you to suck my dick while my younger brothers pleasure you from behind. We will go slow and allow you to enjoy all of us. We hope that you will truly enjoy submitting to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo I finally submit and heed to their advice?

Choose wisely how you go about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI consider not only the weight of their words, but also the consequences of all the choices I could make. I could choose to rebel, resulting in punishments from Mike. To an extreme, Mike might even allow punishments from the six men around me. Considering the constant pain I would feel that would be caused by the constant rebellion I would be acting out, overwhelms my imagination and I shudder just at the thought of it all. This causes me to get up on my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone from behind grabs my arm and I turn and see that it's the tallest of them all, Quentin. His grip loosens and lets go and I find out that it's Bruno who has silently ordered him to do so. I nod out of respect for the old man and continue with my actions, starting with me taking off the white tanktop from my body. Despite the coos and comments from the black men, I continue on with taking off my short shorts. I try to do it as naturally as possible, neither giving them the show they want nor making it seem fake. If this is the extent at which I can avoid submitting, then it's fine. I make haste and take off my undergarments as well, leaving me naked between these rather dominant, clothed men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get back down on my knees and reach for Bruno's pants, but he grabs my hands, causing me to stop and look up at him. \u201cAllow me,\u201d he says and proceeds to unbuckle his belt, undo his pants and pull down his zipper. He slides away his boxers to reveal a surprisingly long and half-erect manhood. Shit, I say to myself. The member is easily at least 8 inches in length. I take it into my hand and it literally hardens at my touch. Any hint of flaccidity is gone as it towers from its base right before my eyes. I look up at Bruno and Mike, who do not say anything, but sport eager smiles on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've never tasted anything old, nor would I want to. If it has mold or smells spoiled, it would get thrown in the trash. But as I place inch it closer to my mouth, my nose smells a terrible smell that threatens to induce my gag reflex. It's the recurring thought of the possible punishments that the men could deliver on my weaker body that causes me to go beyond what is gross to me and continue to perform. I open my mouth, letting the large head of the one-eyed snake into my mouth. Immediately I taste what I've been smelling and it's even worse. As my saliva slowly mixes with the musk, I have to force myself to breathe and swallow if I'm ever to get through this blowjob alive. Fortunately, Bruno is very considerate and does not rush me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, I'm able to wash away the musk and my nose actually gets use to the smell. There is something about the warm flesh of this old black man's cock that intrigues my tongue as it runs over texture of the the sensitive head and traces every vein on the pole's shaft. The work my mouth does soon renders compliment and encouragements from Bruno, who also occasionally takes my hands to massage them now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, behind me, Quentin has taken a position at my rear, taking my hips and my ass in his hands. He already has his dick out and is simply teasing my lower region with it. He often slaps my ass cheeks with his hardened cock, getting laughs and snickers from the other guys as I imagine the flesh of my ass bouncing and jiggling with every blow of Quentin's manhood. He also tries to poke my asshole, which causes me to protest and reach my arm behind me in order to prevent him from actually penetrating me. Bruno, at this time, is no longer the considerate old black man, but is an accomplice to Quentin. When I protest even more, he grabs my hand and singlehandedly clasps them together, using one hand as a makeshift cuff. I look up and see the old man nod at Quentin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mouth finally dismounts from the cock of Bruno and I plead with the man behind me, \u201cPlease Quentin, don't it there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut it where?\u201d he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does he put his manhood?</span></div></div>",

In no time, the shaking intensifies to the point that the whole room is shaking around us. As if being turned into a woman wasn't a shock to my father-turned-sister, she drops the sheet and takes me down to the floor, urging me to roll underneath whatever space is below the bed. I roll from one side and she does so from the other. We stop when we meet each other and we end up facing each other. Without thinking, we wrap each other with our arms and pull each other close. In the chaos of the earthquake, we don't say anything about the skin-on-skin contact. We are just worried about surviving through this tremor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can hear cabinets falling, glass shattering and wood splintering. I observe the quake has lasted more than thirty seconds and in its duration, the headboard of the bed buckles and falls upon the mattress as well as the ceiling fan above the bed. A dresser next to the bed falls onto the mattress as well as one of mirror closet doors, which had dislodge from its track during the shaking. The added weight to the bed causes it to buckle slower, pinning the both of us in between the bed's supports and the floor. When the shaking stops, I open my eyes to see that I'm face to face with my... sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it over?\" my newly formed sister asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" I tell her.

I've been a woman for a much shorter time than you and I feel... comfortable--\" she says, but I cut her off at her comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how come you didn't change me back to a man, then? If it was possible, you could have switched our bodies when you slapped me,\" I point out. The woman across from me, whose breasts interlock with my own stays quiet for a time, allowing me to digest what had just happened. \"What happened out there? Did you have any doubt that the glove would work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Maybe I did and it backfired on me. Then I'm to blame for this predicament and I accept it,\" she says calmly. \"Can you move at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I tell her. \"Can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Then all we can do is wait. Wait until someone comes and digs us out,\" she tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe wait what seems like hours. In the span of time, both of us eventually fall asleep. When I come to, my father-turned-sister is already awake and is alerting me that she hears noises coming from beyond the debris. Minutes later, we hear the sounds of cabinets and debris being taken off of the bed, the weight of which we also feel is being lifted, allowing us more range to move, but not enough to get ourselves out. We eventually hear voices but we can't make out who they belong to. In no time, the box spring mattress is lifted, leaving only the broken frame and the two of us. We eventually see our saviors. Who are they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Out of the windows, I can see the darkness of night. Has it be that long while we were underneath the bed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur two savior turn out to be two men who are very handsome, wearing matching polo shirts with slacks. They do not look like rescue workers, but could be volunteers who has offered to help. On of them grabs a radio all while looking away to grant us privacy. The other man does the same and he goes to retrieve his lantern as well as two blankets he digs out of a toppled hamper. The man with the radio says into the device, \"We found them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man with the blankets hands one to the other man and the both of them hand one to each of us. Knowing we are naked and exposed, we quickly take the sheet and wrap them around our bodies. We then grab the offered hands of both men, who pull us up on our feet. They suddenly lifts us up into their arms, which they point out that there is a bunch of glass and other debris that might cut our bare sole if we tried to walk ourselves. The both of us women silently accept our roles and allow the men to carry us out with no protest. They carry us out of the room into the main living area, where there is much more carnage and chaos in terms of destruction. The hold held up fine, but anything that wasn't tied down has either fallen or is out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is also out of place is the other members of the household. Mainly Sonya and her father was the only ones that were in the house other than the two of us when the quake occurred. I ask the man carrying me, \"Hey, did you find a woman named Sonya and a much older man with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they are outside,\" the man's deep voice says. The two men carry us outside where the night is illuminated by the lights of cars in the driveway.

It's also due to the foot traffic that is seen walking on our driveway. An ambulance is seen at the end of the driveway, its lights on, but its siren off, being driven back onto the street.

The move catches me off guard and when I try to defend myself, it's too late.

It's like I awake from a nightmare, but judging from the sensations and my surroundings, the nightmare is still around me. Still, I'm a woman, but this time, my nakedness is covered by garments that are almost as tight as spandex. I look myself over and find my breasts are supported by a black sports bra that exposes much of my abdomen. The neckline is a plunging neckline and though they are lifted by the garment, my breasts create a prominent cleavage between them. On my legs is a pair of yoga pants, in the same black color as the sports bra. The pants are so form-fitting, I can only assume that the shape of my legs and ass are at the very least, observable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get to my feet and feel that the floor is padded, much like a wrestling mat. I look down and see white padding, that not only covers the ground, but also covers the walls and ceiling as well. To the side, I see my father-turned-sister sleeping soundly on her side. She too wears somewhat of the same garments as I am, save for the longer top that covers more of her abdomen. Just where in world are we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, I hear a sound from my other side. A door that is padded on one side, but has a small porthole at about the height of my forehead installed into it, opens. In comes in a large man, clearly a foot, if not more, taller than I am. His arms heavily muscular. I can only assume with the broadness of his shoulders, underneath his T-shirt, is a heavily muscular chest and abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he steps forward, I take one step back. Somehow, I sense that my move strikes a nerve and he gestures rather aggressively me to cover forward instead of back. I can two more steps back because of, one, he takes another large step forward, narrowing the gap between us, and two, another man with the same muscular build and stature enters in behind him, though staying close to the door. The man gesturing me forward stops himself in his tracks. He stands straight and then looks behind him. He eyes someone in the darkness beyond the door and turns back at me. He finally speaks, with a deep voice no doubt. \"Miss, I am not here to hurt you. If you can kindly come with me, we can sort out whatever mess you're in. If not, then I'll have to ask the boys to assist in getting you to come with me,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do in this situation?</span></div></div>",

He steps forwards as I walk back, trying to keep how small a distance between him and I from getting bigger. In the corner of my eye, his partner walks forward along with him and he easily goes to my sleeping look-alike and picks her up and carries her into his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI back up until my foot hits the padded wall opposite the door.

The object, which I can compare to a more firmer hacky sack, flies straight towards me and strikes my abdomen, effectively knocking the wind out of me, causing me to collapse to the floor. Two successive bean bags fly right after, hitting my shoulder first and then the second hits my upper abdomen. When I'm on the floor, I barely have any strength left to recover. I can only roll onto my back and lay there as the man who I tried to escape walks over to me. He looks down on me with an expression that says, \"I warned you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI roll my eyes from the man to the door, where three men dressed fully in tactical gear enter, all three wielding what looks like revolving-barrel grenade launcher. They were probably the ones shooting those non-lethal bean bags. My eyes dart to the man once more, who gestures to the three men, who turn and walk out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to my feet is difficult and I can only manage to prop myself up on an elbow, which is in itself is difficult to endure. The man easily picks me up drapes me over his shoulder without an ounce of resistance from me. With me facing towards his rear, I can see the other man lifting my father-turned-sister into his arms and following the first man's lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carries me through the threshold of the door and into a hallway. The three men turn a corner far down one end of the hallway, while the two men carrying us turn to the other end. We eventually enter a room with peculiar looking beds. Just the sight of beds leads my mind to think of things that I myself are at a disadvantage. I even take into account the strength of these men and my thoughts of being at a disadvantage get more worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sense we are being taken to the far end of the room and the man carrying me over his shoulder, gently lays me down on a bed. I'm still too hurt to move and gloved hands easily manipulate me, grabbing my wrists and ankles and place them in leather restraints. One the cuffs are on, I attempt in pulling myself free to no avail. Further attempts garners a warning, but not from whom I'm assuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful miss,\" the voice says. The voice has an Indian accent to it. A man walks in between the two beds that my father-turned-sister and myself are laying on and immediately I connect his appearance to the voice. I'm right for once. \"We don't want your bodies going through anything strenuous, at least for the sake of knowing what has happened.\" He gestures to the two men who had carried us. \"Prop them up if you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men round the bed and attend to a panel that when pressed allows the bed to tilt, hopefully to just one axis. The bed vibrate as it tilts forward, with my feet and legs lowering and my upper body and head rising. The bed tilts to a point where I'm almost upright while I'm still in contact with the rather comfortable cushions of the bed. Once the beds are in positions, the Indian man gives a silent approval with a smile. I can only give him a resentful stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing to be afraid of, I hope, but you two have been through a mess of things,\" he says. \"I assure you that we'll get to the bottom of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the restraints?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a precaution. I can only imagine that you went through a panic when you... transformed, so for your safety, we have tied you down. I hope it won't be for long,\" he explains. His words is eloquent and calming enough to keep me still, but it cannot numb the pain in my shoulder and abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would you keep us here?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Testing and research,\" a voice to my right side says. To whom does the voice belong to?</span></div></div>",

He comes out from the shadowy corner of the room wearing what he had on when he was at the house before the earthquake as well as a white lab coat over it. \"If you didn't pay attention, my dear,\" he starts with his British accent, \"I work with sciences, most especially with the laws of thermodynamics. This agency has called me on behalf of the country to try to solve this peculiar matter and for my initial testing, I had Sonya as my test subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you kill her when you were done with her?\" I ask, though not without an awkward lump in my throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You young ones watch too many movies,\" he answers coolly as he steps in front of me. \"She's here, alive and well, just tired, that's all. You'll be able to see her when I'm done with my examination.\" The fact that Sonya is alive and to hear it straight from her father's mouth somewhat caused me to relax, though I was still tense in places, more notably in the areas that had a leather cuff surrounding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, thermodynamics, if you don't know, is the study of heat or radiation, whereas in this case, pertains to work or energy,\" the Indian man says. He gestures to the man who had carried me into this room. \"David, if you can take a picture of our two guests.\" He points to what looks to be a thermal camera. \"We will be taking a thermal snapshot, so we can better explain what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid takes a picture, which doesn't need a flash, even though I flinch expecting one. Sonya's father, whose name is Frederick, leaves momentarily, only to come back with a monitor that materializes a picture of two figures, with varying areas of reds, yellows, oranges and whites. I assume the two figures is me and my father-turned-sister. \"If you see here, these are your thermal signatures at this time. You can see that most of your bodies is bathed in white with some varying degrees in red, orange and yellow,\" Frederick explains. \"When you compare it to a normal human's body temperature, you can see the difference.\" Frederick swipes the screen and shows me a figure bathed with mostly red, secondarily orange and tertiary yellow. The hottest places would be around the chest, in between the legs and at the top of the head. In comparison, the initial two figures have a dominant color of white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it mean?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, your sister, Sonya and a few others came into contact with a certain object, that altered your bodies at the cellular level. We've had subject with isolated areas of affect, but with you, Sonya and your sister, the areas affected are throughout your whole bodies,\" Frederick answers. \"Your bodies are emitting temperatures that are near that of nuclear substances like Uranium or Plutonium, though in a stable state. We don't know why they are so stable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In nutshell, we believe the 'glove,' as Sonya called it, sent energy throughout your body, causing your cells to mutate. This form of technology is so advanced that it allowed electrical impulses to manipulate your body cells to change, and as Sonya put it, from cells of a male to that of a female. This is why you are producing so much heat,\" the Indian man adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I feel hot and why am I not sweating?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you happen to pass out right after being... what did Sonya tell us?... slapped?\" the Indian man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think and recall that I did pass out right after Tyrone slapped me. \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was because your body when into a sort of shock, a cross between traumatic shock and that found with heat stroke,\" Frederick tells me. \"This is probably why your sister here is still asleep after all this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not my sister,\" I tell them. \"She's my father. Did you forget already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrederick stumbles on his words and for the moment, stays quiet, \"Sorry. I guess I did,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we are done here, Sir,\" the Indian man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, is there a way to change us back?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potentially, but the 'glove' you mention hasn't been found and no cases like yours have turned up. If we had it, we could change you, but seeing as your thermal signatures are still high, it would be lethal to change you at this time. I assure you though, we are still searching for the glove as well as the men who took them,\" the Indian man says. \"David, William, you can escort the two ladies to their respective rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI calmly ask, \"You're not letting us go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrederick answers, \"For your safety, we are trying to contain this situation. At the moment, your original identities have been compromised and it wouldn't be beneficial for you to roam around without proper identification. I believe a night in the county jail wouldn't be good for women like you. Plus, that house that you stayed in was demolished in that quake.\" He approaches to unbuckle the leather cuffs around my wrists and ankles. As he does so, he continues talking. \"You are pretty much safe here in the compound. We will provide you your meals and shelter, as well as facilities to fight the boredom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boredom? It gets boring over here?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid answers for the first time, \"You can only imagine. Cooped up in a laboratory all day is detrimental to one's sanity,\" he says out of nowhere. His answer only gets a cold stare from Frederick and myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the restraints are gone, I can freely get to my feet. As for my father-turned-sister, the muscular man named William proceeds to  lift her sleeping body into his arms again and carries her out the door. David, who sees that I can walk on my own, can only look back at me as he follows Willaim out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe turn down the hallway and eventually get to a four-way junction. Willaim and David turn left down a hallway that leads to an elevator, but after seeing the other two hallways, one which is filled with lab coats and fluorescent lighting and the other that leads to natural lighting, my curiosity increases. Which of the three hallways should I take? </span></div></div>",

I come out of the shadowed hallway to find a windowed exit that leads out to a porch of some kind. Another plus is that it's outside and it overlooks what seems to be a forest or jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push against the opening plate, which allows me to push the door ajar and step outside it. My feet now meets the cold of a concrete observation deck, cooled by a gentle breeze which comes from what I assume is an ocean. Are we on an island? I ask myself and my feet continue walking down the deck to find out. To my left, lining the wall is concrete and windows, which are either tinted or mirrored so I'm unable to look through them from outside. To my right, lining the outside edge of the deck is a railing high enough that when I lean against it, I don't have to worry about going over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk for what seems like forever or at the very least, the majority of the whole length of the building, when I come to a clearing where the deck becomes wider and the building create a corner.

On each square sits a VTOL aircraft, like a plane with a pair of propellers that can be used for upwards lift or forwards thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could explore more of this observation deck if it weren't for a pair of strong arms pulling back and forcefully pinning me to the ground.

For a split second I don't know why says this, for I assume he is being assertive and trying to get me to submit to him, when in actuality, in the next moment, I discover the real reason. Debris from the concrete walls and columns as well as glass from the windows burst into pieces, flying every which way, amidst the booms of a rapid-firing cannon.

The next sounds I hear is of heavy footfalls, boots running down the deck and possibly jumping over David's body covering mine. I hear sounds of rifles shoot in the direction of the cannon and before I know it, another explosion erupts, this time farther. Did the people with the feet running on the deck have rifles and shot down the unseen attacker?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear the voices of men shouting. From what I can make out, the men say, \"Get search teams down there!\" \"Get that fucker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at the same time the men are shouting when David finally pushes himself off of me. I look up at him and it looks like the side that was facing me is unscathed. It's when he turns around to respond to a man dressed in tactical gear and carrying a rifle, when I see the damage just a bunch of debris could do to the human body. Concrete dust covers most of his skin and clothes and on his left arm, is a wound. Looks like it was caused by a grazing bullet, not as worse as a direct hit, but still gruesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Lieutenant?\" the geared-up man asked through his face mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing major, just a flesh wound,\" David answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good call on that one, Sir,\" the man comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid taps his temple, \"Well, it's good I had these when I needed them. Bastards can cloak themselves, but with the right tech, nobody can see wear their hiding,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd have to buy you a drink one time. You going to be alright from here?\" the guard asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, just a flesh wound,\" David tells him. \"Now go on, they need more eyes for that bastard. Make sure you find him and bring him back alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, Sir,\" the guard responds and turns on his heel to join his team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid turns around and looks down at me. By now, I've already sat up, but due to the dust and tiny bits of glass in the areas around the space that David covered with his body, I cannot go anywhere without shoes to protect my feet. He sighs as he bends down and lifts me up into his arms. He winces as the weight of my legs burdens his left arm. Concerned, I ask, \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if he's pissed off about me being where I'm not supposed to be and getting him in trouble for it, he scoffs at my question. \"What were doing out here anyway?\" he asks in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to explore--\" I answer, but he cuts me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--And look where that got you,\" he shoots at me, silencing me. I look away, embarrassed truly. My curiosity wounded a man who's extending his help by carrying me over shards of glass and concrete. He carries me all the way down the observation deck and back into the hallway where it's a panic. It seems the attack penetrated the interior and wrecked havoc here as well. When we get to the four-way intersection, two gurneys with one male and one female, both in lab coats, cross in the front of us. Judging from the blood soaking on half of the woman's lab coat, she took a terrible hit that makes David's wound much less major.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid continues to make his way with me in his arms through the chaos in the hallways. He get into an elevator which goes down a couple of levels. We exit into a hallway that looks unaffected by the tension two floors above. I look out the windows and find the upper parts of the canopy of what looks like a tropical jungle dominating the view. Even with the clear floor, David doesn't even let me get back on my feet. I can't even explain when I don't protest for him to put me down. Am I too ashamed of hurting the man that I would allow him to carry me all the way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rounding a corner, which would follow the same route as the observation deck, we come up to another corner. Through the windows, the view is much clearer with much less dense jungle outside. Dominating the view though is a plume of black smoke, possibly from the wreckage of the aircraft that shot at us. Opposite the large window that shows us the terrible scene outside is a door, which opens automatically when David walks near the sensors. Inside, we find...?</span></div></div>",

David quickens his pace and rounds a partition to find William on his feet trying to calm a very panicked woman. Though clothed in pretty much the same type of outfit (only difference is her midriff is covered). she backs away from the large man as if she were naked and exposed. \"Get away from me, you--!\" she exclaims at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid drops the burdened arm holding up my legs and allows me to get to my feet. I run over to my father-turned-sister, who by now is up against a wall adjacent to the far end of the bed she had been laying on. I embrace her like I had when we were pinned underneath the bed during the earthquake and squeeze her for good measure. I speak into her ear, \"Hey, hey, it's okay. We're safe.\" I turn my head to look at William and David talking. I assume David asked what happened. I assume that due to the explosions and possible vibrations, my father-turned-sister had enough stimuli that was able to wake her up from her long slumber. The screaming probably surprised poor William, who for a moment, looked like he didn't know what to do in that situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rock my father-turned-sister back and forth, feeling the throbbing heart in her chest being to calm and relax, as I watch William asking about the wound on David's arm. He's probably advising him to get it looked at and tended to. Without saying goodbye or announcing their exit, they leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" my father-turned-sister asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but it seems like a military compound on an island. They have scientists working here too,\" I tell her. \"Are you doing okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apart from waking up here all of a sudden, I'm fine. What happened to the house?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demolished, I think, but this place should a much better place to rest your head,\" I tell her. \"Are you sure you're okay? You look like you didn't get much sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how long was I out?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how long, but I think you were out an hour or two more than I was,\" I tell her. \"Say, you don't feel hot do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she asks, feeling her forehead with the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you were asleep, some scientist told me that they can somehow explain how we were transformed into women. The technological stuff is a place they can't even fathom, but they have a theory that we changed according to thermodynamics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thermodynamics?\" she asks, taking a seat on the side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said something along the line of heat close to that of radioactive plutonium mutated every cell in our body at the tiniest level and it was the technology in the glove that commanded the cells to switch from male to female,\" I further explain. \"They even took a picture of our bodies in relation to the heat we are producing and we are white hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean smoking hot,\" she says out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me--?\" I ask, but without warning, my father-turned-sister pushes me down onto the bed. Quickly, she straddles me all while pressing half of her weight down on my shoulders. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do to me?</span></div></div>",

She traces along my belly button and slowly and seductively rises to the form fitting band of my sports bra. I look at her and see a sinister grin form on her lips, which, at the same pace as her hand, slowly start to lower itself towards mine. All of a sudden, the whistle that comes from the opening of the sliding door enters the room and my father-turned-sister looks towards it. Now that she is distracted, at that moment I push up against her and throw her to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsteps belonging to our visitor draw closer, possibly to the edge of the partition. I take whatever time I have to push myself up to a sitting position. The visitor reveals himself to be the Indian scientist that I had met before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" he greets the two of us with his accent. \"I see your sister is awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not her sister,\" my father-turned-sister says, with a voice that shows no evidence that she had been panicking minutes beforehand. \"I'm more like her mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean her father?\" the Indian man adds. The question catches her off guard and she cannot shoot back at him. I giggle a bit under my breath while seeing my father-turned-sister's face reddens in embarrassment. \"It's okay. We had to do some testing why you two were asleep. It's been 47 hours since you were picked up on the west coast and transported her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's here?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhere near the equator, surrounded by ocean, invisible to those not looking,\" he answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning that our location is classified?\" I ask in return. \"Then how come someone who was invisible came and attacked me a few minutes ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" my father-turned-sister asks, curiosity written all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't answer her, which gives the Indian scientist a moment to answer my previous question. \"Obviously that person was looking, intently searching for the place that protected you and they succeeded. We don't know how, but we are investigating at the moment. But that's not the reason why I came. I came her to let you know that we have caught the culprit and we are have the culprit restrained to a bed, where he or she is resting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know if the attacker is a male or female?\" I ask, puzzled by his answer. He pauses, as if he is trying to formulate something to say but after a little while, he chooses not to answer my question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he continues. \"We are holding the culprit right now, where he, or she, cannot hurt you. If you want, you can come with me to see her,\" he says. \"Otherwise, you can stay here and we'll get you whatever you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'd like to see him... or her,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" my father-turned-sister puts in. I look back at her, out of surprise. I turn back to the Indian scientist, who nods and takes a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll give you two some time to get ready---\" he tells us, but I interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't need to get ready,\" I cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, if you follow me, we'll get to the holding cells,\" he says and turns on his heel, disappearing behind the partition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get to my feet and hurry after him, with my father-turned-sister right on my heels. When we see him again, he's already in the hallway<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we could have just took a minute to get some shoes or at the very least a pair of slippers, girl,\" my father-turned-sister says from behind me. Truly, after exploring an observation deck and hallways in my bare feet, I was already used to the feeling of the cold floor underneath my soles. My father-turned-sister wouldn't have experienced it since by now, she's been carried here and there. We make it to an elevator, which is the same elevator that David had carried me up in. When the doors close, my father-turned-sister asks the Indian scientist, \"You don't happen to know where I can get some shoes for these itty-bitty feet, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, your sister here was adamant that we not waste time in getting to the holding cells. If you want, I can get William to carry you to the holding cells,\" he tells her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's William?\" she asks in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure you know him by now. He's been carrying you diligently, even when you got here, you were in his arms,\" the Indian man explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI add, whispering into her ear, \"he was the one you were panicking about just a few minutes ago,\" which gives her a bit of shock, which also shuts her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, the elevator makes it to a floor that it had traveled down to get to. I wouldn't be surprised if it were underground, where the sun doesn't shine. I wouldn't expect this floor to have any window that would look out. When the doors of the lift open, two large figures stand with their backs to us, right outside. They turn around and to no surprise to me, it's David and William. After finding out the name of the man who carried her, my father-turned-sister drifts to my side. She whispers to me, \"That's William?\" Honestly, I relate with her experiencing how large a man could be when you're the size of a shorter woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, William, how are things? How's our suspect?\" the Indian man asks as he walks out of the elevator in a somewhat darker hallway that's devoid of any windows. The two of us women walk out of the elevator behind him, feeling a warm floor underneath our feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's sedated and resting in holding cell five. She has been restrained as ordered,\" David saw as he walks side by side with the Indian man. I can see a white ribbon of bandage around his arm, possibly to aid the wound he had gotten earlier due to my curiosity. Looking at just the white wrapped around his arm causes me to feel embarrassed and somewhat responsible for his injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three men stop after walking a while and it seems we just arrived at a holding cell. A large metal door installed through the thick concrete wall to our right has a large white \"5\" painted on it. The Indian man walks over to a panel a meter or two away from the right of the door. He presses a few buttons and light emits from a source in the ceiling. It blinds my eyes and I move out and away from it. It shines on the wall, even the wall and shows an image as if there was a one-way mirror installed in the concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can anybody inside see us?\" my father-turned-sister asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. There are no cameras installed outside the cells, so there would be no point in showing an image to any would-be prisoner held inside,\" William speaks up. The image shows a guard, whose face I recognize as the man who had rescued me from an earthquake-stricken house. I honestly am angry of what he did to us in that driveway. It was rude and unnecessary. But fortunately, he's inside of the cell and not on the side that I'm on. William continues to speak, now addressing the inside of the cell. The guard and even the technician and nurse seem to hear him. \"How's she doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In all honesty, she's doing fine, as if a burning, exploding aircraft crashing into thick jungle wasn't enough to give her at least a scratch,\" the nurse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What boggles me is what had happened minutes after we got her to the holding cell and restrained her to the bed. I mean, she was a man before this. When she crashed, she was a man, fully, but after getting her to the bed, that man changed almost instantly to a woman,\" the guard explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? Did he say what his name was?\" the Indian man asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the name of this suspect?</span></div></div>",

He was writhing so much we needed four men just to keep him still or else he'd hurt himself.\" The guard moves closer to the bed where a woman with dark hair was laying, asleep and restrained pretty much in the same manner me and my sister were minutes prior. A red light envelops much of the bed and it's hard to tell what race the woman is. \"As the transformation ended, he was so tired, but managed to say this sentence: I am Tyrone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart jumps and races at the same time, I take a step forward and inadvertently grasp David's uninjured arm while asking, \"Did he just say Tyrone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy question grabs the attention of everyone, even the guard in the room. \"Yes, I think so, miss,\" the Indian scientist says. \"Did you know this Tyrone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard turns around and looks at the five of us as if he can see right through the walls. I look up at David, who gently removes his arm from my hand, and then back at the scientist. I then look forward and answer the question while looking at the guard inside. \"He's the one who done this to me and Sonya. Did you find a glove with him?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's speaking?\" the guard asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's one of the three women who were brought here after the accident,\" the scientist tells him. The guard bows his head as if in thought and then he walks to the door. He opens it, letting out a pressurized hiss and walks out, closing the door behind him with another pressurized hiss. Knowing that he was the very one who had carried me out of the house and in the driveway, knocked me out very proficiently, I get scared of his presence with us in the hallway. I again take a hold of David's arm and hide behind him. The guard gets a good look of my face and then turns to look at my father-turned-sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I say anything else, I'd like to tell the two ladies here that I'm deeply sorry that me and a colleague of mine had to knock you out in that manner. I understand if you're a bit standoff-ish, but I am not here to hurt you. In fact, to answer your question, miss, he... she, i mean, did not have a glove on her person. Nor did she have it in the aircraft. If she did, then it would have burned up to smithereens,\" the guard explains after apologizing. Not one to trust someone so easily, I still keep my distance from him while hiding behind David. I don't even notice him getting annoyed by the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't explain how this woman here was instantly turned from a male to a female and even in contact with four other males,\" the scientist puts out. \"Like, how doesn't this 'glove' transform people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody wears it and the one that will be transformed has to be slapped in order for the glove to transform them. They even say what the addition or subtraction is before the slap,\" I tell him to the best of my ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like an incantation, a chant or magic word?\" the guard asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that, but I've seen it done without anything being spoken,\" I tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how I was transformed,\" my father-turned-sister adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long silence ensues amongst the six of us. The Indian scientist breaks the silence, suggesting, \"You two must be tired from your ordeal. You've been through a lot the past couple of days. Why don't we have David and William here escort you back to your room so you can rest. We'll keep Tyrone or whatever her name is now here. She is still under guard in case she turns violent again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod again and once more, David gently removes his arm from my grasp. His silent annoyance passes under the radar as I'm totally ignorant of the fact and he briskly meets with William who proceeds to the lead the way back to the elevator. I meet up with my father-turned-sister and follow the two men back into the waiting elevator. The ride back up is mostly silent and uneventful, mostly because I have a lot of my mind, mostly regarding the current state of Tyrone and guesses of how he came to be a woman so suddenly. Questions such as, who had slapped Tyrone and in what way was he transformed? Could the glove be as specific as time or circumstance? Where is Tyrone's dad or where is Carlos and his father?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stay silent until we get to the floor where our room is located. I get to the door, but I stop in my tracks. I feel an emotion that I have never felt before and I tried hard to suppress it. I space out as my mind races and it's only when I hear David's voice accompanied by  him tapping my shoulder with his two fingers that I come out of my reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" he asks. \"Anything on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I ask?</span></div></div>",

One moment, I'm dashing straight for the open door, the next, I'm teetering to the side, involuntarily, my torso and head hitting the padding hard. I can still observe through my eyes, but everything else goes numb. For a moment, I lay there motionless. I see myself being lifted and ultimately being carried by the man I tried to escape from. He has a concerned look on his face as he looks at mine. He starts for the door, each step lulling me into the black of unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up feeling groggy and sore all over, as if I had an intense workout hours prior with no protein-rich meal for recovery. I open my eyes and find myself in a hospital room, in a bed that's flat. I try to move, but I discover that I have limited mobility due to certain restraints put on my wrists, ankles, and waist. Luckily, I'm not naked. I'm still clothed in the garments that I initially found myself in, but I'm still uneasiness since I can't get out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I realize that I'm not alone. At the moment, the curtains around my bed are drawn and I can barely make out anything beyond them. The next moment, the curtains open and the person that walk out of the shadows is none other than that same man I tried to dodge. My fear of him taking advantage of me causes me to panic and writhe against my restraints. I groan in discomfort even though my mouth is not gagged and one of his hands draws near to my body. I close my eyes, trying to hide the place where he is going to touch first from my eyes, even when it's futile since the numbness from before is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe somehow calms me with his deep voice, which has a bit more concern in its tone. \"I said I'm not here to hurt you, Miss,\" he says and I suddenly realize that his hands is not on my body, but is working to undo the restraints. \"Forgive the methods, but you had a convulsion on your way to the infirmary. We did not want you to hurt yourself, but you probably are a bit sore from the spasms.\" He continues to undo the leather restraints, never trying to reach over to the other side from his current side and continuing to distance himself from my body. As each wrist or ankle is freed, I reel it close to my body in an effort to guard it. When the man removes the last restraint from my waist, he reels back, as if expecting a retaliating blow from me. This effort in his defense surprises me and I'm even more surprised at how he allows me to sit up. \"When you're ready, meet me outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I remember the thick arm constricting my neck, applying pressure to my arteries, preventing oxygen-rich blood from circulating, like it was just a second ago. I almost shoot up to a sitting position, when I notice there's a pleasant weight on my side. I feel a familiar sensation, the feeling of skin upon skin. It's at this moment that I figure I'm naked with someone who is as nude as me. Without moving the rest of my body, I lift my head up to see who is causing this weight. Brown wavy locks tossed over a beautiful head, it's none other than my father-turned-sister. She is fast asleep, her head resting in place in between my shoulder, my collarbone and my breast. Her breath is warm against my skin and her closeness is warm as well. It's pleasant to feel with the breeze blowing about the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I notice the surroundings we're in. The both of us are laying on a bed with burgundy sheets and a down blanket. The pillows are wrapped in matching pillow cases. The room the bed is sitting in is surrounding by walls that seem to be made of glass, but they are not see-through, but more opaque like those found in bathrooms. The walls gives clues of things beyond them, like certain pieces of furniture or objects. In the room we are in there is a pair of desks as well as a pair of dressers. To one side there is a open door, which I suspect is a closet. At the opposite end is another door, which I suspect is a bathroom. There is another door, directly across from the bed, which is closed. My curiosity causes me to lightly lift my sister's head from my body, laying it on a soft pillow next to mine. She doesn't wake up, but instead clutches at the pillows as if it were still me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly slip out of bed and go for which door?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I turn to the door to the right and when I enter through the threshold, I find it to be a closet. Unlike the previous room, the walls are fully opaque and the light that is illuminating the closet is a warm yellow light overhead. Along the walls I find clothes of differing designs, most of them hung on hangers. Line the foot of each wall are a variety of shoes, most of which have a raised heel. Not comfortable in finding myself in a dress with heels, I search for a change of clothes. Unfortunately, there are no clothes for men in this closet. I resort to a sports bra and tank top, which I pair with a pair of panties and yoga pants, all in a dull color of black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on clothes that fit the form of my body feels like I'm wearing very constricting garments, but when I look at myself in the provided mirror, I look good. I'm saying that in the eyes of a man who looks at an attractive woman. There's no amount of fabric that will hang loose. I decide to just go with it, settling with the fact that I wouldn't be caught dead wearing a dress. I look for shoes that have no raised heels, which the find was very difficult, seeing that it was kept hidden in a shoe box at the back of a cabinet. I slip on the pair of sneakers and head back out, only to hear a high-pitched scream before I exit through the door I came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here!\" the screams of my father-turned-sister ring out of the bedroom and into the closet. I run out the closet to find that one of the men who had knocked us out is in the room and is pulling my sister out of the bed by her ankle. She clutches at the pillows and sheets to no avail. I run out to help her, but I'm caught in the arms of another person. I look back and see the very same man who carried me out of the debris at my home. He doesn't even give me a chance to escape and he once again wraps his arm around my neck again, easily knocking me out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time I wake up, I feel like I'm in an awkward position. My arms are bound togeher and raised above my head. Not only that, but I'm no longer dressed in form-fitting clothes. WhateverII'm wearing, it's light and silky and when I rub my thighs together, I find that my crotch is no longer dressed with anything. Whatever breeze through the room, it's doing a number on my flush crotch and sending shivers up and down my body. Lastly, my feet are on the tips of my tops and the balls of my feet. I would describe more, but a door opens behind me and I hear footsteps walking towards me. I hear a voice followed by a hand that touches along a particular body part. Who does the voice belong to and what type of hand touches on what body part of my body?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A woman's voice enters my ears amid the heavy footsteps, one from boots and another from a pair of heels. The voice is somewhat assuring, as if the woman senses my distress at this moment. \"Do not worry my dear, we are not here to hurt you nor punish you,\" the woman tells me. She rounds my body and walks into the light in front of me. She's a woman around my mother's age, but with a figure that rivals models in their twenties. She wears a business suit with a blazer and dress shirt with no tie and a pair of business slacks. Her platinum blonde hair is neatly tied in a bun behind her head. \"We are here to marvel in an unbelievable feat and possibly employ you because of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable... yes, unbelievable. You and your sister have dangerous levels of radiations in and on your bodies, level that can have dangerous mutative effects. But what's unbelievable is that you have already mutated,\" the woman explains and when she is done, I feel a hand, much larger than this woman's, holding my arm and running along it from wrist to shoulder. I shudder, but the woman reassures me. \"Don't worry, my dear. He is but your handler, Derrick. Why don't you introduce yourself to your charge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand leaves my arm and I sense a large presence round the other side of me. A large shadow initially is silhouette by the light, but as he walks underneath it, I can see his face and muscular figure. Arms so thick with strong sinews, I believe he can break a weak woman's body like mine like a twig. He looks into my eyes and without saying a word, nods at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already know about the glove and it has been taken care of, along with the perpetrators. But you and your sister do not belong in that category. We initially were going to punish you, but after seeing what this godlike garment could accomplish, we had a change of heart,\" the woman tells me and after finishing, walks forward until I'm face to face with her. She lifts her hand and traces a finger down my arm, from wrist to armpit, the latter which when touched, I momentarily shudder. Her finger leaves my body, only to have the opposite hand liberally take hold of one of my breasts. I can't help but gasp at the gesture and groan and moan as the tender flesh is kneaded and squeezed. Again her hand leaves my body and she continues to speak. \"It's fascinating how a male body, born a man, feeling like one, could instantly change into a woman with all the sensations of one.\" She takes her finger again and traces above the garment I'm wearing, pressing down with enough pressure that I can feel it, making a straight line to the bottom hem of the nightie. \"Fascinating that you can feel everything I can certainly feel, with no boundaries to your sensation. You feel...\" as she speaks, her finger lightly touches along the sensitive folds of my pussy. The contact causes me to moan and I accidentally looks at Derrick's face. He looks back momentarily with no desire to watch and he almost embarrassingly turns his head aside. \"...everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer finger leaves my body for the last time and she walks back to stand right next to Derrick. \"Given this opportunity to get to know your charge, we'd like to employ you. There is a truth you must face. As you are these women, you are no longer the men you once were. Your bank accounts, your identity, even your credit is no more. We cannot simply let you two roam free with no identities. If given the chance, people who wish for two unclaimed vessel would claim you and use you in a heartbeat. We'd like to strike two birds with one stone. There are certain people we cannot get close to due to our involvement in the military or law enforcement. As you are employed in secret, you will act the part of not being part of the two and easily gain entry to places an officer or solider has not been in without bashing the door down,\" she tells me, again walking up to me. \"You, my dear, have been given your first assignment. Your handler here will inform you of the details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the woman leaves the room, leaving me and my handler, Derrick, alone in the room. He looks at my face without glancing anywhere else. But his stare is like those of a predator. His face is stoic, showing little emotion. He walks towards me and then rounds my body until he is behind me. I feel his hand undo the tight rope binding my wrists together. Once they are free, I drop to my heels, but momentarily loose balance. Derrick catches me and already I'm feeling awkward with his large hands on my body. Without asking, he lifts me into his arms and carries me out of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe enter a locker room of sorts, immediately adjacent to that dark room. Derrick sets me down onto the bench installed in the very center of the room and politely steps aside with is back to me. He speaks for the first time, saying, \"You'll find an outfit that we have picked for you. Underneath the clothes is a folder, your dossier for this mission. Familiarize yourself and get dressed. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.\" His speech is sophisticated, but his voice totally matches his body size. It's deep, almost guttural like a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look over to the pile of clothes neatly folded on the bench beside me. What kind of outfit has been picked out for me and what type of mission is it?</span></div></div>",

I take the blankets with me and when I fall, I unwittingly cover myself with the blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, girl, are you okay?\" my father asks as he tries to dig me out of the mass of blankets. He grabs my hand and pulls out from underneath, but when he exposes me to the light, he doesn't see the girl I was before. Sporting the same body type and measurements as the last look, what's different about the girl he sees is that she's Asian. Whatever he was thinking about, he's given me characteristics that are less akin to the stereotypical Chinky-eyed China girl and more like a mixed-Asian import model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I'm halfway out of the mass of blankets and sheets, I turn over and push myself up, which allows my long black wavy hair to drape down from my scalp. I do what I must to take it out of my face and when I do, I see my father standing right before me. \"Dad?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I'm concerned, baby,\" he starts as he runs his large hand through my hair, \"you're no longer my son-turned-daughter. You are not the mirror image of my long-gone wife. You're just a girl who happened to sleep with me last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I call you then?\" I ask, discovering that my voice hasn't changed that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as it's not Father, Pops, Papa, or Dad. You can call me Daddy, but only when I'm fucking you,\" he says with a laugh. I laugh with him and slap his shoulder for making that joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay babe,\" I say, getting rid of the honorific and the relation I have with this man. I press my naked body against him and place my hands on his pectoral muscle. \"Ooh, this will take some getting used to. And say, did you do something else with that glove.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father.... no the man who I slept with last night, wraps his muscular arms around me, resting his hands on my booty. \"Just some muscles and toning here and there and more girth down under. You know you should get dressed. The boys and all the girls are thinking of having brunch some wear, but first, you girls need something to wear,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the girls? Did you--? I ask, but he interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As punishment, Tyrone was turned into an Asian like you. Ricky, on the other hand, willingly submitted to his dad and became a broad of his choosing,\" he tells me. \"Fortunately, you all were changed when you were wearing clothes, so you all have clothes to wear. But knowing women, you need more clothes to wear and impress your man. Wait here and I'll fetch your clothes for you, baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lets go and leaves the room. I take the mass of sheets and make the bed. I guess it's the woman in me that wants to do this one chore and to impress the man that used to be my father. As I'm fluffing the pillows with my back turned towards the door, I hear the door open and the man whose name is Stephen West turns me around and takes my head and guides it to his lips. He plants a firm and passionate kiss which I amazingly return back to him. Our lips separate and I'm left standing there with an expression on my face that seems like I'm still in the throngs of passion and love, as if it was a wave that had continued crashing over me. \"Damn, girl, you are a natural,\" he compliments me. \"Here are your clothes. Get dressed. You'll find me in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly put on the thong, short shorts, tank top and hoodie that seems to have been taken off me prior to me finding myself in the bed naked. Stupid Tyrone, I think to myself. I'm surprised that even my clothes had changed as well. Once I\"m done, I make my way outside. There I find....?</span></div></div>",

He's actually looking at the couch opposite the one he's sitting on, but what could he be watching. The furniture and the shoulder-height wall that separates a hallway that leads to Carlos, Sonny (now Sonya) and my room and the living room hides whoever may be on that couch. I walk over into the living room and out of the corner of his eye, Stephen sees me approach. He reaches a hand out to me and I do the same, taking his hand which signals him to pull me suddenly into his lap. I sit sideways and rest my body against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, look over there. Meet Taira, who used to be Tyrone,\" Stephen points over to the opposite couch. Seated on the front of the cushions is Tyrone's dad, whose name escapes me. Behind him is the Asian woman whose name is Taira. Taira looks to be trying her hardest in massaging the muscles of her dad, but the expression on his face tells me she isn't doing a very good job. I see the expression on Taira's face and it seems like she either doesn't like massaging her father or she doesn't like being a girl at all. \"So, Quentin. Where are we going to get clothes for these women of ours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taira here says that we don't have to go anywhere to get them. Tyrone was such a player, he kept all the clothes of all the girls he ever slept with in a box on a shelf in his closet, ain't that right?\" Quentin explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes babe,\" Taira says in a somewhat submissive tone. \"Mostly bikinis and underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what karma does to you, girl. You act like a playa one second, you guest your ass played the next,\" Quentin scolds Taira, who flinches a bit, but continues massaging the black man's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get that back box,\" Stephen says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go with you,\" I say, opting to join Stephen rather than watch my friend turned Asian model chick being insulted by his former father. I follow Stephen back into Tyrone's room and I find him already rummaging around for that aforementioned box. He pulls out what looks like a Nike shoebox and opens it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo,\" he says and digs a hand into it. He tosses to me a bikini, which looks like it was wrapped up neatly by Tyrone. I unfold and untie the garments I'm given and it turns out to be a bikini top and bottom in the color of...?</span></div></div>",

His upper body, which looks lean and muscular, is exposed and it seems that he has recently taken a shower. \"It's Tanya now.\" The man comes out and enters the living room, taking a seat next to Enrique and Isabella. \"Damn, Stephen, you picked an Asian too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my choice actually, Sir,\" I say before Stephen can answer for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. And she's respectful, too, unlike that girl in there, sleeping her ass off. She weren't ready for what I did to her, but she had it coming,\" the man said. \"I don't believe we've met.

Steve, man, your girl is not ashamed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She deserves it, I think,\" Enrique says from the doorway. At his side is a half-asleep Isabella. \"Since we're second here, Isabella should get what's left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave one for Sonny, though,\" Stephen points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Enrique responds, \"Yes, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella walks into the room and quietly picks the all-white set with panty bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fine ladies should put those on and model for us,\" Marcus suggests. \"We look, but don't touch. We got no time to touch, since I'm already hungry as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea. It's a perfect activity for my Isabella to wake herself up,\" Enrique agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three men leave and close the door behind them. Once we are left alone, I ask Isabella, \"Is that you Ricky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Isabella says. \"Though, you shouldn't call me Ricky anymore. It's Isabella, or Isabel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" I continue to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay. Just tired from last night,\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dad says that you were servicing him like there was no tomorrow,\" I mention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was like that for the first thirty minutes. Every time I see his face, all I remember is him scolding me, scolding Ricky. But after thirty minutes, after he put his dick in me and broke my cherry, me fucking him like my life depended on it didn't really make sense,\" she tells me while taking off the T-shirt she has on. \"I actually was half-asleep when he talked about that. I don't know what happened, but last night, after taking my virginity, all the fucking I did was all for me. I'm embarrassed to say this as his son-turned-woman, but I was enjoying it last night. I think I became addicted to his dick.\" Isabella continues to speak, almost with a free and carefree attitude to her event last night, as she undresses herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI too, undress myself and continue to listen to Isabella. Once I'm naked, I put on the black and gold bikini, starting to the top first. As if we had been women all out lives, we each help each other by tying the strings into knots behind our backs and against our necks. We each put the bottoms on sitting down and untie and retie the knots to make sure they are securely fastened to our lower bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was your night last night?\" Isabella asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. My father... I mean, Stephen tells me he found me sleeping in the bed, naked obviously by the hands of Tyrone. He simply just slipped under the cover and slept with me all night,\" I tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't fuck you last night?\" Isabella asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. At least he tells me he didn't fuck me. If he did, I have no recollection of waking up. I was out cold since yesterday,\" I explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lucky bitch,\" Isabella says, as a joke. \"I guess it's time now. Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall,\" I excitingly say. I'm the first to open the door and walk out. I find Enrique and Stephen sitting on the loveseat that we put next to the dining room. I walk over to Stephen, trying to see if I can walk sexy, since I've only been a female for half a day it seems. As if walking on a tightrope, I put one foot in front of the other and make my way over to Stephen. I stop about a meter in front of him and take my hair in one hand and drape it over one shoulder. I turn on my heel and walk back into the room. As I do that, I wink at both men and start to walk back to the room. \"Get 'em, Isa,\" I say to the Latina girl standing behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI close the door behind me after Isabella leaves and I find myself liking being a woman every second. I put my clothes back on, over the bikini I already have and see the bikini that's left. If Sonya were to get this set, then either Tanya would have to go and wear lingerie or she would have to buy a bikini either someone nearby or at the pier. I look over at the door to find Isabella with the same excitement that I was feeling after modeling for the two men. She embraces me and I hug her back. \"I'm telling you, Rosa, I think I'm going to stay like this after all. I didn't feel like I got this much attention as a guy and we don't even have to lift a finger,\" she tells me as she gets dressed back in her T-shirt and capris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe hear a knock at the door. Who could it be?</span></div></div>",

Right behind her, with his hands on her hips, guiding her into the room, is none other than her father, he too dress in nothing but a towel around his waist. \"Hey, ladies,\" he greets us and whispers into Sonya's ear. Whatever he told her, it is pretty much assumed that she'll be getting the last bikini set, leaving Tanya without one. Sonya's father whispers more into Sonya's ear and he leaves the room right after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing the door, Sonya goes over and locks it shut. She turns around and catches us watching. She parts her new brown locks aside and tucks them behind an ear and says, \"Hi, guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" both Isabella and I quietly greet her. We stick close to each other, almost like sisters, as we watch Sonya remove the towel and expose her nakedness to us. She quickly puts the bikini on, and like us, starts with the top. Once her breasts are supported by the triangle pieces, both Isabella and I approach from the back and we each tie the strings for her; Isabella for the one behind the back and the one behind her neck for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys, I think I got it from here,\" Sonya says and immediately goes to sit to put on her bottom piece. He light skin brings out the blue and yellow of the bikini. Once she's done, she dons the towel once again and leaves the room. Both Isabella and I do the same and exit the room. In the living room we find both Enrique and Stephen sitting on opposite couches. We go to our respective others. When I go over to Stephen, he pulls me in suddenly and sits me on his lap, side-straddle. He supports me with one arm around my back, his hand resting on my thigh. Isabella does the same, but she is allow to sit right beside Enrique, who also allows her to lean against his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe just sit in silence. I pay attention to only Stephen, who caresses my smooth legs. A span of five minutes or so pass by and Sonya and her father, dressed for a summer day, come out of one room. Behind them, Marcus also shows himself, though there is no Tanya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's your girl, Marcus?\" Stephen asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat has happened to Tanya?</span></div></div>",

He closes the door and follows me to the driveway. \"Did Stephen give you a key for the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of that's been taken care of, girl,\" Marcus says. \"All you need to worry about right now is getting us to that Mama Chin's place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Mama Shin's,\" I correct him, but he scoffs it like a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Take a look at what you'll be riding in,\" Marcus says and presses a button on his car remote. The lights of a shiny, black Dodge Challenger light up and a low horn sounds. \"Whaddya think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't help but open my eyes wide in awe at the beautiful machine. Even though I'm a woman now, I still have the adoration of finely-tuned automobiles from when I was a guy. Marcus opens the passenger door for me and I eagerly get inside. Marcus rounds the car and gets in the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking at it is one thing, but hearing her purr is another,\" he mentions and inserts his key into the ignition and turns it clockwise, eventually turning over the engine. The engine roars like a tiger and quiets down to a growling purr, like a tiger protecting its territory. Once the car is on, the A/C blows, but it's not cool air I feel, but hot air. Marcus sees my expression and mentions, \"That's one thing wrong about this car. Air conditioning doesn't work that well.\" I go for the button on the door that operates the lowering of the windows, but Marcus butts in once again. \"Windows does work either.\" I press the button just in case he's joking with me, but like he said, the windows fail to lower at the touch of the button. \"I think it'd be best if you take off the sweater. I don't know what you were thinking when you put that on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll leave it on,\" I reply, knowing that if I take off this sweater, then it'll only be the bikini I have on. I realize it was stupid of me to wear nothing but the bikini underneath. I should have considered riding with someone who was less like Tyrone. All the mannerism and attitude is like a carbon copy of Tyrone. Even with Tyrone being Tanya, I still feel that jerk or a friend is still around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself. So, how do I get out of here?\" Marcus asks, as he backs out of the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just drive down this part of the street until you get to the light,\" I say. Marcus drives down the street and eventually gets to the four-way intersection that is managed by a signal light. \"Just make the right here.\" He turns right along the boulevard and leaves the residential area and enters commercial district. \"Make a left on Boardwalk to get to the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he make the left?</span></div></div>",

The heat of the fans circulating the warm air about the inside of the car, causing me to sweat more and more. It gets to a point where I can't take it anymore. I lower the zipper on my hoodie and eventually take off the sweater. I bite my lip, but glance at Marcus with a pissed-off look, as if I'm silently saying, 'Happy now?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus smiles and turns the car around. \"Don't worry, Rosa. I know where it is. I actually drove past it on my way over here,\" Marcus now tells me, with a smile that he does like what he sees. Embarrassed, I try to cover my chest with my hands, but all it does it make me sweat more due to stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, we make it to the boardwalk and find parking. Once parked, I make sure to put my sweater back on. In the time it takes to put my hoodie back on, Marcus has already turned off the car, got out and rounded the car to my side. He opens the door and allows me to get out, but using his larger body to block my way away from the car. He dares to touch me by snaking an arm around to the small of my lower back and pulls me in an awkward position where his face is right over mine. \"I'm gonna have a talk with your daddy, about your attitude toward me,\" he says and immediately lets me go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, over here!

A/C doesn't work, windows don't work, and he took the wrong turn too,\" I say, more akin to a whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcus! Come on, at least fix the thing before letting a woman ride in the passenger seat,\" Stephen exclaims. \"Seriously, man, she's drenched.\" Stephen guides me to the place where I'm pointing at, but halfway along the way, he gets concerned for me. \"Are you sure you don't want to freshen up, maybe get a shirt instead of this sweater?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, I want to refuse and just get to Mama Shin's, but given that Stephen is being generous, I give in. \"That's a good idea,\" I say. He takes me to a clothes shop, which is littered with stacks of tourist-type of stuff, including shirts, which dominated the sales floor. The A/C in the store is a refreshing feeling as the breeze wicks the sweat off my body. For a moment, I'm actually too cold that I shiver, but Stephen help by hugging me from the back. After warming up my arms, I continue shopping. I eventually go for a small T-shirt that's also black with gold accents. The shirt is made of a sporty material that helps to wick moisture from my body. Before we purchase the shirt, I get the idea of giving Stephen a new outfit to wear, since his short-sleeve button-up and khaki pants and loafers doesn't look right to me. It's something one wears on a semi-formal date, not to the beach. I pester him to get something for the beach, but unlike me, he refuses to give in. Even after we've purchased the shirt and exited the store, after poking him to get something more beach-y, he still refuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go to the bathroom to change into the shirt, leaving my sweater with Stephen. When I'm finished, I find Marcus and Stephen talking adamantly about something.

When you were getting Tyrone's box of bikinis, for a moment I was caught glancing at Marcus' naked chest and arms. He also caught me looking and giggling at his joke back at the house,\" I tell him out loud with my eyes just looking up at his mouth instead of his eyes. \"I guess I was caught up in the moment. I haven't been a woman for at least a day and already I was looking at the chest of the opposite sex and, well, I was attracted to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen pulls me into an embrace without letting our eyes meet. His warmth is a relief to how cold I'm getting directly underneath an A/C unit. We stay in this position for only a minute and I also pull him in closer. He takes my jaw with his hand and guides it to a kiss, where I'm literally on my toes. I give him a kiss of passion, somewhat wanting to tell him that I'm attracted to him either more or equal to how I'm attracted to Marcus, even though he's a cookie-cut replica of Tyrone. He breaks off the kiss and whispers into my ear. \"Why are we acting like this like we are children, baby?\" he asks me a somewhat rhetorical question. \"I know Marcus and he's a jerk, probably just like your friend Tyrone. This whole thing with you being attracted to him and you being with me is all trivial. I don't blame you for telling the truth. Heck, it's only been half a day you've been like this and your emotions are getting the best of you. Let's look at this like grown-ups. Let's just have brunch like none of this even happened. That cool with you, babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod in agreement, which gets me a kiss on the head. Stephen takes my hand, but I upgrade it an arm wrapped around his arm. As we're getting back to the group, I take deep breaths to get my emotions in check and with the sight of beach clothes passing before my eyes again, I ask Stephen, \"Are you ever gonna take off these clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooner than you think, baby. I'm hungry, so let's get our grub on,\" he says to me. At that moment, my stomach grumbles, but the environment is too loud to even hear it. I smile though, as if the growl in my belly is the comedic relief in these moments. My expression brightens up, even when we meet Marcus again and I deliver a playful, yet hard punch to his arm. He's taken aback by the move and I become the group's navigator again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pull Stephen to a large shack that's ornately decorated with a driftwood dragon on its roof. Mama Shin's was run by a South Korean couple who moved to the area to share their culture and fuse it with the local fare. We get there and we see that Sonya has already got us a table, which has a seaside view of the beach and the blue waters as well as the lengthening pier. Once we are settled, we immediately order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen then whispers in my ear, \"Let's share a meal, like a platter. Can we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama Shin does that all the time for couples,\" I say out loud. In the corner of my eye, I see Marcus, who has sat at the end of the table, lift his head and looks our way. \"We can just order two different orders and have them put it on a platter. That way, we can both taste different meals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two couples hear us and decide to do the same. When the waitress, a young Asian woman, comes over, we tell her our orders. As we wait, the men speak up about their ideas back at the house. They want to take us on a vacation, but they are not unanimous in their decisions. They decide to let the women of the group choose. Of the choices, Sonya, Isabella and I unanimously choose...?</span></div></div>",

Knowing the plans of going to Hawaii, I decide that I need to stock up on bikinis and swim wear, since probably half of our time in Hawaii, we'll be in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab bikinis of all colors and patterns, a couple of bathing suits that show as much design as it does expose skin. I also take some cute board shorts for me, if I ever try surfing. When I get back to Stephen, he too has selected a lot of shirts and shorts as well as a pair of slippers and said he has tried them all. We head to the cashier to purchase all of them, We come out of the store with two large bags of goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe find that with everything we bought plus the possible things the other part of our group could get, probably would not fit in the van that they took to get over here. Stephen tells me that it's actually Timothy's van and he doesn't have the keys to the trunk. This comes with a certain dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should we do? </span></div></div>",

We make our way down the pier to the street, constantly bickering on who should carry the bags. Stephen, a gentlemen, offers to carry both of the bags. I myself, who used to be a man, insist that I help him the bags by taking one so one arm can alleviate the other. In the end, he ends up with both of the bags since I forget that I'm weaker than I used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, at the street there is already a cab waiting for a fare. We load the bags in the back and get in. We ride home with the windows down, with the warm breeze rushing into the taxi. We arrive home in no time and when we get inside, we deposit the bags in the living room. In doing so though, I get to close to Stephen and when he turns to as he stands up, we run into each other, right into each others' arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intimate closeness as we stand there in silence is somewhat intoxicating. My breasts, through my sweater and the bikini I have on, are delightfully squished against his chest. I can feel something hardening in the shorts that he decided to wear out of that surf shop. Though we aren't looking into each others' eyes, I resort to just feeling the warmth of his breath. He resorts to smelling the aroma of my hair, even though I haven't showered before going to Mama Shin's. Our hands don't move, but just the fact that they are on his body and his hands are on mine is pleasant. We could stay here forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould we? Or should we head back to the beach and possibly bring another car? I don't even notice that I'm forgetting all this has happened because I got slap by a glove</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, without warning, all the windows and the door burst open. I hug Stephen more tightly, as if my fright from the blast and the shocking sounds around us kicks my instincts to protect Stephen into overdrive. I don't remember anything after that. All I can recall is that strong hands pry Stephen and I apart and my hands are tied together with zip-ties. I must have passed out or fainted from the shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up, finding my hands are still bound, but this time it's not a plastic zip-tie. This time, they are bound by real, thick metal cuffs with no space for my wrists to wriggle. They are suspended above my head and secured to a wall that I find myself leaning against. I'm still clothed in the bikini top and bottom, short khaki shorts and the hoodie, but over my head, a shroud or veil covers my vision. With my sight hindered, I use my hearing to figure out where I am. I sense that I'm in a room, but I'm alone. There is absolutely no other voice and no other sound for that matter. There are no horns honking or cars rushing past nor is there footsteps walking on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember about Stephen and wonder where he is. I become concerned for his safety and worry if he's alright after that interruption where the house of me and my roommates was broken into violently by who knows what. Unfortunately, I had my eyes closed at the time and I passed out soon thereafter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door opens and someone walks in. In fact, I hear two sets of footsteps walk onto the tiled floor underneath my feet. Sounds like they are wearing loafers or leather shoes of some kind. They start to speak and I want to speak as well, but find that I cannot, for my mouth has been taped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was the one with Stephen West. She was in an intimate embrace with in the house we broke into. She's like his girlfriend or something,\" one voice says. It seems he was there when a group of people violently broke into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lab results show otherwise,\" the other voice speaks. He has somewhat of a geek or nerdy accent that I pick up right away. \"The bloodwork and DNA point to a direct file of the identity of Cesar West, who is Stephen West's son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His son?\" the first voice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong. Further tests tell me that the blood that was sampled and tested told me the blood belonged to a woman, but the DNA is an identical match to Cesar West,\" the second voice explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief silence between the two ensues, but that is for the owner of the first voice to simply approach me and take off the shroud from my head. Hair falls in front of my eyes and for a moment, I cannot see the two visitors in front of me. The owner of the first voice uses a finger to tuck the hair out of my hair and behind my ears. My eyes fail me and I discover that not only my mouth is taped up, but my eyes are blinded, but not with a blindfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who has taken off the shroud, takes my jaw in his hand and talks to me. \"It must suck not being able to speak or see, but there are worse thing than sight or speech. You've have your fun, boy... girl... whatever you are,\" he says to me and suddenly a slap is delivered to my cheek and in a fraction of a second, the light from the room and the colors enter my eye. I can finally see, but it's a shock to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the blurring fades and my vision clears, I see the two men in front of me. My expectations are correct. Judging from their voices, the one who had slapped me with the glove that I see on his hand is a man with a rough look on his face. He wear a tactical uniform of all black. His companion, dressed in a white lab coat and semi-casual wear underneath completes his look with a pair of glasses on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door, which is to my left, opens and in comes in a third person. My eyes widen in shock. This person is familiar. Who could it be?</span></div></div>",

Dressed in a black dress suit with stockings and heels is none other than my mother. She walks past the two men right in front of me and they cease their private conversation with each other. She walks right up to me and looks straight into my eyes. I stare right ack at her and suddenly, I get a slap across my cheek. Since she wasn't wearing the glove, I don't have much to fear of me being changed right before my eyes, but it still hurts nonetheless. I'm left gasping for breathing with a stinging sensation on my left cheek. To add, she rips the tape off my mouth for good riddance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have fun, little girl?\" my mother scolds me. \"I had my hopes up ever since one of my technicians took the glove and gave it to your friend Tyrone. We've had our eyes on it ever since. I thought you would be the one to stop it, but no, you get yourself turned into this. Not only that, but you dragged your father into this mess, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was all my idea,\" I say, trying to shift the blame off of Tyrone, even though he betrayed me, as well as everyone else. \"It was me who told Tyrone to get the glove from that technician and also to turn me into a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Highly unlikely, since this glove is a cutting-edge piece of technology,\" my mother explains. \"Not only does it change the person who is slapped by the glove, but it also notes who is using the glove, what command was given, whether it is out loud or thought, and how the command was given. We would know whether someone asked him to turn you into a woman as well as if he was reluctant while he slapped you or he did it out of his own free will. We've made so that every time it's used, we're updated on its activity. But nice try, trying to be the hero.\" She turned and gestures for the glove, which she puts on her left hand rather than her right. Before our eyes, the glove becomes ambidextrous and changes from a right-handed glove to a left-handed on. \"Your father is to blame too. Not only does he sleep with you, but he also changes you into a woman he's attracted to. As if he didn't even consider coming back to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you left him--!\" I say, but I'm interrupted violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mother delivers another slap, this time to my right cheeks, using the same hand that isn't gloved. She delivers a back hand strike that seems to give me an intensified stinging sensation. I deduce that this could be because of her nails. \"Is that what he told you, girl?\" she scolds me with a question. \"It looks more like he left me, since he climbed into bed with you and turned you into what you are now. I only left him on short-notice because of my job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she is explaining her side of the story, two men dressed in the same uniform as the guy in the tactical gear is wearing, drag my bound father... Stephen into the room. It looks like he had received a slight beating, judging from a cut eyebrow and a busted lip. They simply drop him to the floor right behind the two men in front of me and leave the room as soon as they appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stephen--!\" I call out, but I'm once again interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mother, who had turned to watch the two men drag my father in, jabs her elbow into my stomach as she hears me call out, knocking the wind out of me. Stephen sees this through the corner of his eyes and with a struggling voice, calls out to me, \"Rosa!\" He tries to worm his way towards me, but the man in tactical gear prevent another word from coming out by kicking him. Stephen rolls onto his back after being kicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lovely pair of impromptu lovebirds. All it took was someone to turn you into a woman to make you two a couple. Did you ever think about me?\" my mother says, turning around to look at me. \"Well, with this glove in my hand, I'm going to try hard to think about you.\" She looks between me and Stephen, as if choosing a victim for the glove. Which of us does she use the glove on and what kind of command does she give the glove?</span></div></div>",

But she turns on her heel and goes over to Stephen. She pushes the man in tactical gear aside and with her left hand, she delivers a slap with a silent command. It's the effect the glove has Stephen that makes it more than silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change is almost instantaneous and with the shrinking of clothes and body alike, I already know what kind of command my mother had in store for her husband. Stephen's muscles disappear as well as the hardness in his shorts. The shorts shrink to fit the waist of a female. The hair on his body recedes, smoothing out his arms and legs, which thin out and tone and take shape to the form of a woman respectively. His tan skin lightens into a light tan. His shirt becomes small and fits to his... her new torso, which sports two breasts and rise and fall with every breath that she breathes. Every inhale and exhale is a struggle, but there is no preventing the change. There is nothing that I nor Stephen can do about the change now. To finish his female form, his short hair on his head lengthens into straight black and his facial features take shape to that of an Asian woman that is the same ago as me. If I had a mirror handy, I would assume he would look just like me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike me after getting slapped by Tyrone, Stephen falls into a deep slumber, so deep that not even a kick to the side by an iron-toe boot would wake the woman bound on the floor up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoist Stephanie up like Rosa and leave them here for the night. Leave the door unlocked as well. You can blind them or gag them however you see fit,\" my mother says, taking the glove off and handing it to the man in tactical gear. My mother then leaves the room, taking the man in the white lab coat with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man left in the room takes a roll of duct tape and goes over to me first. \"Whatever happens tonight, I want you to see it with your own damn eyes. People will be sleeping, so I'm going to shut your mouth with this. Same thing with your sister over there. It's a good thing she's asleep,\" the man says to me. He rips a piece of tape and places it over my mouth. I struggle and resist, but all that gets me is a hard punch to the stomach. \"Feisty indeed. All that tells me is that you like it rough in bed. I wonder. Did Stephen at all take your virginity as he was a man? If he didn't, he missed out.\" He does the same to Stephanie, but also takes a moment to fondle her breasts from underneath his shirt. I try to shout, but with the tape over my mouth, all that comes out is a quiet muffle. \"Save your voice, bitch. You'll need it later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaves the room and closes the door behind him. Following my mother's command, he leaves the door locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passes and then another. In this awkward position, I slowly doze off and enter a brief slumber. It's when I hear noises in the hallway outside, I wake up and start to alert myself to my surroundings. I look in front of me and see Stephanie still asleep, from the effects of the glove. The sound of the door opening alerts me and I dart my eyes from Stephanie to the door. Who, or what comes in?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door opens and into the room files a group of eight to ten men dressed in the same tactical uniforms as the men I saw hours before, albeit with things missing. They do not carry guns either slung around their bodies or settled in holsters. Weapon magazines for rifles, submachine guns and pistols are missing from the pockets in the vests and harness. Pretty much everything that may weigh a soldier down is removed from the uniform. One last person enters and it's none other than that guy who punched me in the stomach hours earlier. Unlike his men, he wears only the BDU the men wear underneath the harnesses and vests. The men stand in a straight line facing each other, like they were going to make a bridge between me and Stephanie. My eyes dart to the leader, who has the glove on his right hand. He walks up to me and slaps me without warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can only groan and hiss as I breathe through my nostrils. Just what did he do to me with the glove? I somehow have a desire to kick him and I somehow know exactly where and how to do so. I also somehow have the knowledge how to counter and block if he ever chooses to strike a blow. Which he does. I spot his leg start to quiver and I watch it come up, as if in slow-motion. I spread my legs and like a vice, clamp his leg to stop it from rising any further. All I hear is a giggle from him, and he thrusts a fist straight in front of him, landing a deep punch into my stomach. The grip in my legs weakens and he gains his leg back. I'm left groaning and couch through my closed mouth as he recoils back out of range of any of my attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wondering what I slapped you with?\" the man says, mockingly. I just glare at him with heated eyes. \"I slapped you with Kung Fu, literally. It's why you didn't know how to clamp my leg, but now you do.\" He turns to the closest man to his right. \"Bring her down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man goes over to the gallows-type structure that's holding me up and disengages the mechanism that binds my wrists above my head. With it disengaged, my body weight pulls me down and I'm leveled on the soles of my feet, but since I've been in this position for a long time, I sink to my knees but the reflexes in my arms break my fall and prevent my torso and my head from getting injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I slapped you with some my knowledge of Kung Fu. So, now I want to see if you can fight me. Ready?\" the man says and after his question, he gets in a fighting stance. I do the same, out of some inherent desire to best him in a sparring match, getting to my feet and into a similar starting stance. He starts the match by rushing forward and reaching out an outstretched foot to nail a blow to my torso. I sidestep out of the way, resulting in his foot to stomp heavily on the ground where I used to stand. He's quick to counter his own mistake and after finding me at his side, he delivers a backhand strike with his arm, as if to break a wooden board to his side. He hits me square on the stomach again and I'm sent crashing backwards, clutching my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man readies himself again and with the rage within me boiling, I get to my feet, even if it's a struggle, and ready myself as well. This time, without warning, I lunge at him and try to do a roundhouse kick. He blocks with a sturdy arm, which he counters by grabbing my leg and throwing me to the hard floor onto my stomach. He tries to play dirty by kicking me while I'm down, like he did with Stephen, but I see the shadow of his form blocking the light and I roll out of the way and back onto my feet. I try a barrage of punches, but with each thrust, he meets and either blocks it or counters it, giving him an opening to strike at a vital area. We only fight for what seems like ten minutes, each time with me on the ground. After the eleventh minute, I'm on my stomach, clearly out of breath, but my pride fueling my rage and creating more and more opening for the man to strike a stunning blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I mention that I only slapped you with some of my knowledge of Kung Fu. I certainly did not do all of it, or else you would have beaten me in the first minute. I just wanted to see if you wear agent material,\" the man explains. \"I slapped you with the knowledge and moves to strike, but not to blow or counter. It seems you didn't learn anything from that. So, are you done, or do you some left in you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this it for me? Should I just give up? Or should I show him I still have it in me and continue to fight?</span></div></div>",

When I place my hands on the ground to push myself from this sunken plank position, a voice calls out from the hallway. The voice is loud and commanding and just by listening to it, the man before lets his guard down. The opening is there, but I'm too tired to even ready myself to strike. I slump down to the floor with my head facing the door, which opens. My vision goes hazy as a figure comes into the room. All I can do now is listen to the exchange between the man who just arrived and the man who beat me to a pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sent the greenhorn trainer to a replace, me?\" the man says to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Central has given me custody over Rosario and Stephanie.

The younger man says to me, \"Get up!\" He walks over to the contraption that is suspending Stephanie from the ground and releases the locks on her wrists. He swiftly grabs her and slings her over his shoulder. I try to push myself up, but it's a struggle and I can barely even push just one arm. A strong arm grabs me and slings me over another shoulder. I look around and though my vision is still blurry, I see the mess of hair on Stephanies head. The man holding us walks over to the door and uses his feet to open it. He takes us down the hallway to an elevator, but that all I see before my fatigue takes a hold of me and I slowly dip into a slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I wake up, I find myself in a bed and once again, I'm naked.

The most notable one is the warmth I feel on the front of my body, notably, my breasts, abdomen and the front of my thighs. The skin on my body brushes against and even presses against a warm body with soft skin that is curled up in front of me. It feels nice just to hold and embrace and for a second, I almost sink into another slumber after finding this newfound comfort. I catch myself and let go, rotating my head around to see my surroundings. It seems we are in a large bedroom with large windows that give spectacular views of a tropical island. Judging from the canopies that I see, this room must be elevated off the ground or the rest of the building is underneath us. I recall before dozing off on the shoulder of the man who carried us out of that first room, that we were going down an elevator. How the heck did I end up in this elevated bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy attention is drawn back to the body in front of me. Long black hair, soft tan skin, the shape of a woman. This is none other than Stephanie, the woman who my father Stephen turned into. Now he probably can relate to what I'm feeling right now and soon he would wake up to find himself... herself as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awake yet?\" a voice calls out from somewhere in the room. When I sit up in the bed, I find a young man, probably a year or two older than my age, standing near a staircase that sits against one wall of window panes. This one in particular shows a distant beach with the treeline not far from the water. The man tosses to me what seems like a stack of clothes. \"Get dressed and meet me downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can protest or ask a question, he disappears down the stairs. I discover just by listening to his voice that the open ceiling and the windows seems to bounce sounds around. If I called out to him with a shout, I could easily wake up Stephanie, who seems to be enjoying her slumber in innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take myself out of bed and do what the man tells me to do. Upon getting to my feet, I find this band on my ankle that doesn't look like it could be taken off easily, even with tools. An identical band is found on my arm, on the opposite side to where the band on my ankle would be. It sits snug on my thin arm, near to my armpit and just below the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI proceed to put on clothes, finding the garments provided looking nothing like the outfit I was wearing yesterday. No bright colors and no bikinis. Instead, I find a sports bra that when I put it on, tends to squish my medium-sized breasts so that they don't wobble. It does give shape to my chest though. For my bottom, a matching thong is pair with the sports bra. It has the same comfortable material that gives me the illusion that I'm wearing nothing but a soft bad against my crotch. The next garment is a two-piece track suit. I put it on with ease and after finding no shoes with the stack of clothes, I make my way to the stairs and proceed to climb down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stairs lead me down to a spacious (or empty) living room. It could be a foyer, but judging from the environment outside, this place was tailored made to bring luxury (or some of it) to a deserted island. I make my way to a clearing that has no amount of furniture blocking it. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

I already have one in mind. The particular woman has the features of a stereotypical Asian woman: light skin, slanted eyes, long hair... but with some differences. She has an hourglass figure with a voluptuous butt and a larger set of breasts. I could say they are D cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here goes,\" my father says and without any more warning, he delivers a slap across my cheek and I'm actually sent careening over to the side of the bed, falling to the floor. I take the blankets with me and when I fall, I unwittingly cover myself with the blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, girl, are you okay?\" my father asks as he tries to dig me out of the mass of blankets. He grabs my hand and pulls me out from underneath, but when he exposes me to the light, he doesn't see the girl I was before. In fact, when his eyes widen and seem to light up, my eyes are directed to the closet doors, which acts like a mirror. In the reflection, I see an exotic figure. She's definitely Asian with the light skin and the slanted eyes, but what makes her look unique and exotic is the long, wavy blonde hair that flows from the top of her head and drapes over her shoulders eventually ending about halfway down her back and chest. Her chest is to be mentioned as well, since it's not the stereotypical flat chest or small perky breasts like most Asian women. The bust on this woman is just like I imagined. Full, round mounds which are covered by the wavy blonde locks. The woman's figure is indeed an hour glass. Her waist is slim, but her hips are wide. I spin my lower body around and in the reflection, the woman shows off a round booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just think that one up yourself?\" my father asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn to him and I realize what just possibly happened. I ask, \"You didn't make me like this? What were you thinking about when you slapped me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I simply chose to slap the woman you wanted to become into you. I guess the glove did its work and was specific about it,\" he says as he turns me back around so that I'm again facing the mirror. He places gentle hands onto my shoulders and slowly he runs them underneath my locks, lifting them from my body and placing them behind me. This exposes my wonderful breasts, which he wastes no time in taking into his hands, a breasts in each. He squeezes them gently and then hard the next, but every sensation is new and pleasurable. I find the woman's face closing his eyes and smiling as she feels this experience done to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom my breasts, his hands run along the curvature of my side, the middle of the hourglass, so to speak. His hands near my hips and he takes them to my ass cheeks. He aggressively squeezes one and then the other and then he slaps one and again with the other. Both sensations unusually feels good. Is this body naughty by default? He could continue to send sensation throughout my body, but should I stop him?</span></div></div>",

He used the gloved hand to part my hair and toss it over to the other side so that he can see my face. \"I somehow got a message telling me to visit my son at his house.

After the fifteen seconds, I somehow begin to like this, being underneath a weight that I cannot get away from, being handled with strong arms, being a woman kissed by a man. It's unfamiliar, but to me, at this moment, it isn't wrong. My tension eases and I relax and soon, I begin to kiss my father back. My legs spread and I wrap them around my father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith him being in control, all I could so is wait until he comes up for air. He does so after what seems like an hour (which in actuality, is only a couple minutes). He lifts his head, separating the kiss and the look I have on my face seems to be that of pure euphoria, since he tells me, \"You were changed into a woman just a few hours ago and already, you're loving it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my eyes and embarrassed to speak, I can only manage to simply bite my lip since the euphoria still takes it toll on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father rolls off of me and climbs out of the bed, covering me like a gentlemen. I sit up and manage to get a word out. \"Wait. Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get you some clothes, I want to show you something, but first you need to cover up,\" my father says. \"I can't believe I have to take care of a daughter instead of a son now. You're no longer Cesar. I think I can call you Rosario, Rosa for short. We have to get you learning how to be a lady, alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father goes to Tyrone's closet and finds a box that has an assortment of bikinis. He finds a black two-piece set and tosses it to me. He also grabs from the floor a T-shirt and a short pair of shorts and tosses them to me as well. He smiles before leaving the room, a sign that he's still a gentleman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately get dressed, noting the struggle it is to fasten the ties behind me. The bottom of the bikini is fine, but I do have to sit down and put it on like a diaper to do so. After both pieces are on, I check myself out and find that I do somehow look like my mother, and like my father says, with a more appealing and attractive figure. No doubt a more younger version of herself with no evidence of having a baby. That gets me thinking. Since I'm a woman and no longer a man, I assume I'm susceptible to getting pregnant and I tell myself that I have to be more careful from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finish my outfit by putting on the T-shirt, which is black with a Blue Scholars graffiti on the front, exactly like the one I wore before getting slapped by the glove. Also the shorts, which are dangerously close to showing off the bottom of my ass cheeks, is almost like the shorts I was wearing before being transformed into this sexy figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce my outfit is done, I go for the door and open it, finding my father standing right outside. He hears me exit and says, \"Hey, Rosa. Come look, this is what I wanted you to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat has he have to show me?</span></div></div>",

When we approach, the sounds of sexual pleasure being to be heard and once we round the half-wall that separates a hallway from the living room, I see a black woman and a Hispanic woman being fucked by several guys. On the couches, I see Sonya with her father, just watching the spectacle before them. Sonya's sitting sideways on her father's lap, one of her arms wrapped around his shoulders. Her father, I believe his name was Paul, caresses her smooth legs with one hand and cradles her lower back and ass with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father leads me to the other couch and has me straddle his lap, with me facing away from him and towards the scene before us. He leans forward, wraps his arms around my stomach and nestles is head on my shoulder. Being hugged by a human teddy bear does have its perks and it actually feels good to be embraced like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet Tynisha and Carla, Rosa,\" my father says into my ear. His breath tickles my neck and he giggles with me. \"It was my decision to change them and it was their own fathers' decision to degrade them like this, so I'm am not to blame. I feel you are too precious to defile. As for Tyrone, who turned both you and Sonny into women, needed to know how well and how much karma bites back. To show you my trust, I give you the right to wear this glove.\" My father pulls the glove off his hand and gives it to me. \"This is a powerful tool and to my knowledge doesn't mess with free will. It just messes with everything else. I could try to resurrect your mother with this, but I don't think that's wise. What do you think we should do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" I say after thinking about it for five minutes while I watched Carla and Tynisha become sexual targets. Tynisha straddles her father, his dick most likely in her vagina. A younger male, probably around Tyrone's former age, does his job behind the black woman, struggling to hold his load in as he fucks her ass. Yet another black male, who I recognize is Tyrone's uncle, occupies Tynisha's time by letting her suck his cock. The same goes for Carla, who sits on her father's cock and is being tended to by two young Hispanic men. \"Can the decision wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father contemplates what we could do. \"Perhaps. Maybe after some dinner and some better clothes we can discuss some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do we get dinner and clothes?</span></div></div>",

Once on my feet, I find that I'm a lot shorter than my usual self. The breasts on my chest, which rise and fall with each breath, add a certain weight that make my sense of balance awkward. I almost trip and lean dangerously towards the closed closet. A fortunate feeling is what I feel despite having the weighted melons on my chest. If I still had by dick, I probably would have fallen already, but with nothing to hinder my wider hips and wider thighs, I can walk, but in a certain way of course. \"I'll say it again, because I can, but you so look like your mother when I was dating her,\" my father says, drawing my attention back to him. \"Well, she didn't sport the long, wavy hair like you and I can honestly say your breasts are more shapely, as well as your thighs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough I am free from my father's grasp, I'm not entirely free from everything else. I'm no longer the man I used to me. Heck, I have boob and a vagina in place of a dick. I'm certainly not free from the monthly struggles and I'm certain not in the perfect shape to gain an advantage over men. I start to slowly walk back to the bed, where my father resorts to just sitting up with his lower half covered by the blanket. I sit beside him, finding his presence not at all that awkward like minutes earlier. When he slides his hands up and down my arms and traces along my spine, I don't protest or move away. In fact, I stay still, loving the way he is touching me. I somehow ignore the fact that he is my father and what he may be doing is considered incest. I come to an understanding that this man is someone who my mother cherished and loved and since I'm now a woman like my mother, and probably one who looks almost identical to her, I'm someone who can return those feelings back to my father, and probably relive days I haven't seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you thinking about, baby?\" he asks me affectionately.

The fact that he's clothed causes my mind to relax and I assume neither he nor Tyrone have taken advantage over my new form. He stands at the side of the bed, facing away from me, decent enough to not look at his naked son... no, daughter. I take this chance to sit up and clutch at the sheets in order to cover up, at the very least, my bare chest. It's my first time looking down upon them, seeing them in their round, bouncy state. As I hold fast the sheets to my breasts, I can tell they are firm, but have a pillow-like softness to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father's voice turns my attention to him. \"So you say you fell asleep or were knocked out by Tyrone's slap, am I right?\" my father asks, not turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but now that I think about it, where is he and the rest of my roommates?\" I ask, but quickly realize the dangerous potential of anyone who has the glove and add, \"And where is the glove?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean this glove?\" he asks and turns around to reveal from his pocket a plastic bag with a familiar piece of apparel, one of which is missing its mirrored twin. It's none other than the glove, sealed in a Ziploc bag. I'm too surprised to speak and it's my father's voice that ultimately calms me down. He explains, \"You can say it was coincidence that myself and your uncles came when we did. We found your roommate Tyrone with the glove, slapping Ricky with it. Ricky's father could already see the changes that were added or removed to him, not to mention that Sonny, now a female, was in on it. Tyrone's father, after noticing you weren't there, sort of lost his cool and tackled Tyrone so that he take the glove from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean, then?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not in trouble. Most of the blame is put on Tyrone and since it's mostly his fault, he was more deserving of most of the punishment,\" he tells me, sitting down on the side of the bed. I can only imagine what kind of punishment Tyrone was going to get. I wouldn't be surprised to find Tyrone in a female body like myself and being forced to submit to the male of his father. \"But it's too much to tell. You must be hungry.

Getting yourself dressed and meet me in the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I say and allow my father to exit the room, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get out of bed, uncovering the sheets to reveal my nakedness to the privacy of my room.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I look through all the bags, laying out every piece of fabric on the loveseat in the room. A whole wardrobe containing enough pieces to make three full outfits for differing occasions, but with the possibility to mix and match and create countless combinations. The last bag contained some risque items and wondered if the female Sonny or his... her father or the other fathers had the nerve to obtain this item. The garment was a piece of lingerie, something that was either called a bustier or babydoll. It was like a bra, but had some fabric attached to it that would cover one's stomach rather than expose it. The garment, which had straps that would straddle the wearer's shoulders, had cups that more or less supported or pushed up the wearer's breasts. White lacy accent adorned the front in an elegant design that would caused the front of the piece to pop. And it wasn't alone, for it came with a matching panty, but it more like a thong, where the piece of light fabric at the back would be considerably thinner than the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't ask me why, but I found myself drawn to the garment. Without delay, I slipped it onto my body, allowing the fabric to gently hug the sides of my torso and otherwise not be a bother to my skin in terms of how tight it was. It wasn't constricting, but it wasn't baggy or saggy either. It more or less accentuated my figure. I slipped my arms under the straps, letting them rest on my shoulders. My breasts sank and nestled into the cups of the garment, more supporting them than pushing them up. It did in a way caused them to push inwards together, creating a voluptuous cleavage that caught my eye every time I look down to the floor. The bottom of the hem molded to my figure and I realized that this body I now had had the hourglass shape that many women grew envious for. Even my butt was bigger than my male butt was and every time i would look behind to behold my ass with my eyes, I found that not even the babydoll I was wearing, which ended one or two inches from my waist, could not even hide my thighs or my ass cheeks. Putting the panty on didn't help either. All it did was cover my unfamiliar crotch and the thin fabric nestled between my cheeks rather comfortably. It was still unfamiliar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of me felt my outfit was not complete, though a part of me felt that it was enough. Yes, my belly was covered as well as my private areas, but what was left exposed was my arms, most of my legs and thanks to my long, brunette hair, even half of my back was not covered. But the fact that I was technically half-naked did not stop my latter self from walking to the door of the room and opening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I walked into the living room, I found that there wasn't much that had changed. The only things that have changed was, of course, myself, Sonny, maybe even Tyrone and Ricky. But wherever they were, they were not here. The only people in the house was myself and my father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I knew my father was in the kitchen, for the aromas that wafted from the kitchen was what drew me to the area. I entered the kitchen without my sense of sight, as my eyes closed and caused me to drown in the smells of breakfast. I stood in the threshold, leaning against the opening. My father's voice would break me out of my reverie. \"You look like you're ready to enjoy your new self,\" he said. I shook my head, letting the light from the window flood my eyes. When my eyes adjust, I see my father standing at the table, a platter of food in his hand. For a moment I catch him in awe of what he sees, but he breaks his gaze and says, \"Just in time. I was going to eat at the table, but if you'd like to eat somewhere else, I'll be glad to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should we eat?</span></div></div>",

Since I'm the smaller one, I should be the quicker, swifter one, but I'm shocked to see how fast he uses his strength to gain the advantage. Underneath the sheets, we are basically wrestling, and I'm the one losing. From the position we are currently in, my father shifts his weight, so that he is on one side of me. In quick succession, he takes one of his arms and gathers my arms and pins them behind my back. This sort of move could dislocated my arms from the shoulder sockets, but I find that he's incredibly gentle... or that I don't move an inch to resist, fearing I would do the dislocating with my frustration. I discover what position he has me in. With both of my arms disabled, I cannot do much except kick, which is not effective since he's behind me. He has a free arm which he could use to do anything to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe first uses it to trace along my skin and I'm forced to breathe deeply, finding my own body is betraying me. How can something so trivial and easy feel so good. His finger trace from my arm to my shoulder. Along the way, he plants a soft, yet firm kiss on my nape and also plants one behind my ear. I feel his warmth breath against my neck, as if he was a warm-blooded vampire. The finger that had continued to trace finds it way down the front of my body, down between my breasts and stopping to rest underneath my right one. The finger turns into a grasp and he massages the bottom of the breasts. My eyelids start to get heavy and I can't help but close my eyes and feel everything he is doing to me. Eventually the hand the base traces its way up the mounds and poke and twist at the nipples at their peaks. I start to hiss, finding the twisting on my erect nipples hurts just as much as it is aroused. Once the right one is fondled, the hand moves to the other and the sensation is exactly the same, if not more pleasurable. My body starts to relax more, so much more that my head starts to rest on the pillow which it had hovered over previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, baby,\" my father whispers into my ear. \"This is how you're supposed to feel when someone touches you like this. It's definitely not wrong in my book, so don't feel guilty that you're feeling wonderful.\" He let's go of me and also distances himself to one side of the bed. \"So do you want more or do you want to stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I choose?</span></div></div>",

I glance my view to the side to respect his privacy. I also use my arms to cover my breasts, which I have yet to observe on my own. He uses his hands to guide me onto my stomach and puts a pillow underneath my head. I rest my head in its fluffiness and he tells me, \"Just relax, baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to relax, but I can't get past the awkwardness that I'm a woman who used to be a man and that I'm in bed with an older man who seems to be my biological father. A pairing like this should send us to hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a firm pair of fingers that calms me down. My father applies pressure on my spine, starting from my nape to my tailbone. I find that I'm for sure naked with no panty or sorts to cover my lower regions. His finger lifts and goes back to the top of my spine and as the pressure is dragged from top to bottom, I'm forced to relax. I'm forced to remind myself to relax. My father also repeats himself, \"You have to relax if you want to learn to like it.\" After he tells me to relax, he position my arms forward, and I pull them out of the way, letting them cradle my head with the pillow over them as they cross before me. I rest the side of my head to the pillow and allow myself to breathe in and out deeply. \"There you go, girl,\" he says to me before moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe follows up with his large, warm hand, which gentle rub against my shoulders and my neck. His fingers and his palms apply deep pressure to my muscles, which seem to get rid of any tension as well as warm them up as well. I catch myself uttering a muffled moan, since the soreness is slowly being eased away. The same hands move down, applying lighter pressure to my shoulder blades for a minute before moving down. My father's hands, as if from a potter, presses against the shape of my side, using his thumb as an anchor which slowly drags along my spine while his fingers squeeze the sides of my abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now I'm breathing heavily in and out, though not in a distressed kind of way. Irregularly, I let out a moan that lets my father know that what he is doing to me is doing its job in helping me to relax. \"Do you like it?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI answer, \"Yes. I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to spend this summer as a woman? I'll help you in anyway you can,\" he asks and assures me. He also stops his massaging and lays down next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" I answer. \"I don't know if I can truly deal with being a woman and the fact that I'm liking what you're doing to me even though you're my dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. What you have done, whether bad or good, as a son does not apply, since you are now a woman. Hell, you can be my mistress for all I care. Even my new girlfriend,\" he jokes with several chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't joke about that. What would mom say?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what would mom say if you were a daughter and not a son? What would she say if I was in bed with a younger woman? Doesn't it say, 'Til Death do us part?' When mom died, our marriage was finished. I chose to stay single after that,\" he tells me as he traces his finger along my spine before rubbing my whole back with his warm hand. It keeps me relax and keeps my head clear. \"I would say that since you are an adult, you can make the decisions. I will only help you out at times, but it's up to you to decide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I decide to do?</span></div></div>",

Instead I crawl up to him, press my body against his and plant a small kiss on his lips. Despite him being my father and despite me being a woman in bed with an older man, I decide to accept this fate. I accept the fact that there is a possibility I can't change back and that I would have to live the rest of a my life, not only this summer, like this woman. At the very least, I'm a beautiful woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI separate the kiss and still see a surprised expression on his face. \"You're going to stay like this and not only that, you'll let yourself be my new girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI answer with a smile and a cute giggle, before relaxing my head on his shoulder. I feel the chuckles through his chest and a resonating vibration that my woman's intuition tells me is a sign of contentment. He rolls over so that he is again directly on top of me, his weight growing from unfamiliar and awkward to something along the lines of pleasant. My arms wrap around him as well as my legs, and I seem to meld with him under the covers. I close my eyes not in embarrassment in the current position we are in, but to close off one sense so that other senses can be amplified. My father (heck, I need to stop calling the man I'm bed with that honorific title), I assume, sees this and begins to kiss along my neck and around my collar. The sensations I feel in my relaxed state causes me to arch my back, rising my breasts so that my nipples lightly touch along his chest. The rising of my bust allow him to bury his face in between the two mounds of flesh, making me feel a bunch of new, pleasant sensations, which I want to continue. To do so, I pull on his head and press him harder into my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifts his head in response and plants a passionate kiss onto my lips, which I reciprocate with my own, somehow forgetting that this is my father I'm kissing and I was a man just a few hours ago.

I contemplate those words for the longest time. None of us moves an inch and just lay there. My father, who I have to refer to now as my lover, who lays on a weak base, but is saved by the mattress. And I, who is pinned underneath this weight, which by now has become pleasant. I'm immobile, but it's a good thing. Somehow, my psyche changes instantly, not wanting to be dominant, but desiring to be submissive, under control, and His control. He drifts off into a deep sleep minutes after I do so. His breath from his nostrils is warm, yet cool seconds later as it blows against my neck. It's like a lasting kiss that doesn't come from his lips. In the moment before I too drift off to sleep, I silently admire the body that I'm stuck under. I trace his skin with my fingers as well as run my finger gently through his dark hair, smelling the shampoo that he must have washed his hair with. I also observe how my breasts are crushed underneath his chest, how they are flattened, but in a good way. Also, I cannot forget how one of his legs sit between my legs, putting a bit of pressure on the flush crotch I have, but also allowing my thigh to feel his manhood underneath his boxers. In response, I bite my lips, both embarrassed and thrilled this is happening to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnusually, my reluctance of continuing on as a woman is thwarted with just the closeness and heaviness of this person on top of me. Eventually, I too, fall asleep, though into a series of dreams, all escalating from good to bad to terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first dream I find myself in has me on the white sands of a beach resort. The sun is hot and beats down on my skin, which, even though it heats me up and tans me, coupled with a cool sea breeze, becomes pleasantly warm. Cool hands, cooled by sun tan lotion, belongs to none other than my lover, who uses his weight and his dexterity to ease me into another dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I close my eyes, I find myself on my back, but underneath me both my arms have been intricately tied behind my back using rope. Whoever has tied died, has tied them in such a way that it would be virtually impossible for me to fight or even wriggle my way out. A masked man spreads my legs and places something on the void between them. Out of this comes both pain and pleasure. In my pleasure, I roll my eyes back, but in doing so, I transport myself into another dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of the dreams, I feel like I'm on all fours with a peculiar scent in my nostrils. My belly ravages for food, which drives me to run faster than I can possibly run towards a particular object. This certain object has that scent and it is revealed to be a male deer, who has matured with two large antlers on his head. I can somehow smell the fear of him as he is cornered to a steep cliff. He stands there, shifting from a flight response to a fight response. Even though he'll be killed, he won't go down without a fight. He does go down, but with a blood-curdling pounce from the side. The thing that takes it down is not a wolf, nor is it a tiger or some big cat. The creature, silhouette by some light behind it, stands on two legs and becomes a humanoid being. My vision fades and slowly I come to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I wake up, how do I wake up?</span></div></div>",

I'm can do little to stop him from caressing me, so I just lay there and accept it. I also try to keep my moans and gasps to a minimum, so I bury my face into my pillow.

Once on my feet, I look for my clothes. Tyrone must have stripped me and put me in this bed. I try to assume they are on the floor around the bed, but all I find is the clothes of a man. A long-sleeve button up shirt in white lays near a pair of dress slacks. Thinking that it's the best thing here that will cover me up, I pick it up and put it on. As a woman, being shorter than I previous was, I find that the shirt is more or less like a dress with long sleeves. The sleeves extend farther than my arm can reach through them, but all I have to do is roll them up and fasten the button at the end of the sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that's done, I just button up the shirt and to double check, I look into the mirror. The bottom of the shirt covers my ass, but a cool breeze blows between my legs, making me aware of nothing covering the void between them.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I pull the door open finding just an empty living room. The place is quiet. No sign of the fathers of my roommates and no sign or my roommates either. Not to mention no sign of the glove that changed me into this woman. I look through the other bedrooms and find nobody, not a soul. I walk back into the living room and at once my stomach growls. I head straight for the kitchen and open up the fridge. Finding nothing inside has me assuming the rest of the occupants of the house raided this last night while I was out. Didn't my lover say that they were out getting clothes? Did they go out to shop for groceries as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI close the refrigerator and turn on my heel straight into what feels like a brick wall that is soothing to the touch. I land in the arms of my lover, surprising me by standing at my side without me knowing. As he embraces me, he guides me to the counter where he gets me on my toes and pins my ass to the edge of the counter. He plants a passionate kiss on my lips which I cannot break from. To keep him from mauling my lips with his, I kiss him back, which causes me to feel warm and fuzzy inside. He pins his body against mine, keeping me to the counter. He also takes my hands and keeps them behind me, so that the only things I can do is turn my head and speak to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you were too soft to be in my arms, baby,\" he tells me about his encounter with the pillow. \"Thinking you can get away from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hungry,\" I make an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right,\" he says and plants another kiss on my lips. I try to be quick and match his fervor, but at the moment, I'm outmatched. By the time we are done kissing, I'm left trying to catch my breath. My lover runs his hand into my hair which feels pleasant and I lean my head into his hand. \"It looks you are more than hungry. And the ones who made you this way seems to be more hungry than you are for food. Why would they turn you into this wonderful creature, huh?\" I look into his eyes, more focused on his question than his eyes. \"Could they be so famished as to ravage you into a carcass? Leave you so fatigued that if they came upon you again, they would eat you alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis questions are so poetic that I can barely understand let alone stop listening. He turns me around so that my back is turned to him, my body still pinned between the hard counter and this man. He keeps my hands tucked behind me, cuffed with his larger hand. With his other hand, he unbuttons two of the buttons from the top and takes the collar and pulls the shoulder of the shirt down, exposing my bare shoulder. He plants a soft and tender kiss on it, somehow sending shivers down my spine. How is my father, now my lover, well-versed in making love? He already has me relaxed in his clutches by his weight and poetry alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are more than a lovely carcass, a sensual cadaver that mere scavenger can only pick off scraps from. You are but an object to admire, to adore, to be beheld in ones gaze,\" he whispers into my ear. It alone relaxes my arms, which he lets go. Half of me wants to get away from him but the other half, which is more tempted and caught in the moment, wants to stay still and receive. I reach up to grab one of my breasts and he places his hand over it, adding to the weight applied upon it. He forces me to squeeze my own mound of flesh, unleashing a guttural moan from deep within me. \"That's it. Become one with your identity. You're no longer a man...\" His last phrase strikes something wrong with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI discover that I'm able to push back and get out of his clutches. He tries to grab me, but I strike him with a bare slap across the face. His arising expression is like if he had been knocked out of his senses. He doesn't retaliate and I can back away to the other side of the kitchen. I tell him, \"Sorry, dad... I mean... well... This is just going too fast for me.\" I turn on my heel and make my way to my own room. I enter it and close the door behind me. I climb into my bed, discarding the shirt along the way. I pull the sheets and blanets over me so that my nakedness is completely covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn my back to the door and look at the wall. I catch my breath, but no matter what I do, I cannot seem to remove the sensations or the poetic words from my ears. That's when I hear the door knob twist open and the hinges of the door creaking as it swings open. Just who has entered the room?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I want to be able to walk around and not just stay here in bed with my lover. I'm already rested and staying in bed just tests my patience. I have to get out of this position and remove myself from underneath this man, even though his weight upon me is pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking I could just roll myself over, he'll have the nerve to just let me go, so I try it. I push up with my left arm and just use my right arm to just support myself. Though, after managing to get halfway through my roll, I discover that rolling to my right only pins the arm wrapped around me under my own weight. Plus, it seems to have woken up my lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly I see him wake up and I freeze hoping he doesn't catch me in the act of escaping. His head rises, but still his eyes are closed. With his strength he easily repositions his arms so that both are underneath me. As if I'm not alive and cannot feel everything he does, he embraces me, burying his head in between my breasts. The sensations alone are unbearable and suddenly my supporting myself gives out. I land into his arm and my head drops into the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wakes my lover up and he opens his eyes and sees me very awake in his arms. \u201cHey, baby,\u201d he greets me with a smile. He lowers his lips onto mine and we kiss. His is full of passion and mine is regrettably is forced to reciprocate that passion. It's not even ten seconds later that my forced passion turns into real passion. He separates his lips from mine, but drops them onto my cheek, trailing a line of lovely nips and kiss down my neck to my breasts where he without warning takes the nipples into his mouth to suck on them. He uses his hands to squeeze each breast as he sucks on them. All I can do is inhale and exhale, though half the time I'm moaning due to him pleasuring me. He finally separates his mouth from my body to speak. \u201cDon't think I didn't catch up trying to escape from the bed. You weren't that desperate last night, naughty girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I---\u201d I try to make an excuse but can't say a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you learn to become a woman if you can't experience what a woman feels, baby,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd what are you going to wear? Last night we caught your roommates throwing away your clothes in the dumpster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe?\u201d I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou thought I came alone? Since the fathers of your roommates are my very good friends, we thought we could visit for one time. We didn't know that they would turn their roommate, my son, into a woman when we arrived,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo we punished them with a task to get you clothes. But in the meantime, they are not hear it seems, so you can't get out of this bed without putting something on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut don't try to get out of that bed naked. I'm make sure you stay in until we got something for you to wear, girl,\u201d he says and reached for something unseen at the side of the bed. He pulls out a bundle of rope which he immediately unbundles and ties my hands with. He makes an efficient pair of cuffs that surround my wrists and also another that ties my forearms together. \u201cDon't worry, baby. I'm not a sadistic person who gets off in hurting people. I just know how to tie rope. This way if you did want to get out, you would need me to untie you. Something as a woman, you need to depend on your man, and that's where I come in.\u201d He positions me onto my stomach and ties the rope to the headboard. For my comfort, he puts a pillow on my forearms so that if I wanted to, I could rest my head on the pillow. He also puts a pillow underneath my pelvis so my bottom is raised. He removes the blanket from the bed as well, exposing me to the cool of the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe goes over to my legs and spreads them so that they make a right angle. Using the bedposts at the foot of the bed, he uses more rope to tie my ankles to the bedposts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm actually kinda punishing you, but the good thing is, I'm not going to take your virginity. If you say that you got turned into a woman by someone slapping you, I'm guessing once you became a woman, you became a virgin. I'll probably someone else take it. I don't care about that really,\u201d he tells me. He gets up from the bed and puts his clothes back on. \u201cJust wait there, baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dressed he leaves the room and closes the door, but he doesn't lock it. I'm forced to wait in here exposed like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passes when the door is opened. Who comes in?</span></div></div>",

But how did I know what that smelled like? I open my eyes and instead of a ceiling, above me I see a overcast sky. The sun reveals itself behind a passing cloud which casts its warm rays on my cool skin. I'm naked. I know it by how the sun warms up every part of me, even places normally covered by fabric. I am also reminded by a gentle breeze that passes over me, cooling the places that grow too hot by the beating sun. Beneath me feels like a waxy plastic sheet, with grains of something I deduce is wet sand and the waxy parts is just a makeshift beach towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot until I get up of course. And what the sight I see with my very eyes. I find myself in a clearing in what looks like a corn field. Beneath me are stalks of corn, trampled by something heavy enough to snap the stems from the base roots. Several ears of corn lay strewn across the clearing, a couple of them eaten off of. The smell of blood was again brought to my nostrils on another gentle breeze, one that came from behind me. That's when I saw the extent of the damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would first be bothered by something semi-wet, semi-dry on my cheek, coming from the corner of my mouth. At first, I thought it would be saliva, water from my mouth, but when I wipe it with my mouth, I see red. It's blood. I can see where the stench of it comes from. I look around and right near my head is the decapitate head of a goat. Strewn across the clearing with the ears of corn are various body parts from the goat. A bundle of skin lay on one side and a snapped leg sat on another side. The rest of it is nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm more disgusted than shocked to find myself in this situation. The taste of blood lingers in my mouth and immediately my gag reflex kicks in, so much that I vomit to my side. I clean my mouth, but it's then that I hear a shotgun pump behind me. I look up and find an old man, possibly the owner of the field that I'm in, with his shotgun aimed at my head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a taste of raw meat? And a streaker? There are things that happen to those who trespass on my property,\u201d the old man says, a belligerent glint in his eye. He brings the stock of the gun to rest on his shoulder, as if he is preparing for some wicked recoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens in the next moment?</span></div></div>",

He stares into my eyes, but after a few seconds, he lightens his angry gaze and takes the stock off his shoulder. He suddenly lowers his weapon only to use the butt of his gun to strike me. The blow is enough to render me unconscious, though only for enough time to what he does next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI come to, finding my arms stretched out above my head. They are tied tight with a rope, which is being pulled. I'm still naked, but I'm only I can tell is a leather sheet or maybe a tarp of some kind, which protects my flesh from being battered by the ground in between the rows of corn stalks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun, which tells me it's around noon, beats down on my skin and burns me unpleasantly. Just what does this old man have in store for me? I'm dragged for what seems like thirty minutes, but that's due to the speed of the old man, who endures without stopping. Eventually, he makes it out of the field and the tarp switch from being top soil to straight-on gravel. In my peripherals I see farming equipment, tractors, even a couple silos for grain or corn. The old man drags me into a barn that smells like hay. Fortunately, it does not contain the stench of dung or manure from livestock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drops the rope, which in turn drops my arms and my head onto the floor. The impact causes me to cough, which also alerts the man to my consciousness. \u201cYou awake already? I don't know your deal, but I'm not going to shoot someone just because she kills and eats one of my goats and ruins a portion of my corn harvest. I have my own way of dealing with you people,\u201d the man says. Though it's out of my field of view, I can hear what sounds like a squeaky pulley and more rope. He attaches something metal to the rope and goes over to where I can see him. In his hand is more rope and when he pulls it, the rope around my wrists is pulled tight. I groan at the tug and whimper as I'm dragged along the ground for what seems like ten feet. My wrist are then first to lift off the ground and after, my body follows. I'm lifted straight up until my feet leave the ground and hovering a foot or two above the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I'm being lifted the old man watches me with a stoic expression with a bit of anger. After I stop rising, he turns on his heel and walks out the door. He takes one last glance before closing the big barn door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can only wait there hanging, taking in all the sensations that my body is experiencing. I feel how my arms become numb. I continue to smell the varying odors of the hay. Hay that is freshly cut. Hay that's been sitting there for a week as well as the decaying hay underneath the previous. I detect the taste of my meal, the partially eaten goat that I found in the field of corn. I hear the daily work being done outside, every piece of machinery, every vehicle that runs, every tool being used. I also hear the sound of people, but I can barely make out what they are saying above the sound of the machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the day becomes night and in the few hours I'm awake, I start to become hungry and fatigued. My eyelids become heavy and soon I drift into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it that wakes me up?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The same scene starts when I pass out once more, starting where it left off. The figure turned as if it was looking at me and the shadow of it seemed to start walking towards me. Whatever light was illuminating the forest that was part of our surroundings, it shone on two feet of a human being. After seeing the skin tone on the feet, my vision blurs and fades to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start to hear a growl like that of a lion or tiger or wolf. It's like a muffled roar, though the vibrations can be felt throughout my body. I come to seeing a dark shadow. It stands in the doorway of the barn, the light coming through it is very much like a sunrise, but so bright that only a silhouette can be seen. It's large, almost half as large as the barn door. A body lay lifeless, illuminated by the sun, next to one side of the creature. It definite had four massive legs, but in such a shape that it had an aura of swiftness, agility about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature approached. I could its eyes were upon me, like I was meat hanging from a tree. A hole in the ceiling poured light to a small square about a meter in front of me. The creature walked into the light and revealed itself to be a massive wolf, almost three times the size of a regular wolf found in the wild. It's claws were hideous and it looked like the front paws were more terrible than the hind paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnusually, I didn't panic. I  could not panic. My smell caught its musk and it was familiar, though I can't recall from where. That's when it pushed up with his front legs and stood on his back legs. He stood upright, but due to more weight above its weight, it could only stand hunched forward. It's head was the least hideous and resembled that of a larger-than-usual wolf. It had a goatee-like beard of hair hanging from his chin too. Still it stared at me and continued to approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen face to face with it, I found that its snout could very well reach my face, but instead of poking it at my mouth, it prodded it towards my breasts. It stuck out a very long and wet tongue and lapped at both my breasts. It's texture was slimy, due to the saliva that oozed out sometimes, but the tongue itself was rough, so rough that it could very well have scraped my skin off like heavy-duty sandpaper if without the saliva lubricating it. It then used its lips to sort of dry the saliva off and it sucked it off when pressing both lips onto my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm embarrassed to say that I had for just a second there found the feeling of the alien thing upon my chest very pleasant, though this pleasantness is over when it raises it mouth and lashes its tongue upon my cheek, gooey globs of saliva running down it. It does the same as my chest and sucks the saliva off of my cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large wolf then walk back onto its four limbs and goes over to where the rope is tied. He bites it and when it snaps, I come crashing down. I find myself hurting all over except for my forearms, which are instead numb from bearing all my weight. On the ground, I'm on stomach, but with no strength left just to crawl.<br>\r\nThe last thing I see is the wolf walk around to where my head is and with its snout, nuzzles my head. By now, I'm too fatigued to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I awake, where do I find myself?</span></div></div>",

The headache goes away as soon as it manifests and I find myself on the ground, more or less, the same. I'm not a girl like Sonny, now Sonya. I'm not even different in terms of physicality. No muscles or toned body. Not even a change in what I feel in my pants. I look up at Tyrone and ask, \"What did you do to me? Did you just slap me for no reason?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squats down and rubs my head like a kid. \"Nope. I took away something, but I also increased something as well,\" he tells me. \"The way I saw it, is that you're too indecisive. On top of not believing in me, you're wishy washy as well. That's what I took away from you. What I added is a bit more complicated. I increased a desire in you that regards wanting to change or simply, not wanting to be what you are now at this moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That all comes down to you, actually,\" he tells me.

So much so, that it will bother you in about ... five minutes. I'll be outside when you're ready.

At once, as if on cue, I involuntarily have a desire to become something different. I want to be a different or better Cesar and I don't want to stay as the current Cesar any longer.

But when I start to think about something, the desire to change into that specific figure grows substantially. The thought of becoming a woman like Sonny becoming Sonya crosses my mind and the thought of it seems to be one that cannot be ignored. It's more like a burden or a passion, depending on how you see it. Right now, in my mind it's a bit of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen thinking about becoming a woman, I start to imagine the ideal figure I would have that would make me a legitimate woman. Thinner waist, wider hips, shapely legs, long hair, soft, silky skin. I cannot forget to include the pretty face as well as the needed breasts and absence of a cock between my legs. The image of my ideal figure crosses my mind not once, but three times in quick succession. Each time I catch a glimpse of it, I desire to make it proportional and less outrageous. By the time I catch the third glimpse, the image in my mind is almost perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also begin to loathe the body I'm in right now. The hair on my legs, the bush around my cock, even the cock itself becomes thing I want to remove. Like someone who wants to lose weight, my desire right now is a passionate want to get rid of Cesar and replace him with this female figure in my head. Desires to better myself physically and mentally as a male are not even brought up, which would be the case in which my timidity or my indecisiveness is failing. The thought I have in my mind is what I'm setting my sights on. So much so, that it forces me to my feet and towards the sliding glass door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open it and Tyrone turns his head and sees me beckoning him inside. He takes his feet and calves out of the jacuzzi and wipes them off with a towel. I notice his hand still wrapped in the glove, completely dry and out of the water. I wonder for a second what would happen if it did get wet. Would it behave like an electronic, sparking and seconds later, ceasing to work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remove myself from the threshold and allow Tyrone to walk back into the house. \"What's up, Ces? Decide on something yet?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" I say, but find my reluctance and an ounce of embarrassment creep into my emotions. The womanly desire to tap into those emotions almost tries to overtake me as I tell Tyrone what I've decided. I can somehow tell how nervous I am as I open my mouth to speak. \"I need... want... to become a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like Sonny?\" he says to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod in such a way that my head is bowed and as I pivot my head down, for a split second, my chin comes into contact with my Adam's apple, something I know would disappear after Tyrone's imminent blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready? Any last requests?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you somehow make it so the glove knows what I want to look like?\" I ask, rather sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can do that,\" Tyrone says. \"Alright, here goes.\" I shut my eyes tight expecting a sharp, stinging blow that would send me flying to the ground. The slap comes suddenly, again without an warning. After the initial contact of the gloved palm and fingers up the side of my head, the blow manages to knock any amount of focus out of me for a few seconds, but I find that I'm still standing firmly on my feet, if not wavering. I can see a blurry image of Tyrone approaching me and supporting me with his hands, trying to stabilize me and prevent me from tipping over. \"Are you okay? Blink your eyes if you're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blink my eyes twice, which allows me to refocus my vision. Somehow I feel very fatigued and parts of my body feel numb, especially on my chest and in between my legs. I hope the glove did what I wanted it to do. I start to doze off from moment to moment. All I can observe is that Tyrone has picked me up and taken me outside. He lays me down on a mattress on the outdoor patio and allows me to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I wake up, I find laying on Tyrone's bed. Since knowing it was hot inside the house, Tyrone somehow has left the cover off of me. There is no one else in the room other than myself. It's when I open the door to the rest of the house, I find other people. Who are the people beyond the door?</span></div></div>",

I smile, knowing that the glove had given me what I desired. Once the fabric of the glove made contact with my face, it sensed my desire in what was probably a split second and changed me accordingly. In the mirror, I do not find my old self as Cesar. In the mirror, the reflection smiling back at me is what I had desired from the glove. I have long, wavy brown hair flowing down from my scalp, past my shoulders and ending a near my waist, the brown locks gradually becoming blonde tips. I have the face of a Caucasian woman with a light tan complexion. I'm dressed in short denim shorts and a crop top shirt, exposing much of my abdomen. I don't recall wearing this before or after the slap, so I assume it was probably my roommates who played dress up with my sleeping body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rise in volume behind the door breaks my reverie about my new body and outfit. Wondering what is making all the noise, I go for the door and pull it open. I reveal what looks like a house party, filled with guys and girls who looked to be at least the age of 21, since I do see some liquor being pour in various parts of the room. Once I step out of the room and into the open hallway of sorts, a tall guy who I vaguely recognize as a basketball player who used to attend the same high school as me stops me in my tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey girl, wanna hook up?\u201d he asks me, in hopes of getting with me despite of my sour expression. A young woman next to him pulls him out of my way in a sense that she was the one he was hooking up with him in the first place. She looks at me with the same sour expression I gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no more men bothering me at the moment, I scan the room for Tyrone or any of my other roommates, but from what I can see just near the door to Tyrone's room, it's just Carlos and Sonya, each doing their own things with other people. Maybe I can just ask them where Tyrone is and whose idea was it to hold this party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich of my roommates should I approach first?</span></div></div>",

I thought you were someone, but I was mistaken.

Heck, I did not know there would be a lot of people at this party either, considering the amount of people my roommates know combined. \u201cI don't know if you can help me, but I'm just looking for my brother. His name is Cesar and he lives with Tyrone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm caught without an answer, though the truth of where his brother is lies with me. Fuck, I am his brother, just not in the male body anymore. A part of me wants to tell him the truth, but another part of me wants to keep the truth to myself. I don't know how he would react if he found out that his brother stands before him with no manhood and a part of chest ornaments. He may be my brother, but the fact that we do not share a common mother gives me no inkling of what he's really thinking. Heck, I haven't even lived with the guy for more than six months. He had already been out of the house when he was 18.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do?</span></div></div>",

He turns to walk towards the open door, but my guilt takes a hold of me and I rush to get between him and the door. I manage to get past him and closed the door behind my back at the cost of hitting him with my arm. \u201cHey! Girl, I'm not here to enjoy the party, I'm just looking for my brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but I know exactly where he is,\u201d I blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do, don't you?\u201d he asks in doubt. \u201cWhere is he then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe's here,\u201d I tell him, but the face he gives me tells me he is confused. \u201cI'm your brother, Jake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is not quick to believe a girl with long brown hair with a top that exposes much of her midriff. \u201cI'm not here to play games, miss.

I'm Cesar, Jake,\u201d I say, confidently, but his face reads as obvious disbelief. \u201cI know you don't believe me, but it's true. You won't find Cesar anywhere else at this house, because I'm him. And I can prove it you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, how can you prove that you're my brother, girl?\u201d he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow should I prove to him that I'm his brother and not just a girl?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's my assumption that there are more people in the room beyond the door, but when I open it, I find only my roommates chilling in the living room. It's the high volume of the television that had fooled me into thinking there were more people than my roommates. I discover that Sonya and Carlos is taking up most of the large sofa in the living room and Tyrone is occupying the only recliner we have in the whole house. I round the small coffee table that separates the living room with the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon sensing me, Tyrone calls out, \"Why, isn't it sleeping beauty? You were out for a good three hours, girl.\" He sits up and pats his lap, as if he's beckoning me to sit on it like Sonya is laying against Carlos. It seems the two on the sofa have grown closer than roommates. Tyrone's lap is inviting and my absence of indecisiveness coupled with my desire to be more womanlike causes me to confident sit my buttocks on his lap. He pulls me in as if by instinct and I do the same, pressing my back against his chest. He plants his chin on my shoulder and whispers into my ear. \"That outfit looks hot on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even notice,\" I say. I notice that my khakis shorts have shortened and tightened onto my pelvis, emphasizing the shape of my hips, my buttocks and legs. My thighs as well as my calves are exposed, showing the smooth skin that runs down the whole length of my legs. On my torso, my gray tanktop has transformed to a slim-fit, sleeveless blouse that has two small buttons unfastened showing the cleavage that my bra accentuates. I look down and see how deep the valley between the two mounds are. I also discover that everything I desire in my mind has been granted to me. More or less, I'm exactly the ideal female figure I had in mind before I got slapped by Tyrone. For a good five minutes, Tyrone and I just sit still, noting how great it feel to be in constant contact with one another. When one of us, shifts and changes position, it gives me moments to brush against each other, which is a rather sensual feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wraps his muscular arms around me and I find myself not resisting. I'm actually allowing my roommate to embrace me in this fashion. \"You hungry?\" he asks me, rather sensually into my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI answer normally, \"Starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got Chinese food on the table. Just help yourself with whatever you want,\" he tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push myself off of Tyrone's lap and get to my feet, finding a new sense of balance. My breasts and wider hips are the obvious factor to this balance, but amazingly, I manage to walk over to the dining table without any hassle. I grab a plate and place items of food from the cartons and walk into the kitchen. I place my plate in the microwave and set it to heat my food. Unbeknownst to me, Tyrone has sneaked into the kitchen and situates himself directly behind me. When I turn around, I happen to run into him, my breasts squeezing in between two bodies. I flinch and yelp a small bit as I back away only have my ass bump into the counter. For a moment, I'm nervous as Tyrone's larger body is mere inches away from mine. Confidently, I look up and admire him and almost instantly, my nervous goes away. In place of my nervousness, there is curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you in fact slap me with an attraction to you?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Tyrone says, almost with a chuckle at the end. \"You must enjoy being what you are now and being attracted to the opposite sex is just one of benefits. You could be attracted to Carlos...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but it seems I'm not attracted to men who's already taken,\" I add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know I'm not already taken?\" Tyrone mentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no answer to his question has the nervousness creeping back in. I can only bite my tongue since I have nothing else to say. As if I'm submitting to my defeat at our brief conversation. Tyrone sneers and removes himself from my presence. All I can say is expletive underneath my breath. Moment later, the microwaves dings, telling me my food is warmed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner is uneventful and all I have on my mind is Tyrone. Well, not only Tyrone, but also other members of the opposite sex. Tyrone mostly, because it seems Carlos is taken by the beauty of Sonya. If she took to Tyrone, it would be me laying against Carlos, most likely. As I eat, I fantasize about my family. Mostly the males of my family. What would happen if I were to come across my older brother, an uncle or my father? Would they recognize me? Hardly, it would seem. I don't want to sound like a pervert, but it seems possibile event that could happen between myself and the male members of the family sound and feel as pleasurable as my body against Tyrone's. Why is it that I'm thinking these things, as if I'm a nymphomaniac? Is it because mentally, I'm still a sex-starved young man in the hotness of a young woman's body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wash my dishes in silence and I'm almost startled by Tyrone who agains sneaks up on me. \"Do you have to do that, Tyrone?\" I ask, as I start to rinse my dishes of the lather that covers them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" he apologizes and tries to soothe me into calmness by tracing his finger along my arms. I again allow him to do this to me without protest, since clearly it is helping me to relax. Once I'm done and the dishes are put away and I dry my hands, I walk to someplace in the house and Tyrone silently follows me. Where do I go?</span></div></div>",

How much is still a mystery. He says that it was an ordinary glove, but with a special power attributed to it. He says that he can slap whatever he wanted out of someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tested it out on a homeless guy not far from where he got it. He simply said, \"I'll slap the sense out of you!\" That made the homeless dude pretty mad and in his rage, got up and tried to start a fight. My friend says he got a good punch from the guy, but he slapped him with his gloved hand and all of a sudden, the guy went stupid. The vagrant simply stopped fighting and walked into the street, right in the path of a bus! And here's my friend saying he caused that. He should turn himself in, knowing the power he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also tells me this glove can add stuff to people, not just subtract things from them. He came across this girl with a flat butt. He said to her, \"I'll slap some ass into that ass!\" The girl was mad at first, since he had touched her inappropriately, but she quickly calmed down seeing that he flat butt had volume, had curves, had that tushy quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here he is, trying to get me to believe him, which I don't.
