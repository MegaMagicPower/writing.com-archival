I mean, I'm sure you did this for Link...\" She gives him a pat on the back, yet he's too memorized by the princess's ocean of blubber slowly enveloping his legs. \"But... Well...\" She turns to Link. \"We can share, right Link?\" He idely nods, only half-listening to what she has to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's fat mouth drops. \"WHAT? 'Share'!? You can't 'share' me!\" If her arms weren't so weighed down by a ton of sagging fat, she'd raise them in a frenzy of anger. Instead, she had to reluctantly watch Saria and Link lie down between her massive chest and both dreamily look at her. \"Sure you can! We can both take of you! Link's and I are close enough to not mind if we share one another's lovers after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zelda can answer, she slides off and darts towards the woods, turning to wave at the blob princess. \"I'll get ya some grub Zelda!

He then brought her over to Zelda's smooth plump ass, and they started groping it like there was no tommorrow. Zelda loved having her butt groped and then smooshed them between her butt cheeks so they could get the true experience. Link then pulled Saria to his side and shoved his dick up her pussy while Zelda waited for the chance to bang Saria. When they finished, Saria climbed up Zelda's fat, and they bothed french kissed for 30 seconds, until Saria moved her vagina up to Zelda's mouth so she could lick it. Saria and Zelda enjoyed the entire time, even Link enjoyed watching them. When it was all over, they all french kissed each other for what was only 5 minutes, but seemed like forever. Then, Zelda and Saria used their Sage powers to fatten Link and Saria up to the same weight as Zelda.

Zelda grew in both height and width and had a terrified look on her face. <i>Why does this have to happen now?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of Zelda's body increasing, Link was having a hard time trying to hold onto Zelda's sticky flab. After a few unsuccessful attempts, Link fell off Zelda's body and was heading straight to the ground. But before he hit, Link pulled out his Longshot and managed to hit the ground safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Link let out a sigh of relief, he turned and was horrified at the sight of Zelda's body expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's fear turned into a smile as she felt herself getting bigger and bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon covered the surrounding countries with her blubber, and nothing seemed able to stop her from getting bigger and bigger. Zelda felt whole cities and castles being overcome with her blubber, and she felt a rather large tower entering her massive buttcrack. Zelda closed her eyes to enjoy the feeling of being bigger than Hyrule. When she had stopped getting bigger, she opened her eyes to see that she now covered the entire world with her blubber...SHE was the world now. Zelda marveled at her vastness and enjoyed every minute of it. Her Sage powers kicked in so that Zelda could survive in the vaccum of space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, due to her Sage Powers, there was a few side effects. Saria had grown in weight as well and was the exact same size as Zelda, except that she was naked and was sitting on Zelda's belly instead of the Earth itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria had a huge smile on her face. \"Hey Zeldy. Did anyone tell you how attractive you are with all this meat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was blushing deep red in response. She had never received a compliment like that in her life and it didn't help that it came from a person with the same gender as herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when Saria proceeded to massage her breasts, she was put at ease. She felt the comfort from her enlarged jugs moving up and down in a pendulum-like fashion. It was almost hypnotic to her, and when she smiled, Saria's smile began to widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though if I do say so, it seems you've... Filled out the room rather nicely.\" Zelda giggled, sending small waves to flow over her gelatin-like body. \"I think I have, if I do say so myself. Though I'm still finding myself rather... <i>Peckish</i> still. Would I be right in assuming there is some dessert on offer?\" The chef's face dropped a bit. \"You're... You're still HUNGRY?! But- Alright, alright... *Ahem* What exactly would you want for dessert, princess? And may I suggest we change location? I'm not sure anybody will be able to serve any food to you when you're... Um... 'Derriere' is barricading the main doors into the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess shot the thin chef a cold look, but suddenly became aware that there was a slight sensation that a small force was repeatedly pushing itself against her butt cheeks. \"Fine then, fine then-\" Using Farore's Wind, she teleported back outside on the royal grounds, only now becoming aware that even the dress she had created for herself when she was three tons was ripped to shreds, merely covering her even more ballooned breasts. With another chanting spell, she clothed herself once again, now wearing a dress large enough to cover an entire house in Hylrue . \"Now then, about my next order...\" Zelda started as she decided on her order of dessert to the chef who just arrived from the dining hall.</span></div></div>",

HUH?\" the thief argued back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin Link motioned over to Darunia. The gordon leader smiled as he popped the knuckles in his powerful fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...okay okay. I was just trying to score a quick drink with the potions and well grab a bite to eat with the fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...well no...\" confessed the thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more?\" asked Link with a curious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. See I thought those potions would be good for stamina, injuries, and what not but turns out they just make you fat! To a guy like me that's like poison so I decided to dump them. Lucky for me a caravan from Lake Hylia was passing by so I quietly dumped the entire contents of the four bottles into one shipment of the fish they were carrying. After that I took a couple of fish for myself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the Zora guards saw me as I fled with the fish but had no idea what I did with the potions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man laughed for a moment before he was decked by Link's right fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot. Do you even realize you've just contaminated that batch of fish. People may very well get ill from what you just did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Darunia decided he had heard enough and took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother, I say you let me handle with turning over this man to the proper authorities while you make haste and find where that tainted fish was headed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think it was going to the Castle Town...\" mumbled the thief before Darunia threw him over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Castle...alright. Thanks Darunia I'll see ya later.\" As he said his goodbye Link pulled out his ocarina and in a flash teleported toward the temple of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course during all of this Link had no idea if the fish were even still in town or perhaps they had been sent toward the castle. If it was the latter Zelda surely had eaten them all by now! It appeared that once again he was in a race against time.</span></div></div>",

Link wasn't exactly sure of the population, but he did know that there were shady characters that operated in the town.  First, there was Sofasa the Gerudo.  After the defeat of Ganondorf, the Gerudo had moved into other parts of Hyrule and started to do trade.  Since the whole population of the Gerudo were now female, men were attracted to the curvy Gerudo females.  Nabooru had become Queen of the Gerudo, since she was in second-in-command while Ganondorf was in charge.  Sofasa had moved to Castle Town shortly after Ganondorf's defeat, and dealt with the thieves that lived in Castle Town.  Sofasa ran a bar that was a front for a den of thieves.  Sofasa wouldn't probably know about the shipment of fish, but it was worth checking out.<br>\r\n               Sofasa's Bar was in one of the many back alleys of Castle Town; the kind of place where you wouldn't wander around at night.  When Link entered the bar, he saw nobody in it.  He did, however hear a hushed voice in the back go \"Shhhhh!\"  <br>\r\n                    \"Hello?\" asked Link loudly.  <br>\r\n                    A hushed voice rasped from the back:  \"An'otak finas!\"   <br>\r\n                     The language was unfamiliar to Link; although, he had a vague idea that he had heard it somewhere before.  Before he could react, four persons came into the bar area from the back door.  One of them was a female Gerudo; not Sofasa and it wasn't Nabooru.  It was an unusually tall female--around seven feet tall--and she was fat; she must've weighed a good 400 pounds!  The other three people with her were human thieves that Link knew by sight, but not by name.<br>\r\n                     \"The famous Link\" said the fat Gerudo female.  \"the one who killed Ganondorf.  Are you the reason why I only got half the shipment today?\"<br>\r\n                    'Half?' asked Link.  <br>\r\n                     \"One half of the shipment went to the castle\" said the Gerudo female.  \"the other half of the shipment went to me\"<br>\r\n                    \"You're telling him too much!\" snapped one of the thieves with her.<br>\r\n                    \"He isn't going to ruin my plans\" said the Gerudo.  \"calm yourself, Janon\" <br>\r\n                      \"And what's your plan?\" asked Link.<br>\r\n                        \"Oh dear\" said the Gerudo.  \"he likes to hear my plans. Too bad, I ain't telling you\"<br>\r\n                       \"What's your name, then?\" asked Link.<br>\r\n                       \"I?\" asked the Gerudo.  \"I am called Souaraborf, the daughter of Ganondorf himself\" <br>\r\n                  </span></div></div>",

Well...it's no wonder considering how much food she ate yesterday.  She looked for Link, who had used her belly as a bed.  But she didn't see Link anywhere.  Suddenly, Zelda heard muffled screams coming from her big belly! <br>\r\n  Oh no!  Link must've sunk in her flab last night!<br>\r\n       Zelda tried to grab Link from her flabby belly, but it was no use.  Link would suffocate in flab and it would be Zelda's fault.  But, it was clear that Link hadn't suffocated yet because he kept shouting and Zelda could feel him struggling in her flab.  After a few minutes, Zelda saw Link's hand was sticking out of her flabby belly.  Zelda grabbed Link's hand and slowly pulled him out of his prison of flab.  He was gasping for breath when he landed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Oh Link\" said Zelda.  \"I'm sorry that happened\"<br>\r\n       \"No need to apologize\" said Link.  \"I should've known that was gonna happen.  It's just that your belly was so soft and warm...it's better than any bed I've ever slept on!\"<br>\r\n        \"Oh Link\" said Zelda. \"I'm just glad you're okay.  How could you breathe?\"<br>\r\n          \"There was a little hole that let me breathe\" said Link.  \"-but the air in there was getting stale...\"<br>\r\n           \"I bet it was\" said Zelda.  \"so...my belly is better than any bed you've slept in?\"<br>\r\n            Zelda's belly was nearly as big as yesterday...but it had shrunk somewhat overnight.  <br>\r\n             \"Yep\" said Link.  <br>\r\n             \"Well....how can we prevent you from sinking into my flab?\" asked Zelda. </span></div></div>",

He ripped off his clothes like a wild animal and smothered his face in Zelda's blubber while stroking his \"master sword\".<br>\r\nZelda was now so fat that she could easily crush her own kingdom under her girth if she were in her own universe, and from the looks of it, it's not going to stop there.</span></div></div>",

What if it was some evil force that had gotten to him and with Zelda the way she was she'd be defenseless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet once more Link was startled for he was within a very cozy and very soft spot. Crawling his way out Link noticed there was nothing but softness around him, suddenly he felt his foot get stuck in his previous location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link? Link where are you?!\" yelled out the familiar voice of Zelda, eventually reaching Link's ears. As the youth pulled himself out he noticed the sort of \"roll\" his foot was caught on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mixture of horror and surprise crossed his mind as he realized that roll was property of Zelda! Looking around Link realized where exactly he was, on the right side of Zelda's now Castle-sized belly, to add even more amazement he was previously stuck in one of her fat rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his head as far back as he could Link could see nothing but Zelda's vastness which had replaced where the Castle once stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer amazing belly having taken up the entire location of the castle, rounding in at around 40 ft wide and deep with so many rolls and curves that Link lost count of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt cheeks had also taken quite a shot, each one nearly the size of the Temple of Time packed with a vast amount of softness. Her feet no longer visible having been swallowed by her massively fat legs, her arms as well growing to a similar size of her legs making them more than useless if she even tried to move them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's once chubby face was now large and thick with her new fat, making her cheeks even more spherical, her chin count jumped to at the very least ten, and her neck was completely submerged in the lake of fat that was the rest of her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her previous huge breasts took quite a hit and now were more near the area of \"massive\" if not already pass that, Link swore that each one was the size of a small home. What little of her dress was left didn't seem to do much to cover these new \"homes\" causing a large amount of cleavage to be broadcast out for the entire world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all Zelda was quite a site to see, becoming a literal caste of fat, Link was sure everyone in town could now easily see their princess in all her massive glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink assumed that Zelda's expanding girth must have knocked him out but with said realization the young hero wondered what had happen to the others living/working in the castle?

His feet sunk up to his knees in the flab of Zelda's girth, but he managed to make his way, looking everywhere for survivors.  Looking around, Link saw bits of the stone wall that had once made the castle.  Link  couldn't even see Zelda's face as it was blocked by her massive chest.  <br>\r\n      Link found himself stepping down in a small hole and realized that he had just walked into Zelda's belly button!  The belly button was barely 10 feet tall and 20 feet wide!  Zelda had a deep belly button, despite her girth.  Link's eyes grew used to the dim light and he saw that 4 boys were in the belly button with him. The boys ranged in age to 7 to 17.   <br>\r\n       \"Who are all of you?\" asked Link.<br>\r\n      \"We worked in the castle\" said the eldest kid.  \"I'm Dihim\"<br>\r\n         \"I'm Kizi\" said a 7-year old. <br>\r\n        \"My name is Izimi\" said a 13-year old.<br>\r\n       \"and my name is Chiaz\" said a 15-year old.<br>\r\n       \"How did...?\" started Link.<br>\r\n       \"We were cooking more food for Zelda when she outgrew the castle\" said Dihim.  \"it was pure luck that we ended up in here.

Malon to her amazement puts two and two together as soon as she spots the now swelling princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Every time she burps she's gaining weight, and every burp is louder than the last!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, Princess Zelda was quickly becoming a belching machine, pumping out burp after burp each one surpassing the last in audio quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my *burp*!\" doing as best as she could Zelda tries to cover her mouth, yet the belch still comes through clear as day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply watching the princess of Hyrule in such a predicament was amusing to say least, Malon herself was struggling to contain her building laugher, her cheeks starting to showcase a bit of a crimson blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no this is *burp* all wrong *BURP*!\" letting out a stronger belch compared to the ones before it, Zelda feels a rather strong gain come on, her belly actually dropping downward an inch or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is now that Malon completely looses her composure and lets out a hearty laugh at the princess' expense. The redhead rocks back and forth laughing till tears begin to shine within her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it, little miss princess has become a circus sideshow attraction!\" The ranch girl now finds herself holding her midsection still laughing like a women possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you, I'll have you know *BURP*!\" once more Zelda's words are cut short as she feels another strong gain from her belching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon who is on the floor still trying to recover from her laughing spree for the moment has yet to take notice of Zelda, who seems to still have quite a few belches left in her.</span></div></div>",

And another. And another. Until a large, steady stream of poop was being processed out of Zelda\u2019s cheeks, the princess growing ever so larger as each one passed. There was no way Malon could constrain herself. \u201cMan Princess, I thought you\u2019d of been housetrained just a little? Or was that a too complex concept for a Royal Pig? Buh hah hah hah!\u201d She started to roll on the ground laughing again, with a very distraught Zelda left unable to retort as the belching had begun, almost in rhythm to her gas and own excrement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet when she could get a word in, it was less anger at Malon and more disbelief at her own predictament. \u201cHell, it\u2019s just a bottle of milk!

She only just noticed that she was being suspended in mid air as she felt a quick breeze against her huge panties that were now entirely exposed, and realized that not only had Zelda just farted directly in her direction, she was holding her over her own pile of poop. \u201cWait, WAIT! You wouldn\u2019t do that, would you Princess? I mean, can\u2019t we just\u2026 Eh, get along?\u201d Eying the slowly rising pile of poop and Zelda\u2019s dimpled butt, which was intentionally in very, very close proximity to Malon\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s that Malon?

Nope, I don't think there's anything to laugh at at all...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a particularly large squelch is heard, and a decent-sized blob of 'Home-grown Zelda Manure', through a freak accident in physics, becomes airborne and plopes down straight on the princess' head, staining her bright blond hair. Malon, being so close to the girl's huge ass, see's all of this, and an intoxicating grin starts to redevelop. 'Oh god.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda simply sits there (as if there was much else she could do) and grimaces as it slowly falls down her face. Yet above the sound of the constant eruptions from her ass, she hears another sound. It'd be hard not to, considering how much of a loudmouth Malon was. \"BUHAHAHAHAHA! Oh god, I'm really sorry Zelda, but, holy crap, that was, just about... Lemme just get some air here... Just about the funniest thing I've ever seen... Ahahaha!\" After Malon was finished, she grew silent. Zelda, with some significant effort due to her nearly submerged neck, turned her head around, and gave the dangling farm girl a cold stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... That was a reflex, I swear!\" Zelda then turned her face to a smile, yet it was obviously hallow, yet Malon was nervous enough to not fully tell if it was genuine or not. \"Oh, that's alright Malon...\" The farm-girl sighed a sign of relief, yet Zelda continued. \"... Yet you could've been a bit less blunt about wanting to get dunked so badly!\" Before Malon could even register what had just been said, she was forced head first into one of the largest piles of human waste ever created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even being able to breath, the steaming pile quickly engulfed the submerged girl, oozing and staining nearly every crevice of her body. She tried to swim out for air, yet Zelda's own magic prevents her from doing so. Rather, she's slowly forced through the pile, and before long, she feels a soft wall, and a small current. Malon doesn't even want to think of where or what's about to happen, yet she can feel two large, heavy yet oozing masses slowly sliding inbetween her, sandwiching her. After a surprisingly long trip, she finds herself in a small air pocket, and gasps for air, straining her arms from the weight of Zelda's cheeks to wipe some of the shit off her hair and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a sick pervert, you know that Princess!\" Malon screamed, yet it came out slightly muffled outside of the Royal's cavernous ass. \"Well, serves you right then! I'll let you out in a quick while, when you learn your lesson!\" There was a slight pause, and Zelda realized it was probably better to let her out. \"... Why exactly were you so EAGER to shove me up here?\" Nearly instantly, Malon's shot out of the princess ass, and is pulled over to the front of Zelda, hovering next to her as poop drips off her in large piles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farm girl is met with a blushed expression on the princess face, and it only takes a split-second for Malon to figure out what's up. \"OH GOD, THATS DISGUSTING!\" With a gust of wind, Malon is entirely cleaned up, and plonked on her belly. \"That's not why you idiot! Or not entirely why either... It's... Eh... Comfortable?\" The princess held both hands together and began to day dream. \"Imagine Link back there, obviously when I'm not stuck constantly relieving myself, and...\" Malon gave crossed her arms and gave her a cold look. \"I really, really don't want to find out where you're going with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell...\" She climbs off and giving the princess a devious grin, starts to walk off. \"Who's to say you'll stop? I have TON'S of experimental milk... The only difference from you and me is that I'll actually bother to read the label so I don't make a total mess of myself. I'll be twice... No, thrice... Wait, maybe... Aww screw it, any times bigger than you, and Fairy Boy will be all over me!\" Reaching the door, she added one last thing. \"And the only way I can think of how to reveres all that junk coming out you're ass is if you drink a slim-down brew of milk; they'll be nothing for your body to digest into waste...\" Turning the knob, one last snark comment. \"And nothing of you for anybody to like! Either keep on shitting or go skinny, Princess!\" Running out, Malon heads for another place where some experimental milk is stored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding another small fridge in the barn house, she takes a sip and already feels her 300 pound body expanding, her thighs further ballooning outwards. \"Aww man, it's Malon's turn now!\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe they can find a way to reverse this.\" Link said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I like being this way.\" Zelda said. \"I feel like a baby again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda, you can't just keep growing and pooping all the time.\" Link said. \"Sooner or later either you or your waste is going to fill up this entire kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it will be a kingdom I want to rule.\" Zelda said. \"I WILL continue with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not while I'm around.\" Link said, walking away. Just then he felt himself stop in his tracks against his will. He could not move at all. \"What the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that Zelda was lifting Link's body up with magic. Zelda then flew Link right into close proximity of her gigantic butt, just above her pile of poop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'll just have to keep you occupied.\" Zelda said with an arrogant tone in her voice. She then flew Link into her poop pile, covering every crevice in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is worse than Jabu-jabu's belly' Link thought to himself. Just then Link felt himself flowing through the poop until he felt a soft wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh Din...' Link thought as he felt himself sandwiched between two big soft masses, continuing to flow. Just before suffocating, he put his Zora Tunic on so that he could still breathe. Eventually he arrived into an air pocket, where he could see the fresh poop flow out through Zelda's enlarged anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remind me never to give her prune juice...\" Link said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LINK! Oh thank the godesses you're here!\" Malon said from Link's left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malon!\" Link said, glad to see that his friend was alive. Filthy, humiliated, but alive nontheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, how are we gonna get out of here?\" Malon said, getting to the point.</span></div></div>",

None of the Kokiri--save for Saria--had ever ventured beyond the forest.   This is due because any Kokiri that leaves the forest will die--not instantly, it might take a few days or even a week depending on how healthy said Kokiri is.  Saria was a special case because she's one of the seven sages of Hyrule.  Few Kokiri know Saria is a sage.   <br>\r\n                 Saria was exploring the seemingly endless Lost Woods, hoping to find a way beyond the maze-like woods.   Because there was something beyond the Lost Woods to be sure....maybe even another country.  But Saria had no luck whatsoever in finding a way past the Lost Woods that didn't lead back to the village or the Forest Temple.   Since the defeat of Ganondorf, Saria grew bored and explored the Lost Woods, discovering two new locations;  A grand fountain that looked ancient enough to be as old as Hyrule itself.  The fountain had long ago dried up and was covered in vines and moss.  The other location that Saria had discovered seem to be an incredibly old looking temple to the three goddesses of Hyrule.  It was slightly smaller than the Forest Temple, and looked to be far more older.<br>\r\n                     Now, Saria was standing in front of the bit of flesh that had crept its way into Kokiri Village.  The blob was flesh-colored and was very yielding--another Kokiri had almost sunk right into the blob until Saria had saved him--it turned out to be Mido of all people.  <br>\r\n                          \"What's that thing?\" asked Mido.<br>\r\n                           \"I don't know....\" said Saria.   \"but I'm going to find out\" </span></div></div>",

In the distance was the creamy fleshy blob that had overtaken Hyrule field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously it had taken the blonde royal no more then a second to realize what or rather who that was. Malon the perky and clever farmgirl had somehow grown from pleasantly hourglass to gigantically enormous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly Zelda wasn't angry with the far stretching redhead, okay so she was royally ticked off that Malon had gone and made a field of fat out of herself and no doubt the destruction her growth had caused and yes she had been impulsive and selfish but somehow Zelda couldn't completely fault Malon for her recent actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump princess didn't need sage powers to know of the farm girl's crush on Link or that if she were in Malon's place she would have done the same...perhaps even more given her magical abilities They were still young and easily emotional after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case Zelda instead thought over what had lead her to this moment in time. She recalled how she had escaped her flab-made prison thanking the goddess for her skill of instant teleportion unfortunately she had lost complete contact with Link although assure herself that he was clever and expertly skilled enough to keep himself safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer people had panic when the surge of fat had effortlessly demolished a part of castle town so the princess ordered for all citizens to be housed in the castle for the time being after noting that Malon's growth had come to a close. Afterwards Impa left to check up on her home of Kakariko while Zelda left a few of the guards to watch over things downstairs as she pondered away at how to fix all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs things were currently Malon had mercifully stopped growing but Zelda was uncertain if the redhead would possibly expand further at a later moment. She couldn't risk that so making her way over to a nearby bookshelf she began to scan over the titles one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe books were old containing writings that were either long forgotten or deemed worthless by current methods.

The Forgotten Temple was too the three goddesses that created Hyrule...in fact, according to one of the old books the Forgotten Temple was said to be in the oldest place in all of Hyrule. The way to the Forgotten Temple has been lost for countless years, but it was rumored that the Kokiri children knew where it was.  Zelda had read that deep in that forgotten temple was a magical artifact--the books didn't say just what it was--that could grant one person the power of a goddess...or to become one.  The books weren't that clear on what the magical artifact did.  If Zelda could find that artifact, she could reverse Malon to her original size.   Zelda doubted that her magic could do anything against someone as large as Malon...the magic would probably just bounce off of her.   She could go get Link to get the mysterious item, but that would be like looking for a needle in a haystack the size of Hyrule Field and Zelda wanted to end this as quickly as possible.   So, Zelda had no choice but to go by herself to the Forgotten Temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               Nabooru  was also investigating the strange blob of flab that had invaded Gerudo Valley.  The flab didn't extend to the hideout, thank goodness.  Since the defeat of the King of Evil, Nabooru had one hell of a job to convince the other inhabitants of Hyrule to trade with the Gerudo people.   Also, without evil in the world to fight off, Nabooru  had plumped out slightly....nowhere near the weight of a certain farmgirl to be sure, but enough to tell that she had gained some weight.   <br>\r\n                      \"Where did this.....thing came from?\" asked a female guard, reaching out to touch the wall of flab.<br>\r\n                        \"I don't know\" said Nabooru.   \"but...\"<br>\r\n                          When the female guard had touched the wall of flab, the guard nearly doubled in weight!   The guard was skinny as a rail, but when she touched the mysterious wall of flab, she had doubled her weight.<br>\r\n                         \"What the...?!\" asked the guard, pulling her hand away.  <br>\r\n                             </span></div></div>",

In any case despite her better judgment Nabooru figured that if she was going to get a better understanding on what this blob was she'd have to lay a hand on it herself.

The former \"King of Evil\" had nearly taken the elder fish's life had it not been for Sheik's timely intervention, incidentally the fish girl was never told her father's (and her own much later) savior was actually Zelda in deep disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith peace restored Ruto had stressed that she never wanted again wanted her dear old dad to be in such risk. A few days she was made ruler, for now keeping the princess title however, her father retiring to...wherever it was that Zora rulers retired to. Ruto wasn't too sure where that was, maybe one day far into the future she'd find out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case after having calm the growing worry of her fellow Zora the princess was determined to find out just what in the goddesses' names had occurred in the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already have a few of the guards looking into things, my lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything we know?\" Ruto asked glancing over at her guardsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing new to report only that whatever it is originated from outside our land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic\" the princess muttered with heavy sarcasm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater outside Ruto paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's out toward the entrance of the domain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my lady.\" explained the guardswoman by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange how after the surges from earlier whatever foulness it is has remained relatively quiet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it's possibly of peaceful nature then?\" the lady fish asked her male co-worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the moment it doesn't matter what it was that was making such a commotion.

The fact that she knew she was far from done only severed to further her amusement. Her creamy doughy and rapidly increasing bulk spreading outward with each passing second countless tons piling upon anything and everything that had the misfortune of being the way of her tremendous blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later sill she continued to grow in size even after her supreme-sized form had reached the point where every inch of the equally vast field in the middle of Hyrule had been buried beneath her now mountainous self. She chuckled as she felt a portion of her belly begin to flood over the castle town soon enough even the castle itself would bend to her bulk. Same for Death Mountain now that Kakariko had been dealt with. She cooed at the cooling sensation of overtaking the Zora's domain followed by a brief fit of laughter as the forest-life of the lost woods had somehow tickled her swelling form. Moments later a strange mixture of cool and heat ran through her gigantic bulk as her monstrous butt engulfed the fishing lake and desert area belonging Gerudo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough her outlandish growth began to come to come to a close. At firs disappointed that such a marvelous event was ending only to cheer up as she came to realize how far she had gone in weight, this morning she was just an average curvy young woman now thanks to some fantastic milk she was a mountain of woman...no even better she was her own freaking country!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing was bigger or better then her! She had to be the biggest thing in Hyrule hell she was Hyrule now that thought alone made her beam with pride. She almost wished she could bring her tremendous fat-filled arms together so she could clap her hands but obviously that was out of the question so she'd have to settle on sitting back her face submerging slightly in their flab as she admired her grand size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your little girl's all grown up, Daddy!\" she stated in utter amusement a playful grin on her lips.</span></div></div>",

The last thing that she saw was a gigantic flesh-colored wall with a crack in it.  She tried to run away from whatever it was but she had been engulfed along with several other females.  Now the Sage of Spirit was in complete darkness.  She was totally surrounded by the flesh that had covered her and no doubt covered the entire desert, if not all of Hyrule.    <br>\r\n                        Nabooru was--more or less--the leader of the Gerudo since Ganondorf was defeated.  There would be no male Gerudo for at least a century.   Ever since the defeat of Ganondorf, the Sage of Spirit had been bored out of her mind.  There was no evil left in Hyrule which was a very good thing indeed but it made life boring.   Nabooru had no real reason to defend the Spirit Temple since nobody would dare attack the temple now.  So the Sage of Spirit got lazy and gained much weight.  <br>\r\n                                Nabooru shook her head to clear it.  Now was not the time to be nostalgic.  With her Sage powers, Nabooru was able to teleport herself from under the flesh wall and into an area of the desert she hadn't been to before.  In fact the area might not even be in Hyrule anymore.  She knew the desert went beyond Hyrule but she never ventured out of Hyrule before but surely there must be other countries out there besides Hyrule.<br>\r\n                                         Nabooru turned back to look at the gigantic fleshy wall that had engulfed her.  The flesh-wall towered over her by a couple of thousand feet or so it seemed to her.  What in the goddess's name happened?!   What was this wall that had covered all of the desert.  It was flesh, no doubt about it, as Nabooru felt the wall before her.   Was this a <i>person</i>?   Nabooru couldn't see how that was even possible but stranger things had happened.  </span></div></div>",

Malon was never one to hold any kind of power, her greatest strength seem to be that she was a damn good farmer. That seemed so normal though compared to Zelda who was of royalty not mention blessed with magic and Link who was a great hero to everyone in the land but now things were different she was the biggest she was the strongest, or so she thought, that it felt good really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever during all this Malon remembered one thing or rather one person, Ganondorf, she did not want to be that man. Yes she had blanked the land with her fat but Malon had no intentions of being some sort of evil ruler, she had gained out of love not hate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that being said the redhead soon realized the one glaring negative to being so large...she was left utterly immobile or at least it appeared to be that way.

Well...if she moved, she wouldn't cover the land of her birth anymore.  She would probably go elsewhere..but then what would be the point?  She'll just end up covering yet another country--if there were other countries.  Of course there was bound to be other countries; Hyrule wasn't that big!

It took several minutes but she could feel her legs getting to a standing position.  Malon was really amazed that she could move at all.  Her muscles must've undergone a similar transformation...or it could be that muscle weighed a lot more than fat.

An extra 200 pounds on a childish frame didn't look right but it did have the desired effect; Saria had new curves in all the right places; her breasts were rounder as was her butt.   All of the fat she had gained seemed to center on her breasts and rear end although a good amount of weight went to her stomach as well.

With Malon being so fat did she still have a head and her head had simply been swallowed by her own fat? <br>\r\n                           Link continued to walk until he spotted something shiny in the landscape of blubber.  He stopped and dug a bit at the blubber and pulled out a milk bottle.  For a moment Link just stared at the bottle.  How did a milk bottle get here?  Why didn't it shatter? As Link looked at the bottle he was tempted on drinking some of the milk.  Link almost did open the bottle and took a sip but stopped himself.  What if by drinking the milk Link could be bigger than Malon adding to the problem?  And yet drinking from one bottle surely couldn't make Link as large as Malon was.

If only he knew what direction to head so he could find her head!

He was concerned for her safety but remembered that Zelda was resourceful when she had to be. The princess was no fool she had to be out there doing her own thing just as he was silently he wished her luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in his thoughts Link chuckled as he realized he had momentarily forgotten about the bottle in his hand. He still had no idea how this bottle got all the way out here, had it traveled through Malon's girth as if it were a bottle lost at sea? An amusing mental image for sure and he kind of wondered if along with this one had other bottles scattered across Hyrule? He had no answer for that, unaware of how on the nose he may be considering Saria's own discovery...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case as he refocused on the milk he thought of drinking it all now to calm his thirst but if his trek was going to take up some time maybe it was best he saved the some milk for later so in the end he popped the lid and took a quick simple sip to refresh himself and prove nothing would really change...</span></div></div>",

While she was still a ball of blubber at least she was still somewhat mobile chalking it up to her being a sage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zoras were equally stunned until she broke their silence with a new order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards you will head out and find me more of these bottles.

Ruto then ordered that the Zora, Otorou, who had found the bottle accompany her and a squad of guards. Olivia understood and complied Otorou a little less so still unsure if what Ruto was doing was wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Zora squad left Ruto did excused the rest of her people however she did mention that at least someone tell the cook she wanted to meet with him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater the Zora princess was busy stuffing herself silly all sorts of specially-crafted meals seemingly disappearing down the gullet of the growing blue ball of blubber! Her gut already resting easy on the table top, while her butt grew further to cushion growing body, breasts gaining in size although not to the same degree as her butt and belly, her limbs thickening with blubber as she used her pudgy hands to continue feeding herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pushed onward it appeared that Ruto had already gained another two hundred pounds pushing her to above twelve hundred in total and it certainly seemed that she wasn't quite done yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult to tell if this was all the effects of having drank the entire bottle of fattening milk or was it Ruto's own doing, to literally shove Malon aside was a good guess perhaps.

Um...thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all Malon could stammer out the awkwardness from before still lingering around but not as much as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that you are much like me, you are confident and proud of your body no matter what your size. I respect that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" Malon felt her cheeks burn brighter. To have earned the princess' respect despite planning to overthrow her as the focus of Link's love. She didn't know what to say and now a part of her actually feeling a bit terrible at her selfish plan of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely\" Zelda could see that Malon was still a little unnerved and from her royal experience she knew it was best to ease things over first before doing anything else.</span></div></div>",

Curious she turned her head as best she could to spot that the princess was no longer behind her. For a moment she was confused about the whole thing then it hit her like a Goron slamming straight into an opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She teleported!\" yelled out a quite wide-eyed Malon, the truth was in the air as faint traces of Zelda's spell still lingered about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...is bad! Very bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the ground began to shake tremendously, the center of the quake apparently coming from within the barnyard. It didn't take long for Malon to make a hasty retreat back in the direction to where Link was. She knew damn well what was coming in the next few moments and was not looking forward to it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairy Boy! Link! Let's get out of here Now!\" she yelled at the top of her lungs as she desperately tried to reach the blonde hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malon what's wrong? Where's Zelda? Why is the ground shaking?\" \"There's no time Link we have to leave now or else!\" she screamed as she got closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink realized something terrible was on it's way when the ground shook even worse then before, noticing the worry on Malon's chubby face, and the fact that she had addressed him by his actual name and not the personal nickname she had bestowed upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link let's go!\" Malon took a hold of his thinner but more muscular arm, the poor girl was almost at her physical limit when she heard it. The sound she dreaded, the sound of the barn being crushed to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising like dough upward and outward was Princess Zelda, her attire struggled to clothe her as best it could as more and more blubber exited her already beyond bloated form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the waves of an unstoppable flood her flab continued to expand covering all in it's path, her butt growing to cover everything behind her and her titanic belly overtaking everything and anything before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her vantage point Zelda could barely make out the fleeing forms of Link and Malon, though her swelling breasts were starting to make that a bit of a hassle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda laughed proudly causing large waves to surge through her still expanding form. Having already covered the entire ranch area with her girth she snickered as her belly began to tear down what remained of Malon's home. Very soon she would outgrow the entire ranch complex.</span></div></div>",

How is Zelda getting so...fat?!\" he asked of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story Fairy Boy and I think right now she would worry more about the present then the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair continued to the hear the distinctive sound of Malon's home being crushed to pieces by the princess' increasing amount of blubber. Not to the mention the sound of Zelda's laugher, apparently she was enjoying her handy work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing they had little time left before Zelda's girth would swallow them whole Link quickly pulled out his Longshot, grabbed a hold of Malon (told her to hang on), aimed for a tree just outside of the Ranch's entrance doors, and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weapon's chain went sailing through the air until it expertly hit it's mark. Without a second thought Link reeled himself and Malon away from harm's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their narrow escape Link and Malon took a moment to catch their breaths.

Zelda's belly clearly was the biggest part of her now, but her thighs and butt had gained height as well.  Her legs were thicker than the barn she had just crushed.

Sorry but how can you ask me for a favor when you just destroyed Malon's home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was a tad bit taken back at Link's response.

I'm the one and only Great Fairy of Fat. Like you, Zelda, I became obsess with growing ever larger so much so I had to be sealed away into a limitless dimension. Obviously I, as well as the other fairies, couldn't have me replace Hyrule with my girth...although it seems that ironically has now occurred despite our past actions. Add to that your tsunami of flab was also able to break my seal and release me. Now isn't that something.\" the beyond heavy fairy laughed gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I inadvertently released you is there something you want, Great Fairy?\" asked Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing really...in fact I rather prefer it in my \"house of confinement\" than the actual world of the living.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious Zelda pressed on the matter, \"Why is that?

It took many centuries but with it now mastered I can grow and grow and grow. You are big now Zelda but compared to the sizes I have reached in the past you are still so very small.\" the fairy giggled and failed to see the ping of jealously in Zelda's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Small? How dare she mock me. No I deserve more, much more! Power of Girth hmm...I wonder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda racked her brain trying to come up with a way to take the power from The Great Fairy of Fat and add it to her own.

Her powers and magicks, all gone. Her heart dropped, and a sense of dread filled her newly emaciated being as she looked down at Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess simply rested, her eyes closed, a blank look on her face. But then, a low sound could be heard, as a smile leaked across her face. Then, her mouth opened wide as mad laughter exploded forth from Zelda, her eyes opening and glowing with her new power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer already vast-beyond-comprehension body shook and quaked as her laughter rung and echoed across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it!\" the princess cried triumphantly \"I have it!

With the sound of thunder as her power roared into effect, the princess spread across the world like an oil spill spreading across the surface of water. Miles every second engulfed and smother by her corpulence, as her body spread further and further, and to a lesser but still enormous degress, her fat continued to pile up beneath her, sending her soaring upwards higher into the heavens. The mad princess, absorbed entirely into endless vanity and the mad thrill of feeling entire countries pressed under her own flesh, kept on laughing, even after her throat hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the former Great Fairy of Fat, now the Great Fairy of Nothing, hung her head in shame and failure.</span></div></div>",

No her fatness would become a Galactic Empire before all was said and done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it wasn't already obvious it seem the greater Zelda grew the more The Great Fairy's power cracked away at the bloating princess' sanity.

The two women gasped as they instantly took notice of two key items being carried by this particular person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Hylian Shield and The Master Sword!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWide-eyed Zelda was the first to collect herself and speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's you.

Zelda's head was slightly buried in her own fat and she had at least 40 chins or so.  Zelda could feel that people were walking on her great big body, but she couldn't tell where they were.  Country after country were being covered by Zelda's fat as the princess laughed madly.  Nothing could stop Zelda's fat from spreading; even mountains were being covered by the ever-growing princess.

After all, The Fairy did say that she would help Zelda reach her goal.   Zelda used her magic to rub the country-sized Fairy's belly.   The magic that Zelda was using to give the belly rub was for attacks, but she didn't harm the fattened Fairy due to her great girth.  The Great Fairy of Fat purred while Zelda rubbed her huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"You're so good at this\" said the Fairy.  \"is this your first time at this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"Yes, it is\" said Zelda.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Well, you're doing an excellent job\" said the Fairy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"So....how did I break your seal?\" asked Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"The seal that locked me away are in the temples of Hyrule\" said the Fairy.  \"no, it's not the Sage's Seal either.   The Seal of Fat--that's what I call it--is in six pieces.  Each of these pieces are in a secret room within each of the temples of Hyrule.  When you grew to cover Hyrule, you also covered each of the temples in the ocean of your flab.  The temples are not squished; they're protected by divine power from the three goddesses themsleves.  However, the Seal of Fat has been weakened  by your covering of Hyrule.  The Divine Power that protects the temples from your flab has weakened the Seal of Fat in order to further protect the temples from being flattened.  When the Seal of Fat was weakened, I decided to come back here.  Now, the Seal of Fat is completely broken...but the Divine Power is still protecting the temples from being flattened\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 Zelda instantly inmagined the six temples of Hyrule in a bubble within her vast belly...that thought made her giggle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"I was happy in that dimension I was in\" said the Fairy.  \"but I couldn't pass the chance of returning to the world of you skinny people\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"I'm not skinny\" said Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"Like I said, I've reached sizes that make you small\" said the Fairy.  \"microscopic in fact\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"Who made that dimension?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"The three goddesses that created Hyrule\" said the Fairy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"What's it like?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"Empty\" said the Fairy.  \"a big vast void of nothing...which makes the perfect playground for me and my hefty belly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"I've heard legends about you\" said Zelda.   \"it was said that you ate people\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"I have eaten people before\" said the Fairy.  \"but, when you're as big as I was, you don't get to taste anything that's microscopic to you...don't worry, I won't eat you, if that's what you're thinking....of course, if you want me to eat you, I'll be happy to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"How long were you in that dimension?\" asked Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"Nearly 2,000 years\" said the Fairy.  \"it took me nearly that long to reach the size that I was\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"How big were you?\" asked Zelda.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"You're a country of fat\" said the Fairy.  \"I was a universe of fat\"  Here, the fairy had a dreamy look in her eye.  </span></div></div>",

What kind of punishment?  Zelda shook her head and decided to steal away the Great Fairy's Power of Girth from her, no matter the risk.  Zelda was a princess, so giving a belly rub was beneth her!  As she rubbed the belly of the Great Fairy, Zelda sucked some power from the fairy.  The Fairy was enjoying the belly rub so much that she didn't notice what Zelda was doing....at least at first.  It took the Great Fairy a mere 3 minutes to notice what Zelda was doing.  In that time, Zelda felt a rush of power enter into her counrty-sized self.

Not only was she at the mercy of the fatten fairy but on top of that the Great Fairy had the gull to lecture her as if she were some stupid child.

Zelda quickly blinked a few times and moved her fat fingers and toes quickly so as not to be caught by the fairy. It was true she could move again and that meant she could make use of her magical arsenal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now any last words or begging you might want to get to before I squish you flat?\" asked the fairy with a bit of a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah when this is all through your power is going to be mine!' she thought but decided to play the role of the helpless beggar and go with \"No please Great Fairy of Fat, please forgive this reckless fool of a princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was good at her role and almost convinced the fairy to think otherwise.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Good try but I'm afraid it's not enough.

It was Link who noticed that a great shadow was covering the countryside, and he looked up at the Great Fairy of Fat...and Malon saw the fairy too.<br>\r\n            \"Zelda!\" yelled Link.  \"what's happening?!\"<br>\r\n            Zelda didn't answer, she just kept right on preparing her spell to sap the power of the Great Fairy.  When the two made contact, the spell would take effect and it'll be all over for the Great Fairy.   Link and Malon went over to the half of ton Zelda.  <br>\r\n                  \"Zelda, who's that?\" asked Link.<br>\r\n                 \"And why is she gonna flatten us with her flab?\" asked Malon.<br>\r\n                 \"Don't bother me\" said Zelda.  \"I'm preparing a spell\" <br>\r\n                 \"You think a spell is gonna take care of that?\" asked Link, pointing up at the Great Fairy.   The Great Fairy was looking at the three little people all gathered around and smiling.  <br>\r\n                  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"Zelda! We gotta out of here...\" said Malon.<br>\r\n               \"And go where?\" asked Link.  \"whoever the newcomer is, she's as big as Hyrule!\" <br>\r\n                \"Not for long...\" said Zelda.   <br>\r\n              The Great Fairy of Fat was just ten feet above the ground.   She had been descending slowly until then.   <br>\r\n                 \"Body slam!\"  <br>\r\n                With that, The Great Fairy of Fat fell the ten feet to the ground and caused one of the biggest earthquakes in the history of Hyrule!   Again, Hyrule was covered by a country-sized person;  the Great Fairy of Fat!       <br>\r\n                 \"Behold, the new country of fat\"  said the Great Fairy, patting her huge belly.   \"I'm gonna enjoy being this size for a while\"  <br>\r\n                   </span></div></div>",

Zelda had long forgotten about Link and Malon and her sole focus became sapping more and more of the Fairy's Power of Girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA laugh of arrogance escaped the princess' lips as she noticed that not only was she stripping the fairy of her power but of her size as well, meanwhile Zelda herself seem to be growing fatter once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes passed until Great Fairy, who was happily slapping her massive belly, came to notice a bit of a change in her view as well as her power and as more time passed she came to realize what was occurring to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible...is she actually...\" the fairy didn't end her words as she continued to shrink in size (now resembling more the size of a normal Great Fairy).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...my lovely fat! How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer her question, the ground rumbled slightly before the former fat fairy landed on what appeared to be a land of creamy dough. A chuckle then pierced the air as the Great Fairy turned to see Zelda in all her country-filling glory once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda chuckled once more nearly tossing the fairy off of her as the waves of flab made their rounds across her vast belly and beyond. Once the fairy had stable footing once more she noticed a golden sphere Zelda had in her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Fairy I'm sure you can hear me.\" Zelda's tone was pure over-confidence, \"As you can see being the resourceful lady that I am I have not only managed to regain my former glory but taken the remainder of your power and housed it away within this orb.\" Zelda explained doing her best to hold the magical orb close to her grand-sized chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I wanted The Power of Girth and now I have it. The only thing left is to bind it to my body. Then and only then will my dream come true. I Zelda will blanket it all with my heavenly fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy was convinced the overdose of power was corrupting Zelda to the point of madness.</span></div></div>",

Nobody had stolen the power of a Great Fairy before, until now.  That kind of power would drive anybody insane, and they would abuse the power.  It seemed clear that Zelda was going mad from the power, and the former Great Fairy of Fat had to try anything to prevent Zelda from absorbing all her power.  There was a slim chance that the Great Fairy could take some sense to the corrupted Zelda...it was worth a shot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"Zelda, if you blanket everything with your fat, you'll squish Link and all of us\" said the Great Fairy.  \"do you really want that?  I didn't want to squish everything in my fat when I was experimenting with my size all those years ago.  I asked the three goddesses to take me somewhere where I can get as big as I wanted to and not kill anyone;  to that end, the three goddesses made for me a new dimension.  That dimension was empty and infinite and I enjoyed being as fat as I can get.  Soon....I got very lonely being the only person in that dimension.   You get awfully lonely when you're fatter than several universes.   It soon became clear to me that being that fat was a curse and not a blessing.  Please don't do this, Princess of Hyrule.  You may regret your decision one day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               The orb that contained the Great Fairy's power was in Zelda's hand and she paused when she heard the speech of the former Fairy of Fat.

I still want to feel what's it's like to truly be enormous. But I understand if I do that in this plane I'll crush everything under my countless layers of fat.

The orb itself was tiny, but it held immense power.  Zelda nodded slowly and handed over the power back to the Fairy, where she ate the orb in order to restore her full power.  The Fairy smiled and pointed a finger at Zelda.<br>\r\n                \"I'm putting a fattening spell on you\" said The Fairy of Fat.  \"it'll activate once you're in the dimension I was sealed away in.

Instantly, the fattened Zelda was gone.  Link and Malon had watched what had happened and was standing near the Great Fairy of Fat somewhere on Hyrule Field.  The Fairy looked around to see Malon and Link watching her.<br>\r\n                \"Would you two like to me my fountain?\" asked the Fairy.<br>\r\n                \"You have a fountain?\" asked Malon. <br>\r\n                \"Of course\" giggled the Fairy of Fat.  \"all Great Fairies have their fountains.

The Canyon was more than a mile deep in certain places...and even deeper if you ventured outside of Hyrule to parts unknown.  Nobody really knew what lay beyond the lands of Hyrule;  Some people say that the goddesses that made Hyrule made their home somewhere in the wilderness beyond Hyrule, but Link didn't believe those stories.   The Great Fairy of Fat told Link and Malon that the cave that her fountain was in was nearly 4 miles down in the canyon. <br>\r\n                        \"Four miles?!\" asked Malon and Link in shock.<br>\r\n                        \"Don't worry\" said the Fairy.  \"we'll make it if we jump\"<br>\r\n                         \"Jump for 4 miles?!\" asked Malon.  \"that would kill us!\"<br>\r\n                        \"That's why I'm going to do the jumping first\" said the Fairy.   \"I'll catch you in my fat.  Soft landing, you know\"<br>\r\n                          \"And why would we want to go to your fountain?\" asked Link.  \"I've been to the other Great Fairy Fountains...they all look the same\"<br>\r\n                       \"Ah\" said the Fairy of Fat.  \"my fountain is different, you see\"<br>\r\n                         \"How different?\" asked Link.<br>\r\n                        \"Come and find out\"  said the Fairy, and she started walking towards Gerudo Valley.  Malon and Link shrugged at each other and followed the Fairy, who looked to have gained 2,000 pounds in an instant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                           Zelda popped into what looked like the Temple of Light; she was in some sort of chamber in any case.  Zelda looked around and noticed a door that led to the outside.  Zelda left the temple, to discover that she was in a white void.  There was nothing under her feet, and yet she didn't fall.  Sure enough, as soon as she exited the temple, she started to gain weight steadily.  She looked back at the temple to discover that the temple had vanished.  <br>\r\n                             \"Welcome, Zelda\" said a voice that echoed through the void. <br>\r\n                             \"Who's that?\" asked Zelda.  \"I thought this dimension was empty\"<br>\r\n                           \"It is\" said the voice. <br>\r\n                            \"Then who are you?\" <br>\r\n                           \"Get fat enough and find out\" chuckled the voice.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Link rested his head on Malon's stomach and sighed happily \"I don't know but I bet it will be amazing to experience\" \"Actually, you two are the first Hylians to ever enter my fountain\" The Great Fairy of Fat said excitedly. \"Wow, really?\" Malon said . \"Yes, thats why I appeared before the people all around Hyrule. My fountain is nearly impossible to find, so I go out to bring people to my fountain to visit. I've had Zoras, Dekus, Kokiris and even some friendly talking monsters visit my fountain but not Hylians because all the Hylians I met were frightened by my powers and my jiggly girth.  So I roamed the land searching for Hylians I can have fun and hang out with . . . and also to eat. *giggle!!!*\". \"Uhhh, have you ever digested the people you eat?\" Link said nervously. \"Welll yes, but only evil people, many people are living in my stomach right now.\" The Great Fairy of Fat said happily as she patted her stomach causing jiggles to go across her belly.          <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally got there, the Great Fairy levitated them off her belly and jumped into what seemed like an endless aybss of darkness. Link put on his golden gauntlets and lifted Malon into his arms.

The canyon itself was quite dark, with sunlight hardly coming down to it.  Link and Malon fell like rocks.  Link managed to keep his grip on Malon, although it was no easy task.  Link glanced downwards and saw nothing but deep darkness, making him worry that the Fairy had sent them to their death.  However, after falling for two solid minutes, Link saw light at the bottom of the canyon.  The light seem to come from several torches on the canyon walls, and there was something else at the bottom;  a narrow ledge that was beside a sizable river.  At the last moment, Link saw what could only be the Great Fairy's belly and they landed on it, nearing sinking right into the flab.  The Great Fairy giggled and lifted Link and Malon off her tummy.<br>\r\n                 \"My fountain is half a mile in that direction\" said the Great Fairy, pointing to a path that was lighted by the torches.

I tried to eat Ganondorf during his reign, but he had powerful magic behind him at that time....he managed to evade being my snack\"<br>\r\n               They came to the entrance of a cave mouth.   The opening of the cave was quite normal-looking, and a thin stream of the river went right into the cave.  <br>\r\n                  \"Here it is\" said  the Great Fairy.  <br>\r\n                  The cave was a natural one as well as an old one.

It did look like the other Great Fairy Fountains that Link had been to, but on a larger scale.  The fountain itself was the size of Hyrule Field, and there was the mark of the triforce in front of the fountain.

Saria grabbed the golden orb of light, which was much bigger than her, and swatted it toward the former Great Fairy of Fat.  The Great Fairy rushed forward, hoping to reclaim all of her magic (and all her lovely blubber along with it).

How can I...]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Being a Sage means I can transmit my thoughts into your mind, Link.] explained Zelda. [Listen I have a bit of favor to ask, will you hear me out?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn honesty Link actually wanted to be the one asking Zelda a few questions but he decided to play along for the time being, curious as to what the epic weighting princess had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Go on.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Okay good. Here's what I want you to do for me. Head toward the Spirit Temple Nabooru should still be there and I want you to help look for a magical item called \"The Rod of Fattening\".]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[What's the heck is that?] asked Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[It's an item created by the Great Fairy of Fat] a bit of a light bulb went off in Link's head [Basically from what I was told it can make someone as fat as they want. I can only assume there is no limit to it's power.] Link didn't like the sound of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I want you, Link, to find that rod for me and deliver it to me, pretty please.] said Zelda in as kind a tone as she could muster. A moment later their conversation came to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairy Boy? Hey you still with me?\" Malon took a step toward Link. \"Yoohoo!\" she waved a chubby hand directly in front of his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh oh...sorry, Malon, it's just that Zelda contacted me telepathically a moment ago.\" Link went on to explain the whole conversation/request from the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So she wants you to go get this magical rod for her.\" 'Well seeing as she's far too fat to move I can see why she'd have to ask for help.' thought Malon as she giggled mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I don't think I have to explain why she wants it in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get even bigger than she already is.\" Malon stated with a rather serious look and tone, \"If it's true that there's no limit to that thing's power...then in turn there'll be no limit to Zelda's blubber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one way of putting it. In any case we're going to go find that rod...but only because if it gives weight perhaps there's a way to take away as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon could only find herself smiling at Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So going to play the role of the hero again huh, Fairy Boy?\" Link nodded with a bit of a laugh. \"Okay then let's go find that treasure!\" cheered on Malon with a giggle and a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later Malon was once again pressing herself onto Link as he used his ocarina and his song knowledge to get the two of them to the Spirit Temple.</span></div></div>",

Malon and Link could only stare in amazement as they saw that the temple wasn't covered in Zelda's blubber.  Zelda's miles of blubber was being held back by some kind of force field, which covered the temple and the surrounding area.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"That's amazing...\" said Malon.  \"how can it hold back Zelda's weight?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n            \"Nabooru must be doing it\" said Link.  \"or...it could be the Golden Goddesses...anyway, let's go get that Rod!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               The pair both entered the Spirit Temple and saw Nabooru standing there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"Hey, Link\" said the skinny Gerudo leader.  \"its been a while\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"Yes, it has\" said Link.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n             \"You know each other?\" asked Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"Of course\" said Link.  \"I had to rescue her from Twinrova...and awaken her Sage powers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"And for that, I'm greatful\" said Nabooru.  \"now, about this Rod...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"Do you know where it is?\" asked Link.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"It's behind that statue in that one room\" said Nabooru vaguely, but Link knew what she was talking about;  There was this huge statue of a goddess that held the room where he fought Twinrova.  He didn't consider that there could be another room behind the statue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Okay...let's go Malon\" said Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                     The pair left Nabooru and headed for the room with the giant statue.  With the Golden Gauntlets, Link easily lifted the statue and set it aside. Malon just stared in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"Wow\" said Malon.  \"how much weight can you pick up with those Gauntlets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"I don't think I'll be able to lift Zelda....not all of her, anyway\" said Link.  \"but I can lift some pretty heavy stuff\"  <br>\r\n             <br>\r\n                 The pair found a door that led to a room where there was a golden statue, clearly meant to hold something.  But the statue wasn't holding anything.  The statue was that of a fat woman...fatter than Malon, in fact.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"Who's that?\" asked Malon.  \"she's none of the three goddesses...or anyone that I know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"Nevermind that\" said Link.  \"where's the Rod?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    There was no sign of a Rod in the room.  That's when the pair realized that Nabooru must have the Rod!  They rushed back to Nabooru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"You have the Rod!\" said Link.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"You finally realize it, huh?\" asked Nabooru, as she pulled out a Rod.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"What are you gonna do?\" asked Malon.  \"become as big as Zelda...or bigger than Zelda\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                       \"I haven't decided, to tell the truth\" said Nabooru.  \"being the size of a country sounds cool, but you're not very mobile.

The tan-skinned woman then continued, \"Link I never had any intention of deceiving the two of you, I just wasn't sure of your allegiance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a hero through and through so it lays with the good of the people. In all honestly Nabooru, Malon and I had no intention of handing the rod over to Zelda.

So I fatten myself up to win him over but when Zelda caught sight of this along with hearing of the milk that did this to me she went ahead and drank it all...I suppose to prove that she was the dominant female in the land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon continued onward now that she had the attention of both Link and Nabooru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly even after drinking it all she shouldn't have ended up as big as she did, Fairy Boy and I assume that she messed with the formula to increase her weight gain even more and now she wants that magical rod so she can grow even fatter...I won't let her! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone is going to stop Zelda's insane dream of covering everything with her blubber I want it to be me.

They should've been back by now....even if they couldn't find the Rod of Weight Loss.   Finally, Link came to a decision;  it wasn't his first choice, but he had to go into Jabu-Jabu to find out what was taking so long.  Lord Jabu-Jabu opened his wide jaws to allow Link to enter his belly.  Link was holding a latern;  it was extremely easy to get lost in the belly of Jabu-Jabu.   Link moved from chamber to chamber in search for the three girls.  He called out for them;  there was no answer.  That made Link even more uneasy than he alreadly felt.  The gurgles and groans from Jabu-Jabu's belly were louder than Link remembered they were.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"Ruto!\" he called.  \"Malon!  Nabooru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        As he was going in deeper into Jabu-Jabu's belly, Link thought he heard a shout from somewhere up ahead.   \"Malon! Nabooru!  Ruto!\"  His voice echoed in the great belly.  <br>\r\n              \"Link!\"  came Malon's cry.  \"help us!\"  <br>\r\n               Link rushed forward, eager to help the three ladies in whatever danger they found themsleves in.  Link entered a chamber that he didn't recongize at all;  it was a big chamber with four exits to it--including the one that led into the chamber itself.    \"Malon!\"  Link called.   This time, he got no reply.<br>\r\n                 \"I'm going to smell like fish for days...\" muttered Link angerily.  <br>\r\n                  \"Malon!\"  <br>\r\n                 \"Link!\" came Nabooru's voice.

Zelda wished she could use her arms to rub the sides of her stomach but considering how fat-filled her limbs were it proved useless even with magic...they were just to heavy to lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned again something was definitely happening inside her. Then it stopped, whatever was causing those sudden cramps just ended it's run just as quickly as it had began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sighed in relief with that behind her she could now continue relaxing and enjoying the feeling of being a planet all onto herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until another rumbling arose and once again Zelda was knocked out of her relaxed state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now? Ohh...\" she gasped as she suddenly felt pressure begin to build up in her globe-spanning buttcheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no please...not that!\" screamed Zelda, the pressure building up further deep within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda gasped and struggled as she tried her best to force the internal gas to subside, her face and multiple chins swaying from side to side. Down below her constant shaking was causing the whole planet to shake alongside her, her buttcheeks burying themselves deeper into the planet's surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile within The Spirit Temple, Nabooru found herself holding on a stone pillar while Link crashed and burned straight into...Malon's cleavage area!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink quickly realized where exactly he was when he heard Malon's soft giggle tilting his head upward met Malon face to face. The two blushed heavily before separating from one another. Pulling themselves up to their feet Link questioned Nabooru on what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure myself...I can only hope that wasn't a signal that Zelda is somehow becoming even larger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She probably covers the world with her fat and you think she could possibly become even bigger?!\" yelled Malon in utter shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru simply shook her head from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in any case maybe I should check outside just to make sure.\" commented Link as he began to make his way toward the temple's entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairy Boy, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link stop the temple is still somewhat protected by it's own divine power but you'll be crushed if you take a step outside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of what was said Link continued on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry my Zora tunic will ensure my safety. It'll just be like I'm swimming in an ocean of um...well fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru grumbled in annoyance, 'That boy is more stubborn then I am.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" she called out to Malon, \"Let's stop him before he goes and does something stupid.\" Malon agreed and the two rushed to catch up to Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Zelda gasped once again as she felt the pressure from before build up with even more effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGH!\" she yelled as she (the planet) shook heavily from her constant rumbling. A moment later like the fuse to a canon running out a blast rang out that caused Zelda to shake and quiver like a bowl full of jello!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...I mean Oh My!\" exclaimed Zelda she knew her sudden gas attack may have shaken the very planet down to the core, it did after all shake her own planetary form which had yet to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile down below on the surface Link had once again crashed and burned only this time there was no Malon to soften his sudden impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hazy in the head Link recalled opening the temple doors just as Malon and Nabooru ran up to him and urged him to stop what he doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was that but what he remembered quite clearly was opening the doors wide enough and long enough to see nothing but creamy flesh in front of him like some sort of vast impenetrable wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward came what he believed to be a sound-wave so powerful it literally knocked him off his feet and flung him halfway across the temples' main hall but the strangest thing was the moment it hit him he thought his nose caught a whiff of the faint smell of fresh milk as crazy as that sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill dizzy Link tried his best to shake away the mental cobwebs but instead something caught the corner of his eye.</span></div></div>",

She tried to contain it, but it was proving to be impossible.  The latest gas attack felt even bigger than the last one, and Zelda couldn't understand why this was happening to her.

Malon and Nabooru even felt some exceptianally huge women covering the areas where The zora domain and the village of the 'fairy-kids' as Malon called them. These mounds were known as Saria and Ruto. Then the rumbling came back, only this time it was a burp, instead of a fart, and each of them felt their fat jump and grow, their fat lines running into the other's. \"Great, so burps make us grow, and farts make OTHER people grow.....\" Malon said to herself as she looked at herself in awe.</span></div></div>",

She was launched into space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          The fart was too much for the Spirit Temple.  The fart acted like an A-bomb, as the temple was vaporized.  Both Malon and Nabooru each grew fatter, and Link was buried in the flab of Malon.  Malon and Nabooru grew fatter and fatter until they were each covering the planet in their flab.  The two of them took whole halves of the planet.  Nabooru used her Sage powers to protect Malon from the vacuum of space.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \"Oh great...\" said Nabooru, and sighed heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"Is there anyone that could help us shrink back down to size?\" asked Malon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             </span></div></div>",

After a good minute or so Link was able to grab a hold of the rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Almost forgot about you.' Link mentally chuckled before resuming on his way to the surface of Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTopside Malon watched silently as her blubber swayed and waved every other minute, she figured even the most simple moments would cause her to wobble around like a vat of jello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the ranch girl laid there hoping that something or someone would come to her and Nabooru's rescue. Malon also wished she could at least converse with Nabooru but all she could really do was feel the older woman's fat rub and pile up against her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she sighed again causing another group of waves to flow through her flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she felt a good deal of movement from one particular spot on her massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink gasped for fresh air as he popped up from beneath Malon's blubber, thankful he had made it out in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man felt like I was swimming for days...\" Link inhaled and exhaled quickly a moment later he pulled himself out of the ranch girl's flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteading his footing Link looked far out into the horizon but all he could see was the creamy girth of his friend stretching out for what seem close to eternity. He knew he had to find her face and after taking one more look around came to spot a location of land that nearly made him nose-bleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the distance was a pair of mountains many times bigger then that of Death Mountain back in Hyrule but Link knew those weren't exactly \"mountains\" made of rock and gravel but instead made of soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink chuckled to himself. At least he knew in which direction Malon's head was now but before that he had scale a pair of mountain-sized breasts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no time like the present!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a ear-to-ear grin pasted on his face Link eagerly rushed off.</span></div></div>",

Link's boots sunk into Malon's flab as he walked...it was like walking in snow.  He still had the Rod of Fattening with him.  At least nobody else had the Rod...or there would be yet another planet-sized person.<br>\r\n              After two hours, Link came to the mountains of flesh that were Malon's breasts.  The two breasts towered over him, and they seemed to go upwards forever.  Link grabbed the flesh and started to climb.  He slipped a couple of times, but he made good time.  The climb lasted for what seemed like days.  Without the Zora tunic, Link was sure he would die from the lack of air.   <br>\r\n               Finally, he came to the summit of Mt. Malon and just had to rest for a bit.  As he did so, he looked around. He still couldn't see Malon's face yet,but he saw what must be her jaw...or her several chins at least.  He also saw Malon's nipple, which made him nosebleed and highly aroused.   Malon's nipple looked to be the size of Hyrule Field!   Why, her nipple could swallow him whole and he'll be in the caverns of her breast...so Link gave the nipple a wide berth.  Even so, he came across a thin stream of milk.   </span></div></div>",

It took a while but Link eventually made it and paused a foot away from it.

Link quickly gathered himself though and took a split-second sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe milk to his surprise was fresh and rather tasty, licking his lips dry he chuckled mildly while blushing heavily as he realized he enjoyed the taste of Malon's milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'd probably stab me with a pitchfork if I told her though.\" he commented to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding he had better get back to rescaling Malon's immense breast Link took one last look at Malon's enormous nipple.

Zelda was bigger than Malon and Nabooru combined, so she was easy to spot.  Zelda was floating about 200 miles away (in space, that's like super close), and Zelda seemed to be in \"orbit\" of the fat pair that now covered the world.  Link saw that the moon was orbiting around Zelda...the moon was dwarfed by Zelda.  Link didn't see Zelda's face, but he did saw something that made him blush once more;  he was looking at Zelda's planetary ass.  Link continued his way towards Malon's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Zelda had been trying to turn around in space.  With her as big as she was, it was going to take her a while to rotate to the direction she wanted to turn.  It seemed as if Zelda was done farting...for now at least. She spotted the moon that was in her orbit.  Zelda was so big and massive that she had her own gravity.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 Nabooru had taken this calmly.  She didn't want to become a planet, but now it seemed that had happened. She could feel Malon's fat piling on her own fat.  She, of course, couldn't see Malon.  All that Nabooru could see was her own flab that seemed to go on forever.  <br>\r\n                    That's when Nabooru felt something on her massive belly; like somebody was walking on her belly.   It was really faint, but she could feel someone--or something--walking along her massive belly.   Could it be Link?  Nabooru didn't see what had happened to Link...she had guessed he had been swallowed up by her own fat or Malon's.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             </span></div></div>",

Well that was a good question and one that she had no clear idea of as far as an answer went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless young Saria continued on her way. The childhood friend to Link was thankful she had as much energy as currently did, a lesser person would have possibly collapsed onto the blubbery tan ground below her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria along with the other Kokiri weren't exactly sure what had occurred when Zelda first flooded Hyrule. Luckily The Forest Temple was able to provide safe zone for them all. Things got even more complicated when Zelda's fatness went on to cover the entire world. Of course then came her sound-barrier breaking farts that freed the planet from her girth only to have two others cover it with theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all very complicated for the young girl to take in but here she was traveling along a lone fatty road to who knows where. The rest of the Kokiri were currently housed within Nabooru's vast belly-button, mostly because it was the closest place Saria using her Sage abilities was able to transport them to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria sighed to herself as she looked far into the distance yet all she could see was nothing more then tan blubber. The trip was far from over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to collect herself Saria gazed downward at her slightly chubbier body. It seem that Saria as well had been affected by Zelda's fattening milk scented farts although obviously not the degree that had affected Malon and Nabooru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria's total weight clocked in at around somewhere between 375 and 400 pounds definitely a huge step up from her original tiny weight but not as bad as it could have been for her. She has thankful for that at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case she had it on a good guess that all of this girth belonged to Nabooru but the girl couldn't seem to sent a mental signal out to her. The distance was simply too far even with their Sage abilities that or her powers were just too weak. Whatever the reason Saria now had to take the long way to speak with Nabooru directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering herself she prepared to continue her journey.</span></div></div>",

Saria waddled with her new weight, but she made good time.  There was nothing but tan blubber for miles around and Saria felt like a tiny bug.  Saria decided to take a short rest again.  She could just see mountains on the horizon...which had to be Nabooru's breasts.  Still a long way to go.  Again, Saria tried and failed to talk to Nabooru using her sage powers.  Saria was by far the weakest of the Sages.  The most powerful Sage was Princess Zelda herself.  Saria wondered if Zelda was behind all this trouble. <br>\r\n              That's when Saria noticed something strange up in the sky;  it was the planet-sized Zelda.

Impa was also a bit chubbier than usual due to Zelda's milk smelling farts.  Impa's weight was probably around 500 pounds or so.

There, the Princess of Hyrule looked around. <br>\r\n                 \"What happened?\" asked Zelda.  \"could that Rod shrank me down?\"<br>\r\n                \"Indeed, it did\" said a voice.  Zelda looked to see who had spoken, and found a skull kid on her vast belly. <br>\r\n                \"Where did you come from?\" asked Zelda.  \"and...how did you come here?  I thought the Kokiri died if they left the forest\"<br>\r\n                      The skull kid grinned.  \"Who said I was a Kokiri?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             </span></div></div>",

Once, long ago, the Skull Kids were infact a great race known as the Churus. The Churus were much different than I appear now. They were large beings, known throughout the kingdoms for their weight. But unlike so many other species, the Churus took pride in their obesity, for it was their strength. It made their bodies impervious to damage, and allowed them to survive hardship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Churus were blessed, for they were the children of gods, the great Gods and Goddesses of Fat. All aspects of weight gain were controlled by these divine beings, from gorging to expansion\u2026there were gods in charge of big pillowy asses and goddesses that determined how mobile one would be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink raised an eyebrow. \u201cThere were\u2026Gods and Goddesses of Fat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Skull Kid glared at him. \u201cYou have met talking trees, bongo playing ghosts and to top matters off, have grown to the size of a country, your body bloated and so beautifully fat\u2026and you doubt this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201che has a point, Link.\u201d Malon stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to the Churus?\u201d Nabooru asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what does this have to do with me getting bigger?\u201d Zelda demanded, her gigantic breasts jiggling as she worked herself into a huff. The tremors in her body transferred to the others, and sound the Skull Kid found himself in a 4 country sized earthquake of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will explain!\u201d he said, enjoying the ride. \u201cThe Churus, like all great races, grew greedy. My people believed they could rival their fathers and mothers, the gods and goddesses of fat. They were wrong. The divine ones left this plane, shattering their forms and rejoining the well of souls, but not before they stripped us of our gifts. As the years past, we lost our weight until we became mere husks\u2026skeletal children of the forgotten gods\u2026the Skull Kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow terrible.\u201d Malon whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink groaned. \u201cMalon, we have more important things to worry about\u2026like the fact that my ass is crushing several hundred square acres!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Skull Kid nodded. \u201cWhich leads me to why we are here today! It was long foretold that there would come a time, when the princess of a great kingdom would show signs of the weight the Churus once held. When this time came, the Skull Kids would be able to use the magic they were forbidden to use on themselves to grant her and others like her, beings of great power, the gift of fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026\u201d Zelda began, liking where this was going. \u201cI sense there is more to the story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dBut of course!\u201d The Skull Kid exclaimed. \u201cThe legends said this princess would be joined by others, and that these beings were the reincarnations of the gods and goddesses of fat. By returning them to their true size, the Skull Kids would return their memories, and thus, allow me and my people to become the Churus again, while you each will produce new children to replenish our race.\" He pointed at Link. \"You will have the most important task of reproducing with the women, so that they can grow fat with children and birth new Churus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cYou mean\u2026you think we are reborn gods?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink shook his head. \u201cNo way\u2026I did not sign up for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSounds interesting\u2026\u201d Malon stated, gleeful at the thought of not only being immortal but getting to have sex with Link...a big, fat, sexy version of him to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSign me up!\u201d  Zelda exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys can\u2019t be serious!\u201d Link shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Skull Kid turned to Link. \u201cYou have no say in this. Once I increase your size just a bit more, you will regain your memories and feel rather silly for resisting your destiny. Of course, there are several others that need to join you...Saria, Ruto, and a few more...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink struggled, his massive weight causing the other country size beings to wiggle, resulting in the girls cooing in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Skull Kid held out the rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Link's cock should have ripped her wide open, but instead Malon seemed to be filled with energy, becoming stronger with each thrust. Bringing one of her massive tits to his face, Link teased her nipple, circling it with his tongue before clamping down and sucking hard, bringing her into her first of many, many orgasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru watched in envy as her friend and rival was being pumped by the new god of fat. Each thrust she watched made her hornier, lusting for him more and more. But what she saw next, even after all that had happened blew her mind. Inflating like it was being filled with air, Link's ball sack was growing at a tremendous rate. It grew and grew, until it pressed against the ground, miles below. His balls seemed to pulse with a supernatural energy, and soon his shaft grew even wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink's member grew until there was no room left. The sheer force it took to continue to pump Malon was tremendous, and the friction of each thrust only caused Malon to cum again and again, her juices lubricating Link's shaft, allowing him to continue to plug away. Suddenly, a loud gurgled emanated from Link's sack, and a massive bulge appeared at the base of his shaft. Link looked into Malon's eyes. \"And so Malon, are you prepared to assume you role as a Goddess of the Fat, taking your place by my side and spawning my children?\" Malon, just coming down from another orgasm had just enough self control to cry \"YES!\" as loud as she could, and Link came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulge pulsed up Link's member, doubling its size before passing into Malon. Lifting her head back to cry, Malon was struck by her mightiest orgasm yet as a wave of supernatural seed flowed from Link into her womb. It felt as if the entire ocean was pouring into her. Link's seed filled every inch of Malon's belly and still he poured into her. Rolls of fat smoothed out as her skin stretched to accommodate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like a lifetime to Malon, Link's never ending deluge of seed stopped. Withdrawing his still very erect shaft, Link marveled at his work. Malon, a country of fat, lay flat on her back, her massive gut arching proudly into the air. No rolls on her belly were evident, her titanic mass being filled to the brim with the Fat God's seed. From the look on her face, Link could tell she was in heaven. Pressing a hand against her belly, Link was greeted first by a pleasing slosh and then a squish, his hand sinking into her belly as if it was dough. \"Dang Farie Boy... aren't you a.... hose.\" Malon gasped out between pants, exhausted by the romp. Malon's belly bubbled as the seed within morphed into fat. Dozens of rolls formed on her belly, her limbs thickening. It was if Malon was being inflated with fat instead of air. Quickly, her mass surged outwards, her previously country sized body being dwarfed by her new one. Zelda and Nabooru merely looked on with a mixture of awe and jealousy <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her growth stopped, Malon's eyes glazed over before snapping back into focus. Her voice, shaky at first, soon boomed across the plains. \"I-I remember. I REMEMBER!\" She looked over to Link. \"And so we have returned. And I shall do as is my duty.\" Malon's massive belly began to glow. \"To bare your children!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly her stomach began to bulge. Like rising dough it swelled higher and higher, filling with the life force of the Churus Link's seed had supplied. Her breasts swelled as well, inflating as milk surged into them, future fountains of nutrients for the reborn race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink stood back, looking over to the Skull Kid. \"I think I may have overdone it a little.\" The skull kid merely laughed. \"But no sire! The legend foretold that the first of the Goddesses was to be of fertility, and Malon indeed shall make a fine Goddess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded. \"Indeed! But...\" he said, turning toward his other two companions. \"Which of you...\" he gestured to his still erect cock, \"Is to be reborn next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru and Zelda locked eyes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Within 5 minutes, Malon emerged from Nabooru's fat, ending up near Nabooru's vast belly button. Malon continued to grow and grow until she reached the size of the other two ladies...and kept on growing!  Both  Zelda and Nabooru got a glimpse of Malon's smug look on her face before the two countries of fat were completely covered by Malon.   \"I think I've won\" said Malon just before Zelda was overtaken by Malon's girth.  Now, the young ranch woman was a contient of fat...and yet, she still grew.  Malon had a firm grip on the Rod of Fattening, determined to not let the Rod be lost in her ever-growing girth...where Zelda, Nabooru, or even Link might find it.  Malon still grew and grew, until she covered the entire world with her fat.  Malon marveled at her sheer size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               \"Fairy Boy, you're the size of a fairy to me\" said Malon, and laughed...which sent great waves of fat all over her planet-sized belly.

She'll put the Rod somewhere it couldn't be found; her stomach!     Malon smiled and swallowed the Rod in one gulp.    \"If anybody wants the Rod of Fattening, they'll have to go down my throat to go get it\"  Malon laughed once more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked past her fat cheeks in absolute marvel as her landmass of stretched flesh quivered and seemingly moved on its very own, left, right, downward, upward, mountains of flesh folding in on itself.  Her breasts folded and plopped upward and over her vast gut flesh.  She was a monsterous marvel to behold.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon peered into the blackness of space and watched as the moon seemingly lowered and landed itself right between her gargantuan breasts.  She coo'd a bit and soon her flesh wrinkled up around the rocky sphere, almost as if it was being absorbed deep into her universal form.  Her body kept growing far beyond the planet her body'd covered, like rising dough in the vastness of space.  Gasious eruptions shook Malon's flesh from every end, stretch marks were common, and dug deep into her continous flesh, she'd lost any true form she once had.

Her breasts, belly, and butt now housing far too many universes it was impossible to tell where her original universe had ended up as she grew larger and larger and larger.

It should all be gone all that fattening madness meant Hyrule should be buried in her fat well in someone else who obviously she blanketed in her own blubber but that wasn't it at all. There was no signs of any of that conflict and as she struggled to find her footing, apparently she was laid out on the ground, Malon realized that she was in fact back home where everything had started it wasn't the only thing she realized she carrying quite a good deal of weight on her, she had to be three perhaps four times her average weight putting her near or around four hundred pounds. She was enormous from her shelf of a butt to her creamy thicken thighs her barrel of a belly and the proud owner of amazing breasts, her arms and face having fatten up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this the rod's doing? She wondered just as she heard the tremendous arrival of Zelda and Link. The hero and the butterball of a princess greeting her as if nothing had ever happened in the past although Link was initially shocked at Malon's new weight before Zelda slightly slapping him across the head stating that he should never speak of a woman's weight without her permission. Zelda simply stating that she wore it well and the tubby redhead said the same for the princess, in the back of her mind still putting everything together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They don't remember or maybe they don't even know. Did I somehow fix everything?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have an answer instead invited them both to a hot meal jumping at the chance but of course royally thanking her first afterwards she pulled Link aside for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up? You seem kind of distracted Malon anything I can do to help?\" he asked in truth she wanted to tell him everything about what happened but feared that she'd just be messing things up all over again so instead asked for a Bombchu stating that she had one last chore to take off. Link agreed only after she stated that while she's softer now that doesn't mean her ranch skills are too. With Link out of the way she headed toward where her dad kept the cooler with the special milk. After clearing the area of any of the animals and muttering an apology to her father Malon activated the Bombchu and closed the door behind her the section of the barn rumbling slightly as the mouse-looking bomb destroyed the milk leaving nothing of it behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done Malon was confident she had prevented the crazed fat-filled future or so she had hoped so time-travel was weird Link would've most likely mentioned if she had bothered to explain everything to him. In any case afterwards she headed inside her home ready to finally get that meal for her and her friends going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear to the goddesses above that all looks astounding Malon I may very well eat you out of house and home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda mentioned playfully as Link chuckled slightly embarrassed at the fatty royal's remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sure you could. But I'm thinking you won't just this once.\" Malon stated with a playful wink of her eye and tongue sticking just slightly outward as she placed more plates on the table. Link and Zelda staring at her for moment before bursting into a cheerful laugh as did Malon as she joined right in in the good times and good food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead would always wonder what had happened to the rod of fattening if she still carried it within her or if it was destroyed when she seemingly exploded in space it was hard to say and maybe she didn't want to know either way. She also wondered if she should ever tell Link and Zelda about what had really happened again it was hard to say but perhaps it was better she didn't in any case that was all for another day right now all that mattered to her was sitting here in her ranch home having a wonderful meal with her dear and equally wonderful friends.</span></div></div>",

With the knowledge of a god, she realizes that it's a whole new universe separate from her own. She looks around and finds herself surrounded by an infinitude of other universes, some similar to her own, others radically different. She could see the Mario universe, the Metroid universe, and many others. Eventually, her expanding mass touches one of the universes that was the closest to her and, like a bubble, it pops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon then gets a crazy idea. Imagine her getting so unbelievably fat that she completely dwarfs every reality, every existence, every dimension. Too fat for anyone's mind to comprehend. A literally endless ocean of fat, but even words like \"endless\" and \"infinity\" wouldn't do it justice.

I don't know I just know I've got star systems in every fat fold, not to mention all the ones housed right inside my reality-spanning breasts and butt. No seriously stop and think about it for second I'll wait...pretty crazy, huh! I was never really too self conscious about my figure, thanks mom, but there's literal civilizations living inside my breasts and on and around my butt cheeks, yeah that can make anyone embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face buried as it is in my own blubber is no different really all these universes housed in my numerous chins, I'll spare you the number, and super fat but also super cute fatty cheeks. So I bet you're thinking if I'm speaking out loud that's some kind of cosmic safety hazard well yeah it would be but apparently my abilities have grown to a point where a) I can just do it telepathic-like so no danger there or b) I subconsciously shield anything around my mouth to not be in mortal danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm apparently amazing that way although to be fair I'm kind of discovering all this on my own since you know becoming a reality-spanning blob means you're kind of left to your own devices on personal matters and despite what you may think I'm not about to become some crazed tyrant of a goddess that's not the type of girl Dad raised, if only he could see me now...well he can, kind of, sort of, not really but maybe he can just feel that I'm okay you know parents are like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway this whole experience has been amazing to take part in seriously I did all this by just getting fatter and fatter rather mind blowing if I actually give it some deep thought but see here's the thing breaking this fourth wall/source wall whatever you wish to call it means well I don't think I go any further in fatness which is sad but also okay I mean I broke reality as I knew it with my blubber. However like I said I'm little by little discovering what I can do with my powers so how about a few options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA) You stick around here with me for a little while longer and chill with the reality-busting redhead as she figures out what else she can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB) We check in on what Fairy Boy and the others are doing at the moment. No really they're not gone they're just on me somewhere but trust me I can find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC)Last choice, unfortunately there's a system in place that even I can't break on my end(weird huh), I create a super tubby copy of myself insert her back into my world of Hyrule and follow things through her eyes. So it's like I'm there but not really and obviously you'll come along as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how about it, friend?</span></div></div>",

Not sure what will happen though but I guess that's what makes it exciting so here we go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh I got this no worries, with a newfound sense of wonder and curiosity I began to fuel my reality blob of a body to push out further and deeper into whatever may lie beyond the fact that I have broken the fourth wall. My seemingly endless fat churns and wobbles as my girth spreads forcing reality itself to quake and tear before reshaping itself it's a spectacle really my blubber is so astounding I am literally reshaping reality just to grow to further levels in fatness I find myself smiling even as my face is further surrounded in my own massiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery portion of me is swelling in fat and in pride as my butt, breasts, and belly pound away at what should be the absolute limits of what can should contain me but mere moments later there I am warping shattering what was once the reality before it and before it as I continue to swell out. Once upon a time it was mere pounds, man that was a long time ago, then it was tons, at some point I was gaining planets worth and whole star systems but now and I'll keep this simple every passing moment I'm gaining a reality's worth! Trust me that sounds as nuts as it feels I think only by talking to you do I keep myself from either passing out or going mad like crazy mind-snapping mad so thanks for being my anchor. Anyway still growing still getting that much fatter I'm starting to think I've got no limit now just going to keep in a cycle of endless fatness, again not that I'm minding because let me tell you This.

Grima then turns to Leaf who is the most scared out of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaf, oh Leaf, so young and yet so unlucky. It may have been a noble decision to protect your beloved Red, but that cost you to grow and murder him, along with your beloved hometown of Kanto, you wanted to be a hero, but deep down, you are a murderous villian.\" Hearing all of this causes Leaf to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your wrong...\" Leaf cries out letting her emotions controlling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda, oh Zelda, your supposed to be the symbol of peace, but you let your greed and desire to be the fattest woman corrupt you, if you never chose this path, you wouldn't be in this situation.\" Hearing this causes Zelda to understand the sin she has cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your...right.\" Zelda finally admits wishing she could reset everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally, Lucina, you may have defeated me in a alternate timeline, but that hasn't changed anything, your growth is a sign that you are destined to always suffer. Your family, friends, and loved ones are gone, and there is nothing you can do to stop me.\" Grima says while letting out a maniacal laugh that is so loud, that it makes her whole fat body jiggle in response. Lucina however seemed to show a different look compared to the other girls which makes Grima look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing you worm?\" Grima demands as she sees Lucina look at her...</span></div></div>",

But the rod\u2019s power wasn\u2019t sealed away instead its divinity fueled Malon\u2019s planetary form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunger was an afterthought, as was drinking of any liquids; breathing came easy even if all she saw was more of her spread out far into the distance. Due to her tremendous size and the rod\u2019s power Malon truly was a living planet now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed with Link at long last finding his way out of the ranch girl\u2019s immense blubber while she was so glad to see him again a part of her wondered if Link would in fact try to take back the rod? The young hero did no such thing instead stating how while it seems everyone was readjusting to leaving on the new fat-filled planet. People, countries, nations, were all starting anew due to the fact that they could in fact live just as they had prior to the redhead covering the world with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather strange to think about but Malon found comfort in the fact that at least no one was hurt and while the landscape had changed greatly, she couldn\u2019t actually feel the numerous lives that now lived on her flesh, life was beginning to return to normal\u2026well about as normal as living on a living breathing planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end life was good. Planet Malon was perfectly healthy despite her grand size, her speech and eyesight still as good as it ever was even with all the fat around her head. Link would come by from time to time (having to warp around obviously) at times even bring his childhood BFF Saria with him, the younger-in appearance only-girl putting on a bit more pudge each time she came along. Malon smiled when Saria would state that she liked the idea of her body at long last having some well-deserved curves. She was on her way the redhead thought amusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Zelda and Nabooru, with the Great Fairy\u2019s input Ruto was able to restore the desert woman back to standard size something Nabooru was very grateful for. The Skull Kid assisting Zelda was eventually found and defeated by Link with Saria\u2019s assistance, The Song of Fattening lost forever with his death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda however for her greed and arrogance was sealed away much like the Great Fairies and Ganondorf had been in the past. Speaking of the former Gerudo King it was ironic that Zelda swore she\u2019d break free at some point in the future, find the rod, and claim the destiny that was hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sadden Link to see how hard the mighty had fallen guess the saying that absolute power corrupts completely was true\u2026he just wished that Zelda hadn\u2019t befallen that same path just as Ganondorf had a good deal ago\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case the former Princess was gone and Link after some time doing a bit of soul-searching and completing your average heroic-type dealings was able to move onward with his life thanks to the help from those close to him, most of all Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanet Malon was his home now but more important then that she was also a wonderful friend, even at the size of a planet a beautiful woman, and maybe if he continued to play his cards right a possible lover\u2026of course he prayed that any potential love-making would involve him being \u201con top\u201d because Goddesses help him if Malon \u201ctook priority\u201d!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled at that rather dangerous thought Malon asking what was so amusing he didn\u2019t answer directly instead planted a quick pick on her plumped cheeks, nearly causing the entire world to shake with happiness.</span></div></div>",

As Malon grew within Nabooru's fat, she lost the grip she had on the Rod of Fattening.  The Rod was quickly swallowed by Malon's fat.  Malon shrugged.  She wasn't going to need the Rod anymore, so why worry about it?  Within 5 minutes, Malon emerged from Nabooru's fat, ending up near Nabooru's vast belly button. Malon continued to grow and grow until she reached the size of the other two ladies....and stopped growing. Now there were three countries of fat: Zelda, Nabooru and Malon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n    \"Uh-oh\" said Malon.  \"why did I stop growing?  hmmm...maybe the Rod of Fattening has a limit\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Malon could feel her vast self against both Zelda and Nabooru, but couldn't see either of them.  All that she could see was her own fat going to the horizon.   Malon sighed, sending several ripples of fat through her country-sized self. Zelda, Nabooru and herself now covered three countries...since Malon didn't knew the lands that surrounded Hyrule.  Just how many countries of fat does it take to cover the world.  Malon chuckled at the idea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              [Fat Ones, hear us]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               The voices came from nowhere.

I can feel their emotions they wish to return to their normal weight, it's two against one milady and your desire will be canceled due to their favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\" intrigue Zelda urged him onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why not do this, play along with them for now. Return to your original weight, which was already quite grand, and when they least expect it...take the Triforce pieces from them! Your Sage abilities should make that an relatively easy task, and once you have all three make your grand desire a reality, by becoming a true Goddess of Fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda smiled rather confidentially at the forest creature's brilliant plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know you have my help if need be.\" The Skull Kid laughed in glee as he pointed at himself and his flute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes a fine idea, little one.\" Zelda smirked as she decided to match Malon and Nabooru's wish upon the Triforce of Fat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later Link awoke on the ground, his head slightly pounding away. The young hero remembered snatching The Rod of Fattening while he was buried within Malon's girth he assumed she must have lost her grip on it. Since he didn't hear the voices of the Goddesses he was surprised when Malon's flab began to thin out and he found himself falling downward in a rather unpleasant manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case he first caught sight of Malon who was by his side checking on him for any injuries, he noticed she was back to her usual half ton self. Just as he was going to thank her, ask her what happen, and explain how he had gotten back the magical rod Link spotted Nabooru and Zelda nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach one appeared to be back to their original weight.

Nabooru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Zelda shot a light above to substitute for the blocked sun. True to her word, everyone saw Nabooru's gigantic anus coming closer and closer.

If there was anyone in Hyrule that knew the princess in and out it was the sliver-haired warrior of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda's power if not made for physical domination the way Ganondorf's was. If she releases that much as I said she will pass on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do we stop that gargantuan woman's...ASS from falling on top of us!\" yelled out Malon her face for a moment matching the color of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I may have found a way. If you're willing to cooperate miss...\" Malon blinked in surprised as Impa met her in the eye, \"The same goes for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of her finger Impa brought forth the Skull kid from before tied up in shadow powered chains. Reluctantly the forest spirit nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Zelda slowed down the process needed to gather enough power for her spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impa? What are you?\" \"Stop what you are doing this instant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" shot back Zelda. \"You do realize what will happen if I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...but I ask that you trust me on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh of frustration Zelda cut off her spell and waddled back toward Impa and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind then? We're running out of time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's rather simple actually. With my power I'm going to temporary fuse and the ranch girl together into a sole being\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda and Malon shared a look of shock and horror at the idea of being one and the same regardless Impa continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then this sprite from the forest will enlarge you to the point where you can successfully hold back Nabooru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By enlarge you mean he's going to make them extremely fat?\" asked Link to which Impa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how do I fit into all this? And why a fusion?\" asked Malon with a question of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's to keep Zelda's mentality in check. Without you serving as half of a mind once Zelda relinquishes Nabooru of the Triforce of Fat she will no doubt wish to use it herself. You will serve as her conscious to keep her from doing so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sighed before smirking slightly, Impa really did know her as if she were her own child. Walking forward Impa placed an open hand onto Zelda's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've bestowed upon her a long forgotten spell that should allow you the means to strip Nabooru of her newly gained power. Use it well Zelda, you may very well get a single shot to stop her. Now stand side by side ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctant at first Zelda and Malon ultimately took the steps needed to place next to one another, their flab practically running into each other.</span></div></div>",

Her once slim belly formed into several rolls of fat which had burst open her trousers and her boobs had grown and sat happily on her paunch. Lifting her ripped shirt to see her belly, Saria suddenly realised that the Poe Ghost was watching her curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you happy so far, dear?\" the Ghost asked Saria as she lowered her shirt and climbed from her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Saria, \"but I'm still not big enough. I need to be much, much larger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" replied the Ghost. \"I've prepared those new clothes for you. They are on the table in the washroom. As soon as you're ready come down to the dining room for some feeding.\" With that, the Ghost left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria pulled on her new clothes and then studied herself in the mirror. Her boobs had grown noticebly larger and sat atop her belly nicely. Her belly stuck out from her waist, which had also widened and her butt was bigger as well. Her face was also fatter, more filled out and a double chin covered the top part of her thick neck. Sighing happily, Saria walked down to the dining room where she found the Ghost waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" she Ghost exclaimed happily. \"Take a seat my dear. I've increased the size of your meals today. You'll eat six meals a day from now on: breakfast, brunch, lunch, pre-dinner, dinner and supper. Between meals you'll also have a two hour nap and be given as many whole cakes as you can eat. You're appetite will have increased enomously, and if you get bored just lie in bed for a bit, or eat of course!\" The Ghost waved a hand and several other ghosts entered the room carrying large platters of food which were promptly laided on the table before Saria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria began eating like she was possessed, piling the food into her mouth with her knife and fork. When she saw that this method was too slow, she discarded her cutlery and began shovelling the food in with her hands. By the end of the meal she was stuffed and her belly had swollen to twice the size it had been that morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done dear,\" the Ghost spoke happily. \"With an appetite like that you will surpass my daughter in no time!\" Saria grinned contentedly. She had chocolate sauce around her mouth and on her cheeks, and crumbs and bits of food littered her clothes. Lumbering to her feet, she walked back to her room which was, thankfully, just down the corridor. Collapsing on her bed, she had barely sat down when the Ghost entered carrying a large chocolate cake covered with all kinds of delights. Placing it on Saria's large thighs, she smiled and left the room. Saria began plunging the food into her mouth, barely chewing it before swallowing. When she had finished, she called for more. Two cakes later, Saria fell backwards onto the bed and fell instantly asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day progressed in much the same manner. Saria finished any food given her, ate prodigious amounts of cakes between meals and then collapsed on her bed and fell asleep. By the end of the day, Saria was tired but ravenously hungry for more of the Ghost's delicious food. By the end of the day Saria's new shirt had burst open from the size of her stomach and the seams along her trousers had ripped open, revealing her thunder thighs. Falling asleep, she woke up in the middle of the night with her huge  stomach rumbling loudly. She felt ravenous and decided to...</span></div></div>",

Walking through the door leading to the kitchens, she was amazed to see, stacked their almost expectantly, a huge pile of cakes, cookies and sweets. Delighted, she plunged in and began eating through the huge pile of food. As she ate her pants (which were already ripped down the sides) burst open, sending her ever-growing belly sprawling out. Her bra snapped and her boobs hung out over her belly for all to see.

However, when she tried to sit up, she found that she just couldn't. She strained and heaved but finally gave up trying. Suddenly, the Ghost was looking over her with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great news my dear! My daughter peaked at just over 1000 pounds. You, however, have just gotten over 1200 pounds!\" Saria smiled happily, pressing her massive chin down on her throat and chest. She was slowly raised up and saw that she was in a room she hadn't seen before. She was sat on a humongous bed and as she looked at herself she saw how fat she'd become. Her arms flowed with fat that hung down till it almost touched the bed. Her belly was spread out so much it nearly touched the edges of the bed, and her boobs had become sagging and bloated with fat. Her fingers were like sausages and she found that she couldn't bend them at all. Her legs were spread eagled by the weight of her belly that was forcing them apart and sagging between them. She could feel her insanely huge triple chin hanging over her chest and crushing her windpipe. She couldn't move at all. She was completely immobile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lay there she saw several ghosts place large trays of food beside her. The Ghost mother looked at her and Saria merely nodded (talking was too difficult). At that nod the food on the trays began immediately flying into Saria's open mouth. Saria felt a rush of erotic pleasure as she saw her gut begin expanding. It began spreading like a puddle towards the edges of the bed, also getting higher and higher as it grew. Her thighs were the same, getting wider and wider. Soon, Saria couldn't even keep her arms in position and they collapsed at her side. Her boobs began to inch towards her waistline, and her triple-chin became a quadruple-chin as it grew enough to cover her entire upper body. Saria suddenly felt a wave of pleasure as she felt the edges of her belly reach the floor, and within a few minutes the entire floor was covered by her fat, with her belly reaching halfway to the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the ancient temple, Link was searching desperately for Saria. The villagers had told him that she had gone to the temple before she disappeared. Suddenly and without warning a ghost appeared before Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know where your friend is dear. She wishes to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink followed the ghost to a hidden door that led into a secret corridor. The ghost led Link into a large room where he saw, to his surprise, Saria! But had she changed! Link felt as if his greatest wish had come true (which it had) and felt his penis go hard, forming a noticeable lump in his pants. He removed his shoes and weapons and leapt into Saria's fat, massaging it and rolling it, kissing it and finally leaping atop Saria and shoving his rock-hard penis into Saria's vagina. Both were lost in a sea of ecstasy, and when Link left he vowed to return to see Saria once a fortnight (since she couldn't move). And he did, and Saria was content and grew ever bigger. </span></div></div>",

It took her a few seconds to remember why she was there, but once it all came back to her she felt somewhat relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to see how her gain had turned out she rolled out of bed as best as she could and looked to a nearby mirror.  After dusting the mirror off she got a good view of herself and was thoroughly pleased with what she saw.  That last meal had managed to up her weight by at least three hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\"  Saria swayed back and forth causing her new fat to jiggle.  Her clothes had been torn asunder at the belly, causing the pale jiggly mass to hang out.  She prodded and rubbed it satisfiedly before her eyes went up to her chest, which was straining against the tatters of her top.  She quickly turned around to get a look at her rear and thighs and grinned when she saw it jiggle.  She was getting some of those curves she wanted, but she was still far from being as curvy as the Poe's daughter.  Still...  Four-hundred pounds at her height was nothing to sneeze at.  Saria looked in the mirror, imagining Link at her side with his arms sinking into her flab, with him occaisonally popping a chocolate or three into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?  Are you awake?\"  The voice of the Poe broke her out of her daydream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes I am.\" Saria replied, a bit disappointed.

In the meantime, Saria played with her blubber, watching ripples of fat everytime she pinched herself or simply patted her belly.   She also felt much stronger now in her magic.  Saria's magic had easily tripled when she had gained so much weight.  She couldn't see the Kokiri village from where she was, because the trees were so tall and very thick.  Her two breasts were easily the size of a small house.   Her green clothes showed no signs of strain.  She sat back on the ruins of the Forest Temple and eagely waited Link's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               -------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 Link rode on Epona in  Hyrule Field.  He had left Kakariko and was headed toward the forest, where Saria was waiting.  Since peace had returned to Hyrule, Link easily got bored.  Although, peace was highly sought after, it was dull for a former hero.  Nowadays, Link helped with small jobs for money.   It was a honest living, and Link liked it.  What's a hero to do after he was longer needed?  Due to the lack of fighting monsters and running around from temple to temple, Link had gotten a little pudgy; although, it was hardly noticeable.   It would be early evening when Link finally entered Kokiri Forest.  <br>\r\n           The Kokiri children were milling about, doing whatever they did in the evenings.  Mido, the head honcho, was bossing two other Kokiri.  Link had to smile at that;  he had never told Mido that he had been the little kid without a fairy all those years ago.  Link walked into the Lost Woods and made his way to the Sacred Forest Meadow.  He saw a couple of Skull Kids along the way.   He continued to walk until he walked into a green yielding wall.  <br>\r\n            The green wall blocked the path toward the Sacred Meadow.  Link touched the green wall, realizing that the wall was made out of cloth.  As he pushed his hand against it, his arm sunk into the yielding wall.  Link yelped and pulled his arm out of the wall. <br>\r\n             \"What's this?\" asked Link.  \"is this why Saria called me here?\"<br>\r\n              With nothing to do, Link decided to scale the green wall.  The green wall was easily 40 feet tall...Link used the Longshot to make the climb a little easier.   When he climbed atop of the \"wall\", Link realized that the wall was breathing...not only that, but he thought he heard some girlish giggling.  He then noticed something that made him gasp.  He realized that he didn't climb a wall after all...he had climbed Saria's massive stomach! </span></div></div>",

Yes at first she was confused by the fact that even after downing an entire lake and in turn growing to the size of a mountain how she could still be hungry but now instead Saria had come to embrace her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps her stomach was working off her desire to be more then just a \"child\" now she had the power to become something much more and she was going to use it for all it's worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMount Saria? No that wasn't enough perhaps Hyrule would be better off renamed as \"Saria\"? But what if she wanted her empire of blubber to expand further? Planet Saria didn't seem to bad either...but she decided to put that amusing thought aside and concentrate on the here and now. Namely Zelda's demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" Saria started off with, \"but it's like I said. I love being big, massive, larger then life and I only wish to become even bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a minor flick of her fatty finger Saria levitated a portion of the grass-tipped land clear off the ground and straight toward and into her open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was shocked at the showcase of power. Was Saria really powerful enough now to forcefully rip the land apart? Zelda cringed as she heard more of the land around her take to the air and fly toward Saria's open maw and with each patch of greenery Saria grew larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively Zelda ducked as the iron made fence that lead to Lake Hylia was ripped from the ground and floated over toward Saria. Apparently the girl was having her daily dosage of iron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case this was certainly getting out of hand and Zelda knew she had to find a way to stop the eating rampage before it could get any worse. But before she could do that Zelda dodged yet again as more land was devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen to her horror Zelda began to notice that Saria seem to be regaining feeling in her beyond massive self. Could she stand? If she did she could eat Hyrule for lunch...or perhaps even worse as a snack! thought the princess racking her brain with thoughts of what was to come.</span></div></div>",

It seemed that Saria had regained her mobility as she got up to her feet...which had grown thick in fat too, otherwise the mountain of a girl wouldn't have been able too stand up, much less move.  Saria looked to the lake and smiled, and started to drink the lake dry again.  Zelda was running as fast as she could to avoid being swallowed up by Saria's blubber.   Saria swelled even bigger with every gulp of water she took,  Soon, she was far more bigger than Death Mountain itself and still she grew.   Zelda managed to get away, and try to think of something to do with the growing problem.  Meanwhile, Saria had finished up the lake again.  Now she took up the entire area of Lake Hylia.  Her blubber almost reached Lon Lon Ranch and was partially in Gerudo Valley.  Still, Saria wasn't yet big enough.  With the lake drained again, Saria caught her sight on Lon Lon Ranch and licked her massive lips and started to walk towards it, making the ground shake under her great weight.  <br>\r\n                           <br>\r\n                              Malon was out in the ranch and feeding the horses when she noticed a shadow come over the entire ranch complex.

It was plain to see that Saria had spotted Link and the two women.  Saria was probably a good mile away from the village, but her shadow engulfed the town in darkness.  The ground started to shake as Saria made a step.  While she was just outside of the village, Saria leaned far forward in order to see Link and the others better.  This shifting resulted in Saria's bulk landing on top of the village, squishing everything under her girth.   Saria's fattened face ended up a few inches away from Link and the others.  Sohahn had vanished from sight some 40  seconds earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \"Well, what do we have here?\" asked Saria.  \"you three are all here.

The two girls must've landed somewhere else in the vast stomach of Saria.   The sights looked much like Lord Jabu-Jabu's innards as well.  The light came from Link's latern which he happened to have.  The 'floor' was slick with moisture and was very slippery to walk on.  There were pits spotted here and there...pits of stomach acid, Link soon found out.  The pits all varied in size.  <br>\r\n                   \"Zelda!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Raising and extending an arm outward Zelda's eyes came to a close as she began to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes I can see a haunting presence within the walls of the temple.\" stated Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least we know for sure that ghost in there now!\" exclaimed Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Link gasped as he watched Malon pull out a pitchfork from seemingly out of nowhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Link pointed cautiously at the farming object in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is for protection. Remember that green-clad mountain of blubber ate my home but luckily I was still able to find this among the wreckage.\" Malon explained with a bit of a cheery grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink with a single raised eyebrow made a mental note to never get on the redhead's bad side. Edging over Zelda leaned in slightly in Link's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She certainly is quite a fire-cracker isn't she?\" stated Zelda with a bit of a dry giggle to which Link only nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case we should get going. The longer we spend in here the more time Saria has to devour more Hyrule.\" Zelda nodded to Link's words and soon the three were off toward the temple...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of magical tinkering Zelda was able to pick the magical seal to the temple doors. With Saria gone and focusing solely on her seemingly endless gluttony the Poe Sister was able to spread her influence over the temple sealing it away from any trespassers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for the heroic trio Zelda's power outclassed practically everyone in Hyrule outside of the sealed away tyrant Ganondorf and the now immense Saria so the power of a Poe's magic was nothing to the royal princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking in Link signaled for the ladies to stay behind him. The temple was quiet...too quiet, Link had truthfully expected some sort of resistance especially if Amber had picked up on Zelda undoing the door seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda as well had something on her mind, if Saria had overtaken the temple with her growing girth then how was it able to be reconstructed so easily much less perfectly...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something isn't right here, Link...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Link could respond an eerie crackle resounded through the hollow halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteadying his blade, Link watched for any sign of life as Zelda and Malon covered his rear and sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems today is a day full of guests. First the cute little sage and now you three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber show yourself! We know you're the one who made Saria into the terror she is now!\" growled Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You speak of her as if she is a monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Currently she sure as hell is. Wrecking people's lives and devouring the land like a snack!\" piped in Malon with a look of anger that mirrored Link's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me spirit, is this truly the temple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's question actually surprised all for moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you princess are the only rational one in the group. As for this place, it is my area of dominance. Changeling a portion of wondrous Saria's new found power this space is mine to command as I see fit. In fact \"It\" should be taking hold right about now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shock both Malon and Zelda gasped in union. The two ladies clutching their stomachs before being pulled below by a pair of floor-masters. The hands striking before either woman could react and Link soon found himself alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do with them?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are now each locked away somewhere in the temple or should I say my temple. If I were you Hero of Time I'd concern myself with finding them both before coming after me after all if you take too long in rescuing either woman well...I'll let you see for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink cursed under his breath as the voice of Amber faded away. Time was short now and he had to find both Zelda and Malon before whatever surprise the Poe had in store for them could occur.</span></div></div>",

There were slight changes to it however...like the addition of pits of stomach acid dotted around the place.  Link spent 15 minutes looking for Malon and Zelda with no luck.   There were the same monsters in the temple as before; some of them had slipped into pits of stomach acid, leaving their skeletons behind.  Link then came to a room with four locked doors within it.  In front of each door were small chests.  There was a note on each door.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   1) The Way to Zelda lies behind me, while my neighbor leads elsewhere<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   2)  If you take my advice, the fourth leads to death <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n                  3) Number 2 and Number 4 are the same <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  4)  Malon isn't here <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              <br>\r\n             Shrugging, Link opened the chest that was in front of Door 1....only to find a key within it with a \"3\" on it.  Link tried to open the other three chests, but he had no luck.  Sighing, Link opened Door 3.  The door led to a long and twisted hallway,which led to a wide-open room.  Link went down the twisted hallway and entered the room at the end of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  The room was a big circle with a pit in it.  Hanging over the pit on a rope was Malon.  Malon was alive and well....and utterly still.  Link approached the pit with caution.  When he got within two feet of the pit, a skeleton popped out from the pit and started to attack Link.  Link quickly dispatched the skeleton.   With the skeleton defeated, the pit of stomach acid vanished and Malon was released from the rope.  Malon and Link rushed to each other and hugged.....and the pair returned to the room with 4 doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"Do you know where Zelda is?\" asked Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"No\" said Malon.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                Since the key to Door 3 was in the chest in front of the 1st door, Link went to the chest in front of the 3rd door and opened it.  </span></div></div>",

Although Malon found it odd how the note left on the door had blatantly told them where to go but before she think any more about the strange clue Link piped in with a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I didn't have a chance to ask you but are you okay, Malon? I mean you and Zelda killed over in pain before those wall-masters grabbed you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that...yeah I'm fine at the time though it felt like my entire body had gone numb starting from stomach and spreading outward...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A paralysis then? Yeah I guess that would be the best way for the Poe to take Zelda hostage considering their power difference and you were a bonus as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Malon grunted in anger, \"Now I'm really going to tear that ghost apart once we find it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink smiled slightly it was nice to see that despite the ordeal Malon was still full of vigor. Pushing forward for a few more minutes the hallway the two were currently in came to an end as they approached a pair of double doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink steadied himself while Malon took his side, her old pitchfork gone but was lucky enough to pick up the spear from the fallen skeleton Link had battle with prior to her rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the room slowly the pair noticed Zelda out as a light and chained to stone wall on the opposite end of the large chamber but she wasn't alone! Four Stalfos stood in front of the princess guarding her...and perhaps wanting to kill her upon Amber's request...regardless the bony warriors turn to face the trespassers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monsters then growled in rage before rushing at Link and Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she wasn't as skilled as Link was Malon was at least able to content with a single skeleton while Link took care of the other three. Together the duo finished off the final monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow turning their attention over to Zelda the two of them paused as they watched the chains wrapped around her bust free allowing the princess to crumble to the ground seemingly and luckily unhurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing over to help Zelda up that particular feeling that Malon had experienced before about the clue on the door being too helpful came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad it been too easy? Too obvious? Just as she was going to comment about the bothersome feeling Link had already reached Zelda and slowly assisted her up to her feet.</span></div></div>",

It was a huge Like-Like dressed as the princess!  Link had come across several Like-Likes in his adventures, but none so big as this one.  It was a head taller than Link and Malon, and the clothes it had been wearing were absorbed by the Like-Like.    Link swung at it with his sword, and the Like-Like was easily killed in three or four hits.  It left behind Zelda's clothes.  The thought about Zelda being naked made Link's nose bleed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"I knew it was too easy\" said Malon.  \"hey, your nose is bleeding, Link\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                  \"Erm....let's look elsewhere\" said Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               So, Malon and Link returned to the room with the two remaining doors in it.  Doors 2 and 4 were the same it sounded like..and it sounded by the notes that the doors led to death.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                Malon went over and opened the chest in front of Door 4, and found the key to Door 2 within it.  She showed Link the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"Might as well try it\" said Link.  He look the key from Malon and opened Door 2, which led right into a pit of stomach acid.  In the middle of the pit was a small island.  On the island were two Stalfos and two wolfos, protecting a cage that was hanging by a chain attached to the ceiling.  The cage was too high to see in it, but Zelda's voice came from the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   \"Link?!  Is that you?\" came the voice of Zelda.<br>\r\n          <br>\r\n                   The way to the island was a very thin bridge that would allow only one person on it.   The island itself wasn't very big at all;  just big enough for 4 monsters to stand upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"Oh boy\" said Link.  \"this should be fun\" </span></div></div>",

She had eaten about 20 Zora and the bean seller.  Ruto was able to escape from becoming Saria's snack by teleporting elsewhere.  Saria hadn't noticed this and kept right on eating.  Saria could feel the faint struggles within her immense tummy.  Link had eventually made it out from Saria's flab and looked at what the ranch-girl was doing.  Link had exited from the flab near her ear, which towered over him.  Link shouted;  \"Saria, you must stop this!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               This made Saria stop eating and looked over at Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"Why should I stop?\" asked Saria.  \"I like being large.

Now the green-wearing titaness was nearly the half the size of Hyrule and worse yet she was hungry for more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda wasn't sure what had caused this insanity and unfortunately Saria wasn't to willing to hear her out, much less provide any sort of answers to any question the princess may have due to the inhuman gluttony Saria was currently experiencing...and where in blazes was Link during all this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sighed in frustration she certainly hadn't send him off in any sort of adventure hell Impa had seen him earlier in the day so where was that man when she actually needed him?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer anger subsided however when she felt the ground tremble beneath her nearly knocking her unsuspecting self to the grassy field below. It was easy to see that Saria was on the move again and her next target was a defenseless farm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa had her hands filled with taking care of her own and Link was strangely MIA so Zelda was left with only one course of action...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving fallen on her rear due to a quaking footfall Malon clearly panic-stricken began to crawl in reverse desperately trying to make as far a space as she could between her and the green clad beast that had descended upon her helpless home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Malon had seen and experienced a few terrors during Ganondorf's dark reign but nothing could prepare her for this her ranch home was actually being ripped apart and devoured by a monster of massive proportions. The surrounding fence, buildings, the poor animals! She was thankful Epona was out somewhere else practically wishing she had joined the lucky horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead yelled out in pure terror as the sky-eclipsing hand began to lower in her general area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no...please no!\" she whimpered skin nearly as white as a her familiar dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairy boy where are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her teary eyes she felt her end all but a certainly as the area grew darker and the mammoth hand at last made contact with the ground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes shut Malon instinctively yelled out as she felt her body be whisked away her overwhelming fear telling her it was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open your eyes, Malon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice...no it couldn't be she should be dead. Yet something told her otherwise. That voice it was familiar in fact it sounded just like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon gasped as she looked over her rescuer and it wasn't exactly who she first expected! If she had to be rescued she had hoped and expected Link but the voice she heard earlier matched that of Princess Zelda's but this wasn't Zelda or rather wasn't how she normally came to expect the royal woman to look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back deep in her memories she had seen \"this\" Zelda before. The blue skin-tight suit the Sheikah symbol on the white clothing material across her chest the long braided ponytail was new and seem to replace the mask she had previously worn. However in her mind there was no doubt about it even if they hadn't spoken a word to one another back then Zelda was that mysterious stranger that had come to her aid once when Ingo came home a little too tipsy and far too eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Zelda asked as she stood directly in front of the downed farm girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah.\" Malon muttered softly yet loud enough for Zelda to at least hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was happening so fast for the poor girl to keep up with. First that monster, then the destruction of her home, and now Zelda reveals herself to be that silent protector from long ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe coughed however after staring a bit too long at the back of the battle-ready princess. She knew Zelda was beautifully shaped but her current attire really showed off her defined curves and surprising muscles. Malon thanked the three goddesses that Zelda was unable to spot her rather visible blush. Afterwards she took in a breath in hopes of cooling down her emotions...and strangely that feeling she usually got whenever Link was around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in Hyrule's name just happened?\" she asked, at the moment just wanting to put everything behind her and start anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're safe for now but I'm afraid your home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know...still thank you...Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stared on over in her direction flashing a brief understanding smile Malon almost felt her blush reappear at the princess' soft expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um where are we?\" the farm girl asked again attempting to shift things away from her emotional reactions.</span></div></div>",

What was up with her today and why was the princess of all people making her act this way, usually it was only around Link her fairy boy when she acted...hold on where was Link anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you could have told me and not kept this from me all this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Malon wasn't going to get a chance to ask seeing as the two of them were suddenly interrupted by Princess Ruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda replied with a quick apology stating that why should she have said a thing when she believed her \"Sheik\" days to be completely over with Ganondorf's defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you have a point but seeing as you are back in costume I take it you know of that green behemoth that's ravishing the countryside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\" Zelda going on to explain how it was their fellow sage Saria and how she believed that the once petite girl was being controlled in some fashion.

Funny you'd think he'd be jumping at the chance to help his oldest friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stood quiet for a moment unlike Ruto Malon was able to spot the rather clinched fist of the princess however she was smart enough to know not to comment on on her observation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where he is.\" the princess spat out a mixture of anger and frustration clear in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ruto at times was rather nosy she like Malon knew when it came to leave enough alone.

When Saria hugged Link to her fattened body, the Hero had sunk into her fat so fast that Saria lost her grip on him.  Saria could feel Link's every movement within her fat, and it made her giggle.  She then decided to have some fun with her fat while Link was buried in it.  She flexed her vast belly, letting it wave like the ocean.  Link's movements increased, tickling her.   She felt Link try to swim his way out of her fat, but her flexing belly prevented him.  Saria stopped flexing her belly, and pushed her house-sized breasts downwards, hoping to entomb Link entirely into her belly.    She felt Link going down in her fat, heading towards her belly.   <br>\r\n              \"Link...I didn't mean to bury you in my fat\" said Saria.  \"but I think this is gonna work\"  <br>\r\n               <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n            Link was trying hard not to suffocate and trying to pull his Zora tunic on.

He was slowly being pushed off of Saria's massive chest, and onto her belly.   Surrounded by Saria's flab, Link was warm and comfortable.  He didn't know how Saria had done this to herself, but he liked it.    He finally managed to get his Zora cap on his head, finally able to breathe in the flab of his long-time friend.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Simply playing her favorite tune within her mind was enough to send the signal outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink meanwhile was stretched out and relaxing by Lake Hylia's shore when he heard Saria's voice inside his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Link? Can you hear me?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Oh hey Sar! What's up?] said Link, tossing in his makeshift nickname for his eternal friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Oh...nothing much...] she lied with a short giggle, if there was anything that was \"up\" it was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Okay...say Saria, listen I'm sorry I haven't been around recently.

Saria had teleported herself to Lake Hylia, intending to appear in the lake itself and not above it.  When she had materialised to her destination, Saria knew something went wrong the instant she appeared.  First of all, she had materialised in mid-air...and she had landed right on top of Link!  At first, she didn't knew that she had landed right on top of the hero.  She just looked around wildly for any sign of Link, but there was no sign of the Hero of Time.  That's when Saria felt a slight twitching under her vast belly.  It tickled her, causing her to giggle....and then, she realized that she must've landed right on top of Link!  The twitching meant that Link was still alive, and not squashed under her amazing weight. Her fat might've saved his life;  if something had landed on Link that was solid and hard, he would be squished.  But, because of the softness of Saria's fat, Link was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Link had no time to react, no time to do anything really but stare at the massive bulk that was Saria.  Saria had landed right on top of him, causing the ground to shake all around the \"impact\" point.  It was sheer luck that Link had been wearing his Zora Tunic.  Link had gone to Lake Hylia to fish, which was quickly becoming his new hobby since evil no longer lived in  Hyrule.  He had gotten into a splashing fight with a Zora earlier, as a matter of fact.  The fight was about who had caught a sizable fish.  Clearly, it had been the Zora that had snatched the fish away from Link's fishing rod and had pulled Link right into the lake!  The two argued about whose fish it was.  The Zora had won the fight by splashing water into Link's face, which blinded him for a minute or two--long enough to get away with the fish.  <br>\r\n                Link found himself in an expanse of fat and darkness.  He was still wearing the Zora Tunic, so he could still breathe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Link could tell that Saria was on the move but that's all.  Next thing that Link heard was Saria eat even more.   She was still eatting!

Saria tries to shake her head out of the poe's grip, shouting small angry noises.<br>\r\nThen suddently, swift as a lighting the Poe forces the spoon into her mouth. Saria could feel the tunnel getting tighter around her. The Poe repeats the process, and Saria is forced another spoon. Again her body expands, and demands more space. Again the Poe proceeds with stuffing her with another spoon of weight gain liquid. When was she going to stop this? Saria thought to herself. She can only be fattened up so much, before the entrance would be to small. As Saria becomes fatter she notices that it is getting harder for her to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria starts to wonder how much she has gained, but it is hard for her to find out, seing as most of her body is still inside the cave. Looking down, she can see some results. Her breasts are huge! The elastiks is strained to the limit. She touches them with her free hands and is only more stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looks at the Poe again. With an evil look in the eyes the Poe grabs the vial and stuffs it into Saria's mouth. All the remaining liquid flows down her throat. Saria freaks out and struggles as mutch as she can to stop it, but it is useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the liquid flows down into her stomach...</span></div></div>",

She had to face her own problems by herself. Taking a deep breath to prepare herself, Saria then went to exit the room and begin her search for whatever that specter was that knocked her out cold. When she opened the door leading back out to the rest of the Forest Temple though, Saria was instead met with something that no longer resembled the dungeon she was originally exploring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the decaying paint chipping off the walls and the ratty, musty stench that filled it before, the Forest Temple had suddenly been revitalized into what felt like a luxurious mansion! The walls were now painted in such a way that they looked like they were made out of solid gold! But Saria was quickly enraptured by the new scent of five-star cooking, like what a professional chef would cook up. Still unsure if she was imagining things, Saria followed the smell back up the elevator to the main hall, where she was met with even more questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the basement, the main hall was refurbished with a brand new coat of paint similar to the last one. What was different though was the tables set up all over the room, every one of them decorated with many different professionally cooked foods. From main courses to desserts for presumably afterwards, the entire room was packed with foods that looked like they were made of raw calories! Saria stood there motionless for awhile before attempting to call out to whoever it was who could have set this up, but no one ever responded no matter how long she waited...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, Saria decided to investigate on her own since she wouldn't figure anything out by just standing there. Everything looked absolutely delicious, so she decided to check out the tables themselves. Immediately after approaching the first table, Saria found a note simply sitting there, folded neatly. Upon unfolding it, Saria read the note to herself, hoping it would give at least some insight as to what all this was, 'Dear Saria, Please do enjoy this feast I have prepared for you. It is all for you, so do not hesitate eating everything you want~' It did say <i>why</i> the feast was here... but it only added even more questions about the who, when, why, and how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Saria was standing there confused, she suddenly heard something behind her shift. Turning around, she saw a chair that wasn't there before. Shocked, Saria fell backwards into the chair, unable to stop herself. With a sigh, Saria shook her head and attempted to get back up, but noticed that she couldn't as the chair was magically holding her down! Struggling to get out of there, Saria believed that not only did something cause the whole temple to change, but that same force was actively trying to keep her from leaving! As she continued to try and break free of the magical binding, food from the table in-front of Saria also started to move on its own...</span></div></div>",

I've known him for a far longer time period than any of them, he's my best friend for Goddesses sake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning a hand through her forest green locks of hair, Saria began to question some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We used to do stuff all the time, now I rarely see Link anymore.

I know what it is. I'm just a \"kid\" and the others already have \"curvier\" bodies than me. That must be it if I had a better figure Link would hang out with me just like the old times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria smiled happily as she jumped off her bed. \"But the question is where will I find an object that can grant my desire?

Like you can force me to eat that junk!\u201d Remembering directly afterwards yet still too late that \u2018Yes, whatever it was COULD make her gorge herself silly\u2019, she felt a large poke in her stomach.

It was addictive. REALLY addictive.

Her new NNN breasts almost fell over the front of her huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, stop!\" Saria exclaimed. \"You're going to fatten me up until I won't be able to move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" Link exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria begun to sit up, but found that she couldn't lift her impressive girth. But, with a tremendous flash, the jewel lost all magical power, turning into a dull, green, golden laced necklace. The expansion had stopped, leaving Saria a 2100 pound blob. Each of her massive mammies weighed 100 pounds each, with a nipple the size of Link's fist on each. Link placed a hand under Saria's left breast, and lifted it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, you've got some <i>weight</i> on you now, Saria!\" Link exclaimed. \"But... your clothes kind of exploded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your fault, you perv! You fattened me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\" Link placed a hand on Saria's fat lips. \"I'll be back with some bigger clothes, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Link turned on a heel and began to walk off to Hyrule Castle Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, a choice lies with you...</span></div></div>",

A feast already prepared! One of her servants walked up and smiled, gesturing for her to sit down at a chair. The princess gladly obliged, sitting her slightly larger body down on the chair. Her first tray was a delicious, grease soaked fish, covered in oils and fattening additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ruto finished with this meal, her stomach was stretched to breaking point. Her breathing was laboured, but she began to feel better about it. Her stomach made her feel attractive, and she knew that she would soon be far more attractive with the added weight.

Her dress, made of silk and gold, made her all the more so. Carved rupees lined the dress, and she carried a bunch of fresh water lilies. Link smiled. FOr a moment, he woindered why he ever said no to her before. Aftert all, even though she was very fat... she was still pretty cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceremony went off without a hitch.

The Zoras were also exploring the massive insides of their queen.  <br>\r\n       \"Nothing can stop Ruto\" said Zelda.  \"I tried to use my magic on her, but they wouldn't work\"<br>\r\n       \"Bounced off her blubber?\" asked Link.<br>\r\n       \"Yeah\" said Zelda.  \"-now, how do we get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...I don't think we're ever going to get out\" said Malon.  \"we'll have to accept that the belly of Ruto is our new home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess the castle can be rebuilt in here...\" said Zelda, sighing. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the most part Ruto and Link made a surprisingly good pair when it came to ruling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto showed to be a tough no nonsense ruler. More then a few dignitiaries were surprised that despite her rather massive girth she had not fallen into such classic traps as Sloth and Gluttony and indeed was a fierce politcian and negotiator. She played hard and fast, could be quite ruthless if she felt someone was taking advantage of her people. Her husband would undoubtly confess (though not to loudly or to close his wife) that this was a carry over from when she was young. Some habits just don't die one could suppose<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever her husband Link proved to be the more level headed and patient type. Indeed one could not help but wonder if his years of adventure had taught him to think before he acted (not to say Ruto didn't think. She merely had something of a fiery temper and could at times be rash to act. Indeed her near rage at Link after she first ate him is a testament to this) Link indeed prefered to think on a solution as opposed to simply acting. Gather all the information one could before making an action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether the Zora kingdom prospered. Not only through the age old legend of the larger the queen the more prosperous lake hylia would be. They also ruled their country fair and justly and indeed even after only on year many a Zora was calling them the finest rulers to have ever sat on the Throne. They opened many avenues of trade with other cities and had indeed become penned a very prominent trade agreement with the Kingdom of Hyrule. On top of that thanks the friendship of Link and Darunia (whom still gleefully refered to Link as his Brother) the Zora and the Goron for the first time in the history of Hyrule penned a trade agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo needless to say Link and Ruto had been busy the last year. After all they weren't just rulling a prospering kingdom. Ruto was still eating and growing large. Link would spend a good deal of time adventuring deep in the belly of his wife (after all occasionally parasites would sneek in. Would do no good for the queen to get seriously ill. Though that was far from Links only reason. Indeed he rather enjoyed his adventures in his wife. Who was more then happy to have her husband running around in her belly.) There were also certain *ahem* marital matters that the two engaged in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the more popular topics in some societies (polite and otherwise) was the topic of when these two would produce an heir. Some even questioned if they could produce an heir. If they did would the heir be a Zora or a hylian? The Zora's claimed and indeed cited precedence that Zora and Hylians could mate and produce heirs (even referencing a few occasions it had happened in history. Though such coupling was very very rare.)  For the Zora's part they were certain that their King and Queen would produce an heir. It has even become a popular topic of converstaion and in some sectors bets were being taken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch bets included the Gender of the child, whether the child would appear more Zora or Hylian, would the child take after its father and go on adventueres, another popular one was to bet on whether or not the Queen was already pregnant. Given her prodigious girth many joked that she might be ready to pop at any moment so to speak. So another popular betting circle was how far along the Queen was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Ruto was pregnant they were both keeping it very tight lipped. Though rumor has it both have joined in on the bets themselves though no one can confirm this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo needless to say all is good within the realm of the Zora's. All is good within the marriage of Link and Ruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo lets begin our new tale shall we.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthors Note: I do wish to apologize. This backstory was meant to be very brief and quick before jumping into a more main streamed part of the story. However I confess that it sort of ran away from me and I ended up establishing a lot more continuity (for lack of a better word) then I wanted to. Haha so if you don't want to go with this story line by all means ignore it there will be two options down below. The first one I would want to continue to follow this sort of continuty I established and have it not end up with Ruto or someone else ultimately eating the universe. While she has gotten rather gigcantic I don't intend to have her get MUCH bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option will be to just go nuts. Have fun</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ruto sighed and sort of sunk into herself as she floated on the waters. She was currently floating in a special part of her side cave that had access to the sun. At present she and her husband were sunning. Her husband was currently lying on her massive stomach he declared it the second best place to get some sun. The other place she would pause to giggle here were her rather large breasts. Though Link felt that it was a touch to early in the day to get a little adventurous with his wife. After all they could still have visitors (though thankfully their personal attendants would announce any of the more esteemed visitors. The attendants had learned to ignore their king and queens more... adventurous times. Though the two of them have tried to be more patient... with mixed results) so Link was more then content to sun on her belly were it was more appropriate as it were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink glanced up at his wife's face and smirked at her. Ruto glanced down at her husband curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: What's with the smirk? Heh you were the one that was preaching patience. Don't tell me you are already losing the will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and smirked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Nah I was just thinking of putting another bet in. You know to muddy the waters as it were. Which led me to thinking of one of the more popular bets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto gives link a quizzical look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Oh now this I have to hear. So how far along do they think I am now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: More then nine months along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto covered her mouth in a vein attempt to burst out into laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Ahhh yeah I'll have to send one of my representatives down to throw in on that. That'll raise our pay out in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink chuckled and relaxed back into her belly folds. Before pausing and looking up at the sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: I forget where we having the representatives from Koholint Island? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto sighed and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: They say you are the level headed one amongst us. You can't remember a thing without it being written down. They are supposed to show up at the end of the month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink chuckles and rubs the back of his head sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: It's going to be a fancy dinner right? Ugh those can be so boring. Well maybe I'll get lucky and you will accidentally eat one of the dignitaries and I'll have to go in to \"rescue him\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: I swear you'll never let me live that down. Honestly you eat one diplomat and BAM suddenly it's just common occurrence. You are never going to let me live that down are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Just once? I distinctly remember you eating me when I came down here just before we got married. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto's cheeks reddened here and she looked away rather bashful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: ... okay sooo maybe I am a little excited when food is presented to me... I rather enjoy my meals is all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink chuckles and begins making his way up his wife's belly. Until he reaches up to her face kissing her lightly. Ruto looks at him and slowly a smirk begins to spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: You are a weak man. Heheheh <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: You aren't any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leans into give his wife a more passionate kiss when the slight clearing of the throat nets their attention. The two glance over to see their head advisor Ralis standing there giving them both disapproving looks. Link quickly hops down off his wife dusting himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalis: I am not interrupting anything am I? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says as he raises his eye brow ever so slightly. Link and Ruto exchange bashful looks before looking back at Ralis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Of course not. We are always ready for important business. So Ralis what's happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalis: Yes the princess Zelda has arrived for a visit. She said and I quote \"Ruto, Link it has been AGES since we've last seen each other. So I decided to pop in for a surprise visit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Oh wonderful we were just wondering how she was doing. Oh I wonder if she found a husband... I could use someone to catchup on my gossip with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto begins to ponder her meeting with Zelda rubbing her chin as she does so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Well I'll leave you two at it. Last time I was between you two you never stopped. Gave me a headache. Give her a good excuse for my absence Ralis. As well as my heartfelt greetings and that indeed we must catchup... You know I could use a trip to the castle soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink turned and walked towards Ruto who was still musing to herself but then noticed Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Hmmm oh another adventure huh. Yeah my belly has been feeling weird lately. Do see if you can find out if there is a big parasite in there for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink gives her a thumbs up as Ruto opens her mouth wide and begins to inhale deeply the force of which sucks Link into her mouth. She swishes him around a bit relishing in the flavor before gulping loudly sending Link to the depths of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto pats her belly lovingly before looking towards Ralis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Well then be a dear show Princess Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalis glances around nervously before coughing into his fist<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalis: Well you see the thing is... the princess has put on a bit of weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto raises an eye brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: ... and?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalis: Well you see...</span></div></div>",

Did you say she has more then tripled my weight? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalis nods his head before taking a step back. Ruto floated there in silence for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: B-but... it's been... maybe only three months since me and Zelda last saw each other. At that time she was as thin as she always was. How could she have accomplished such a feat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalis: I cannot say my lady. I only am reporting to you what I personally have seen. I had not even heard this bit of information myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto sinks down into the water. Ralis knew his queen well enough to know that she was in something of a foul mood. He knew Ruto took great pride in her girth. She loved to flaunt it when she could. After all such girth only benefitted their kingdom. So he knew that she must've been jealous of princess Zelda. After a moment Ruto resurfaced clapping her hands together a cheery expression adorning her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: LOVELY It has been far to long since I've last seen the fair princess of Hyrule. I suppose I have been cramped up in this cave for far to long. I feel as though going out to greet her would be appropriate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto rose up to her full heigh and surfaced from the pool shaking herself of excess water. She looked down to Ralis. Putting on an overly cheery expression. One that sent dread into the pit of Ralis stomach <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Ralis do inform princess Zelda that I will be out to see her in just a moment. I need to make myself presentable. Also do give a wonderful excuse as to why my husband will be unable to join... also see to it that you inform me this time as to what excuse you used. I don't want a repeat from when the last incident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared down at Ralis who took a step back and nodded his head. Swiftly retreating to meet with the princess Zelda. He did not want to anger his Queen Especially in her current foul mood. With Ralis gone Ruto clenched her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: So she thinks she can show me up can she. Well I'll show her. She may be fatter then me but that doesn't matter. Heheheh I have been this size for well over a year now. I have long since learned how to present myself. Heh I bet she is only still learning how to walk elegantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto laughed covering her mouth as she did so presenting herself as a rather cliche noble woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink*from within*: ... ummmm I want to remind you Zelda is our friend... please don't do anything you may regret... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto glares down at her stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: I'm sorry I didn't quite hear you Link. Was there something you wanted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Nope all is good. Ummm still checking around. I've found a few parasites but uhhh nothing worthwhile yet. I'll keep looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Good. Now then <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto summons her attendants. When she appeared before Zelda she would be every bit the prim and proper lady like Queen.... which was odd given her rather notorious reputation as a tomboy. No matter! She though to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ruto prepared herself to visit Princess Zelda. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite popular opinion the Zora's did have clothing and a fashion style all their own. While their scales did a fine job covering up their more personal areas. Other cultures very quickly found their penchant for walking in the nude rather awkward. So while Zora's would spend most of their time naked as it were when wandering their own domain. If a Zora were to travel abroad or even live in another community as some of their merchant class liked to do. They would often times wear clothing. So naturally in order to keep a sense of cultural identity. The Zora's quickly developed a fashion style all their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Ruto for her part hated wearing clothing. Often times she found it really constricting. A sentiment she possessed long before she put on any of her current weight. Now that she had become rather massive she found clothing even more constricting. However she had long since learned and accepted that she would have to get some clothing when dealing with other cultures. More often then not she would have visitors as opposed to going out. Given her massive size long travels were rather... difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was fine by her she prefered staying in the water as much as possible. Her husband mused that this was on account of being part fish. She had eaten him for the sentiement and then proceded to bury him under as much food as she could stuff herself with. Queen Ruto's wrath espcially when directed towards her husband could be quite... brutal when the need arised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part when dealing with close friends like Princess Zelda in this case. Ruto would usually skip the whole ordeal of putting clothes on and the uncomfortable feeling that came with it. However her jealousy at the announcement of Princess Zelda's new size has prompted her to try and show her up in an area that usually Princess Zelda was the superior. That being acting like a proper lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto was proud of her rather Tomboyish nature citing it as one of the reasons (among others) that Link had choosen her. She was adventerous, mischievous, not afraid to speak her mind when the need called for it. Still sometimes jealousy makes one act in rash and stupid and Ruto was something of a hot head. Her husband would muse that if Ruto had been hylian she would've been a red head. This again had gotten Link eaten and crushed beneath a mountain of food. That man knew Ruto's anger better then anyone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Ruto had her finest dress a rather fetching Red dress. She felt the blue to be to... reduntant. It also exposed more then ample clevage. Again the queen was proud of her weight. Make-up applied, and other luxuries she normally would've forgone for such a simple meeting with a friend. Something in the back of her mind told her she was being ridiculous and that regardless of Zelda's size she would be same Princess that Ruto would never openly confess to but knew deep down was her best friend. Even if she felt that the Princess might harbor feelings for her husband. Perhaps that was the reason she had reacted as she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate Ruto was now prepared to meet with Princess Zelda. She took a deep breathe and made her way out of her cave. When she reached the surface she immediatly noticed Zelda. Whose flabby belly alone made Ruto some practically tiny by comparison. Nevermind her large breasts (Ruto huffed realizing they were far larger then her own.) ample rear and wide hips. Ruto also noticed that the Princess was wearing a dress that resembled the ones she wore while thin. Not only that it seemed to fit her perfectly despite her massive girth. How and where did she find the time to make those dresses. It had taken Ruto nearly 5 months to get one made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto shook her head. This was her friend. Now was not the time to be jealous. She should be happy after all only a short while ago she was delighted to hear that Zelda had come for a visit. Ruto closed her eyes took another deep breathe and looked up at the massive Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Zelda! It's been far to long since I've last seen you my friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda wore a positively massive smile befitting her size at seeing Ruto for the first time in months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: I know Ruto. I do apologize matters in the castle have been rather... hectic to say the least. I had intended to come visit you sooner. I do apologize deeply for being unable to see you and Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalis politely coughs to gain the attention of his Queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalis: Yes I was just explaning to the Princess that unfortunatly King Link had fallen ill recently and has been confined to bed rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto looks down at Ralis <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto *whispering*: That's the best you could come up with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalis*whispering back*: You didn't give me a lot of time. It's the best I could come up with on short notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto sighed and regained her cheery expression looking back at Zelda<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Yes awful little virus that's been spreading amongst my people. My poor husband has been down and out for days. He constantly says he has more adventuring to do and I simply tell him no. You know how he can be though honestly so hard headed at times. Though I suppose that's men for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto and Zelda giggle at this. For his part Link could easily hear his wife's side of the conversation and merely sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: Yes I know how stubborn your husband can be. Still I am glad to see you taking such good care of him. I however expected that he wouldn't have wanted to stick around for our meeting. No rather I came all the way out here to see you Queen Ruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto blinks taken slightly by surprise for this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Well I mean I know we normally dominate the conversation but I was surprised you wanted to speak with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda smiles at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: Honestly you are the only one I can really talk to freely. Your personality makes it so much easier for others to open up to you. I envy your ability to speak your mind so freely where as I have to constantly hold my toungue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZora's could indeed blush. Instead of pink their cheeks went purpleish. In this situation Ruto's cheeks were a deep purple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: I-I thank you Zelda. I have always envied your ability to be so ladylike. GAH I am no good with this touchy feely stuff. Honestly *sigh* anyways you said you came to catchup I have missed a good conversation Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda nods her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: Oh I agree completly Ruto. So I came here to invite you to a royal feast for just the two of us back at my castle. I know how much you enjoy food and well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda pats her astonishingly huge stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: I have taken a page out of your book so to speak. Though I confess my size does not contribute to a bountiful harvest as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda giggled while Ruto stared at Zelda<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Well I would love to join you for a feast Zelda. I fear that getting to your castle would take some time however and I do not wish to leave my husband unattended to for so long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Liar! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto swiftly slapped her stomach an act that didn't go unnoticed by Zelda but she said nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: Oh I understand that completly. However I have a spell that can get us to the castle in no time at all and another one to get you back to your domain in equal amount of time. So you won't be gone to long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto rubbed her chin before breaking out into a wide grin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Well I'm never one to pass up on a feast for the ages. So what are we waiting for princess lets stuff ourselves silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto claps her hands together eager to stuff her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: ... what happened to your desire to try and one up her on being lady like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto slapped her stomach again. Her smile never fading.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ruto shouldn't have been surprised at all. It was a teleportation spell. She had seen her husband use such a spell himself to travel quickly to far away places like Death Mountain and back again. Honestly she should've realized that at Zelda's size walking to the Zora domain was unfeasible. Nevermind any form of horse or carriage. On top of which at her size she imagined she would have heard Zelda coming LONG before she would have seen her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Ruto had to admit. The Hyrule castle was grand. It appears that Zelda has had it redesigned to fit her now rather generous self. It showed Ruto could only imagine what the average castle worker must have felt wandering these halls. Even Ruto felt tiny moving through them (walking wasn't really a thing she would call doing anymore) and she easily towered over the average person. Still Ruto mused the castle was grand. The dining hall even grander. Ruto was surprised to find that seats and tables that they could make use of. They even had appropriate silver wear for their size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly where had Zelda found the money and supplies to build all this. Let alone the time it would have taken years to reconstruct the castle yet she did it in only a few months. Well Zelda was a master of magic it is not unreasonable she had a spell or two tucked away that would allow her to do this. Still Ruto could not help but marvel. Her and Zelda had made small talk while they had awaited the meal to be prepared. Ruto was pleased to hear that there was juicy gossip to be heard. While Ruto did shy away from the more feminine areas of being a noble (Ruto was one more to talk politics and sports as opposed to the latest fashion trends.) she still loved the juicer gossip and Zelda was always a deep well of the juiciest of gossip. She had wondered where the Princess had found the time. Then again Zelda never did cease to amaze her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto's grin turned mischievous here. Well since she was here she might as well ask a question that's been on her mind for sometime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Soooo Princess Zelda I was wondering. Have you found a good man yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's face immediately went a bright shade of pink. At the question looking away rather bashfully from her friend. Ruto's grin only widened at her friends unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Oh come on you can tell me. I promise to keep it a secret between us girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda coughs into her hands looking at Ruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: I hardly feel that... that is any business of your's <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Heheheh soooo I'ma take that as a no. Come on Princess there has to be plenty of suitors out there for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: Well of course there are. It's a matter of finding the one that's more then just interested in ladder climbing up to the ranks of king. Most of the men my father have introduced are well... more interested in simply using me as a stepping stool to the throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs and leans her flabby back into her chair. Ruto frowned now she just felt like a jerk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Hey I'm sorry didn't mean to tease you to hard. Don't worry I'm sure you'll find the right guy eventually I mean I never thought I would get so lucky as to find a good guy and yet here I am happily married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Zelda's turn to smirk here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: What about you Ruto? You and Link have yet to produce an heir what are you two waiting on? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto's face flushed purple and she now looked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: I-I... you know that's perfectly fair. Well I mean it's not like we haven't been trying you know... I dunno I'm sure it's just a matter of time before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto paused and placed her hand on her stomach. There was that feeling again. Zelda tilted her head quizzically noticing her friends shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: Are you alright Ruto? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto looks up at Ruto the feeling had passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Oh just fine. I'm just starving is all what is taking them so long?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flashes Zelda her most reassuring smile. Zelda simply smiles back but wasn't quite convinced. Ruto turns her head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Hey Link... what are you doing in there? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: hmmm so far I've just sort of wandered around. I mean I'm trying to draw a more proper map. But this place is always growing and changing I get lost easily enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: That's it you haven't touched anything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Nope not a thing? Why whats up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Nothing just be careful alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: ... sure thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto looked back at Zelda and quickly changed the subject. However her mind began to wander. What was going on with her stomach lately. She was beginning to worry if a particularly nasty parasite like Barinade might have snuck in. That Parasite nearly killed Jabu-Jabu and he was diety. Though she may have been far larger her innards weren't nearly as powerful. She rubbed her stomach. Well if there was such a thing no doubt Link would find it. If he didn't find it by the time her meeting with Zelda was done. She would inform Link of her concerns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last the food was brought in. Ruto licked her lips in anticipation. If there was one thing about Zelda and the Hylians was that they knew how to cook.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zelda had always been impressed by Ruto's eating habits. She watched in almost awe as Ruto shoved practically whole plates of food down her throat taking no time to chew merely swallowing the contents whole then wasting no time at all she moved onto the next plate, then another after that. Zelda shook her head while she herself was a noble lady and despite her own recent... expanding. She herself maintained her manners at all time. While she knew that Ruto could if she so desired eat like a civilized person (while still an abundant amount) she often times prefered this method. An act that made Zelda more then a little jealous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Zelda slowly ate away merely watching as Ruto glutted herself. Zeldas royal staff more then aware that the Queen of the Zora would be attending. So there was going to be no shortage of food at this royal feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto gulped down a large amount of her beverage upon completion of that paused for a moment placing her hand on her ample stomach and proceded to unleash a devestaingly large belch. One that shook the table they sat at. Ruto smiled pleased with herself patting her stomach nearly lovingly. Before immediatly tearing back into her food again. Zelda chuckled to herself before taking a sip from her drink. Ruto paused mouth still filled with food looking up at Zelda. She took a moment noisly gulped down her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: So I have a question for you Princess? It's been bugging me since I heard about your arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: It's the matter of my new weight is it not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Yeah it is. I mean it took me a year to get to my current weight but at your size you could probably swallow me whole and have enough room for desert. With that said. You are still working on your first plate and myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto motioned to the pile of dishes around them. Ruto had nearly consumed the whole feast herself and from the looks of it was more then willing to consume the rest of it. Zelda blushed slightly placing her hand on her stomach before giggling sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: Well that's a rather interesting tale to put it mildly. Well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto frowned and looked at Zelda. She was stalling. Ruto sighed and lowered her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Ugh if you don't want to tell me nevermind. The better question...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto stabbed a large piece of stack with her fork and shoved the whole thing in her mouth again swallowing it this time with exaggerated loudness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Why did you get so fat? There had to be a good reason for it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda paused here and looked away from Ruto. She took a deep breathe before looking back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: Well it was because... I suppose this goes back to the question you asked me before. Why I haven't gotten married yet. I'll confess that when I started putting on the weight it was for Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto's eyes widened ever so slightly. She stopped her feasting and stared at Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: I-I confess that I was in love with him. Before you get upset with me I want you to understand I have since moved on from this foolish path. I no that I can't steal him away from you no matter how large I get. What you two have is true genuine love and I wouldn't dare try to step in the middle of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto stared at Zelda for a moment as though weighing her words. She closed her eyes and shook her head. So Ruto at least had some justification for her jealousy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: But by the time I had realized that I would never win Link's love and moved on from it. I had already put on a substantial amount of weight using... well it was magic as you probably could guess. Along with the help from a very kind Ranch girl who lives not to far from the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto rubbed her chin. She had heard Link make mention of a farm girl who had given Link his horse. She wondered if they were the same person. Well she decided it ultimately didn't matter anyways. The magic was probably the bigger reason Zelda had gotten so big. Ruto shook her head and smiled at Zelda <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Well put your fears to rest. I'm not mad at you and I'm not going to end our friendship over this. You have no desire to take my husband away from me right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: Absolutly not. No I kept putting on this weight simply as a means of... well I suppose testing which of any of the courtiers would give me a chance at my size. Most run away in fear or disgust upon first seeing me. So I figured a first good test to see if they could love me would be to accept me at my size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto nods her head and smirks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Ahhh so you figured that me and Link found true love because of my size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: N-no of course not! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto chuckled and went back to shoveling food down. Zelda smiled and placed her hand on her generous belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Don't think I haven't caught you staring. Hey it's just us two all the servants have left. Come on live a little. At your size you needn't worry bout manners specially with just me around. I've never held back for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto grins at Zelda<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Tell ya what Princess if you can clear more plates then I can I'll do whatever you want in exchange. However if I clear more plates then you do you will have to teach me that spell you cast to make you so large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked at Ruto who was grinning widly at Zelda. Ruto picked up another plate and shoveled the contents into her mouth before again gulping loudly. Then motioned for Zelda to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda hesistated for a moment before picking up a full plate opening her mouth... she paused closed her eyes and dropped the whole plate into her mouth. Swallowing loudly she felt the contents of the plate land in her stomach. Ruto flashed her a thumbs up and motioned for her to do so again. Zelda paused before shrugging and grabbing another plate and this time doing consuming it with much more gusto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto nodded her head approvingly. She could afford to let Zelda catch up a little bit. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link stared at his map. Before glancing around. The area around him was pulsating and he could hear Ruto in the process of another one of her feasts. He stared back at his map. There was no doubt about it. He had somehow ended up in what his wife had dubbed the \"burp chamber\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed his wife could be so childish sometimes. This chamber had earned it's nickname as being the place where if Link had wanted to be burped up this is where he would come. There was also a gland (he had found a few in his wife's belly.) that he could manipulate in order to cause his wife to burp he could even use it to control the volume and power of the burp (Other glands he found controlled her hunger and manipulate were her fat would go. If there were other glands in her stomach he had yet to find them. Her innards were massive to say the least.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't were he had wanted to be. One of the problems of his ever expanding wife was the fact that her innards were constantly changing. The larger chambers for the most part stayed the same it was more that new tunnels and corridors would sprout up often leading Link to different chambers. So the map he was working on was constantly being updated. Nevermind that he had yet to visit every chamber inside of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink placed a hand on his stomach as it growled hungrily. He knew Ruto was usually good about making sure Link would be able to have something to eat himself while he was in her belly. He'd have to go back to the entrance chamber (his wife named all the chambers in her stomach. She felt it was her right given that it was her stomach after all) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunatly for Link he was so caught up in his map he failed to realize that the pressure in the chamber was growing. Link realized it all to late when the pressure burst upward easily carrying him with it. As his wife belched he was sent flying out of her maw. He flew for several moments before he landed in some sort of liquid. Huh had they already gotten back to the Zora domain? Maybe she burped him up intentionally to speak with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his whole world shifted and he felt motion as though the entire lake was being lifted. He looked up and saw the massive face of Princess Zelda before him. He only then realized that he was in a rather large cup. He shouted and waved his arms to try and get her attention but to no avail as he and the liquid he was in entered Zelda's mouth and he was very quickly swallowed down. He plunged for several moments before landing in her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned as he stood up. He glanced around his new surrondings. Things were different in here then they were in his wife. The color for starters while his wife's innards had been blue. Zelda's stomach was redish not unlike Jabu-Jabu's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also siginificantly larger then Ruto's stomach as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Well... this is unexpected. Hmmm I don't think Ruto would appreciate it if she found out I had taken to exploring Zelda's insides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checks his bags only to realize that he had left his ocarina behind... or had he dropped it when Ruto burped him up. Either way he wouldn't be able to teleport out of here. Well he would need to alert Zelda to his presence. So the first thing he did was try shouting after all his wife could hear him no problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of shouting to no reply he frowned. Either Zelda was aware of the circumstance and was keeping silent about the whole thing or more likley she couldn't hear him. Link frowned he supposed it was possible that due to being much larger she simply couldn't hear him. Either way Liink needed to find a way out of here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: I suppose a new stomach should make for an interesting exploration. I'll just explain everything to Ruto and I should be fine... yeah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink heard a rather noisy gulp above him and a shadow appeared around him. He quickly jumped out of the way as a large plate landed where he had been standing prievously followed shortly thereafter by the contents of the plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: ... It seems as though Ruto has given Zelda eating lessons... I should talk with her about it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink shrugged picked up a piece of food Zelda had eaten. Began eating it himself as he moved off. With any luck Zelda's insides wouldn't be to different from Ruto's insides. He could find a burp chamber and have Zelda burp him up (He would apologize to her about that later) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: It's not a perfect plan but I don't have much else to go on I suppose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Link began his adventure in the belly of Zelda<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthors note: For those of you playing along at home. For the most part this chapter syncs up with the prievous chapter. When Ruto burped is when she burped up Link and then Zelda drank him by accident (or design?) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoooo yeah I realize this story has gotten a touch fanficcy and mvoed away from the realms of fetishy. I do apologize this was not my design when I started writing. This story sort of ran away from me and yeah I'm rather enjoying the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah if any of you have anything you wish to say about this work I'd love some feedback. If you hate it and hate my writing style then please inform me. I'll take any and all criticism. Just drop me a little writing.com mail thing and I promise to read it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSooo uhhh for those of you reading it I thank you. If you enjoy it I promise to continue if yall hate it... then I'll sort of stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut enough of my ranting </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link groaned as he trudged through Zelda's massive belly. This was most assuredly different from Ruto's gut. There were no side chambers no different paths to take. Heck no monsters had even shown up in there. Ruto's belly was like a dungeon Zelda's... more of a giant empty plain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed he missed his wife's stomach. Hell he missed his wife. While he liked Zelda well enough he loved his wife. As massive as she was. He began to wonder if he would ever get out of here. Would he ever see his wife again? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink shook his head he couldn't begin to think such thoughts. No rather he had to keep himself motivated. He would figure a way out of here. It might take him a lot of time but he would figure a way out eventually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother loud gulp from up above signaled the arrival of more of the food. He sighed he wasn't hungry. He could only hope that maybe in her now stuffing herself phase Zelda would eat to much and accidentally let loose a belch and he could use that to escape. At this point he had given up on finding a burp chamber with which to make Zelda burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed when suddenly he heard a massive burp. He blinked his eyes in surprise. Was that Zelda? No it didn't feel like when Ruto burped when he was traveling her innards it was to close. Like it was coming from... within Zelda's belly. But that couldn't be possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother massive burp echoed throughout the stomach. No it was definiatly coming from within Zelda's stomach. He quickly ran towards where he believed the burp had been coming from. He skidded to a stop when he saw a massive form before him. It was huge slightly smaller then his wife when she first ate him all that time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked his eyes quickly when he realized that this was a person. Not only that he recognized this person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Malon! The red headed farm girl of whom he had met several times in the past. Now he was confused how had she gotten in here. Not only that but... how had she gotten so huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly approached her and realized right away that Malon was quickly scarfing down all the food that she could get her hands on. Well that was certinally one explanation as to how she got so large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon paused in her binge to pat her stomach before unleashing another monster of a belch. This one shaking the entire stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*on the outside*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda paused in her eating as her stomach let out an odd sounding gurgle. She placed her hand on it gently. Blushing profusly as she looked over to Ruto to see if the fat Zora Queen had heard the noice eminating from her stomach. Luckily for her the Queen was to busy stuffing herself with food to notice Zelda's lapse in manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sighed in relief. It was so strange that her stomach would occasionally let out such odd noises. At any rate there was no way she was going to lose to Ruto! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Zelda threw herself back at the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Back in her stomach* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon sighed and nodded her seemingly proud of the size and volume of the belch that she had just emitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: ... Malon? Is that you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon paused and looked down gasping as she saw Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: Fairy boy...?</span></div></div>",

The better question is how long have you been in Zelda's stomach and also... how did you get so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink wasn't one hundred percent sure how to broach the subject of her being well<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: Fat? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nearly face faulted with the how blunt she was about it. Malon giggled slightly and slapped her gigantic stomach <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: Don't need to dance around the subject Fairy boy. I'm proud of my size. Now as for how long I've been in Zelda's stomach well... I don't really have a concept of time down here. Could be a few hours for all I know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink rubs his chin and nods his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Well we last saw Zelda a few months ago and she was still skinny. Now well she's simply huge I mean she makes Ruto look skinny and that's no easy feat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon chuckles and rubs the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: Then I've probably been in here for a few weeks. Lets see Zelda was probably like 400-500 pounds when she ate me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon rubs her multiple chins deep in thought. Link blinks a few times looking at Malon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Wait a second if Zelda was only like 400-500 pounds how in goddesses name did she eat you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon blinks and looks up at link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: Oh well... uhhh funny story. You see as it turns out just about any one can cast magic... okay this is kind of a long story so let me start from the beginning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon coughs into her flabby fist <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: Alright so when Zelda heard about how big Ruto was getting and then how you and her got married and blah blah blah. She got well jealous. Not sure if becausee of you and her or if because the Zora people where suddenly in the lime light. Either way Zelda wanted to get fatter and came to me... not sure why she came to me now that I think about it buuut I'm getting off topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink tilted his head watching Malon ramble. He was a bit concerened with this Zelda being jealous thing but he wasn't going to interupt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: So yeah as it turns out I happened to have this special milk that is super high in fat and basically Zelda commiosioned me and my farm to begin producing this in mass for her. So hey she paid a lot of money and we did. Still I'm assuming there is more to it then just the milk. My guess is she found a spell to increase her weight gain. Anyways on one of my delieveries I happened to sneak a visit into the royal library annnnnnd I found a book as it turns out some spells can be cast by anyone... long story short I shrung myself. I was to small to move the pages so I went to find Zelda. As it turns out she was busy eating food. I tried to get her attention and... well one thing lead to another and she ate me. I've been in here ever since. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon takes a deep breathe after finishing the story. Link merely blinked a few times in something along the lines of shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Wait... you were shrunk... did the spell ever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon giggles and shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: Nope the spell never wore off I'm still I guess shrunk though you wouldn't know it by looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles again looking down at the practically tiny Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: I mean look at you Link you are pretty much bite size. I could eat you up. Heheheh don't worry I won't though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink chuckles and nods his head sitting down in Zelda's tummy and rubs his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Well then how do we get out of here Malon? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: I dunno to be honest I'm kind of okay with it. Zelda eats a lot and well it's done wonders for my figure. Though given how big her belly is she must be huge by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Well as much fun as touring Zelda's innards are I'd really REALLY like to get out of here and return to my wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: hmmmm I think I have an idea actually </span></div></div>",

That's not even as powerful as I can go. I'll burp so loud and powerful not only will I launch you out of my stomach it'll launch you out of Zelda's as well. Heheheh it might even make the Princess think she burped as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Ugh... whatever if it gets me out it gets me out. You are sure you can burp me out right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: Heheheh positive now quite a master needs time to prepare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon closes her eyes and begins inhaling. Deep within her stomach Link can feel the pressure changing.</span></div></div>",

Concentrated when she felt the pressure rises she opened her mouth and... what came out would barely qualify as a hiccup for a woman of normal stature. Malon frowned slightly looking down at her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: ummm Malon... Not for not but why are you stalling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon glared at her stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: What did I tell you Fairy boy don't interupt the master. If you interupt me I won't be able to complete my brilliant plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink sighed an sat down in her stomach. He blew some of the hair out of his eyes and shook his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Brilliant plan alright you can't even burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink muttered under his breathe and laid back looking up towards the roof of Malon's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back outside of Malon's belly. Malon was getting frusterated. Despite her best efforts she couldn't even get the smallest of burps out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: I don't get it I've been able to burp like a champ since I was a little girl. The heck is going on with me right now. I mean god just a few minutes ago I let out a burp that shook Zelda's whole stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon started pounding on her stomach anything to burp properly. But alas nothing came. Malon just sighed and lowered her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: Well Link this is a touch awkward buuuuuuut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Let me guess you can't get a burp out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon sighed and nodded her head realizing how fruitless this was she sort of blushed and rubbed the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: Yeah weirdest thing... Oh well I mean I guess your kind of sorta... stuck in my tummy for a bit. Don't worry probably won't be long I'll have that big belch I promised you soon. Don't you worry HAHAHAHA....

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hello everyone this is the author of this particular substory Seproth/Angel. Unfortunately I confess that I don't have much of a chapter here. I wanted to do more on the royal feast but no version of myself writing it ended in anything other then a branching chapter which I'm not dreadfully happy with. While I could simplify this by just going with the person I decided was the winner I ultimately didn't like forcing that upon you the readers. Since while I am writing most of this particular story this is still an open \"campfire\" story line where anyone can chip in and I feel forcing this takes away from that. So instead of forcing a decision and instead of boring you with a mere who is the winner chapter. I instead decided to take this opportunity to discuss a few things about the \"world\" I sort of created. So this will be a bit of an... I suppose behind the scene's esq chapter along with a few ideas I had but ultimately scrapped. Which will ultimately end in a branching chapter. While I probably won't update the branch at this time. I will instead tell you that I intend to update the path that is Ruto winning the eating contest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo first and foremost I guess I want to discuss my thought process on how this all sort of works. After all Ruto, Zelda, and even Malon are fairly gigantic far more then would be considered reasonable (especially in Zelda's current state.) Essentially I have just applied an MST3K mantra to the whole thing. Just don't think about it. More then anything while writing I instead tend to view it as Link has been shrunk and all the girls are on the heavy side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those of you who know the Zelda lore this particular story line takes place during the Childhood timeline. At which point I give it about 15 years following the events of Link ratting Gannondorf out and him being banished to the Twilight realm. So I estimate everyone to be in their mid 20's at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo in my cannon here Link and Ruto are sort of a child hood friend romance story. In that after Link's ratted Gannondorf out he would often visit the Zora domain and hang out with Ruto. Who at the time he considered only a friend. (being to young and somewhat immature to really reciprocate her feelings) Ruto for her part mostly acted the role of a Tsundere often times being somewhat mean and bullying Link though occasionally being sweet on him. When Ruto first started putting on weight (I estimate around 5-6 years post Link ratting out Gannondorf) Link would often visit and be bewildered by just how much weight Ruto was putting on (Not to mention how much she could eat.) Ruto herself merely brushed it off. It would be another couple of years before we hit the the part where this story first happened (Namely Ruto accidentally eating Link) at which point Link and Ruto where around about 18-19. They would be married about a year after she first ate him. By the time the story started properly (when Zelda showed up) They had been married for about 5 years and where jointly ruling the Zora domain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part their rule is looked upon as a favorable one. Though there are some staunch traditionalists who view their union as blasphemy. For the most part they have near universal praise and the Zora domain is becoming quite prosperous as a result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a queen Ruto is a somewhat hot blooded (fitting her tomboy nature) and at times aggressive diplomat ruling more off of emotion then anything else. Whereas Link is the one who sits down and more willing to talk things out. They also work well together each one knowing when their particular brand of diplomacy will be better suited for the time. Ruto is not above using her intimidating size and somewhat fearsome reputation to bully some hard headed diplomats. Whereas Link is more then willing to use his status as a hero to get what he wants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile there is no cannon proof that the Zora and Goron's don't get along. I decided to play with the whole Elf vs Dwarf trope. With the Zora clearly being the elves and the Goron's clearly being Dwarves. So it's thanks to Link that these two races are actually performing trade with one another. Whereas before they would never dare trade in the past (what they trade... I have no idea lol) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the rest of Link's sort of harem. Zelda is happy for her friends though somewhat sad that Link chose Ruto over her. Malon hasn't given up hope that she can win Link anyways. Saria who has yet to appear though I have plans for is more then happy for her best friend. The two often spend time together to talk (When Link isn't busy playing around in his wife's stomach) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Ruto's belly. It is actually bigger on the inside then one would think. I have applied a lot of bizarre alien biology to it. I have given the Zora people a unique internal structure. That changes as they get larger. Especially in their females who tend to be on the plus size... in this world. All Zora regardless of size can swallow people whole if need be. Without even showing signs that they did. So even a super skinny Zora can swallow a full size person and show no signs (their insides even being big enough for the person to stand up in if need be) This stands at odds with every other races insides. Which look more like a perfectly normal humans... Though less immediately fatal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea I had been playing with but ultimately scraped was the idea that Zelda wasn't actually fat but had cast an illusion on herself to make herself appear to be the size she was at. Though when I decided that Malon would be inside Zelda's stomach I decided better not. I had wanted to do this because I wanted a scene later in the story in which most of the main females from Ocarina of Time would have a sort of girl's only slumber party and Ruto (being by far the largest in this scenario) would accidentally eat everyone. Though I may not completely scrap that idea (She can totally eat Saria who is her perfectly normal size making her... an ant in among giants) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea I had was the idea that there was a parasite monster inside Ruto that would find her \"hunger gland\" and begin messing with it causing Ruto to go on an eating rampage. This would happen while Link was still trapped in Zelda's stomach so the drama would come from trying to get Link out of Zelda's stomach and into Ruto's to destroy the monster before Ruto does some serious harm. While I confess I may still go through with this. I feel the story has already been done to death in this soooo I ultimately probably will abandon it. Though I may bring it up if ideas run short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for whether or not Ruto is pregnant as some seem to believe well... That's a secret :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate I thank all of you who have read this story. It means a lot to me as I have put a bit of actual effort into writing it. For those who you have enjoyed it I apologize for the lack of updates I am SUPER busy in my real life (also one chapter I was writing got accidentally deleted near the end of it. So I sorta went nuts and took a break lol) and because of that I got super bad writing block especially with this particular chapter of the end of the eating contest. Don't worry though I finally got my shit together and I promise to start pumping out updates on a maybe weekly basis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo one again thank you all. I hope you enjoy this sort of author's note chapter or found it interesting. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Authors note: Okay I promise this will be short and sweet. I just wanna apologize to everyone that the last chapter was supposed to be changed to Author's note but there was a slight fowl up with my computer. So I do apologize for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRighty right now then on with the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto hastily shoveled another mouthful of at this point she wasn't even sure into her mouth. She wasn't even bothering to taste it anymore. She swallowed it down swiftly. She placed a hand on her stomach and groaned. She hadn't felt this full since she started putting on weight back in the early days. She patted her stomach glancing up at Zelda who herself seemed to have slowed down as well. She wasn't sure how long they had been at it... or how even the cooks kept up with them. Nor did she truly care all that mattered to her was beating Zelda. She'll be damned if she allows anyone to out eat her. Even one of her dear friends. She had a reputation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso... she didn't want to be at Zelda's mercy. Sure Zelda was a kind soul... but Ruto knew there was a devious side in there somewhere. She'd be damned if she let it hit her. Ruto's stomach let out a groan signaling it had nearly enough. She glanced down at it and gently cooed at it in an attempt to soothe it. On the other hand it looked a bit bigger from all the food she'd been eating. She smirked if nothing else she would put on quite a few tons after this meal. With renewed confidence (and a bit excited at the thought of messing Link who was by now no doubt running into the massive amounts of food she'd been eating) began again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part Zelda groaned she was not a big eater. Most of the weight she put on was through... Well calling it cheating would be uncharitable. Most of the meals Zelda ate were still relatively small. On top of which she never ate this fast. Her stomach was simply put not prepared for what was happening. Already she was starting to feel.. not just full but downright bloated. It hurt she wasn't sure she could take much more of this. Still she continued eating as fast as she could. Eat through the pain. After all no pain no gain <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Inside Zelda's stomach*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon marveled at all the food around her. She had never seen the stomach so packed before. Malon licked her lips as she continued stuffing herself on Zelda's meal. Hey what Zelda didn't know wouldn't hurt her. At that moment an odd groaning noise vibrated the place the force of it vibrated Malon sending the now super obese farm girl into a jiggling fit. She giggled enjoying the feeling. From within she could hear Link call up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: Please tell me that was you and you are about to burp?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon huffed and placed her hands on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: Hush you and no that wasn't me heheheheh that was Princess Zelda's tummy. I have to tell you I've never seen quite the bounty in here before. It's like heaven. Though I think she's reaching her limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*back with Zelda and Ruto*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it... Zelda thought placing a hand on her stomach as it began to groan and gurgle angrily at her. She placed her final bite down and looked up to Ruto honestly impressed that the Zora queen was still able to put away so much. She had even eaten far more then her at the start of this whole competition. Ruto paused and glanced up noticing Zelda's gaze on her. A smirk forming on the Queen's face. Zelda sighed as she took in the image of the massive queen. The fancy dress and all the make up she had bothered to put on ruined by way ward crumbs and other food stuffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Don't tell me Princess you are throwing in the towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: I dare say Queen Ruto you have bested me at this challenge I am quite impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda winced and placed a hand on her stomach a tingling pain of fullness shooting through her. Her stomach groaned and gurgled again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: YES! Hahahaha I have to say princess victory is honestly delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda chuckled and shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: Yes of course my Ruto I imagi -urp- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda blushed fiercely as her hands quickly were brought up to her mouth. Her face flushed a deep pink at her sudden outburst... Even though it was barely audible. Of course Ruto picked up on it and burst into a powerful laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda; My apologies... I-I do not know where that came from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto was clutching the sides of her massive stomach trying her best to regain her composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Hahahaha  I'll say you owe me an apology that was pathetic. Hahahahaha ahhh I was about to say at any rate there was one last thing I needed to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto began rubbing her stomach a massive gurgle rang out from deep within. Ruto tightened up for a moment before unleashing a massive belch. This one not only shook the table they were sitting on but could be heard out on the castle streets making some wonder if some sort of thunderstorm was brewing (or perhaps a monster attack. Either way panic in the streets) Once the belch subsided (and the ringing in Zelda's ears died out) Ruto gleefully patted her stomach and let out another boisterous laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Now that my dear princess is how you celebrate a powerful feast. With an equally powerful Belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: .. Charming...!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda made a face and placed her hand on her stomach. Another gurgle this one quite different from before emanated from her stomach. She swallowed nervously as she felt it move inside her stomach. Ruto for her part noticed the look on Zelda's face and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Ahhh it would seem your belly agrees with me Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began giggling watching as Zelda looked to be struggling to keep whatever was trying to get out in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: Ruto this... No-...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't even talk feeling the bubble shift around within the confines of her massive stomach. Ruto burst into laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Heheheh come on Zelda let it out. You'll feel sooooo much better I assure you. It's really simple watch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto took a deep breathe paused for a moment before unleashing yet another monster of a burp. While not as powerful as the previous one this was still a powerhouse fitting the Queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda groaned as she held her stomach she wasn't sure how much longer she could keep it in <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Back inside Zelda's stomach*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole stomach was quaking now. Malon could scarcely keep her balance among all the plates of food. The stomach gurgled and groaned omniously. All around Malon she could see gas bubbles bubbling up around her. Even within Malon Link was being tossed around by the force of the quakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: What is going on out there! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: I uhhhh think Zelda is fighting a battle she can't quite win... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: What does that even mean! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: it means... hold onto something tight! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*outside Zelda*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda groaned she couldn't hold it in anymore. Meanwhile Ruto looked on in anticipation. This would be a good day. She giggled and watched </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zelda couldn't do it she couldn't contain it any longer. Not that she would say that she hadn't gone down easily. No Zelda had her pride. She would not lose to a burp of all things she was the Princess of Hyruke future Queen. She had her manners to think about it. She took a few throaty swallows in a vein hope that this would quell the storm within her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest if anything it feels like it made it worst. She attempted to open her mouth perhaps in an attempt to speak or perhaps the force of what came next simply forced her mouth open. Either way Zelda burped. Not just any burp mind you. One for the record books. Easily eclipsing any that Ruto had unleashed during their time here. If anything whatever mirth had been on the Zora's face before hand was gone simply replaced with sheer amazement as Zelda. Perhaps the most feminine woman she had ever met unleashed... what could only be described as a force of nature. The burp flipped the table and nearly knocked the massive Zora queen over. It was all Ruto could do not to be tipped over by the sheer force of belly winds as they flowed from Zelda's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Inside her stomach*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though it wasn't strong enough on the outside. Inside was something else entirely. As Malon could actually feel the force of the belch lift her off her grand ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: I-I can't believe this!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas all Malon could shriek as she was sent hurtling out of Zelda's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink: I... I'm not even sure how to react anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas all he could mutter even as he bounced around the insides of Malon's stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Outside of Zelda* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's belch had continued now long into the 15 second mark. It was still going strong. When it suddenly very rapidly died off. Instead she began to gag. Ruto who was still somewhat awe struck noticed this. Rushing over to the Princess side she began to pound on Zelda's back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: I have to say princess you must have belched up like your whole meal. Don't you dare die on me like this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one more strong slap to Zelda's back. The force dislodged whatever had been stuck in Zelda's throat and sent it crashing into the floor like some sort of massive rock. Zelda took a few deep breathes before letting out the rest of the belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: Wow... You scared the hell out of me... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'll look over to where Zelda had coughed up whatever it was that had clogged up her throat. Blinking in surprise at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: W-WHAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda shouted looking down to see the somewhat massive Malon laying on the floor looking dazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: What the hell... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: Ugh... Wh.. Where am I... Why is it so bright<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes blinked rapidly as she tried to readjust to the sudden brightness of the light. She had spent some time in Zelda's stomach where there was no light. So needless to say even the now dimly lit room was nearly blinding to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda: Malon... What are you doing here.. .Where did you... Did you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hand on her massive stomach. Quickly looking back and forth between her stomach and Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto: ... I'm not even sure... What just happened... Did you just burp up Malon? How... did that even... Are your burps like some sort of teleportation spell or something... Is that why you never burp! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda shoots Ruto a quick glare and then glares down at Malon. Who seemed to finally be orienting herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: Uhhhh... Hello Princess Zelda... Queen Ruto... How have you two been? Heheheh... This is all very awkward I'll... Just head ou...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly backed away until she felt an incredible wall of flesh. She chuckled and lightly groped at it. Looking up she noticed that somehow Ruto had gotten behind her. Ruto was staring down at the tiny farm girl a mixture of a glare and a confused stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda for her part slowly dusted herself off and stared down at Malon a sweet look on her face. That somehow immediately put Malon on edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: W-Well you see Princess.

Nervously... sheepishly she begins to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon: Well ya see... There's a bit more I uhhh heheheh WELL ummm okay...</span></div></div>",

Meh but I won't drudge this out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd Note: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon opened her mouth to speak then promptly shut it. <i>Lets Pro/Con this whole... Telling Princess Zelda and Queen Ruto that I ate Link thing. Pro: I'm sure they will figure out a way to get him out of my stomach unharmed and he'll stop complaining. Con: They are totally gonna kill me. Uhhh I do enjoy the whole living thing. Okay so here's what you are going to do Malon. You are going to lie to them. Then you are going to go back to the farm. Work up the most epic belch ever get Link out of your stomach. Trade some favors so he never speaks of this to Queen Ruto and uhh live happily ever after weighing like a few tons. Sounds great.</i> Malon nods her head enthusiastically. Leaving the somewhat bewildered Zelda and Ruto to stare questioningly at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda coughed into her hand re grabbing Malon's attention. \"So you were saying something about there being more? I would love to hear this more my dear Malon.\" Zelda spoke in a rather serene tone of voice. That just underneath Malon could sense a twinge of venom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon gulped nervously before opening her mouth to speak again. \"Oh yeah well ya see uhh... I think some of that food was undercooked. Yeah I have some like real bad indigestion going on right now from what I ate while I was in you...\" Malon sighs and lowers her head. As Ruto snickers behind her. \"Your stomach... In your stomach.\" Zelda shoots Ruto a quick glare silencing the large monarch. \"So yeah you should look to make sure you didn't eat anything undercooked would ate for you to have a tummy ache. Right so you can send the bill of my punishment back home to my farm. I am sure my dad will be quite shocked to see me as I am. In fact I don't even know what's gonna happen next.\" Malon finishes up quickly and turns around ready to head out the door. <i>They totally bought it heheheh. Man Malon you are the best liar ever!</i> Malon's internal monologue causes her to giggle victoriously on the way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sighs and rubs the bridge of her nose with her fingers. This had become a trying day to say the least. \"You honestly don't expect me to believe that do you Malon? Spit it out what are you really hiding? I promise I won't be mad.\" Sure Zelda was upset with the farm girl but she still considered her a dear friend. Even if she had apparently decided the parasite route was the best for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon freezes up turning around slowly to face the two fattened royals. \"For my part I promise to only be mildly amused by the whole thing. Go on Malon spit it out what are you hiding?\" Ruto said holding back another laughing fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon sighs and places a hand on her stomach. <i>Hey I tried... It was a nice life while I had it...</i> Malon sighs in defeat before sheepishly looking up at the pair. \"I uhhh kinda sorta maybe... have eaten Link. He also has not stopped yelling at me since I've done so...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda tilts her head slightly to the right. Well that was unexpected. She slowly looks over to Ruto. A number of questions were going through Zelda's mind right now. One: How did Link end up in Malon's stomach when he was supposedly ill back at the Zora domain.  Two: Was she going to have to throw herself between Ruto and Malon. Zelda took a long look at Ruto's face. She was going through several emotions it would seem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto finally settled on annoyance. \"I burped him out at the beginning of the feast and he ended up in your cup just as you drank from it Zelda. He washed up in your stomach. Couldn't reach you. At the same time he lost all the tools in my stomach... That'll be fun later. Found Malon in there. Malon then ate him in some sort of strange belief that by doing so she can help him escape your stomach while hiding the fact that she was in there.\" Ruto closed her eyes and nodded her head sagely. Before they snapped open and stared down at Malon. \"Did I miss anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon blinked a few times before slowly almost mechanicaly nodding her head. \"I had hoped that I could burp him out... Problem is I suddenly haven't been able to burp despite being like suuuuper good at it.\" She rubs her stomach slowly. \"Well since the cat is out of the bag and I'm sure you two want to kill me or something... Uhh maybe you can help me get him out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto and Zelda look at each other. Zelda turns to look at Malon and...</span></div></div>",

When Malon gave the appropriate response... she suddenly paled. Realizing what Zelda must've been getting at. \"Well I have some news for you. The spell does have a time limit. So if you were sitting there thinking that you were still shrunken and weighed some unfathomable number of tons more... You are mistaken.\" Malon sighed and looked down... So it was official she was the lightest of the three. She would have to redouble her efforts... Why was this a contest? \"However I feel as though... a bit of a... turn about is only fair play. You spent time in my stomach eating all my food... I feel as though it's only fair that I repay the favor. Think of it this way you are getting off light. I mean I'm just going to go in there grab Link. Use a teleportation spell then warp us out. You probably won't even know we were in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon's eyes brightened up slightly. She was getting off light. \"Oh of course Princess Zelda! I will gladly help you in saving my friend Link from my digestive system. Granted I think he's safe... He has been shouting at me for awhile now though... Bit strange hearing a voice come from the inside of your stomach.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto shrugs her shoulders. \"Ehhh I'm used to it but then Zora biology is probably considered strange to you non Zora.\" She pats her stomach enthusiastically. \"I mean after all my belly is like a massive dungeon that Link is constantly exploring heheheheh... Ya know I feel this is a good learning experience Zelda. Think that shrinking spell can work on two?\" She looks over to Zelda who smirks and nods her head. \"Wonderful well Malon I hope you don't mind having three people in there.\" She reaches down and pokes Malon's stomach giggling as it starts to jiggle in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda clasps her hands together. \"Right then lets do this.\" Zelda moves next to Ruto and places her hand on the Zora's shoulder. She begins to mutter incantations of power slowly a blue light envelops both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon gasps as she watches them begin to shrink before her eyes until they are suddenly teeny tiny (well compared to her at any rate). Zelda and Ruto look at the now massive Malon who was moments ago smaller then the both of them. Malon reaches down and picks them both up. \"Woooow you two look soooo small. I wonder if this is how small I got...\" Malon giggles and brings them up to her face. \"Right then lets get this over with.\" She opens her mouth wide and drops the both of them into her mouth. She wastes very little time swallowing them both down. Before grimacing slightly. \"Ugh Link tasted much better then them two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubs her stomach slowly as she feels the two drop in. Eliciting a very mild belch from her. She simply sighs. \"Lame...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within Malon's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink sighs as he leans against the stomach walls. \"Ugh to think when I was younger I thought being eaten by a Whale would be the weirdest thing I'd ever do... If only they had warned me then...\" He sighs again before slowly looking up. Seeing a pair of massive forms falling from the sky and landing right in front of him with a powerful splash. Getting digestive juice all over him. He wipes his face off. \"Not the most graceful of landings ladies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirks as he watches Ruto slowly get up from the impact. She glances around seeming to take the pulsing organ in. \"Well this is different it's like... One huge sack. Like I don't see anything resembling connecting paths or alternate chambers. Man you Hylians are boring.\" She looks over to Link and proceeds to bound over to her husband and tackling him to the ground pinning him under her still considerable weight. \"Oh Link I've missed you so much! Also I don't think we've been the same size in forever it's so weird to be eye level with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped beneath the butter ball that is her wife he could only grunt out a small reply. Ruto snickers before slowly rising up. Allowing Link to breathe. \"Thank you... Also yeah it is nice to be eye level. Though I confess I already miss your far more grand size.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda clears her throat drawing attention from the pair. \"Not to ruin this reunion but I believe you wish to leave?\" Ruto and Link look at each other and nod their heads. \"I promise you have sometime before the spell wears off so you two can enjoy being the same size later. I'd rather not have to witness it.\" Zelda walks mutters something under her breathe before approaching the pair. Placing her hands on their shoulders. \"Well then lets go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda begins speaking the incantation for the spell</span></div></div>",

It was dreadfully boring while waiting for her friends to rescue her other friend from her belly. She grumbled moodily under her breathe. \"All this because I couldn't burp!\" She frowns and let's out a big sigh. I mean it shouldn't be that hard, she'd been doing it her whole life. Proudly could she out burp any one else she'd ever known. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed her arms and breathed out an annoyed breathe. \"I think I'll explore the castle. That at least should give me something to do while waiting for them to get back.\" She grins pleased with her decision. Who knows maybe she would find something to eat while wandering around. She pats her belly lovingly she was apparently way behind Ruto and Zelda in terms of weight. She would strive to fix that. Time to find some food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she began her lumbering exploration. The castle was huge. So many rooms and side chambers. How was she supposed to find the kitchen or dining area... Wait she'd been in the dining area. \"... Crap. I forgot to see if there were any leftovers.\" She sighed. Well the table had been flipped she thought quietly to herself. What leftovers would have been knocked on the floor. Probably best not to eat floor food if one was to be honest with themselves. On the other hand she had spent the last few months in Zelda's belly eating her food. No floor food was probably a worst decision then... ABC food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hummed quietly to herself. Malon couldn't believe how wide these halls where. I mean Malon was a very large girl and she still had plenty of space to walk around. She wondered how the servants managed to navigate this place. Come to think of it she hadn't seen any maids or butlers or any kind of servant for that matter. \"Does anyone actually live/work here?\" She asked aloud. No response. She frowns \"How very lonely... Such a large castle and Zelda lives here all alone...\" She was making herself sad. She shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure how long she had been walking for when she stumbled across an interesting looking room. She glanced around and entered. There were books everywhere. She whistled as she glanced at all the books. \"Guess this is Zelda's personal library. Heheh a nerd like her would gather up a ton of books.\" She giggles lightly to herself reaching out and grabbing one. It was some dusty old arcane looking book. She opened it up to a random page. \"Hmmm...\" She wasn't the most learned girl having grown up on a farm and all. Yet she recognized a spell when she saw one. Then again she had cast a shrinking spell on herself some time ago. What led her to her brief stay in Zelda's tummy. She snapped her fingers. \"That's right Zelda did say I could cast some magic. Hmmm... Well I mean wha's the worst that could happen. All I have to do is read this old word stuff. I can do that!\" So Malon went about casting the spell. It took her a few tries and botch pronunciations. Surprisingly this did not lead to her exploding or something. Lucky her at last however she was able to properly cast the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body began to glow a strange red color upon it's completion. \"Uhhh... Maybe this was a bad idea...\" She said at last</span></div></div>",

I was hoping to find like an organ I could mess with. But there's nothing, Nadia, zilch.\" Ruto shakes her head and looks over to her husband. \"Though I'm willing to bet that this makes you all the happier with your marriage choice eh?\" She gives him a cheeky grin. his only response is a shrug. \"Because being eaten by you is the only reason I married you my dearest Ruto.\" Link sparked back. Returning her grin with one of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto favored him with a look and then burst out laughing. \"Fair enough I suppose. You choose me for my award winning personality. I know, I know. It's hard being this perfect.\" She says while striking a pose sending her multi-ton body jiggling and quivering everywhere. Link began to fan himself lightly. \"It's a bit warm in here don't you think?\" He asks not quite looking at his wife. Who was at this point clearly trying to get a rise out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks proud to call herself the victor of this round. She pauses and place a hand on her stomach. There was that odd feeling again. Link notices this and approaches her. He place his hand on her stomach now being more or less the same size he could better gauge if anything was going on inside her. \"You've been having these feelings for the last few days. I didn't find anything to interesting last time I was in there.\" Link glances around and lowers his voice. \"Is it the children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto shakes her head. \"No it's not them. This feels like it's coming from my stomach. I am worried it's a different kind of Parasite.\" She rests her hand over her husbands hand feeling her belly. \"I am worried it's putting Mipha and Sidon in danger.\" She mutters quietly to her husband. Link frowns and nods his head. He'd have to be more diligent in tracking down this elusive threat. He was not about to put his unborn children in danger due to his negligence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opens his mouth to speak. \"There you two are!\" Zelda shouts as she waddles over to the pair. Panting as she approaches them she stops to begin to catch her breathe. \"Why did you two just wander off and leave me! Do you have any idea how foolish and dangerous that is!\" Zelda angrily chides the pair. Before taking a deep breathe and calming herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Zelda I had to speak with my husband about a private matter. It's not like you are in any danger. Seriously there is no threat. I mean her stomach acid's don't even burnt. This place is boring.\" She mutters stomping her foot into the squishy belly floor as she says this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's right eye twitches ever so slightly. \"You do realize that our shrinking spell has a time limit, right?\" She asks shaking her head. \"So it's not me you are putting in danger but Malon! Since I seem. To be struggling to cast my teleportation spell I am going to have to recast the shrine don't regrow inside her! I needn't remind you of the disastrous consequences of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto was going to respond. I mean Zelda had a solid point. However her words stopped dead in her tracks when she noticed that Zelda was now glowing blue. \"Uhhh... Zelda... Why are you glowing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked down at her arms and saw the strange blue glow around her. Her eyes widened in a slight panic. This was definitely not good.</span></div></div>",

She shook her head in an attempt to regain her bearings but that only made the sensation worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rested her hands on the table to steady herself. She groaned as her vision began to fade. Casting a spell was a big mistake. As all this happened the red aura that had surrounded her seemed to shrink into her stomach. All the while a blue aura began to grow out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was suffering from similar effects. Ruto rushed over to support her friend. \"Zelda what the hell is happening to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get any response as Zelda began to fade from conciseness. The blue aura that had surrounded Zelda's body slowly began sink into Malon's stomach. While a red aura seemed to emerge from the walls and attach itself to Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slowly seeped into Zelda's body as the last bit of conciseness faded from her. Ruto and Link could only look at their friend in concern. Link rushed over and checked to see if Zelda still had a heartbeat and to his relief she did indeed. \"Well what do we do now...\" Link mutters looking over to his wife who could only shrug in response. \"Well hopefully she comes to before the two of us make a rather messy departures from Malon's innards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs those words left her lips elda began to stir. Causing the married couple to sigh in relief. Link kneeled next to Zelda. \"Are you feeling okay Zelda?\" He asked with concern in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda blinked a few times looking up at Link. Confusion taking over her features. She began to glance around. \"Where are we? What... Why do I sound so weird?\" Zelda says placing a hand to her multiple chins. Only then does she seemingly notice the gloves on her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and Ruto exchange a confused look before looking back to Malon. \"Zelda... Are you feeling okay?\" Link asks. Staring at the Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looks up at Link. She blinks a few times. \"Fairy boy... What are you talking about. I'm not Zelda. It's me Malon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and Ruto exchange another set of confused looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Malon's stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon slowly opened her eyes blinking a few times. \"Wh-where am I...\" She glances around the library. Before biting her lip. \"Oh no... This isn't good...\" SHe mutters rising up to her full her height. She looked around and spotted a nearby mirror. Rushing over as fast as her weight would allow. She looked into and uttered a silent curse. The face that looked back at her was indeed Malon's. Just as she feared. The once Princess now farm girl could only curse her fate. Before placing both her hands on her stomach. \"They are still inside... Me... I don't have much time. This is so typical of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthors note: Why hello everyone. I couldn't resist doing a good old fashioned body swap. While having an exciting *as much as my garbage writing allows* Endo adventure/race against the clock.. Thing... Ehhh. Anywho so there is no confusion *oh there will be confusion* I want to inform you how I tend towards writing body swap stories. Basically I like to write the body of the person over the soul. So basically Malon in Zelda's body will be referred to as Zelda and Zelda in Malon's body will be referred to as Malon. My reasoning being that it helps me visualize the body swap better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnywho I hope you enjoy. The exits are that way for the emergency escape you all are probably looking to do!</span></div></div>",

Link entered the Scientists house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there young man!\" The scientist greeted him cheerfully. \"You'l never guess what I found out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink sat down. \"Have you noticed anything wierd the times the queen has had to go? felt anything unusual?\" The scientist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well.. no\" Link said. \"Except for maybe one thing..\" Link continiued: \"The smell! Well... it doesn't smell good, but it doesn't smell bad either. It's not what you'd expect feces would smell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a clever boy!\" The scientist smiled. \"I ran a few tests and in the end I discovered that the feces acctually contains very small amounts of blood, which explains if she ever gets tired or exhausted when she has to go. The blood, meanwhile, contains a high estrogen-level who radiates out a scent which is somewhat of an aphrodisiac. I think this is acctually a way for Zora females to attract a male Zora they desire who may or may not desire the Zora female in return. Sence you can smell it to, it might have a small effect on young humans to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An aphrodisiac?\" Link thought \"Ruto has had a crush on me once. But she seems far to uncomfortable when having to go so she probably doesn't know of this\" Link wondered if any Zora at all knew of this. After all.. The zoras didn't posess anything near the technology the scientist did.</span></div></div>",

Link touched the orb, which turned out to be rubbery...and blubberly.  This confused Link to no end;  there wasn't a person big enough to cover Zora's Domain.  Suddenly, A Zora shot  out  of the blubber; A Zora that was wearing a chef's hat.  The Zora gasped for breath and he noticed Link and Malon standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Um..hello\" said Malon, who never saw a Zora before.  \"what's all this?\" She pointed to the mountain of blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Queen Ruto\" said the Zora.  \"the bigger our ruler is, the more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"THAT'S RUTO?!\" asked Link in disbelief.  \"what did she eat to get that big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Pretty much anything\" said the Zora.  \"she even ate Lord Jabu-Jabu after she ate her second helping...and she's still hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             \"You're joking\" said Malon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          \"No I'm not\" said the Zora.  \"she ate all of the other Zoras too...I escaped when she wasn't looking at me...I swam through her blubber...We Zora can hold our breath for a really long time...but I thought I would be a goner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           <br>\r\n  ************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 After Ruto had finished off her second helping, she noticed that she was right next to Lord Jabu-Jabu himself.  Jabu-Jabu looked like a mere worm to the gigantic Ruto.  It was then when Ruto remembered a legend that was passed down by the Zora;  if someone should eat Lord Jabu-Jabu, then that person would  become a god.  Ruto didn't really believe in that legend, she was just hungry.  So she ate Lord Jabu-Jabu in one gulp.  <br>\r\n           \"Enjoy my stomach, Like I enjoyed yours\" chuckled Ruto, patting her great girth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      ************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"What do we do now, Fairy boy?\" asked Malon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Link thought about what to do, and came up with an answer.  </span></div></div>",

She couldn't move that fast, but that didn't stop her.  The hunger she was now feeling was overpowering;  it overrode her senses.  She was out of her mind with hunger, and she would eat anything and everything that came across her path...which was what happened to a small caravan on its way to Hyrule Castle Town.  She gulped down the entire caravan in one quick swallow.   Ruto used her Sage powers to lift the caravan up and over her wide-open mouth and dropped them inside.   Despite what she had eaten so far, she was still hungry.  She could feel the struggles of her Zora subjects within her...faintly.  Ruto was heading towards Hyrule Castle itself.   The castle looked like a cake to Ruto, and it would be the biggest meal that she had so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              Link, Malon and Zelda watched as the gigantic Ruto headed for the castle.

Almost at once, Malon started to grow both in height and weight (but mostly height).  10, 20, 30 feet she grew, and on she grew.   Malon could see Link now and Lon Lon Ranch beyond...and she could see Ruto now.  Ruto was almost to the castle now.   Malon reached the height of Ruto...and continued to grow!    Zelda looked puzzled and looked back at the spell in the book.  She had cast it right...she had made no mistakes.   She read on while Malon was continuing to grow...easily towering over the massive Ruto.  Malon was glad that she was now bigger than Ruto...but she was worried over how much bigger she'll get.   As Malon grew in height, her weight increased...but not all that much.  Ruto might've outweighed her in the pounds department, but Malon had height on her side.  Malon continued to grow until she was 1,500 feet tall.  Her clothes had grown with her,  and her boots nearly covered all of Hyrule Field.  <br>\r\n                  \"Well...I'm one heck of a distraction..\" said Malon.  \"Hey, Ruto!  Why don't you pick on someone that's bigger than you?\"<br>\r\n                   Ruto, who had been about to eat Hyrule Castle Town, looked up at the new giantess in Hyrule.

As she did so, Zelda caught glimpses of other spells that had been lost for thousands of years.<br>\r\n                  The spellbook that Zelda was now holding was as old as Hyrule itself.  According to legend, the goddess Din gave the spell book to the first king of Hyrule.  Why she did this was not made clear, but it was clear that the book held many spells that were only known to the gods.   The book had the emblem of the Triforce on its leather cover.    One of the spells that Zelda glimpsed was a spell that could make you into a god...but now wasn't the time to look up useless spells.  Hyrule was at stake.  She found the shrinking spell, and started to get ready to cast it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The wall of blue was a good 300 foot tall, and it was too soft to be climbed.  With nothing left to do, Link decided to try to climb as high as the soft blue wall to see over it....but where was a good place to observe this strange wall?  The only thing big enough to let Link get high enough to look over the blue wall would be the Spirit Temple in the Gerudo desert....if the wall did indeed covered half of Hyrule, it would be easy to spot from the Spirit Temple.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the period of an entire week, ruto had eaten as much as possible. And it seemed like her body was always frantically trying to decide where to put all the new weight she was gaining every time she finished a feast. Sometimes the weight went mostly somewhere, like to her already massive ass, or maybe two places, like her belly and thighs. After a couple of days, however, most of it started to constantly go to her chest. \"Mmm, look at how huge they've gotten!\" Ruto exclaimed, feeling her brests in all their jiggly round glory. Needless to say, pleanty of fat went to the rest of her body as well. She had to constantly sit down due to her size, with her belly always squashed between her massive boobs and gargantuan thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer previously ginormous stomach had become huge, forming a fat, wide lower roll that rested on her hips and buldged constantly. Her upper roll was not quite as large, but it was very soft and squishy like the rest of her, and was permanantly supporting her breasts, which now bloated further out than her entire stomach. Her naval was so deep, an exploration team would be lost trying to explore it. Her love handles had become engulfed in pure fat, becoming round and jiggling when she moved, and they connected to her giant hips, which had grown even wider to acommadate her ass and thighs. Her thighs were huge and doughy, and the blubber that engulfed them spread out when she sat down, wide and jiggling when she tried to move herself. Her ass had expanded with it's own fair share of fat, and was spread out so round and plump when she was sitting that it looked like two giant mountains of calories. She loved how huge it had become, and would slap it and wait for it to stop jiggling, which could take forever given her size. Her skin, though encompassed with fat all around, was constantly soft and tight, packed full with the calories from past meals (and a giant fish). She loved feeling herself, testing how smooth she was everywhere, never finding any lumps or dips in the plush, tightly packed surface of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the matter of her breasts. They had grown so huge and round, each extending longer and wider than the rest of her with plush, rippling fat. They were plumper than the rest of her, and continued to grow as she ate. They were so plump that Ruto began to worry they would start to droop down the sides of her belly where she couldn't reach, she ordered her entire staff of servants to fashion her something to support them. They worked while she ate, estimating what her future size would be by the time they would be finished with it so that it would fit her. It took hours of non stop work, but with the effort they put in, it was finished in 48 hours. It took many servents to lift her heaving breasts, constantly trying not to sink too deep into her belly as they stood on it for support. When they had finnaly gotten the cloth over her chest, it was an ear perfect fit. A bit loose, actually. Ruto loved the blue fabric they used, and hoped that it would keep her gargantuan tits from drooping. She knew however that at the rate she was eating, it wouldn't be a loose fit forever. The \"bra\" fitted around the circumference of her bosom as well as underneath her growing breasts. It was always showing off her deep cleavage and the bulk of her boobs. It wrapped around her underarms and back, using her girth to support the globular orbs of flesh and fat they contained. She loved jiggling them and watching them try to escape the confines of the \"bra\". She could lift them barely, only enough before they engulfed her pudgy hands with soft plushy breastfat and she would be forced to release them. She was so happy now that her chest was the biggest part of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the week, she gained many pounds, and her breasts still took most of the weight for themselves. The cloth had begun to feel much less loose, and was a perfect fit soon enough. However, after a few more days, it became tight, and the fat of her breasts started to buldge upward and over the hem of her \"bra\" as she gained weight. Days went by, each bringing the bulge of her fat tits farther and tighter over the hem. She liked how it looked, as tight as it was. Stretch lines formed as her bosom grew bigger, tightening the fabric that was holding then together. Whenever she moved, they would jiggle and ripple with motion in the most arousing way, showing or not only their immense bulk, but also their softness and squishiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do now?\" Ruto thought to herself. \"If I keep eating, my boobs will grow even larger, and I may need to have this clothing resized.\" Looking around, she wondered if she could still stand up, and what she would look like standing with all her expanding blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to...</span></div></div>",

Ruto had obviously gotten taller in order to distribute her weight properly, but not by that much. She drank the potion, licked her plump lips, and tried to get up. She got off her ass, and her entire body wobbled as it happened. she balanced herself, then walked outside of the zora's domain. however, each step only caused her body to jiggle violently, her breasts especially given their gargantuan size, and each step created a small scale earthquake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" ruto sighed. she thought to herself, did she really want to be this fat? as she jiggled with each movement made, no matter how small. eventally, she made up her mind and decided she would work the weight off. A seemingly impossible feat for someone of her size, nevertheless she was determined to lose weight. over the next week, her servants climbed to her breasts in order to convert the cloth holing them into a \"sports bra\" type of cover.

I could never allow your people to be targets for the issues within my kingdom. Farewell your majesty.\" said Link as he made his way to the door. The King, the guards, and all the other Zora subjects in the room were disappointed that Link did not accept the offer. Ruto was more affected since she had been rejected by Link twice now.

We all know how mush the princess loves this outsider and is currently heart broken, which gives us an opportunity. People tend to eat more while depressed so perhaps now maybe an ideal time to start increasing how much she eats. Since she depressed, we can cook delicious foods to cheer her up. Then we'll slowly increase the amount of food she eats. Soon she'll adapt to a new eating system and start to gain enough weight to satisfy the kingdom.\" said the adviser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this adviser had a great plan, another adviser disagreed and said \"That won't work! The princess isn't a fool, she'll realize we're fattening her up. She won't be happy if we just trick her into being the proper size of Zora royalty. We must make her accept her fate by bring Link back here. I say the boy doesn't realize how important this is. He's still in our kingdom, so we can catch him before he leaves. Once we do catch him we will find a way to convince him to love the princess, even if it requires <b>drastic measures</b>. Once he accepts our proposal the princess will be happy to indulge in food and become the queen she's destined to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the advisers had good strategies on dealing with this situation, but the King had to pick one of these plans.

Malon looked down and to her surprise found a very large stomach blocking her view of the ground. \"Oh my goddesses!\" Malon screamed. She stared at her stomach for awhile before grabbing it to see if it was real or if she was just imagining things. Her stomach felt soft and squishy, and she realized that it wasn't just her imagination. It was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon ran, well, waddled as fast as she could to the closest mirror and gasped at what she saw. Her face was now much rounder, with big cheeks and a large double chin. Her stomach spilled out from her body, and was easily at least the size of an octorock. Her breasts, which had already been quite big to begin with, had doubled in size, and lay atop her large stomach. Her arms were much rounder then when she had sat down for breakfast, and got bigger and bigger the closer they got to her body. Her legs now pushed against each other, each now trying to take up the same space. Last but not least, her butt had nearly tripled in size, and now stuck out from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Malon continued to look over her body in disbelief, out of the corner of her eye she noticed a dark figure hidden in the shadows. \"Who are you?\" She asked as she turned to face the figure. The person started to laugh in a dark and sadistic manner, and immediately Malon realized who it was. \"Ganondorf!\" she cried. \"Hello farm girl.\" the Gerudo said as he stepped out from the shadowy corner of the room. \"What do you want?\" Malon asked. \"I notice you've put on a few pounds since this morning.\" He responded. \"I wonder what it was that caused that?\" he pondered with an evil grin on his face. \"It was you!\" Malon answered. \"You're the one who caused me to turn into this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, such a clever girl.\" He replied. \"But, I wonder, what would \"Fairy Boy\" think of you if he was you like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairy Boy! What will he think of me now?\" Malon asked as a single tear fell from her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can change you to how you once were.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. But, I'll need you to do something for me first.\" Ganondorf said, that evil grin once again gracing his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help Ganondorf, he's evil!\" Malon thought to herself. \"But I don't want Fairy Boy to see me like this! What should I do?\"</span></div></div>",

Petite.\" As his grin grew, Malon's face dropped. \"Obviously a growing girl like yourself needs some encouragement to fully bloom!\" Taking a few steps backwards, he beckons at the table, suddenly overflowing with a wide manner of Malon's favorite sweet goodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Malon scoffed. \"Not like I have to eat that stuff! Besides, I can work all this off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanondorf chortled, and as you would guess, it was fully with malicious intent. \"Work all that off? Besides barely being able to move...

Several of them panicked, but nonetheless remained seated. \"This is no trivial concern\" said the captain of the guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon hobbled up the staircase, finding the stairs more difficult to climb than usual. Zelda and the Captain followed her, both being careful to not stare at her crotch which was visible due to her undersized dress. Zelda asked her about what had happened, and Malon told her of how she grew in size, how Ganondorf appeared, and his offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda thought for a moment, then ordered the Captain to quickly dispose of the milk crates. She realised if he had a plan, it must have been something to do with them. \"Malon, return home as if nothing strange has happened. Hopefully he will make good on his promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon rode her horse-and-empty cart back to the ranch, and put the kettle on. She sat down on her bed and hoped that everything would work out perfectly fine, her bed creaking as she moved even the slightest. She tried to keep perfectly still, as the sound was getting on her nerves. She was tired from all the work combined with her new form. Her father was still not home, and she was worried yet about her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kettle boiled and she got up. The thought of tea relaxed her, even if only a little. As she picked up the kettle, a dark figure appeared in the corner of her eye. He nodded at you with his menacing look. \"Well done. I heartily thank you, from the bottom of my heart. You met with the princess, as I asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you mean..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to make good on my promise. I shall \"remove your rather noticable weight.\"\" He grinned. What was he planning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed her, with his impressive strength, and a blue light shone from his hand to her body. She could feel herself being lighter as his arms struggled less to carry her. She was feeling glad that she was doing so well after disobeying the King of Evil. At last, she had gotten what she wanted... Or had she? Her body was feeling very weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling lighter, yet?\" he laughed, as her body started to feel <i>floaty</i>. Her arms drifted around by a small draught through the window. \"Now you weigh nothing.\" He bent over, and blew on her face. She floated back a few feet. She looked at her body. She no longer looked overweight, but her body looked transparant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to float back at him, but he merely blew again, and she was launched against the wall. Her gaseous body prevented her from being hurt, but the helplessness of the situation almost made her burst into tears.</span></div></div>",

She once again hid her face with her chest, and turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda spoke up. \"Let me speak with her in private. Head up the stairs on your right.\" Malon was somewhat comforted by her words, and followed her upstairs. The room had a simple oaken table with a series of almost melted candles on its top. Emily was also there, though Malon didn't really care so much. Zelda noticed Malon's increased physique and realised that it may have been her problem. She had seen her several times when she was younger, though they had never directly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened at the farm in which you work?\" Zelda questioned. \"Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I guess,\" was Malon's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't like this before, were you?\" Zelda asked, straight to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Malon tensed up by this, and prepared to leave. Did Zelda know. Had she known all this time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The times that we live in, our era, may be suffering turmoil, but don't let that get the better of you. Eating too much can have awful consequenses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon breathed a sigh of relief, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know what it was until it happened. She burped very loudly, a pungeant odor (something like clotted milk) filling the room. Her head began to spin, and lost her balance. Zelda and Emily called out, amidst her sickness, but no one came. No one heeded her pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon looked up as the dizziness ceased, and saw Zelda and Emily now at a large size. Zelda's dress bursted at the seams, confused and wondering what had happened. Her dress hardly contained her swollen bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon realised the milky outburst had caused it. Not knowing what to do, she walked out of the castle. The people of the castle looked as if they had passed out, though the milky odor did not reach the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanondorf marched in. \"I am an honest man, I shall return you.\" He handed her a bottle of a weird liquid, which she drunk. It wasn't like she was in any position to refuse. Sure enough, it worked. While heer dress retained the stretchmarks, she was once again her fit self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a great job. Perhaps I may have further use for you.\" He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to her?\" She cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Join me, and you shall find out,\" he said, looking back at the castle. \"You will be greatly rewarded.\"</span></div></div>",

Naturally, I have the Triforce of Power.\" He showed her the triangular mark on the back of her hand. \"Zelda has Wisdom, as she is the wisest in the kingdom.

When she becomes an idiot again, the Triforce of Wisdom shall be forfeited to whom defeats her in a test of wisdom. Now do you understand, my red haired servant? What I did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon was amazed that he had such power to steal ones wisdom, but she had another question on her mind. \"But then, why did the gas make her so fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGannondorf had an answer to that, as well. \"So I may kidnap her with ease. The milk you delivered was not in fact milk, but a cursed liquid made to force the castle's staff into a sleep.

We must first find the princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon led him up to the princess' room, and found her comforting Emily, sitting in a chair. She looked up, and pointed at Malon. \"You... You did this to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanondorf revealed himself. \"A fine guess, but only half-right.\" He picked her up with his massive arms, and looked at her bloated body. He hurled a jinx at Emily, knocking her unconsious. He picked her up, wrapping his right arm around Zelda and his left around Emily. He managed to join both hands together at great difficutly, due to their bulging bellies. Zelda expressed great discomfort and embarrassment at being squished against an obese lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You betrayed me!\" Zelda cried out. Malon remained silent at this, but didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, onto the next part of my plan,\" Ganondorf announced, in Zelda's presence to torment her, \"The third piece of the Triforce, Courage. Link, the Hero of Time has it. To obtain it, we must terrify him. But, this bold boy has faced onslaughts of armies without breaking a sweat. That's where you come in.\" He turned to Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must approach him as an old friend. Meet him with a smile. Reminisce about old times, if you wish. Then... you turn on him.\" He handed her a small vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink it,\" he boomed to Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vial tasted of rotting cabbages, and she was reminded of a time during a bad harvest. It almost made her threw up, but she was determined for success. It made her buttocks feel all rubbery and expand, she worried that she was expanding again. No such bad fortune however, Ganondor clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body is just changing. Of course, it is reversible, should you like. Your body... or just your lower half is reshaping to that of a spider. Your rear is becoming your new abdomen and sternum. You shall become a spider-lady, with spinarets and all. Your upper body shall remain the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda watched her diabolical transformation with fear in her eyes. \"You sick, sordid fool. Do you really think Link will fall for such a weak ruse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly? Yes,\" Malon laughed, as her body rushes with euphoria with her four additional limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link should arrive in the castle after all the commotion. That's when you shall strike. Meet me at the top of Death Mountain when you are done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my King,\" she answered, and headed over to the front of the castle. She was worried about how much she had changed under fear. She was working for the King of Evil. She dismissed it, telling herself that such thoughts will only impede her, and waited at the front of the castle. She had hid her body by standing inside a house and looking through the window. Her legs covered most the room, she had entered with some difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, a green, hooded figure rode in on a red horse toward the castle at great speed with a solemn look on his face.

She bit into link's neck, injecting the venom. She then used her spinnerets to encase him in a web caccoon to keep him safe for his transformation. Malon then had a descision, wait for link to transform or go strait to ganondorf.</span></div></div>",

Though it felt more like a nightmare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was sunrise though, so Malon got up to go about her daily chores. Feed the cucoos and collect eggs, slop the hogs, feed and milk the cows... The typical farmgirl stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first it was time for breakfast. She got some bacon, eggs, and... were these spiderwebs always there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's our little farm girl doing? Sleeping well?\" a sinister voice came from behind Malon, or rather what seemed to be a sinister voice in unison with that of a familiar woman's voice. She turned to find the source, only to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this!? Who are you!?\" her counterpart seemed to laugh wickedly, only now did Malon notice the red eyes and the giant spider she sat upon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, surely you recognize yourself! You've looked into mirrors before, afterall~\" She chuckled, petting the spider she used as her seat. \"Atleast the part of you who embraced being a servant Ganondorf. You're objections were getting annoying so I showed you a stupid nightmare where we suddenly gained hideous looking fangs that and link was a total pansey, then trapped you here in our own subconscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon paused for a moment, this was a lot to take in, even if the news came from herself. Though that last statement confused her the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trapped? But I'm not... why can't I move all of a sudden? it feels... tight?\" Looking down, she only now realized her body was stuck in a stringy coating, in the middle of a giant web \"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you're no longer busy, just sit and enjoy the show I'll put on for you. I'll let you watch as I scare our beloved fairyboy and take his piece of the triforce.\" as the dark half said this, a projection of what Malon could see in the waking world, complete with a ceiling view of Link entering the abandoned house. \"Bye-bye~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evil half faded away as she re-entered consciousness without her innocent side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon had engaged Link in combat. Although mildly startled, he wasn't scared by her sudden jump from the ceiling. The battle took a while, but it seemed to end when Link pointed his blade in the face of the spider torso'd girl as sh layed backside to the floor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Link Is that you?\" tears welled up in her eyes, surprising the hero. Was she being controlled? Forced to do this against her will? Could he really kill his friend? His sword was lowered as he worried she might really be in trouble... then she flipped their positions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just kidding! You're weaker than I thought!\" With one of her pointy legs jabbed down to the hero's torso, it stopped just short of piercing as she began laughing. Link had put an arm in front of his face so he didn't have to see someone he held close end his life, fearful of her betrayal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd cower out when it came to finishing off a dear friend. And now that you've shown fear, I'll be taking the Triforce of Courage!\" Laying defeated, Link couldn't even bring himself to look at Malon. The shame was too great. His had glowed to show his piece of the Trifoce, before fading, soon the same glowing image appeared on the redheaded spider's hand and she laughed wickedly. \"So long, would be hero. I have a master to return to~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling to herself, she wasn't truely planning on leaving him behind. She'd send someone to retrieve him later, as it was clear he wouldn't be going anywhere anytime soon. But first, she'd go to her master atop Death Mountain.</span></div></div>",

Thin was supposed to be sexier wasn't it?  \"She's been busy trying to smooth relations with the Hylians and the Gerudo.

Yes, there was quite a few Hylians that had fallen in love with the all-female race but there was still tremendous distrust between the two peoples.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yes, I heard of the difficulties my people have been going through\" said Nabooru, grabbing another turkey leg and ravenously ate it with gusto.

Love was something that didn't exist for him; there was no time for love when you're saving an entire kingdom.  When he met Nabooru as a child it was like love at first sight.  There was something about Nabooru that was irresistible to Link.  When he had later met her as an adult, Link found her ten times more alluring.  In fact all the Gerudo women had that alluring effect on the males of Hyrule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I could be with my sage powers\" said Nabooru as she kissed Link more deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Sage powers?\" asked Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"It took the seven of us to seal up Ganondorf\" said Nabooru. \"What do you think just one of us can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Link shrugged.  He didn't knew the extent of the Sages power.  They had a great deal of magical powers, obviously, but they weren't on par with gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Actually there's a secret Gerudo technique that's fallen out of favor for at least a century\" said Nabooru.  \"It was quite popular with the last Gerudo king\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"And what's that?\" asked Link, feeling Nabooru's sexy body up and down with his skilled hands.

The real meal is this way\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Nabooru led Link down a long hallway to what clearly was a banquet hall.  In it there were at least a dozen tables all piled with foods of all kinds.  Link's mouth fell open in awe as he looked around at all the food.  There was a sizable throne big enough for ten people that were Nabooru's size.  The hall was also filled with plenty of hot Gerudo women which were all thin for the most part.   At the far end of the hall Link recognized one of the offspring of the carpenter he had once saved from the Gerudo.  <br>\r\n                \"You can help yourself with as much food as you want\" said Nabooru.  \"I prefer to have well-fed servants unlike other rulers I know\" <br>\r\n            Link wondered who was Nabooru referring to.  He recalled no such ruler in Hyrule.  <br>\r\n            \"Who are you talking aboyt?\" asked Link .<br>\r\n            \"You mean you haven't heard?\" asked Nabooru .<br>\r\n             \"I've been far too busy to hear much gossip\" said Link. Nabooru nodded vaguely.<br>\r\n            \"If the rumors are true then Ruto has turned into quite the greedy eater\" said Nabooru.  \"But enough about her for now.  Help yourself......or feed me directly.  It's your choice\". With that Nabooru waddled to the throne and started to eat like she hadn't eaten for days.  Link sat down on a chair near the throne and started to eat.   The food was really good.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       A few minutes went by in silence when the leader of the caravan wandered into the banquet hall.   Before Link could react the caravan leader was almost immediately noticed by one of the Gerudo servants .  The two then went to a distant corner of the hall and started to make out.  Link blushed and averted his eyes.  His eyes fell on Nabooru who smiled at him as she ate.   <br>\r\n              Link soon lost interest in eating food.  It might've been because of an unknown spell or it might've been the subtle magic that all Gerudo females had on males.  In  the end it really didn't matter why Link had stopped eating and focused all of his attention on Nabooru while she devoured plate after plate of food.  Soon Link climbed out of his chair and, as if in a trance, wandered over to Nabooru.<br>\r\n            \"Couldn't resist coming over to me?\" asked Nabooru.  <br>\r\n             Link silently shook his head no.  </span></div></div>",

'I'm glad the Tribe is doing so well, but they should be a little more enthusiastic about things'  Zelda thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the Queen's room, it was obvious that Princess Zelda had definitely gained some weight, though not quite as much as Nabooru.  She looked fairly chubby and she had developed a slightly pear shape.  Her dress hugged her generous hips, and her royal booty could be seen outlined against the rear of her dress.  Her pretty face had grown a bit softer, and her middle had started to thicken.  At about 165 pounds, she was chunky, but had not really come to terms with the fact that she had put on a few.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened when she saw Nabooru, especially her potbelly, which was quite round.  The 200 pound ruler of the Gerudo smiled as she stood up from her pile of cushions and walked towards Zelda, her tummy jiggling with each step.  She continued to dress in her old outfits, which meant it was easy to see the Gerudo queen's own generous hips and thighs through the diaphonous material of her pants, though most of her weight was carried in the middle.  As the plump rulers embraced, Nabooru spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad to see you Princess Zelda!  You are looking healthy and good, yes!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Queen Nabooru... you are, uh, looking very pretty.\"  Zelda giggled nervously.  This was true though; Nabooru's face had gotten puffier, but it was still beautiful, with her dark eyes, full lips and long red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, the tribe is doing very well!  And when they do well, so do I!\"  Nabooru grinned as she said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's obvious' Zelda thought to herself.  Then she remembered, \"I brought two more caravans of Hylian food, as my gift to you, Queen Nabooru.  They are unloading them now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru's face lit up.  \"Oooh, many thanks Princess!  Your gift is much appreciated. May I call you Zelda?

As soon as Nabooru mentioned food, she felt a hunger pang of her own. \"Oh yes, some food would be lovely, please,\" the blonde Hylian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru mentioned for Zelda to take a seat on a large collection of pillows next to her's, as the queen's personal servants start to bring food out.  There were platters over a plump desert bird, as well as traditional Hylian ducks and chickens, but cooked with different sauces unique to the tribe.  Zelda's eyes widened as more and more plates were brought out, but she was too hungry to question.  She dug right in, selecting a thick slab of meat, and eating it quickly. \"Delicious!\" She stated, and Nabooru grinned at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru, for her part, was gorging even more quickly than Zelda, greedily eating chicken legs and turkey breasts.  It was easy to understand how the queen had grown so plump, with her gluttonous appetite.  As soon as she finished one plate, she motioned for another to be brought to her.  \"Mmmph, ith sthooo good, ishn't it, Jelda?\" Nabooru said with her cheeks bulging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda just nodded and continued to stuff herself silly with all the tasty meat platters that were available.  Eventually she realized that she was more than full, and leaned back on the pillows with a sigh.  She hoped Nabooru hadn't noticed her indulging liked that.  When she looked over at the tanned desert queen, her eyes bugged out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru was still going full tilt through an enormous stuffed bird.  Her potbelly looked taut and bloated from all she consumed, and there was a large pile of empty trays next to her.  Zelda watched in awe as Nabooru continued to make a pig out of herself for some time, and then eventually leaned back herself, patting her full tummy with a satisfied look on her face. \"Urrrrrrpp!\" she belched loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was very good,\" Zelda couldn't help but to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you saved room for dessertm,\"  Nabooru said, and licked her lips...</span></div></div>",

Tradionally the gerudo gave any important guest a plate of local sweets. To refuse it would be a great insult and so she acepted the fact that she would have to shove a few more bites into her growing gullet. She watched as nabooru swallowed a few more small cakes before pickin up slices of the large cake and eating it all. Zelda watched wide eyed as Nabooru ate the entire cake in less than a few minutes before a large plate was dropped in front of her piled high with every sweet that was thrown across the tables. She gulped, she should have known that this would happen given the increased appetite of the gerudo people. She grimaced as she began putting food into her mouth. Across the table Nabooru grinned as she shoveled more food into her large bloated stomach.<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before before it was all finished.

When she arrives, it looks like Nabooru has already been stuffing her greedy face for quite some time.  The desert ruler looks up and says \"Mmrf, good morming  Zelda sister, please join me for *braaap* breakfast.\"  With that, Nabooru goes back to gorging herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stares around at all the food available.  There are plates piled high with sausage links, mountains of eggs, cheesy omelets, crisp bacon from the Hylian stores she brought with her.  After her over-indulgence last night, Zelda still feels a bit full, and not particularly hungry.  But after getting herself comfortable among all the pillows making up her seat, and smelling the bacon wafting through the room, she leans over to snag a piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the blonde princess finds herself trying a little of this, and some of that.  Rasberry danishes and powdered donuts pass her lips as well as sausage and eggs.  After 40 minutes of hedonistic enjoyment, she leans back contentedly full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru has continued to glut herself throughout this time, eating noisily and occasionally letting out a loud belch.  For the next 2 hours, as Zelda digests her food, she watches with some disgust as Nabooru messily eats more and more, stuffing greasy sausages and omelets with melted cheese into her face.  Plate after plate is brought to her, and when she finishes one, she tosses it to the side and impatiently motions for another. Finally, her plump face covered in grease and ketchup, Nabooru belches, and then farts loudly.  \"Ahhh... that was a -hiccup- good breakfast. What do you say we talk privately after a brief -urrrrrppp- nap?\"  Licking her fingers, Nabooru, rests her head against one of her cushions, and almost immediately starts snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral weeks of similar events pass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several weeks passed as Zelda stayed as a guest at the Gerudo fortress.  She spent most of this time with Nabooru, mostly just hanging out and talking.  At first they spent alot of times walking around and looking around the renovated Temple, or checking in with the other Gerudo.  But after a while, Nabooru only wanted to spend more and more time eating.  Despite this, Nabooru asked Zelda to extend her stay longer to \"continue strenghthening their bonds\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, as the weeks went by, Nabooru seemed to become lazier and lazier.  She rarely  could be bothered to pay attention to her royal duties, and left them all to her advisors.  The female guards were all getting noticeably out of shape, and were not training very hard, but Nabooru didn't say anything.  She was more considered with herself, and keeping herself fed.  This took up more and more of her time, and eventually, most of the time she didnt spend sleeping (which had also gone from a normal 8 hours to a languid 12 hours a day sleeping or napping).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the day before Zelda was supposed to return to Hyrule, Nabooru wanted to have a huge feast to celebrate with her \"sister\".  It was supposed to start in the morning.  Zelda got up a bit late and, worried she had offended her host, hurried to the main room.  But Nabooru was apparently sleeping in as usual, and didn't wake up until noon.  When she finally waddled in, Zelda almost gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe months of over-indulgence had taken a heavy toll on the desert queen.  At over 400 pounds, she had nearly doubled in size since Zelda had arrived.  Her once pretty face had become swollen, with round cheeks, over-plumped lips, and a triple chin.  Her already large breasts had become massive, the size of watermelons, but they had also become quite hefty, and had begun sagging down.  They were spilling out of a tank top that had been made for her two weeks ago, but was already inadequate.  Her pants weren't faring any better, and had actually begun to split from the size of her gigantic, dimpled ass cheeks.  The thighs of her thick legs rubbed together as she walked.  But by far, most of the weight had ended up in her enormous belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now sported a truly massive paunch, hanging over the front of her pants, most of the way to her knees, and jutting out two feet in front of her.  Her tank top rode up completely, revealing her vast tan gut, which her breasts were currently sloping down off of.  Thick love handles spilled over her sides, and forced her meaty arms to rest at a slight angle outward.  She moved extremely slowly towards the growing pile of cushions she needed to rest on, sweat glistening on her face and chest.  Zelda could hear Nabooru's short, ragged breaths, even though this room was at most 30 feet from her bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce seated, the obese ruler lay there for several moments, trying to catch her breath.  \"Good morning *hunh* Zelda.  Are you.. ready to *pant* celebrate?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, of course, Nabooru.  Uhhh... are you sure you are up to it?\"  Zelda had put on quite a few pounds herself during this time.  But not anywhere near the 200 pounds Nabooru had gained.  Princess Zelda was now a fat 210 pounds, with most of the weight continuing to go into her increasingly wide bottom, though she had now grown a noticeable potbelly herself.  All of her dresses had to be re-tailored to contain her, and some days she wore some of Nabooru's older clothes (though they were mostly too large in the chest and waist, and a bit tight in the rear).  With all the food around, and constant feasting, Zelda might have put on more, but she occasionally continued to take walks herself.  She was also a bit put off by the way Nabooru messily over-ate constantly.  Zelda didn't think it was a good idea for a ruler to make such a greedy pig of oneself in front of subjects or guests.  But Zelda was too polite to say anything to Nabooru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I *urp* am...\" the redhead replied, licking her overly full lips in anticipation of the coming feast.  Then she lazily waved one thick arm, and dozens of servants began bringing food in to the two rulers.  Nabooru greedily grabbed the first thing brought to her, a large tray of meat resting in a thick gravy.  She grabbed one slice and dangled it above her mouth, causing the dripping gravy to spill on her cushions, top, and cleavage before shoving the whole thing in her mouth and reaching for another.  Her other hand grabbed a slice of chocolate cake from a tray that had been set down nearby.  She stuffed the whole thing in her mouth, smearing chocolate across her face in the process.  \"Mmrrf, sho good,\" she mumbled, then went back to alternating between meat and cake.  Occasionally she would take long droughts from a jug of thick, honey tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda did her best to ignore the queen's gluttony, and enjoy the food herself.  As usual, the plump Hylian was quickly caught up in the delicious food, and ended up eating far more than she intended to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the afternoon wore on, Zelda took a break, as she had become more than uncomfortably full.  She had eaten more than usual and had to stop.  She looked over at the bloated Nabooru, who was still shoveling food in her fat face.  She was a complete mess, with food smeared all over her face.  Large glops of chocolate had fallen into her bountiful cleavage.  Occasionally she would stop to belch loudly, or let a fart rip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the evening, she had slowed down a bit, and her breathing had become slow and labored.  New dishes continued to be brought in, everything from bacon and sausage, to pies, burritos and whole chickens and turkeys. Zelda got a second wind, but it didn't last long.  Mostly she just picked a piece off here and there to nibble on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*UUURRRRPPP* ishn't thish .... sho *wheeze* good Zelda?\"  Nabooru gasped in between bites from a large burito.  It was the second plate of 12 she had cleared off.  Just then, the lazy Gerudo farted several times.  \"More!\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Zelda replied, though she hadnt gotten a chance at any of them.  She eyed Nabooru's vast girth, filled to bursting with all the junky foods she had eaten that day, and covered with bits of food.  \"Maybe I should be leaving now though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All that was required to see the queen was a donation of food, or a recipe. The more fattening, the better. And those who came to see her got very creative indeed, with concocting the most syrupy, greasy, fatty foods imaginable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru, her gluttony now fueled by and joined with her sense of pride and her fiery temper, was growing fast.

The spies figured it was the only place large enough, for the time being, to house such a massive woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Queen shall not be pleased with this revelation.\" whisper one girl to whom appeared to be their leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, but now that we have confirmed her weight it is time we find out what sort of method she is using to rob our Queen out of victory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio continued to watch silently in hopes they would spot something out of the ordinary but nothing came...until the girl at the right of the leader heard the creaking sound of the metallic gates to the courtyard open up obviously to allow someone passage inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlending into the shadows they stood still watching a figure enter and seemingly approach the hill-sized princess. Admittedly they were all amazed that the person had not been freaked out by such a ridiculous sight, perhaps the individual was somehow accustom to seeing the Princess this thick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemaining ever quiet they spied onward as the mystery individual was revealed to be a woman but not just any woman. This particular girl had on a simple white dress, a pair of worn-in brown boots, ocean-blue eyes, and flowing red hair. There was only one woman in all of Hyrule that could match such a description and of course that was the ranch-girl Malon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhistling to herself Malon causally strolled up toward Zelda, the princess relaxing in the sun and her bulk. In her hand was a simple sack that seem to be filled to the brim with something. From their vantage point it made guessing what was in the sack a bit of a mystery to the Gerudo spies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying ourselves, Princess?\" called out Malon as she looked far into the air in hopes of making out the blubber surrounded face of the noble woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment there was silence until a slight giggle was heard, which caused Malon to laugh slightly as she watched the fatty \"hill\" shake as if it were caught in an earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my yes.\" responded Zelda ever so happily. Malon couldn't quite see what with the sun in her eyes but she was sure Zelda was smiling widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a relief and here I thought you'd decide to cut your gaining now that you're as big as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perish the thought, my friend. This is only the end of the first month there are still three more to go. At the end of it all I may very well be as wide as my castle if not more! There is no way I can lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon continued smiling, the young woman could practically feel the confidence radiate around Zelda. Glancing over at the sack she remembered why she had come over in the first place and why Zelda had asked for her assistance a day after she returned from the desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising the sack into the air Malon called out once more, \"I brought what you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Would you be a dear and climb up my girth so I may have an easier time drinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last word brought curiosity to the desert spies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah about that...\" Malon whistled a few times to herself as she turned slightly away blushing a tad crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense Zelda but you're um...how do I put this...nude!\" There she had blurted it out even if it was a bit higher pitched that she expected, \"I'm all for helping you out and I'm really honored you asked me to...but I'm not sure if I would feel comfortable climbing your um fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Malon felt her cheeks flare up from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well I suppose I do see your point. Well no matter Impa should be back soon with a specially made dress that will accommodate my ever growing weight so why not stay for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon thought it over and simply shrugged her shoulders, \"Sure...why not and thanks for understanding.\" she added in at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You know we've been at each other's throats in the past that it's nice to cooperate every once and while.\" stated Zelda with childish glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's not so bad...pretty cool actually. Plus you're the one gaining not me so that's definitely a plus in my book. I wouldn't mind a few extra pounds but not that Much.\" Malon stated with a laugh as she placed the sack on the grassy floor beneath her before relaxing onto ground with a slight stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above the Gerudo figured now would be the best chance to strike and steal what ever was in that sack of Malon's. If it's contents were indeed the source of Zelda's vast and inhuman weight gain then Nabooru would be so proud of their accomplishment and would surely pull Zelda to shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparing themselves they took one last breath...</span></div></div>",

As Zelda let out an \"OOF!\" at the sensation of three women landing deep into her softness, Malon let out an even less refined \"Guh?\" of confusion. And while the three Gerudo scouts lost valuable fractions of a seconds trying to get off of Zelda (the Princess was less bouncy than they had hoped, and more just plain pillowy), they still managed to swipe the sack from the startled farm woman before she really responded. And with that, they bolted for it, deciding to simply leave as quickly as they could through the castle's front gates now that their secrecy was blown anyway. As they fled, every countless inch of Zelda's wobbling, gelatinous body turned beet-red with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nabooru...\" she hissed through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.

And though ever guard they passed promptly gave chase, they were less naturally nimble, and were weighed down with armor. The Gerudo scouts, however, approached attire of any sort with a \"less is more\" philosophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, in a shockingly short time, they reached the front gates, and found to their delight that it was open, saving them the hassle of having to climb over it. But their relief dampened when they realized that it was open to let Impa in. It took Impa as much time as it took the scouts to pass her to decide to give chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scouts grimaced, panting, finally reaching their limits as they continued their mad dash through the civilian streets surrounding the castle.

Snapping up to her feet the ranch girl was just about to alert Zelda of what she had heard when a sharp yell surprised her and awoke a previously resting Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of the spies had been flung forcefully off the balcony and now found herself falling through the air before landing at top of Zelda's bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess let out a gasp as the woman sled off the Royal's girth and tumbled onto the ground with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh?\" wondered Malon altering her course and taking a step toward the body on the ground. But before she could get any closer a cloud of smoke and shadow appeared in front of the young woman nearly startling her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's faithful guardian, Impa, then showed herself to the surprised redhead. In each arm she held an unconscious spy from the desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" mumbled Malon in pure disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impa what is the meaning of this? Who are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrior to turning her attention toward the heavy-set princess Impa placed the two spies down on the ground and snapped her finger causing a shadow-like rope to bind the two desert women forcefully together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These three are spies from the desert, dear Zelda. I highly suspect they were sent here on orders by their Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Zelda needed to hear, a plotting look in her eyes.</span></div></div>",

The resulting quiver forced her large. fat filled, fat rolls to erupt with a series of uncontrollable ripples. These ripples resounded from her soft cellulitic underbelly, which always managed to rest on the ground, all the way up past her mammoth thighs and through her behemoth backside. Truly a breath taking sight, Nabooru's butt had grown so vast that no man made furniture could contain it any longer. Those dimpled butt cheeks had become so engorged with cellulite that they had taken on a sort of watery cottage cheese appearance.  The shelves of back fat above accented her biggest asset accordingly. At last the quivering ended in her billowing breasts. These massive sacks of fat perched atop her vast gut tickled her love handles regardless of clothing or not.

The news was so shocking that Nabooru had finally decided to call an end to her next meal course ( the first time in three days). Nabooru silently signaled her royal guard to help her rise to a sitting position. Her guard quietly maneuvered beside their queen and with little delicacy <br>\r\nbegan raising Nabooru's flabby forefront forward. Rolls collided, new rolls formed, and seams ripped as Nabooru's massive frame reached the upright position. Fat arms flailed violently as Nabooru's breast fat engulfed her head. Her royal guard sensing the situations gravity quickly forced their ruler's collosal thighs apart, causing her belly and breast fat to flood outwards towards the floor. With the pressure released Nabooru gasped for breath and waited for her senses to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...can...this...be?\" The mammoth ruler queried \"All the castle's furniture has been reinforced by Gorons.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may speak frankly\" the servant replied \" Queen Nabooru has already broken 2 reinforced chairs as well as 1 bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...have...never...done...such...a...thing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was during your many post-feast naps...your highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queens already crimsoned face grew more scarlet as she took in her servants words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....huff....want....huff....a....team....up....there...now\"  Nabooru wheezed \"I want....her down here....before dinner!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer servant nodded and left with haste as Nabooru grew lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Zelda has finally reached my weight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sweat beads cascaded down their fat cheeks and pooled between the crevasses in their jowls. Massive breasts slapped and scraped across prominent belly folds and love handles. Behemoth bellies shifted with each rise and fall of overly plump calves and thunderous thighs. Abnormally abundant ass cheeks fought for dominance colliding heavily with each step. Undulating upper arms dripped with flab and did little to push back to pounds of cleavage that spilled out ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA journey that had used to take the lithe queen 2 minutes had now become an arduous journey of 30 minutes of agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has it always been so difficult to reach your baths Nabooru?\" Zelda wheezed \"I don't think I have much more strength left in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have become well accustomed to our lifestyle have you not Zelda?\" Nabooru huffed as they reached the waters edge. \"We are here....and I hope you do not think ill of me after today's....unpleasant incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda stood silently, her massive frame quivering, trying to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.....it was bound to happen sooner or later\" she said as she took hold of a prominent belly fold and shook it wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall make it up to you anyway\" Nabooru replied \"We shall have that feast that you were desiring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda chuckled sending a good deal of ripples through her frame \"Thank you, I find myself always hungry these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It comes with the territory\" Nabooru quipped \"Women of our stature need a little more nourishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transition into the waters was a relatively simply procedure turned slightly complicated.

Her now erect nipples throbbing in anticipation for what would come next. The next few minutes felt like an eternity as Nabooru continued to kiss Zelda with an undying passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda returned the favor, slipping her free hand onto Nabooru's breasts and fondling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru moaned with pleasure, her nipples stiffening between Zelda's fat fingers, slipping her tongue into Zelda's mouth with vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped only to catch their breaths...panting as they looked into each others eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be mine...\" Nabooru said huskily as she slipped her fat hands around Zelda's belly. Zelda remained silent as Nabooru pulled her closer into her soft fat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda simply responded with an equally as sensual kiss as the one before it. It was a spur of the moment decision to her but it was one that didn't feel at all unwarranted. Zelda pushed her tongue past Nabooru's lips, committing more fully to the moment that she was caught in, moaning lowly as Nabooru's hands found their way towards the hyrulian rulers fat filled breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru wrapped her tongue around Zelda's, interlocking them, and slowly fondling Zelda's rigid nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir panting increased with each renewed kiss, their flabby bodies quivering softly in the hot waters of the bath.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zelda had gone back to Hyrule...but only after a serious of intimate moments had expounded in the royal baths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru ate now to stifle the hungering pains in her belly and her heart. She longed to see Zelda again, hoping that she felt the same and returned to her. She longed to feel Zelda's soft expanse embrace hers, she longed for the intimacy they had shared, she longed for a feasting partner that could dine with her properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been communicating though Cuckoo mail, Zelda promising that she was pining away just as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru's servants appeared with fresh platters and rested them near her exhausted feeder's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were beginning to become deeply concerned with their Queen's behavior. She was beginning to eat much more and far longer than she had when Zelda was here, and her belly always appeared horribly distended. They were afraid that they would soon be looking for a new ruler, fearing that Nabooru would die face down in a bowl of gravy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, they held their tongues and followed orders despite their wide reaching effects. Take the royal guard for example! Nabooru had ordered that the guard's leaders take turns feasting with her....an order that was beginning to turn the once lithe women into fatties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe royal chefs had been gaining since Nabooru first started to grow in width, and had now reached the point in which they were ready to be retired due to size related difficulties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru had ordered them to take on taste tester duties, hoping that they would soon be too large to cook. This in turn meant fatter chefs, which in return caused manning changes and unease. She had assured them, however, that they would be allowed the priveledge to be her feasting partners once they could no longer work as chefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chambermaids were fat in their own respects, having to finish off whatever Nabooru could not after her feasts. There was not a thin one among the palace staff by the time that things had reached this point. They also began to take on new roles, kneading and straining their leaders breasts as Nabooru's once dry breasts had begun to produce small drops of creamy white milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Nabooru did not seem to notice or care, as the obese desert queen continued to feast...waiting for her Zelda's return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------Hyrule-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sat awake in her reinforced bed, once more reliving that passionate moment with Nabooru. Her fat cheeks grew crimson as she recalled the feeling of Nabooru's tongue touching hers. Her intimate parts grew wet as she relived the passionate embraces she received that night. Zelda's arrousal was matched only by her frustration, as she could no longer reach her womanhood by herself at her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, She reached idly to her dresser and bought a piece of one of her Hyrulian pound cakes to her lips. She had taken to eating as a means to alleviate stress and tension lately. These many cakes and snacks left at her bedside were for moments like these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been eating incessantly since her return, snacking mostly between meetings and public appearances, driven by loneliness and stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed as she finished off a few more, she hadn't felt right since returning. Things were awkward between her and Link, mainly due to her confusion over her feelings towards Nabooru, and she couldn't seem to build the courage to speak with him privately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer palace attendents had grown larger in her absence, except Link and the guard, wishing to imitate their massive matron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but notice that they had increased their efforts to become fatter since seeing her fatter frame. Add to that Nabooru's insistence that she return for \"Diplomatic relations.\" Zelda was eating even more than her feasts with Nabooru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't continue...\" she sighed, bring her fat hand up the side of her increasingly substanial belly folds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't be able to go anywhere at the rate I am growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly demolished the rest of her fattening treats and decided to sleep, vowing to send for Nabooru first thing in the morning.</span></div></div>",

Nevertheless, she bit her tongue as she waddled her way towards Nabooru's throne room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood winded outside the throne room doors, catching her breath and trying hard to brace herself for her quivering queen's gaze. She waited a minute before entering and waddled slowly towards her massive master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru sat sated atop her immense platform, a glazed look in her eyes, panting heavily as she finished off the last of her mid-afternoon post lunch snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZaruna approached her queen and bowed to the best of her extent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zaruna...*huff....I...need....a...beautiful....set...of..robes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZaruna lifted herself up slowly and met Nabooru's gaze before replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robes only?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Nabooru huffed \"I...am...too..fat...for...lingerie...now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZaruna nodded in agreement as she carefully examined her queen's mammoth body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru no longer seemed to have a neck, her fat cheeks, bloated chins, and meaty jowls eclipsing any hint of one, and her shoulders were so padded that it seemed impossible to tell where they blended together with her pillow like upper arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts had become two masses of fat filled flesh, which cascaded down her belly folds. Their mass pushed her cellulite pebbled upper arms into a slight angle, enhancing her size by a great deal. Her thick nipples were erect and capped by drops of milk, which seemed to be leaking slowly onto her massive saddlebags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly had split itself into three dense folds, each wider and thicker than the previous. Her bottom fold had developed a very pronounced cleft and was beginning to dimple with cellulite. It pushed its way out to her knees, despite her massive thighs being spread apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZaruna carefully measured every inch of her queen's immense forefront, marking each crease and fold with a small ink mark. Once she double checked her measurements she waddled behind her queen and began to prepare for another round of measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru's folds of backfat hung atop each other beneath her cascading red hair down to her behemoth butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt cheeks were cellulite ridden boulders of watery flab that jostled and quivered with the slightest movement. Her biggest asset by far, was also her most unruly, jutted out defiantly behind her and made sitting in any chair an impossibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZaruna finished her measurements carefully before announcing her plans for a pair of royal lingerie and robe sets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of irritation blazed in Nabooru's eyes as Zaruna continued her explanations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lingerie is a wise choice my queen, Hyrule is more reserved than the Gerudo desert is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It..better...be...comfortable....\" Nabooru relented \"I....hate...tight...panties...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will be my queen! I swear it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make...Haste...then...\" Nabooru huffed impatiently \"I...want....them...ASAP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my queen!\" Zaruna cried, retreating to her shop as quickly as her blubbery thighs would allow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------meanwhile in Hyrule--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...has...to...be...a..mistake..\" Zelda huffed as her massive feast digested slowly in her stomach. \"Check..your...measurements again....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of shock was plastered on the morbidly obese princess's face as her fat seamstress, once again, read off a series of unbelievable measurements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true your highness....\" she muttered softly \"...I can fashion you a pair of loose fitting clothes and lingerie for you my highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do...what....you...must...\" Zelda replied wearily before reaching for a nearby hyrulian cream puff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seamstress watched as her princess devoured the sweet treat in one bite, streams of creamy filling and salvia oozing down her fat lips. She watched as Zelda's flabby cheeks, thick chins, and dense jowls quivered as the sweet dessert slid down with her swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seamstress looked on in awe at Zelda's dimpled, fat filled upper arms. She studied how they tried in vein to hold back the obese ruler's massive, milk filled breasts. The tear shaped milk bags, cascaded themselves down huge folds of creamy water-like flab, tickling her lower-most belly fold lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA belly which engulfed her fat-enclosed knees, despite her cottage cheese thighs being wedged apart completely. It commanded presence with its mass of three mighty folds and dimpled underbelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda let loose a massive belch before reaching for another creampuff, devouring it just as fast as the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell...Impa...to...have...Link...prepare...for...Nabooru....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your highness!\" she replied, before turning around and waddling out into the palace halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda let loose a light belch before finishing off the remaining creampuffs that remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*huff*...I...wonder...how...fat...we...are...going...to..get...\"</span></div></div>",

Her royal gaze shifting from the empty platters that were being taken away by her fat handmaidens, towards her headguard's blubbery body. Her headguard, once so lithe and quick, now huffed after a few interuppted seconds of speaking...It was an irony that Nabooru savored like a fine wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the one that had been the most against Nabooru's indulgences, and now she was one of the fattest of Nabooru's kingdom. Nabooru wasn't surprised in the least, Ophela always had a sweet tooth and a big appetite, it didn't take much for her headguard to start packing on the pounds. All Nabooru had to do was promote her and switch her duties to more administrative ones, this freed Ophela from the stress of constantly patrolling and keeping in top shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru had enjoyed every time Ophela reported with a distended stomach, every time that she was caught snacking instead of filing away royal documents, every diplomatic feast that she returned from a few pounds heavier and beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela was panting as she finished her rhetoric and began recapping a prior incident in which Nabooru had found herself held hostage by brigands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru could see the anger seething beneath Ophela's squinted eyes as the story began to become more passionate. Nabooru, now fighting the urge to smile at her headguard's passionate speech, continued to size up her obese warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela was a beautiful Gerudo woman, whose beauty could almost rival Nabooru's, whose fiery red hair and piercing eyes accented dark flesh. Her flabby cheeks, although concealed beneath a dark blue face mask, quivered whenever she spoke, sending small tremors through her increasingly thick chins and jowls. A fact that impressed Nabooru, her headguard was literally so fat that her facial features were form fitted beneath a mask meant to hide them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela's well padded shoulders and pillowy arms, tried in vain to stay by her flabby lovehandles and impressive chest. Dark and creamy flab now replaced Where there was once definition and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru diverted her gaze down to Ophela's vast belly, a mass of folds and handles of watery flab. Ophela's belly was divided into two very heavy and full folds of fat. Her lowermost fold, tucked tightly into her cobalt pants, was dimpled with cellulite underneath and clefted in the middle.  Nabooru watched pridefully as Ophela's belly quivered with each slight movement that she took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Nabooru diverted her gaze to Ophela's immense breasts, noting that they were hardly concealed and contained by her flabby arms, that they lied within and without her arm's reach. Nabooru loved how Ophela's Twin, tear shaped masses of creamy brown flesh capped by thick nipples cascaded down and across her voluminous forefront. They were jammed tightly within her threadbare cobalt tubetop, where they still succomed to gravity despite her top's support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru noted that her massive warmaiden's nipples were fully erect and the fabric atop them was a darker shade of blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is new\" Nabooru thought as she watched Ophela's breasts quiver heavily with each gasped breath she took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little Ophela seems to be arroused at something or someone here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru shifted her gaze as best she could, confirming that it was only her and Ophela within her throneroom. A smile crested her fat lips, as Nabooru finally started to connect the subtle signs that Ophela had been giving her lately. The private \"debriefings\" in which she insisted on feeding Nabooru while relaying kingdom intelligence, or the way she seemed to exaggerate her waddle in her queens presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" Nabooru let loose a mental laugh \"I'm sure Zelda won't mind if I have some fun....priveldge of royalty and all that.\"</span></div></div>",

She worked her way beneath Nabooru's heavy breasts, cupping them carefully, savoring their warmth as she reached for fabric. Nabooru moaned as Ophela ran her hands up towards her stiff nipples. They were slick with milk and eagerly releashed a few streams as Ophela's fat fingers made contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you...should...feel...honored...\" Nabooru huskily spoke, bringing her fat hands to her behemoth breasts pushing them closer together \"....Zelda...hasn't...even...tasted...these...yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela hastily ripped Nabooru's top apart, a feat rather easy due to the fabric's threadbare state, as well as her own and leaned atop her queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made sure her milky nipples were tucked to her flabby sides as she leaned atop her master's immense belly. Ophela greedily sought out one of Nabooru's thick nipples and quickly began to suckle the sweet nectar from within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru shuddered as Ophela's lapping tongue released streams of pressurized milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How...does...it...taste...\" Nabooru queried, slightly lightheaded from her growing sexual tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela unlatched herself momentarily, staring Nabooru in the eyes as she whispered \"like...ambrosia...my...queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru sighed contently, guesturing for Ophela to return to her breasts, vowing to order Ophela to be with her in the royal caravan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela returned to her queen's breasts with zeal, aggressively guzzling milk in an effort to quench her growing thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru chuckled softly, sending tremors through her and Ophela's fat, as she watched Ophela suckle like a hungry babe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Careful....\"Nabooru moaned, tilting her head back as her eyes rolled in ecstacy\"....My....heavenly....breasts...hold....much....ambrosia....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela, increased her efforts, eventually draining one of Nabooru's massive milkbags completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....and...I...can....hold....much....ambrosia...\" Ophela quipped, thrusting out her slightly distended belly defiantly, before latching herself onto the untouched nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....you....will....ride...within...my...carriage...to...Hyrule....\" Nabooru swooned, as her nipples stiffened even more \"...I...will...have...you....suckle...me...all...the...way....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela detached herself, bringing her hands to her fat breasts, licking her lips before replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Your...servant...agrees...if...you...would....return...the...favor. ..my...queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru smiled, pulling Ophela's head back towards her breast, and sighed contently as Ophela latched once more onto her milky teat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of...course....my....foolish....Ophela....\" Nabooru chuckled \"...traveling...always...makes...me...unquenchable....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela drained her queen slowly, barely finishing as her stomach distended far beyond its comfort zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru smiled as she watched her sated headguard struggle to her feet, belly sloshing painfully with each exaggerated movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...speak...to...the...royal...tailor...\" Nabooru commanded \"....have...her...make...you...some....clothes....you...can...grow...into... my...milk...will...make...a....woman...of...you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela let loose a heavy belch, before pulling herself atop her queen, raising her breasts to Nabooru's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...will...my...queen....\" she groaned \"...my...milk...isn't...of...poor...quality...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru latched onto Ophela's offered teat and drained it within a few moments. Ophela gasped as Nabooru detached herself from her empty teat and reached for the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It...isn't...as...rich...or...fullbodied...as...it...could...be. ..\" Nabooru huffed \"....we...will...have...to...fix...your...diet....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela drooled slightly as she thought of the rich foods that Nabooru was offering, she would be priveledged enough to eat the food of royalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you...are...too...kind...my...queen...\" Ophela moaned as Nabooru made quick work of her other milk filled breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I...provide...for...my...people...\" Nabooru huffed \"...especially...if...I...find...them...pleasing....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I...will...have...you...producing...rich...milk...for...my...person al...use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela blushed deeply as Nabooru began to massage her breasts, as best she could, before lowering her attentions to her swollen womanhood. Ophela turned to putty in Nabooru's hands as the immense ruler's fingers pushed past her vaginal lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....you...will....be...my...colossal....cow...won't...you?\" Nabooru cooed, pushing her fat fingers further inside Ophela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES....OH....DIN...YES...\" Ophela cried, as her blubbery body began to convulse passionatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its...all...YOURS...\" she screamed as she climaxed violently atop her queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Good....\" Nabooru said with a smile \"....Now....go...prepare...for...tomorrow...Ophela...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...my...queen...\" Ophela whimpered, stumbling to her fat feet, as she hastily grabbed her garments.

She wrapped her thick tongue around his, moving a fat hand to his toned butt. Link responded by sliding his hand down to one of Zelda's immense breasts. Zelda pulled him closer, feeling his throbbing dick press into her flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn eternity seemed to pass before they broke from each others lips, both panting heavily, each being swept away in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was the first to move, slowly pulling herself nearer Link as he kneeled before her, sliding her fat fingers atop his thick member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....what...a...lovely...sword...\" she chuckled, sending quivers through her milky white fat \"....let...me...polish...it...for...you...brave...hero...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded in approval as Zelda slid her fat lips onto his erect \"sword\" slowly moving her fat head from its base to tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are quite adept at polishing swords...\" he moaned as she began to quicken her pace. He slid his hands behind her fat cheeks and began to guide her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to slide onto him, a moment he seized to deftly maneuver himself to end up with her head atop his member and his face facing her behemoth butt. He then preceded to spread her dimpled cheeks, forcing his tongue into her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda moaned appreciatively as Link began to lap up its contents. She increased her pace, bringing her hero to climax, swallowing every ounce of seed he produced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink returned the favor, driving her to a maddening orgasm, lapping at every last drop of her nectar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled off slowly, allowing Link's poor body to regain some circulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I...hope...you...find...your...gifts....to....your...liking...\" Zelda panted as she rolled over exposing her massive bottom to open air once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are very much to my liking...Princess\" Link chimed as he slid his still erect member past her gelatinous cheeks into her.

He renewed his efforts and had Zelda screaming loudly as he continued to pump into her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....GIVE...IT...*huff*....TO...ME...*pant*...FAIRY...BOY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink leaned in closer, sliding his hands towards her fat arms, and began to pull at her wrists with vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda bit her lower lip lustfully as she wrapped her fat fingers around her lover's wrists. She began to pull as he retracted and he began to pull as she rebounded. Her moans began to stifle as he reached her G spot and pounded at it unrelentingly. Her eyes rolled even higher as her body convulsed violently beneath Link's frame. He pumped even faster as she climaxed into multiple orgasms, releasing his seed onto her back only after she had gone limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink helped her to her side before lying next to his obese princess, she was panting heavily as she motioned him to her milk covered teats. He began to milk them gently, watching in awe as streams of pressurized milk squirted out onto them and the mattress. He milked them dry before bringing his lips to Zelda's once more. She whispered a simple phrase after they broke from their passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Feed....me....\" </span></div></div>",

She began to drain them as she had done so many times these past two weeks. She didn't know what was more distressing, the fact that she had gained so much on the milk alone or that she was actually finding it difficult to get full off just one feeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru slid her feeding tube past her fat lips and began to gulp down the sweet combo of her breast milk combined with sugar and honey. The sickeningly sweet fluid went straight down her throat and began to fill her overstretched stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would have known that my milk would be so full-bodied and fattening?\" she thought as she gazed upon Ophela's fatter frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is getting so fat, so fast, that her bigger rolls are starting to get stretch marks.\" Nabooru increased her pace as her thoughts continued to carry on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has exploded since I put her on a strictly liquid diet....I wonder how big I can make her get before we reach Hyrule...A week is sufficient time to have her nearing immobility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed furiously as she observed Ophela's dimpled behemoth belly tremble with each slight movement. She took notice that Ophela could no longer rest atop her seat properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her butt is probably mindbogglingly huge by now...\" Nabooru thought lustifully \"I will have to let her get out before me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn their seated position their bellies were nearing constant contact as they grew more immense with their incessant feeding.<br>\r\nOphelia could only access her queen's teats by kneeling before her and turning her fat engulfed head towards them, a fact that Nabooru savored as it appeared that she was kneeling before her ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru watched as Ophela's behemoth, triple belly, distended forward with each deep swallow she took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru swallowed deeper as she watched Ophela's mammoth mammories quiver with each swallow she took. She had worked hard to increase their size and capacity, being careful to massage and knead Ophela's breasts after each milking, changing her diet to sweeten her milk and increase its texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela finished draining her queen in record time and had stumbled lazily back to her side of the cabin. She carefully lowered herself onto her seat and pawed at her distended belly in an effort to soothe her packed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru finished her meal, shortly after, leaning back into her expanding flesh. She took a few minutes to catch her breath before ordering that the shake be replaced and that it be given to Ophela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela's eyes widened as the caravan stopped and Nabooru's orders were completed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....My...queen...I...am...too...full....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of anger flashed in Nabooru's eyes, silencing Ophela's whimpering, her tone was one of frustration when she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Ophela....Don't....tell....me...*pant*..you...won't...accep t...my...kindness...\" she huffed angrily \"...I...*huff*...only...want...you...to...*pant*..be...presentable...my...eq ual...before....Zelda.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela opened her fat lips and allowed a fat handmaiden to slide it down her throat, whimpering slightly as the liquid began to pour into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....From....now...until....Hyrule....\" Nabooru panted \"...That....vat....stays...full...and...Ophela...stays....fed....stuffed.... and...content....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, soft moans echo throughout Nabooru's tent as the feasts die down and the caravan members lay down to sleep. Only two remain awake, Nabooru and Ophela, and Nabooru is currently lips deep on Ophela's bloated breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela's breasts find relief as Nabooru suckles them for the first time all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....mmmmm.....\" Ophela coos as her sensitive nipples release streams of pressurized milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Do....they....please....you....my....queen....\" Ophela huffed as her queen increased her suckling greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....They....are....so....heavy....and....full...\" she continued as Nabooru hastily continued to drain Ophela's dense breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....you...honor....me....my....queen...\" Ophela sighed, her fat lips curling into a smile as she continued to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru took a moment to return a smile after she had finished draining Ophela's first breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I....only....drink....the....best....\" Nabooru hautily replied as she slipped her plump lips atop the undrained breast and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela drifted slowly into a deep sleep as Nabooru continued to suckle intently.</span></div></div>",

Her once stern eyes and prominent elven ears now  squinted and somewhat obscured by blubbery cheeks, her once snarling lips now incredibly pouty and thick, her once strong chin line now replaced by hefty chins and heavy jowls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa's once toned shoulders and arms were now engulfed with pillowy olive flab. Her once pert breasts now mammoth tear-shaped masses of fat filled flesh. Her once chiseled abdomen now a series of fat filled folds, rolls, and saddlebags. Its massive dual folds pushed past her knees, her lowermost fold cleft in the middle and dimpled with cellulite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once toned thighs, were now dimpled greatly, and apart only when sitting as her belly pushed them wildly apart to make room to expand. Her once slender hips were now pebbled with cottage cheese-esqe fat and her once shapely bottom was now caked with dimpled cellulite and topped with rolls of back fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink winked back as he slid a hand up to her heavy breast \"I can't wait to have you handle my blade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa grasped his wrist with a fat hand and pulled him into her mass, planting a passionate kiss upon the hero's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I...will...be....sure...to...teach...you...properly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink excused himself from their presence, under the pretense of checking up on preparations, the whale sized women knew better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, in Impa's room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....come....closer....*Huff*...Hero....of...time....\" Impa cooed as a confident Link entered into her chambers.

His smile grows wider as he takes in her naked form, its much larger than it was when she was with him and Zelda earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Like....magic....and....deception....\" Impa smiled as she noted Link's observation of her. She knows her message has been received as Link's member stiffens to attention at her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\" Link's silent streak continued as he grew closer to Impa, he stopped just within arms reach of her flabby belly. He slid his warm hands across her blubbery sides before leaning forward, across her quivering expanse, to kiss her chins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....don't...be...shy\" Impa bit her lip as she whispered huskily \"....I....don't....bite....hard....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink worked his hands across her expanse, stopping at her tense nipples, ensuring that he worked his hands carefully against her body. Impa, in return, pulled the hero of time closer planting her fat lips against his thin ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa pushed her thick tongue into Link's mouth, wrapping it tightly around his as she proceded to suck greedily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink's hands made their way to her erect nipples, tweaking them tightly with each renewed thrust of tongue, causing her milk to lather his hands thickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa's fat hands made their way to his tunic belt, deftly disrobing his lower half, nostrils flaring as her chubby crimson cheeks jostled with each tongue lash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke her lip lock with Link slowly, panting for breath, as she cupped his toned buttocks and pulled him closer to her. She wrapped her sausage like lips around his erect member as she pulled him closer still. With adept skill she began to run her tongue across his shaft, moving her lips back and forth with increasing urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe released eagerly into her mouth, Impa swallowing deeply with each stream of his fluid. She released his member from her lips, licking them slowly as she reclined herself backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Your....turn...\" she panted as she tugged on a sweaty fold with her fat hands, lifting her belly high enough to expose her feminine parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink knelt down before the reinforced bed and began to part Impa's dimpled thighs with his hands. He deftly inserts his face into her near touching thighs and begins to lap eagerly at her clit. Impa's moans get louder and more gutteral as he reaches her spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe increases his pace as she convulses wildly, he stops only to catch a few breaths before bringing her to climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE!\" She cries as Link retracts his tongue, he eagerly sticks his stiff member into her throbbing slit and begins to pound violently. Impa's eyes roll back as each trust drives deeper into her sensitive womanhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deeper!\" She moans as he grabs tightly at her dimpled hips violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink soon climaxed inside of Impa, and then stood up to kiss her. After a few more minutes of passion, the pair had no choice but to sleep, as the feast tomorrow would leave them no time to rest at all.</span></div></div>",

She downed one quickly as the blushing maidservant placed the <br>\r\ntray within her arms reach and waddled away from her ponderous princess's nude form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda smiled slyly, before biting into another cream puff, knowing that her maidservant's embarrassment was primarily due to the circumstances that she was currently involved in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was completely nude, eating mass amounts of sweet dessert food, while being milked by the captain of Hyrule's royal guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was currently filling up bottles with the creamy milk exploding from Zelda's back breaking tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....*mmmph*...you...really...do...have....magic...hands...\" Zelda cooed as Link emptied the last of her milky reserves into the last container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Nabooru will be here soon\" Link said hastily, changing the subject as Zelda sighed, doing his best to avoid taking her right here and now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled slyly as he awkwardly hid his raging erection from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes....*pant*....Help....me...up....*huff*....fairy..boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am far from a boy Princess.\" Link quipped as his wrists dug into her bloated forearms. Zelda shot him a knowing glance as her body slowly shifted forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Good....I....need....a....strong...man.....to....help...me...\" she wheezed, momentarily startling as her heavy belly slammed atop her massive thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited for the quivering to stop and her footing to steady before taking the laborious waddle towards her wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink watched intently as her body quivered with each heavy step. He took note of how <br>\r\nher belly quivered off her thighs before swaying towards the unadvanced legs side and <br>\r\nalternated respectively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as her massive bottom jiggled with each impact violently. Of course, he took note of how her body still quivered intensely even after she had reached her wardrobe and had come to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Clothing...is...quickly....losing...its....novelty...\" Zelda panted as she reached <br>\r\nfor her royal garb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed her fat arms through the sleeves as best she could before draping the garment atop her breasts. Her dilemma became clear as her fat arms fell to her sides, lacking the clearance to maneuver her fat hands towards the bundled fabric situated on her flabby torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Don't....just....stand...there....\" she blushed angrily \".....help...me...out....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No bra Princess?\" Link queried as he made his way in front of the Hyrulian royal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Shut....it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink tugged heavily at the fabric, smoothing it over her frame until it clung to her <br>\r\nfat folds perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it wouldn't do these much good\" he smirked, squeezing one of her huge <br>\r\nbreasts as he spoke. He looked on amazed as her nipple produced more milk despite his incessant milking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Thanks.....hero....\" she whispered before planting her plump lips atop his. She <br>\r\nwithdrew once she felt his member press into her dimpled thighs eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets....go....greet....Nabooru....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink steadied himself as Zelda slid her fat hand atop his shoulder for support as they <br>\r\nproceeded to the throne room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt himself amazed at how out of shape she truly was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had always assumed that she would be able to counteract the detrimental parts of her <br>\r\nobesity with magic....but she was breathless after a few minutes of labored waddling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds her body now produced also kept him in awe, her belly slapping against her <br>\r\nknees or her thunderous thighs scraping together were oddly alluring and concerning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appeared to be at her limit as they reached the throne room, both silently grateful <br>\r\nas they lowered her fat bottom atop her reinforced and widened throne.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of relief washed over the sweat drenched Hyrulian ruler as her deeply dimpled <br>\r\nbutt eagerly accepted the strong seats support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sweat drenched frame tinted her dress a darker shade of purple as she fanned her <br>\r\nface frantically, trying to regain some composure before ordering the Palace doors <br>\r\nopen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------Hyrule Gates------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru waddled, laboriously, elegantly into the Hyrulian palace throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fat body, quivering hypnotically as the tan skinned red-haired fat filled ruler panted heavily. Every eye in the palace halls were upon her and her quaking body as she regally made her way down the pathway to the throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear to even the most dense servant in the palace that the Gerudo queen would soon lose the ability to stand let alone waddle at the rate she was expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda watched lazily from her throne as Nabooru inched closer with each labored step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red haired queen's eyes reflected such passion that Zelda couldn't help but feel a <br>\r\nshiver travel down her mammoth backside as the Gerudo ruler's eyes burned into her <br>\r\nfatter frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft smile crested Nabooru's sausage like lips for only a second as she made eye <br>\r\ncontact with Zelda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Hyrulian flower had blossomed perfectly in their time apart and she found herself relieved by her lover's softer visage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe resisted the urge to lick her lips as she stared upon Zelda's fatter frame, making note of her fatter breasts and thicker belly. Nabooru felt her nipples pressing deeply into her multi-colored tube top as thoughts of Zelda suckling on her bulbous breasts, once more, filled her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda could not help notice that the Gerudo queen had grown quite obese since their <br>\r\nlast meeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn observation that bought her both relief, in the fact that she was not alone in her gluttonous growth, and an oddly primal arousal at the way her obese counterpart's immense body quivered violently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her fat head slightly to Link's side and made note that he was visibly excited as well. Her thoughts became lewd as she imagined squashing his muscular frame between her and Nabooru's soft frames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda felt her own thick nipples press into her damp dress as she soaked up Nabooru's <br>\r\nimmensity and her own fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, a panting Nabooru stood winded before Zelda's throne still quivering wildly as held a fat hand atop her behemoth right breast. She was trying in vain to catch her breath as she spoke her greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Its....a....pleasure....*huff*....to....meet....again....princess. ..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly smile crested Zelda's puffy lips as she returned the greeting eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gerudo queen watched on eagerly as the Hyrulian princess slowly slid her fat arms to her throne's armrests as she began preparing to stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda's face contorted in a less than royal manner as she slowly shifted her fat feet and pushed up heavily. She finally made it to her feet, her fat face drenched in sweat, taking time to catch her breath before announcing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome...to...Hyrule..*huff*..Queen....Nabooru....we...have....prepare d...a...feast...in...your...honor!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A series of loud thuds echoed thorough Hyrule palace's corridors as Zelda waddled towards the feasting hall with Impa, Nabooru, Ophela, and Link in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweat dampened faces of the immense women wore fatigued expressions as they waddled slowly, their bodies quivering with each heavy deliberate step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa treated herself to a view of her Princess's swaying backside, taking pride in the <br>\r\nfact that she had taken part in the dimpled cellulite that packed those butt cheeks and <br>\r\nthe fat that oozed off her torso into backfat. Impa longed to nestle her head in the princess's pillow like upper arms. Those arms were quivering and getting softer and her  thunderous thighs were getting downright titanic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa found herself smiling slightly between each panted breath as she watched Zelda's flab <br>\r\ntwitch and jiggle  far after initial movement had ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru soaked in the corridor filling Impa's more than ample backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but feel her already crimson cheeks burn hotter as she gazed upon the once lithe guardian's titanic tush. She could see each dimple of Impa's cottage cheese-like <br>\r\nboulders, as well as the many folds and rolls that culminated near it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gerudo queen silently vowed to have this woman in her bed sometime in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela waddled behind her queen in awe of the Gerudo matron's mammoth proportions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir incessant feasting had definitely added a few inches to the Gerudo matron's <br>\r\nalready behemoth bottom. Ophela watched the cellulite packed cheeks ooze into each other and down atop the thunderous thighs that struggled to support their heavy payload. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink said nothing, appreciating the view Ophela was giving him as she and the others <br>\r\nwaddled out of the corridor into the dining hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself reaching out absentmindedly to the quivering woman's butt as they entered the dining hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands grasped tightly at their soft expanse as she stopped to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Not....now....\" she huffed as the others waddled to their seats \"....later....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped back to reality in time just enough to find himself feeling a small tad of <br>\r\nempathy as her nostrils flared desperately for air as her body continued to drench itself with sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly lost that feeling as her damp clothing sunk deeper into her every fold quite <br>\r\nprovocatively as she waddled forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly rushes ahead to draw out two large chairs for each panting woman. They smiled <br>\r\nweakly as they lower their bottoms atop the seats and sit wheezing for a few minutes. He <br>\r\nhelps them to adjust themselves as they try to compose themselves before going to call <br>\r\nthe chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru is the first to move as her fat fingers begin to unfasten her sarong, allowing her creamy mocha skinned belly flab to surge out even further beneath the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer uppermost fold spilled out atop the wooden table heavily allowing her bloated breasts the opportunity to shift deeper into her dimpled upper arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs in relief, savoring the coolness that the table bought to her sweaty flesh<br>\r\nbefore suggesting that the others follow suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda nods in reply, causing her jowls to compress and release as her fat fingers begin <br>\r\nto loosen her dress's drawstrings. The regal Hyrulian's face relaxes as her belly spills forward within her, now loose, tent like dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa remains motionless, her flabby forefront quivering with each breath, she doesn't <br>\r\nmind her tights constricting fabric she enjoys the pressure it produces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela follows suit, her creamy mocha flesh oozing further forward as the cook finally <br>\r\narrives with a number of trays and servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda is the first to dig in, juices running down her quivering chin as she greedily <br>\r\nsucks down a few sausage links. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru is slowly draining the contents of a large bowl of pudding, her head tilted <br>\r\nbackwards as the goop slowly slides past her plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa is draining a hearty stew in the same manner as the Gerudo ruler, the only <br>\r\nexception being that she has a few bowls resting atop her cascading folds for easy <br>\r\naccess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela palms handfuls of desserts into her gaping maw moaning softly as trays continue <br>\r\nbeing switched out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink sits silently resisting the urge to pounce upon these fattened foxes as they <br>\r\ncontinue to gorge lazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watches as they eat in a way that is almost harmonic as platters are moved and <br>\r\nreplaced with precision. He feels that time is slowing and blurring as he watches fat <br>\r\nlips part and close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe feels a stirring feeling as fat jowls compress and expand with each swallow. He feels as though the tempo peaks with each heavy rise and fall of their tubby torsos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe symphony of glutton continued until the conclusion came just as slowly as the start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was the first to signal that she was done, servants removing all her platters as <br>\r\nher glazed eyes struggled to focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fat coated belly distended far ahead of her and to her sides. Her face wore a slightly pained expression as she tried to move a tired hand to her taut belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru, secretly grateful that Zelda had stopped, signaled for her platters to be <br>\r\nremoved as well. Her face, looking slightly weary, betrayed her true state of near food <br>\r\ncoma induced sluggishness. She summoned some strength to bring a fat hand to one of her <br>\r\nbloated breasts as she panted softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa and Ophela finished at the same time, signaling for their mounds of platters to be <br>\r\ntaken away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa's tight spandex now sporting a slight ripping sound as her forefront heaved with <br>\r\neach labored breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela sat slightly dazed, concerned that her queen's insistence for her to gorge <br>\r\nhad made fullness a feeling of the past. She watched slightly the others appear to be <br>\r\nat their limit whilst she felt as though she could perhaps eat a bit more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze shifted down to her bulging belly, her mind starting to process that she had long <br>\r\npassed the point of no return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly lifted her gaze to find Nabooru staring at her, a proud look on her fat <br>\r\nface, she mouthed a smile before the royal chefs bought in dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphela's stomach began to roar dully as the smell of chocolate reached her nostrils. She was the first to dig into the after dinner treat, chocolate smearing across her plump lips.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't seem to keep that woman out of her mind no matter what she tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo in her frustrations she slid her fat thighs to the bed's edge, allowing her belly to succumb to gravity bringing her to a forward leaning squat position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly pressed into the cold tile, a relieving sensation, as Nabooru slid her fat <br>\r\nhands to the bed's side pushing upwards as best she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arched her wide back as she lurched forward, resting on her fat heels as she stood quivering beneath her purple nightwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly waddled towards the door, her fat body jiggling intensely with each labored movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exited her room into the draft filled corridor, her underbelly catching a cool breeze as she waddled towards the royal chambers. Her thong devouring bottom jostling <br>\r\nheavily as she passed the next chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was slightly cracked open and her curiosity, getting the better of her, bought her eyes to the crack inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside she saw Ophela atop her bed on all fours, her face beet red as her body quivered <br>\r\nviolently. She saw the Hero of time thrusting from behind, his face bearing a sly grin <br>\r\nas he pumped into the flaccid Gerudo woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru fought back the urge to join in as she continued to watch Link continue to lay claim to her fattest subordinate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, she found that woman occupying her thoughts again...only with images of naughty things sprinkled in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly backed away as soft moans began to emerge from the chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru returned to the corridor her eyes holding a thin mist as she reached the next <br>\r\nchamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rounded the corner to find her belly slamming into the soft warm mass that was Impa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Queen Nabooru?\" the triple chinned woman whispered, her voice a sultry <br>\r\nbass touched serenade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am now...\" Nabooru stuttered as she found her hands unconsciously stroked the fatter <br>\r\nwoman's thick rolls. Her memory was a bit addled by desire, but she could almost swear <br>\r\nthat the gray haired beauty was even fatter than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see\" Impa chuckled sending jostles through her underwear clad frame \"You are just as bad as Lady Zelda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you will find me better...\" Nabooru cooed \"I have never been accused of leaving someone wanting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You talk big\" Impa quipped in return \"I hope you can back it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you I can!\" Nabooru smirked waddling past her next lover, giving her a good <br>\r\nglimpse at her behemoth butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do...\" Impa grunted softly as she followed suit, closing the door behind her as <br>\r\nshe entered her chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru slid her fat belly against Impa's as she slid her hand up its fatty surface <br>\r\nuntil she reached those bulbous breasts of hers. She slid her fat fingers beneath the <br>\r\ngray haired woman's bra and began to grope longingly at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa let loose a soft moan as her nipples stiffened beneath the red-haired gerudo's palms.<br>\r\nImpa slid her hands to Nabooru's sides just as eagerly and began to massage the fleshy <br>\r\nflanks passionately. A soothing warmth passed through the Gerudo's thick folds as Impa <br>\r\nsummoned a bit of magic to her fat hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated and overly stuffed feeling that had been somewhat hindering Nabooru seemed to disappear as her body thickened, unbeknownst to her, and congealed with more flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru's expansion was slow and almost deliberate, Impa looking on eagerly as the <br>\r\nGerudo Matron's fat cheeks and thick chins thickened even more than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mocha tinted breasts cascaded farther down her dark belly folds, which had thickened into droopy creamy shelves of flab. Her bottom expanded out behind her, the last smooth <br>\r\nareas dimpling with cellulite, as her dimpled hips pressed out further from her sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one has potential\" Impa thought gratefully as she stepped back enough to get a <br>\r\nglimpse of the Gerudo's thickening thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru found herself groping air as Impa slowly lumbered back, a look of confusion <br>\r\nfilled her fatter face before Impa bought her obese bottom to the bed behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA playful look crossed Impa's face as she unclasped her overtaxed bra and signaled for <br>\r\nNabooru to join her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru's puzzled expression morphed into a lustful one as she waddled over towards her <br>\r\nbedbound prize. She would have notice how much more effort it took or how she jiggled <br>\r\nmore than she used to if she weren't so ridden with desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still growing larger as she stopped before Impa, her gain ending only as she removed her own overstuffed bra as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa stopped Nabooru as she turned to join her on the bed, her voice demanding as she <br>\r\nspoke her chosen words carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight I will be the queen Nabooru....\" she said sternly \"and your queen wishes to be <br>\r\nsatisfied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru felt a wave of indignation sweep over her for a second as she caught on to <br>\r\nImpa's intention. She decided to throw away her pride for a moment and dropped to her <br>\r\nfat encumbered knees slowly. Her fat fingers pushing aside thunderous thighs as she <br>\r\nslid her fat cheeks into Impa's forbidden parts. Her tongue darted in viciously <br>\r\ncausing Impa to let loose a weak moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------meanwhile------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....More....More....\" Ophela moaned as Link continued to plow into her womanhood. She <br>\r\nwas adamant that he took charge as things progressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't mind that every part of her seemed to jiggle, or that she was almost always <br>\r\nhungry. He didn't mind that she was severely limited to the positions they could have or <br>\r\nthat she had to stop to snack midway. In fact, she was pretty sure he enjoyed <br>\r\nit....almost as much as she was enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt him enter again and again as her blubber filled butt pushed him aloft after <br>\r\nevery stroke. She savored each entrance with a bite of her thick lower lip as he <br>\r\nthrusted harder and grabbed more flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe battered her with compliments as she climaxed, her whalish body giving way beneath her. <br>\r\nShe still wanted more as he dismounted and made his way around her...she needed more... and to her surprise he told her to be still and left her lying nude atop her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost felt herself tear up in frustration before he returned minutes later with a tray <br>\r\nof decadent desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up\" he said softly as he placed the tray in front of her \"I know you have got to <br>\r\nbe hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to ignore the growing hunger in her belly as she desperately wanted to avoid <br>\r\nlooking like a pig, especially when she had the choice to eat without her Queen's guilt <br>\r\ntrips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered back to the dining hall when the realization hit her that she was past the point of no return....she sighed deeply before unwrapping an over-sized cupcake-like treat and guzzling it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was she kidding anyway?\" She thought as the sugary food slid past her lips she <br>\r\nenjoyed the unrestrained gluttony too much to diet or stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he wants to see me make a pig out of myself...\" she continued her mental monologue <br>\r\n\"then he is going to need to bring a lot more food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink headed back to his place behind her, almost entering, when he heard her grunt at <br>\r\nhim huskily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need more food fairy boy....\" she cooed as she slid the empty tray to the side of <br>\r\nthe bed \"You didn't think that meager snack could fill me up did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled coyly as he returned to her side \"Of course not, a woman of your size needs a <br>\r\nfull sized meal for a snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her cheeks redden at his sarcasm, yet she couldn't help but feel her arousal <br>\r\nbuilding once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then make me a snack!\" she grunted as she rolled onto her side \"Otherwise you can say <br>\r\ngoodnight to a woman of my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scrambled to find his pants and left without so much a warning, leaving Ophela with <br>\r\na smile across her thick lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Punctual as always the guest of honor arrived and the queen of the desert got a rather unexpected surprise when Zelda made her way into Nabooru's chamber after being announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink had told her that Zelda had gotten a little fat, but apparently the poor boy must have taken a few too many hits to the head as Zelda was more then just a \"little fat\" she was instead flat out Fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 350 pounds Zelda's dress struggled slightly to contain her increased girth, her gloves now many sizes larger to better fit her thicker arms and leggings sharing the same fate to accommodate her log-size thighs. Zelda's rear and belly seem to shake with every step her dainty feet made. Nabooru wondered if Zelda could even see her feet pass her belly that seem to spread a foot or two in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desert queen also took note of the hylian princess increased chest size. Nabooru already considered herself \"blessed\" but Zelda's weight gain had done wonders to the girl, putting her a few cups above Nabooru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda waved and greeted Nabooru with a smile as she approached the tan-sized woman. Nabooru still somewhat caught up in Zelda's new appearance didn't respond until Zelda was but a few feet in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru apologized for her carelessness and went in for a shared hug with Zelda, though she found it even at her weight a bit tough to get her arms fully around the fatter royal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the hug Nabooru was the first to strike up a conversation.</span></div></div>",

She though just answered, \"Well if you must know, I heard Link loved big women, and I just tried to see if it was true when I became even more attractive toward him every bite I ate. And after the last bite I was so in lovee I used magic on myself to triple my size. I've haven't changed to fitting clothes, because, well, none of my clothes fit.\", Nabooru was so happy she just had to tell her they could help her with a feast they're preparing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------DURING THE FEAST-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda started speaking,\"Wow this looks so good! I'm betting all foods here are like this!\", as Nabooru replied,\"Yep, they all are, and we through in a few of your Hylian foods for you more than me. Oh speaking of which, thank you for the food. The amount I ate tasted great!\" They started digging in, they both ate as fast as they could, but Zelda beat her out  by 1 piece of food per 3 minutes against Nabooru's 5 minutes. They both grew large. Zelda a whopping 450 pounds while Nabooru was 350 pounds, the original weight Zelda weighed before this feast.<br>\r\n \"Doesn't this all taste so good!\", Nabooru said as the hylian princess replied cheerfully,\"Yes!!! It's so good, by this rate I'll be the 500 pounds that Link said he wanted for me!\" Nabooru commented on that, thinking aloud, \"I differ, I will weigh more than you ever will, even at my size compared to yours!\", and at that moment suprised at what Nabooru said the hylian princess Zelda grabbed as much as she could and shoved it in her mouth with slight ease, as she frowned at the confused Queen of the dessert. \"Well, I beg a differ against what you said. I know I'll be a good wait that will satisfy Link with my weight when you become a huge blob of blubber!\", as she threw a blubbery piece at Nabooru. Then out of nowhere, Link came inside the building telling Zelda that he got that 500 pound gem for her.\"...Link...500 pound?500 POUNDS! You got me thinking 500 ****ing pounds of fat! And look at me now!, my ass is a wide as 2 of those small chairs! My stomach is about 1 yard in front of me!!!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, this was a surprise. Princess Zelda herself was paying the Gerudo a visit? Nabooru was a tad shocked, since no arrangements were made beforehand. This meant one of two things: either there was some sort of emergency, or the Hylian princess just decided a surprise visit was the best course of action to take when meeting with a fellow ruler. If the latter were true, maybe it was a way to create a more casual air?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her in,\" Nabooru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard nodded and ran back to the door as fast as her pudgy frame would allow. By the time she got all the way over, she was huffing and wheezing as though she'd taken a jog around four different corridors. With a gront, she pulled the door open and signaled for the new guest to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing Zelda enter the throne room, Nabooru was able to tell the latter assumption was correct, thank the gods. She was walking in a dignified way, her posture upright and without slouch, yet her slow pace indicated she had nothing of urgency to talk about. Relieved at figuring out the true nature of the visit, the Gerudo matriarch  took stock of the Hylian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was all the woman she had been during the fight against Ganondorf. Even after the past year of rebuilding and stress, it was clear she hadn't lost a single bit of toned physique. Her flat stomach didn't make a single bulge in her dress, a sight no Gerudo had seen for months now. The blonde's chest was also smaller than the average tribe member's, but for a woman of her stature, it was sizable enough. While it couldn't be seen under her dress, the lack of a rear presence through the skirt indicated that it was also small and firm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking further up, it seemed as though Zelda had even developed a bit of visible muscle in her arms. Not enough, to be immediately obvious, but her biceps and triceps were somewhat visible now. Her face was also still as sharp and thin as one would expect from the leader of a country. While she had never seen Princess Zelda mad before, Nabooru got the feeling her smooth, yet still angular visage would do well in intimidating foes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving just before the foot of the throne, Princess Zelda kneeled and bowed her head, the ultimate show of respect from one ruler to another. Nabooru nearly whistled at the act. It took a great deal of maturity and devotion towards diplomacy to do something like that. For what other reason could Zelda be here for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Nabooru,\" the blonde began. \"Have you been well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have. Thank you for asking, but, please lift your head up.\" Zelda complied, and the former thief smiled. \"<i>There</i> we go. It just felt a little weird, seeing you do something so humbling. But enough of that. Tell me, Princess, what brings you all the way out to such a remote region?\" Using formalities was still something the young queen was getting used to, but it was getting easier and easier the more she did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda went from kneeling to standing in an instant, thanks to her lithe figure (which Nabooru couldn't help but note with just a touch of envy). Judging from the smile on the young woman's face, and the brightness in those azure eyes,it was clear she was glad the Gerudo queen was being so cordial. She chose a very good time to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Your Highness, as you know, in the eyes of most of the world, Hyrule has lost its standing as a benevolent territory. Even with Ganondorf's rule deposed, many other nations still view us as being a corrupt place that may invade them at any given moment. They greatly overestimate the number of Ganondorf sympathizers, and it's gotten to a point where trade relations and diplomacy could crumble apart,\" Zelda explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That <i>does</i> sound  like quite the predicament,\" Nabooru said, leaning back in her chair. Her flabby gut was only made more obvious as its full, un-constrained expanse was revealed to the world. \"You think there's something the Gerudo can do to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I believe so,\" the Hylian nodded. \"I'm sorry if this sounds rude at all, but many have been astounded by your people's ability to completely change their society into one that no longer relies on...unorthodox methods of gaining wealth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you flatter me, Princess!\" Nabooru's belly jostled as she let out a booming laugh at the sentiment. \"Don't worry, you don't have to dance around the fact we were a bunch of thieves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, sorry, Your Highness. But it's a major turning point for your nation, and I would like to propose a deal, if you'd be willing to hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please save your breath, Princess. I think I understand what this deal you're talking about is: you want to provide aid to our nation in order to help with our recovery. It'll show the Hylian people are willing to support former enemies that are willing to reform, and as a result, will help to boost the overall opinion of your country from other leaders. Which will inevitably help with trade negotiations and lessening the likelihood of war. Have I gotten the basic gist of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Zelda hadn't changed her largely stoic expression, her face was red as a tomato, causing Nabooru to smirk. Even as a relatively new ruler, she understood how embarrassing it could be to have someone see through you so easily. Resting her flabby chin on her pudgy hand, the Gerudo matriarch leaned on the arm of the throne as she pondered her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Zelda, I must commend you on your devotion to your plan. You've trekked through the desert, taken time out of your busy schedule, and have bared yourself to me in complete honesty. I appreciate your willingness to be upfront with all this, for sure.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Huh? O-oh, yes, of course,\" Zelda said with a nod. \"I would never ask you to make a decision right away. You haven't even heard the terms. Of course I'd be happy to be in your company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Princess, there's no need to get so flustered,\" Nabooru heaved her hefty body off the throne, with no small amount of effort, and began walking over to her guest. Her dark stomach and chest jiggled with every step she took. \"I''m not offended. After getting past all the trouble our former idiotic King put you through, it's expected that everyone'll make a few mistakes. So please, be a bit more cheerful, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda gave a genuine smile to the overweight queen, her happiness evident. Seeing that face re-ignited Nabooru's respect for the Hylian. So non-judgmental, so eager to help her people. And, from what she said earlier, the Gerudo as well. How could Nabooru not listen to a proposal from someone who was willing to help two nations at once? While there was the obvious benefit Hyrule would gain as a result, it was an idea most people would balk at, especially when there was no official alliance in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think politics can wait a bit, though.\" Nabooru said. \"After all, your journey must've been a hard one. You traveled from Hyrule through the Gerudo Desert to see me, no way you're in good condition now. And I'm not the type of person who'd ignore that in my guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen Nabooru, don't worry. I was well-cared for during my trip, it's not like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gurrrgle</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large, thunderous noise emanated from the blonde's gut and filled the room. For a moment, the Gerudo had no idea where it came from, but upon looking at Zelda's smoldering red face, they had their answer. Nabooru clicked her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Zelda, you're starving, aren't you? I bet you haven't eaten a thing all day!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda shuffled her feet, obviously mortified at such an improper bodily function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, no, I haven't, but it was just because there were more important things on my mind. Food-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is one of the most important aspects of life! Without it, we'd all keel over and turn to dust. I've made it my mission to make sure no one in my kingdom goes hungry, and as long as you're here, you're on that list. We need to get you fed, fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru grabbed one of Zelda's slender arms, pulling her along into the hallway, the dining hall set firmly in her mind's eye. The Hylian, for her part, could only gawk in surprise by the sheer determination the queen was exhibiting in her self-imposed race. Was not eating anything for a while a problem? She'd been planning on having dinner, but there was really no time to have breakfast or lunch, being in a wagon for most of the day, and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, while Zelda was hoping politics would be the first order of discussion, it wasn't as though having a meal with the leader of the country she was trying to curry favor with would be a bad thing. If anything, thinking about it a bit more, it might actually be advantageous. After all, eating with others almost always led to socialization, and warming Nabooru up a bit with some small talk would help to bring a more amicable air to things. It wasn't as though she was going to make any alternate suggestions; not showing respect to other figures of authority and seeming like you knew better with something as trivial as \"when to eat\" didn't send a good message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin another minute, the two young women arrived in front of a large set of oaken door. Upon Nabooru's signal, the two guards stationed in front went up and pushed them open, revealing the massive hall inside. The matriarch of the Gerudo tribe smiled with satisfaction as she saw Zelda's jaw drop the moment her eyes took in the sights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past, it was an old part of the castle that had been renovated under Nabooru's orders, a storage room that housed abandoned pieces of furniture and other things. Now, however, it was a sprawling area that could host a hundred people. The long, white-clothed table in the center dominated the view, but there were plenty of decorations littered about, like golden plates on the walls, a crystal chandelier hanging from the roof, a brown carpet that looked to be made of a woolen material, and a few paintings here and there of past influential Gerudo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressed, huh?\" Nabooru said with a laugh. \"I spent a couple months overseeing this place's development, you know. A queen and her subjects can't eat in anything less. And before you ask, no, all this gold and jewelry did <i>not</i> come from me confiscating it from the Gerudo that stole it from your people. Not a single carrot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course, yes. It's wonderfully furnished,\" Zelda agreed, regaining her composure (and ignoring the poorly-made lie). \"Your effort really payed off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru strode over to the nearest chair, the one right at the head of the southernmost end of the table. Plopping her tonnage down into it, a loud creaking noise could be heard, indicating the thing had gone through a lot of unprecedented strain as of late. Paying it no heed, Zelda walked over and took the nearest seat to the side, getting her herself comfortable as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about what you order, by the way. Anything you wish, my servants can grant...I mean, as long as you avoid stuff like greens or vegetables in general, really,\" Nabooru amended. \"Those have been falling out of style lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How come?\" Zelda asked, raising a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I dunno, probably because they're just not really tasty. Stuff like that, a lot of fruit, on their own without desserts, it's not exactly a party for your mouth. So, we really only use them as ingredients: apples for pie, potatoes for this new recipe one of my cooks made where you make this crunchy shell for it, cherries for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry, but none of that's available just to eat? You know, without something special being added, like sugary things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru shook her head, her tits belatedly following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, no. Is that a change from your normal diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda didn't know whether or not to tell the truth. It was, but not wanting to eat the food presented to her and forcing special accommodations to be made wasn't something she felt would go over well with her host. While she always refrained from eating \"luxurious\" types of food for fear of what it could do to her figure, surely a day or two of having it wouldn't mean much. And she knew plenty of exercises, so even if the Gerudo diet was lacking, she could pick up the slack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch as she didn't want to have these thoughts, the Hylian couldn't help it. Most of the people in this desert were overweight, plenty outright obese, and Nabooru just revealed a damning piece of evidence as to why. Nutritious food was apparently out of fashion here, instead in the process of being replaced with junk. Zelda knew the Gerudo were becoming a more peaceful people, but for them to throw away their admiration of physical fitness and healthy living was something she just couldn't grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a big deal at all,\" Zelda said resolutely. \"What would you recommend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabooru placed a finger on one of her double-chins, contemplating the question. A chubby waitress showed up, garbed in a slightly more exposed garb than most other Gerudo, her flabby legs and thighs exposed on top her potbelly, chest and arms. After a few moments of sorting through her various meals, Nabooru decided to make her order on top of the suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was going to get the grilled Octorok, with lemon on the side and an order of crispy potatoes, along with another dish of three steak and cheese sandwiches.\" As the waitress scribbled it all down, Nabooru gave Zelda a smile. \"That's my favorite combo. And you?\"</span></div></div>",

Ganondorf wanted to marry Nabooru, but she wasn't going to marry someone as evil as Ganondorf.  As punishment for refusing to wed him, Ganondorf sent Kotake and Koume--the two Gerudo witches--to punish Nabooru in any way they saw fit.  The two sisters quickly came up with a punishment for Nabooru;  They would place a curse on her that made her eat every bit of food that was placed in front of her.  Luckily, Nabooru met Link before the curse could be placed on her.   Later on, however, the two witches captured Nabooru and placed the eating curse on her.  Nabooru would have to wait seven long years before Link could save her from the twin witches.   During those seven years, the two sisters kept on placing a tablefull of food in front of Nabooru.  Nabooru would be in shackles and was forced to eat all the food in front of her...not that she could stop herself from eating.   Nabooru  quickly became fat with all the food....she became so fat, that she filled an entire room with her blubberly fat!  Then, seven years later, Link came to the Siprit Temple to save Nabooru and slay the two witches who had captured her.   Nabooru was fat beyond belief at that time, but she had awakened as a Sage....and with her Sage powers, she made herself skinny once again.

She still eats every bit of food that's placed in front of her...and she can't stop herself from eating...no matter how hard she tries. <br>\r\n        With the death of Ganondorf, Nabooru became Queen of the Gerudo.

In fact, several Hylian single men had come down to the Gerudo Desert and started to have  families with all the cute Gerudo females.  Link decided to stay for awhile, since the celebration at Hyrule Castle.  wouldn't start until evening.  At the celebration, there would be a grand feast that boasted to be the biggest feast in Hyrule history.  Link told Nabooru about the feast, and he sounded excited about it.  Nabooru took the news well in front of Link, but she was freaking out on the inside.  Nabooru would eat and eat until she was fat...and if she was fat, she couldn't attract mates.   Gerudo females loved to show off thier sexy skinny bodies in belly dances.  If Nabooru went to the feast, she wouldn't be skinny any more...she would be fat.   <br>\r\n        \"What's new with you?\" asked Link.<br>\r\n        \"Oh, nothing\" said Nabooru.  \"we just killed the last of the evil monsters that were in the Spirit Temple\"<br>\r\n        \"Oh...didn't I kill all of them?\" asked Link.  <br>\r\n        \"No...\" said Nabooru.   \"They were all in a room you must've missed\"<br>\r\n           \"Oh\" said Link,who frowned for a minute and then he remembered.  There was a room in the temple that he couldn't open at all...the door to the room would only open half a inch...if that.  He couldn't tell what was inside the room, or what was preventing the door from being opened.  <br>\r\n            \"Well, I guess nobody's perfect\" said Link. <br>\r\n           \"So...when is this celebration?\" asked Nabooru,  quickly  changing the subject.   She didn't want Link to know that it was her fat body that had prevented him from entering that one room in the temple.<br>\r\n          \"In the evening\" said Link.  It was around noon now. \"I thought I might stay here for a while and woo a cute Gerudo\"<br>\r\n              \"Oh, Link\" laughed Nabooru.  \"well...what are you planning to do?\"<br>\r\n           </span></div></div>",

The only thing  keeping her alive, is the fact that she is a goddess and she CAN'T die, no matter how much pain she is in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been 20 years since that fateful day. She is enormous. Then she looked, there was only one platter of food left. She ate it. She jumped for joy, though she couldn't really jump, nor do anything really. The magical chains stopped any magical power she had from working, and she was too overweight to do anything physical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she started stumbling in a direction. she couldn't control her body, just like when she was eating. She stumbled along to a fair, and she was set up on a stand, exhausted. She was then tied up and left in the sun. She recognized this place, it's was a slave market. Then she saw them, her sisters. They weren't in as bad a condition as her, but they must have been at least 300 pounds. She was over 100,000 tons. They looked at her in disbelief, they had magical chains as well. They then realized their destiny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer old red dress barely suited as a covering for her more private parts. Everyone was then taken away, but her. The troupe leader (now that he had replaced her) frowns. He said something about not selling. Then he turned to Din. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, girl. Looks like it's back to the tables with you. Don't worry, I'll make enough food to feed all of Hyrule for a billion years. Oh, and I mean that literally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDin grunted in pain. He smiled, and laughed maniacally. Then a man came up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! He yelled \"WAIT!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troupe stopped, and they talked for a bit. Then gold was exchanged and he was given Din's chain. The man grinned, then Din recognized him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link?\" she wondered \"Yes it's him. He'll save you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her hopes died as he said, \"Well Din, This is payback time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Just a note, let's try and keep this in third person, otherwise it can get a bit confusing.)</span></div></div>",

The breasts command respect all right, yet what about these love handles... And my butt! There's no way I can risk getting any bigger! My body can't take it!\" Displaying amazing will power, she turns around to walk out of the room, yet finds that the passageway she had just walked through was no longer there... Blanked out of existence. Startled, she turns around, just quickly enough to see a quick, ghostly hand shove a huge handful of food into her mouth, not even bothering to unwrap the sweets' wrapper. Before she can spit out the contents though, a small trickle of chocolate touches her tongue in her mouth... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before she knows it, she's sitting down in front of a several metre high pile of candy, unwrapping brick-sized pieces of fudge and mawing down on them as if she hadn't eaten for eons. Despite this sudden binge, Tetra was fully aware of what she was doing... Yet had little control over her own body. Every time she managed to get one of her arms to stop grabbing at another oozy piece of chocolate, her other hand would slap her, before shoving down an amount of sugary junk that her small hand couldn't possibly of been holding, her unwilling mouth straining as her free hand slamming down on the pile of sweets to go down. As chunk after chunk of food was rammed down into her mouth, Tetra slowly drifted off, her mouth apparently giving up the fight to prevent what was to become an enormous gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came to, the pile was finally finished, and all that remained was a pile of several thousand chocolate coated wrappers, with a huge, oozing and jiggling stomach erupting from Tetra's shirt, weighing 250 pounds on its own. Her pants thankfully still fit, yet each cheek was far rounder, and her legs were the size of a pirate mast each. Her arms look as round as balloons, her dainty hands nearly sinking into the lard of her upper arms. Her brand new breasts, while still miraculously still covered by her shirt, had absolutely no modesty; each looked the size of a basket ball. Tetra could feel the gooey remains of the candy she had just gorged on oozing all over her body, sticking into awkward crevices she wasn't sure she'd ever be able to reach again. To add to her humiliation, her arms and hands still had a life of their own, excitedly prodding her boobs and stomach, seemingly trying to lift them up to embrace her lardness, her toes wiggling madly like they belonged to an excited school girl. Her face however, is one of dread... Or perhaps intense fury. Though she didn't exactly have anyone to be angry at... Or so she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty heave, she lifts herself up, and turns around just in time to see behind her... </span></div></div>",

If it weren\u2019t for her bulky size, Tetra would\u2019ve lunged herself at this jerk, sword first. So instead, she settled for swearing her mouth off at her, which was still dripping with fudge and chocolate, her hands refusing to clean up Tetra\u2019s piggish appearance. \u201cHey, calm down! I have a tendency to laugh at things when I\u2019m nervous\u2026 NOTHING to do with your huge weight, just happy to finally see somebody down here! My name\u2019s Sabrina!\u201d She strolled over, and Tetra noticed that for her age, she was quite attractive; nice curves, skimpy clothes to accentuate said curvy-ness and a wild hair do\u2026 She also quickly realised that it\u2019d of been impossible for her to enter this room after herself, as it had been sealed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Sabrina, if you\u2019re so happy, then maybe you can explain how you managed to get in here? My name\u2019s Tetra and this place suddenly became sealed off when I walked in! Next thing I knew I was being force fed huge blocks of fudge!\u201d The girl seemed to reflect on this a bit, and then seemed to come to a conclusion that would satisfy the pile of lard and boobs in front of her. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve, eh, been in here for weeks\u2026 Went treasure hunting, walked in here and got trapped in. Managed to live off taking a nibble every now and then, and the chocolate fountain for drinks. Watching my frame a bit, heh heh\u2026\u201d A chocolate fountain? Tetra realized that despite eating a literal ton amount of food, she was becoming peckish again, yet her hunger would have to wait. A minute. Two at the most. \u201cYeah, well think some weird apparition thing possessed the lower half of my body\u2026 My hands have been doing all the force feeding, and WA-\u201c Before she could finish, her huge, droopy arms began to grip at her shorts, ripping them with an unnatural amount of force, while her chest suddenly gave a mighty shove towards her top, almost instantly disintegrating her favourite top. Her legs started to bend a bit, and her arms seemed to follow suit, running their way over her several fat rolls, occasionally spanking her huge, exposed ass. In other words, her possessed body had decided that now was a perfect time to give a complete stranger, and to complicate matters, a GIRL of all people, a strip tease. At 800 pounds. \u201cSHI- You see what I mean!? I swear they have a mind of their own, yet I still have to go through all the embarrassment!\u201d While her body continued to slowly move a bit, now bending over towards the girl, her ass with her panties stretched well into her cheeks moving right up to her, that the girl didn\u2019t seem surprised, or even humoured. She tried to gain a better look through her blob-ish arm, and came to a terrifying conclusion: the girl had a seductive smile on her face, while with her finger, she seemed to be a conductor controlling an orchestra, yet in this case, the orchestra was Tetra\u2019s huge body. Finally, the strip teasing stopped as Tetra realized this, and she fell over with a mini-earthquake the weight of her front stomach far heavier than her dimpled cheeks. The rolled around to see the girl walk right on top of her, and then lied chest down on her stomach, a large, mischievous grin stretched out on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tend to think actions speak louder than words. Unless you\u2019re even stupider than I first assumed you were you\u2019d of realised that I\u2019m controlling the majority of your body\u2019s movement. Now, I\u2019m hoping that you\u2019ve already reached a conclusion as to what I\u2026\u201d And now she rolled over on her back and began to shake a bit, seemingly embracing the pirate girl\u2019s huge stomach. \u201cFind irresistible in a partner. Heh heh, you don\u2019t have a CLUE as to how long I\u2019ve been waiting for somebody to do stuff with; normally it\u2019s some dumb pirate looking into the rumour that there\u2019s treasure here; naturally I leave a chest or two lying around this temple so that myth continues and somebody matching my\u2026 Ahem, preferences shall we say, comes along. In retrospect, female pirates aren\u2019t that common, yet when I first came here, I assumed all that girl power stuff was going to amount to something significant.\u201d She sat up now, and started to walk her fingers up Tetra\u2019s body, right up to her chubby cheeks. \u201cI just love a girl with a \u2018large\u2019 aura to them, and I can tell you from personal experience that you\u2019re definitely the cutest girl I\u2019m come across to completely smash the scales. SO\u2026 What do you say we do first, my little fatty watty Tetra?\u201d </span></div></div>",

She felt like she could move before, but no under this little girl's fierce stare, she felt powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Sabrina yelled. \"No, no, no, no, no, NO!\" she spat stomping her feet, sending quakes up Tetra's massive belly. \"You AREN'T leaving,\" She said running away from Tetra, disappearing around a column, returning with a large tube. She plunged the tube into Tetra's mouth, and Tetra grunted with anger. Out of nowhere Sabrina suddenly smirked triumphantly, and a thick liquid began pouring down Tetra's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each pump Tetra was pushed slightly backwards, only jiggle back forward again, her massive ass bouncing her back causing her boobs to bounce atop her round belly. Pump after pump the liquid poured down her throat, and she felt her stomach fill up, swelling and growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most disturbing part about the entire ordeal was that Tetra was enjoying it. Each gulp sent a warm feeling into her stomach, which then dispersed to her entire body. She couldn't help but close her eyes and moan in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The entire ordeal felt orgasmic and with as the rhythmic pumping continued she felt even more pleasure. Suddenly she felt the tube being yanked out of her mouth, and also liquid splattering all over face and boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes, welcomed (if you will) by a panoramic view of her entire jiggling body, which was still shaking from the tube. The warm brownish liquid--which she was only now realizing was melted chocolate--was dripping slowly down the sides of her belly, slowly sliding down towards the floor, and Sabrina standing right in the middle of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetra could tell she was obviously much fatter. Her boobs were now the size of a general store, and her belly was even larger. Underneath her chin she felt the presence of massive double chin, or maybe even a triple chin. Her legs were nowhere in sight, but she could feel squishy mounds of fat pressing against her feet. Sabrina was in standing in Tetra's cleavage, stroking her left boob delicately and lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to reach out and grab her, she was going to choke the little bitch, even though she had to admit she wasn't particularly disliking the experience so far. But nothing happened, she glanced to the left, just to see a giant mound of fat, bouncing around each time she tried to move her arm. She was stuck here, at the mercy of the little girl stroking her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so cute with chocolate all over your face, Teehee,\" she giggled.</span></div></div>",

Tetra shot her a furious look as the witch girl started to fondle it fantically. Though she could give her one thing; the look of intense desire on her face at least proved she was genuinely love-struck, if not also completely unhinged. Sabrina motioned at Tetra's face. \"Awww, this feeling nice for you, piggy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter growing (slightly) bored of groping her chest, Sabrina made her way back to Tetra's face, scooping up debris of dribbled food in her cupped hands and feeding them back to Tetra, who reluctantly sucked it back up. \"So, whatcha wanna do Tetra?\" Sabrian cooed as she started to lose herself in the pirate girl's dark cat eyes. \"Well, first I want to know outside of the obvious lust thing why you decided to put me through all this.\" She couldn't be bothered to curse or threaten the girl with the irritating grin in front of her: both of them knew they'd obviously be empty and impossible at Tetra's size. Sabrina snapped back from her daze. \"Eh? What'd you say?\" \"You heard me you little bitch!\" Sabrina rolled back into Tetra's immense neck fat laughing and feeling her mass at the same time. \"Ooooh, I LOVE it when you get all pouty!

CONFESS HOW INTENSELY YOU LOVE ME!!!\"<br>\r\n  \"......alright you crazy bitch, listen to me and listen to me good. See this?\" Tetra adjusted so she was covering both of her mountainous mounds with one arm, allowing her to gesture to her massive amounts of mass with the other, \"all of this is coming OFF. I will NOT get keep BIGGER, i will get SMALLER. You're NOT making me you're island of love, I'm LEAVING, and I DO NOT LOVE YOU. If at any time you try to stop me, you'll pay for it.\"<br>\r\n  \"NO!\" Screamed the witch, \" WE WILL MAKE YOU THE ISLAND OF OUR LOVE!!\"<br>\r\n  \"Well, cant say I din't warn you.\" She promptly whistled, as if to call a dog. A green and blue blur rushes by.<br>\r\n  \"Who is THIS!?!?\" demanded Sabrina<br>\r\n  \"THIS, you little shit, is the cavalry, or as I like to call him, Link. Link,\" she called, snapping him to attention(HOLYSHITSHE'SHUGE!!!!),\" kick her bu-\" She then saw the cause of the the blue in the blur.<br>\r\n  \"WHY THE HELL DID YOU BRING YOU LITTLE SISTER ON MY RESCUE MISSION!?!?!?\" Aryll gave her a look of disdain.<br>\r\n  \"Hey, less complaining, more getting rescued, okay?\" After that Tetra just cheered them on as they fought for her, but they were beginning to lose.<br>\r\n  \"Big brother,\" Aryll called, \" do we HAVE to try operation delta?\" He nodded. Without another word Aryll ran up to tetras belly, bounced above her head, and dove mouth open. Suddenly, Tetra was in darkness. The force of the fall had shoved Tetra down(up?) the girls throat. Aryll was still not fat, but she ran out of the room with a massive, struggling belly.<br>\r\n  \"HEY! THROW ME UP!\"<br>\r\n  \"Sorry, Tet, but it'll have to wait till we're safe!\" After an hour of fleeing, Sabrina screamed<br>\r\n  \"YOU WILL NOT STOP ME AND MY LOVER!\" and let loose an explosion that knocked Aryll into the air, landing with such force the fatty Tetra flew out of her mouth. Suddenly,Tetra got an idea.<br>\r\n  \"LINK! Send some MAGIC my way!\" He was confused, but shot some magic at her hip all the same. It bounced off her sword, the floor, link's shield, and the ceiling, then strait into Tetras mouth. Her stomach churned. It gurgled. It GROANED! and all the fat flowed from her body to her belly until proportions (except one) were normal again. She grinned a mischievous grin and started rubbing the sides of her belly. She rubbed faster and faster until; \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" Like a mighty hurricane, louder than thunder, Tetra blasted Sabrina, eventually blowing her out of the cavern(through a wall) revealing an exit. Throughout the belch, Tetra's belly deflated, reverting until it was it's normal size once more. She found her old clothes. They were a bit torn, but they'd do. She then turned to Aryll.<br>\r\n  \"We NEVER, speak of this again?\"<br>\r\n  \"Agreed\" And Link just nodded.</span></div></div>",

I wouldn't say something like that in a million years! If you can even control what I can say, why not just take me over entirely? Seriously, what's your problem!?'

Answer my question!\" Yet she only let out a small grunt. \"...\" \"C'mon, I wanna answer here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why you're getting all angry on me, Tetra.

For both of us.\" She quickly climbed to Tetra's face and slumped her head into her hands. \"THAT is 'my problem'. Besides...\" And she once again broke into her baby-ish tone, \"Doesn't Tetra like being a huge, blobby toy for me? C'mon, I know from my days on the surface that I was irresistible to ANYONE, so don't tell me you aren't even a tiny bit interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter if I turn YOU on! I'm not... Like that. I'm happy to stuff myself into immobility, but that's only because that's all I really have left. Even if I was happy like this, I'd still never be attracted to you in a million years!\" \"Oh... Oh, don't worry! I know a way my little blobby wobby Tetra can make the same romantic leap I have! So, even though I know that you're secretly just as crazy for me in this slim curvy state as I am for you in your mountain of lard state, if your little brain is what's stopping us, I can help with that in a flash!' She struck a pose, leaning one of her hips to the side while her feet sank into Tetra's stomach, and poked Tetra's stubby nose. \"There. Now if you could move, you really would be all over me!\" She giggled a bit and stroked Tetra's skin, and was met with a giggle rather than a yell. \"See, my little piggy wiggy!\" Tetra grinned for the first time since getting trapped to Sabrina, and blushed a bit at what she now saw as a romantic gesture from Sabrina. Despite this, a thought still lingered on in the back of her head: \"Shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where were we? Oh, RIGHT.\" With a wave of a hand, Tetra found that she was easily able to lift her 1200 pounds of flesh with complete and utter ease. So of course, with escape now seemingly possible, she walked to a wall and started to lean against it, her round ass directed right at Sabrina. \"Ooooh, ooh, before you start, lemme quickly  do something!\" Sabrina piped in. Cue waving of hand. A gust of smoke, and Tetra was fully clothed in her favorite pirate garb again. \"I looooove the look of ripping clothes! Now shake it Tetra!\"</span></div></div>",

All the while, she was dancing, teasingly, sending lazy waves across her soft body. Slowly, she sped up, and as she got down to just her underwear, she was gyrating her body wildly, her huge belly slapping against her thick legs, her buns dancing and shaking crazily, her boobs rising and falling, tumbling against her insufficient underwear.

Grabbing another log, she dangled it over Sabrina, where she couldn't reach due to Tetra pinning her down due to her bulk. \"Try begging for it Sabrina! C'mon, beg!\" The witch girl, who'd already made herself insanely ravenous, nearly yelled out. \"Pleeeeeeeease Tetra! I'm sooooo hungry!\" With a giggle, Tetra shoved it in, along with ten others, barely giving the girl time to breath. As she felt Sabrina's breasts balloon and press against hers and her stomach ooze out from underneath her, Tetra practically moaned in delight; she could very, very easily get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter most of the piles were gone, Sabrina had already put on another 300 pounds; not quite as large as Tetra, but still a large, towering girl practically bursting in blubbery goodness. Pulling herself up, Tetra quickly recovered the fountain tube, and brought it over to Sabrina, and shoved it in. With each gulp, another inch grew on Sabrina; Tetra completley failed to resist the urge to start stroking her growing body. Yet finally, the pump started to slow down, and Sabrina took out the pump, and slowly hovered up to her feet. \"Well, Tetra? How do I look? Stunning?\" With a huge blush and grin, Tetra nodded her head. It was only afterwards she thought that maybe acting a bit more patronizing would've been better for her own situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was. Her stomach nearly swept the ground, her thighs were absolutely gargantuan, yet her massive stomach still slightly engulfed them, and her bare breasts were bouncy enough to be just about begging a very promiscuous Tetra to lunge at them. \"Though I'm glad that you're still larger; wouldn't want my little butter-ball to feel overshadowed.\" With a pause, Tetra looked down at herself; she was just about in the three thousands thanks to the constant forced feeding; Sabrina hadn't even reached one thousand. \"Eh, Sabrina, didn't you want to be 'enormous'?\" \"Well DUH silly! But obviously I want you to dwarf me... I can tell in your face you're still turned on!\" While her emotions were even more ecstatic than before, she couldn't help but feel a bit baffled as to what the plan was in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a mental lightbulb lit up. Waddling over to Sabrina, she started to delve back into her lustful-self, though the gropping of her boobs was something she did more subconsciously. \"Well, that was fun, wasn't it? But you know what would really get me into the mood, witchy?\" She started to slide her titanic butt against her. \"And I mean, really, REALLY into the mood? So much we'll practically be wrestling over each other forever? Because as much as I'm into all this, I just don't feel like we're far enough in this relationship...\" This was a lie. If there was any other way, Tetra would LOVE to be doing her right now, but there wasn't any real way for Sabrina to be able to tell this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh god, quickly Tetra, TELL ME!\" The girl was already sweating and twitching again, even partially moaning. \"To really, really make me feel like we're ready, I want to...\"</span></div></div>",

She wondered why...perhaps because she had some company?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought was interrupted as Sabrina's power struggle began to manifest as a bright light. Still, Sabrina continued to bend her powers to the sole goal of making Tetra a divine being. Her let out a scream as her mental battle reached it's zenith and enveloped the room in a bright light. It was almost blinding as Tetra had to shield her eyes from the reality-bending wave of energy was released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes still closed, Tetra heard Sabrina say, \"I...

But as she glanced over to examine her, Sabrina had satisfied look on her face. Tetra was confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she did \"succeed,\" then what happened...?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With amazing willpower, she ignored it and tried to do jumping jacks to keep her mind off the hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, as you can imagine, the whole exercising thing didn't work out to well. It's not that she was too big to move her arms and legs (though she was getting close with that mountain of a stomach), it was that she was too big to even jump a millimeter off the ground. And the VERY tiny distance she did jump, when she went down she was sweating a river and couldn't even attempt to do another one. With that and her unbearable hunger added to the mix, she wasn't going to lose any weight anytime soon. Actually she wouldn't lose it ANY time, period. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" thought Tetra, \"Since I can't get rid of the weight and I can't seem to be able to stop myself from gaining more, why resist anymore?

Taking a handful of melting caramel, she already starts to moan at the taste as it flows down her stomach. So she mawed down even more furiously than last time at her greased up food, thrilled at how godly her body\u2019s about to become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even a third of the way through, and Tetra finally becomes aware of something; the cave has slowly dissolved away during her titanic binge, and now all that remains is a large tropical island with her gigantic body stretched across its shores.

Each breast was the size of a small house, her butt stretched across nearly half of the beach and her stomach was creeping steadily into the ocean, which wouldn\u2019t of been as impressive if the tide wasn\u2019t 20 yards away from where she was sitting. Her belly button could\u2019ve easily fit several people; heck, her stomach was soft enough that simply touching it would drag half your body into her beautiful tanned lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet despite the huge space her body pre-occupied, she felt a strange sense of movement amongst her flesh. Unable to do much about it due to her obvious immobility, she could only wait as this unidentified object made its way to her head. As it finally made its way to her head, with a small snorkel emerging from Tetra\u2019s layers of fat only JUST high enough to avoid being drowned in flab, a girl suddenly hopes out and hugs Tetra around her stuffed and bewildered face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s\u2026</span></div></div>",

Try!\" Tetra was about to retort, yet found that, despite her legs and feet being submerged by several metres of flab... She could walk. Really, really easily! \"That... Is really, really weird!\" Tetra tried running, and found that as if by some unseen force, her waves of fat were held up, giving her legs enough room to move.

Looking closer, she realized that their ship had been absolutely dwarfed in size by another ship, decked with several anchors and hundreds of portholes per row. Their ship's length barely made up a fifth of this colossal ship's. When she squinted, she could *just* make out the silhouette of a happy couple, or a rotund man or portly woman feasting. \"Heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetra quickly gathered her crew into a huddle. \"Right men, we've hit the jackpot, but we've gotta think this assault through.\" Thinking over it, she realized there wasn't actually that much thinking required. \"...

Annoyed, she lay down on her stomach and started to mope. After her treatment by Moblins she wasn\u2019t anywhere near the depressed state she was in earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, when she stopped and thought about it, Medli wasn\u2019t depressed or worried about her predicament at all. She was just really, really damn hungry. Before she could act on this, she felt a nudge against her backside. Then another one. Then one closer to her bubbly butt. Jumping up, she turned around to see a startled pig dash off. Just then, an idea formulated in her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly crawling her way up to the group of pigs, she spied around for what they could possibly be feeding on if the island was seemingly deserted. Then she saw it, and was surprised she didn\u2019t earlier; a large, almost-water tower like structure, with a small valve under neath it, with a trough leading off underneath it. Every so often, the valve would undo and a gush of mush would flow out, before automatically closing up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any other situation, she\u2019d of been grossed out. However, in the context of being stuck on a desert island with no way back home, it was some kind of blessing. A blessing that\u2019d force her to demean herself immensely, but she was only among pigs anyway. Rushing up to the trough, she wedged herself in-between a pair of incredibly round pigs and started to shovel the food in her large mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWet, soggy and rotten, was the taste Medli was expecting. Warm, creamy and sugary was what she actually did taste. With a large butt thrust either end to send the nearyby pigs waddling away, she dug in, slurping up as much as she possibly could, almost entirely forgetting where she was or her situation. Instead, her mind was filled with visions of gorging on this weird, mysterious food for as long as she could possibly fathom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good six hours later\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But as the sun set it suddenly dawned upon her how long she had been doing nothing but stuffing her face. Her concern was evident, and as she sluggishly got to her feet she could already feel the weight of the six hours that had passed. She peered about the island, spying a small spring, but still spring on the far end. She gripped her belly as she waddled to it, finding a gullet as stuffed as her's makes moving very difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, through her pronounced waddle and layers of flab, a part of her liked the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No,' she thought to herself, 'It's merely the hunger potion still at work.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was the truth, or perhaps only denial, she regardless reached the water's edge. Peering in, to the still, mirror-like surface of the pool, she got saw a clear image of herself peering back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her alright, although a much wider and stuffed her. The effects of her meal were incredibly more evident in her reflection. Even under the 300 pounds of fat she had packed on at the fortress, her stomach noticeably pressed out enormous and round. It was not fat, not yet anyways, simply her meal pressing out her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she kept eating like that, she thought, she'd get a whole lot bigger. A thought of living with the pigs, and eating the sweet nectar that was dispensed from the valve, every day briefly crossed her mind. How delicious it would be... How it would tickle her tongue and fill her belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. No, what a terrible thought. She glanced back briefly to the trow where the pigs were feeding, and then her eyes again looked at the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA double chin had formed on her fat face, and she had developed a pair of enormous breasts from all that blubber. Her chubby hips jutted out enough to give her a feminine figure despite her enormous stomach. Her formerly loose-fitting dress was now tearing at the sides, and couldn't even reach her belly button. Her panties peaked out from under her stomach, white and very stretched.  For the first time, it hit her how tight her clothing had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedli sighed, and decided it was best to just sleep for the night. In the morning she'd look around the island for anything she could use to escape. Besides, the meal had made her tired. Precariously, she peeled her dress off and placed it on a soft patch of grass - it was horribly stretched, but would make a nice enough blanket for the time being. She curled up with it, and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the morning light, Medli arose. Her meal from the night before digested, her stomach was smaller, but it's contents had been spread through her body and added another thin layer of fat. Groggily, she pat at her tummy and mumbled happily and lazily for a few minutes before getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggily, she lazily waddled over to the pool of water she had looked into earlier and washed her face with it's contents. She took several mouthfuls of water, slowly waking up. The thought passed her mind that, perhaps, if she were trapped on this island that this would become her morning routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedli got up and looked at her dress. Even with it as stretched as it was, she doubted she could get it back on. For the time being, she would hook it on a tree so it would not blow away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her morning over and her wise awake, she decided it was about time her her to have a really good look around. There must be a way off the island, after all. So she began to look around everywhere. Truth be told, there wasn't much to see. One one end was the pig's trough, that got filled with foodstuff from the water tower, and the pool a short ways away. In the island's centre, there were a few trees. The island was small and fairly flat, though the edges were rather rocky. Despite that, though, at her weight, Medli found she got winded walking from one end to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the trough and sat down in a huff. She reflected on her situation. There seemed to be little she could use here. She looked at the water tower feeding the pigs, and suddenly it occurred to her that someone probably owns the island. Perhaps they're raising pigs here? Surely they would come back if she could only wait a week or so. Someone has to give the pigs food, or check up on them. So, she decided, if she just stays put, she will surely be found eventually!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the pump opened, and filled the trough with that sweet milky substance she loved. She eyed it, licking her lips. She has food, she has water, and the pigs could keep her company... Everything for a reasonably comfortable existence. Besides, it'll make a good vacation from her regular duties for a while. Yeah, she thought, she could grow to like it here. Her mind pondered over this thought, and she was lost inside her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mechanical sound shut the trough pump, knocking her out of her deep thinking. She looked up and wiped her mouth, suddenly realizing she had been eating the sweet mixture ever since the pump started... Several hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedli got up, and decided to...</span></div></div>",

Her DD boobs became legendary HHs that had all the same perkiness of DDs. Her stomach became a flabby table for her tits as it just barely didn\u2019t touch the floor and had completely squished her navel flat. All of its previous rolls became a flowing river of belly fat. Her love handles bolstered out past her already massive hip size. Her booty and back fat now became connected into one solid layer of protruding, THICC fat. Her legs became the star attraction, though. Her thighs were near spherical and bloated with so much fat as to look like the pillars of a temple. And resting on them was a meaty, smooth, bubbly, saggy, thicc, fat piece of ass. Her rump had become so deep with fat that a human could stuck their whole arm into FaiMed\u2019s ass fat and still not feel bone. A new entity of big, beautiful woman had been created: FaiMed. She wanted to test her strength by lifting an immense rock within the fairy fountain. Getting to the rock took a while as FaiMed could only waddle with the slowest of snails at this point. Every step caused a mini earthquake from her mass. Tremors were visible on her body fat. Her ass practically leaped up and down, making a slight slapping sound against her pillar-like thighs. Her boobs would sometimes smack her in the face from their lack of modesty. Her cheeks had near obscured her vision and forced her to close her eyes. However with the  Magic eyes of a diary and the sharp eyes of a Ruto, FaiMed had the best vision across the seas. When she got to the rock, she took her hands and placed them under a surface the rock hung off of. Belly, boobies, and ass flailing wildly, she easily lifted the 10 ton rock over her head and crushed it in her hands, releasing several fairys trapped within. Her voice sounded of both Medli and Ms. Fairy combined, shouted with blubber jiggling everywhere, \u201cALLLLRIGHT! IM THE BEST CREATURE ACROSS THE SEAS!!!\u201d She slammed her left foot down, registering a mini earthquake for a good 7 seconds. She had become a wonder of the seas. A big, thicc enigma.</span></div></div>",

She then flipped the now blobby princess over and shoved her face between her ass cheeks. As she did this, Zelda let loose a fart to rival even FaeMed herself that resounded across the seas. *PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFARRGGGFFFFFFFFFFGHHHHHHHHHHHTTTTT* FaeMed came out of Zelda\u2019s ass cheeks chuckling and said, \u201cMy goodness someone must be excited to see me.

As Zelda was served the main course of the never ending chocolate pudding, FaeMed pulled her head up from the ground with one hand to force the treat into her mouth. While Zelda\u2019s bloating body practically caused her to rise from her ocean of stomach and tit fat, FaeMed repeatedly slapped her ass over and over again. Sometimes she\u2019d just go for purely hearty smacks. Other times she\u2019d do more of a grabby grab. Sometimes she\u2019d even snarl like a dog and chew a tiny bit of Zelda\u2019s booty.

Her tits rivaled the size of some sharks in the seas. Her stomach now dragged with immense and slippery force against the floor and pushed out 6 inches further than her boobs. Her wider and chubby face still had Medli\u2019s appearance but now with long flowing blonde hair of the princess with highlights of brown from Medli and silver from Ms. Fairy. Her love handles could practically be used as their own swinging weapons. Her thigh fat now extended to the farthest reach and connected to the highest bumps of her grandiose toshie. Her long flowing hair grew to hide her now severely long and ugly big butt crack and went down to and dragged with quite a bit of length on the floor. Her skin had become the perfect complexion of a light tan. And through it all was the ultimate symbol of cuteness: the duck bill. Saggy would\u2019ve been an understatement for her body ass her ass was getting ever close to dragging on the ground if it weren\u2019t so perky yet flabby.

She looked down to see that bed was now a mass of splinters, but fortunately for her the mattress protected her flabby skin from any rogue shards of wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedli had a difficult enough time adapting to adapting to a weight of 400 pounds, but at 1200 pounds she was immobile.  He belly draped over seven feet in front of her, lying heavily on the cold floor of her dungeon.  The slightest motion caused it to wobble and bounce, making her substantial rolls of fat slap against the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to reach forward to poke the jiggling mass that was her waste but her breasts prevented her from doing so.  They were now nearly Chuchu size, and far more jiggly than her belly.  In a moment of glory she smiled;  how could anyone resist a chest as jiggly and soft as hers?  Her breasts were so large that they obscured her vision, after all, to the point where it was impossible for her to see her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of investigating her belly she decided to see how else her new weight affected her body.  She turned her head around as far as she could (which was much harder than before due to her rounded face and four new chins) and was surprised at her large her rear had grown.  Her rear was nearly as wide as her bed was, which was far longer than she was tall to begin with, and she was certain that it had done much to destroy the bed.  Each cheek must have weighed more than she did before her gain, at that.  The more Medli thought about her gain, the more amazed she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes wandered over to her legs, large sacks of fat that tapered off towards her feet.  She tried to move them, but it took large amount of effort to slide them even an inch, much less move them around.  She could still move her feet around a bit, but the ability to wiggle her toes would be of little help to her in this predicament.  Her arms were in a similar state, although they were definitely easier to move.  It still took some effort on her part, but she could bring them to her face, which would be helpful.  If she could get out of this dungeon it would take a lot of food to keep her from getting hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she realized that she had been so distracted by her weight that she hadn't even taken the time to see what time it is.

It\u2019s not like I can move, and the only things even close to being strong enough to lift my weight are going to make sure I pack on as many pounds as possible\u2026 Ugh, it wouldn\u2019t be as bad if I didn\u2019t keep on getting the feeling that a part of me WANTS to get fatter.

How are you enjoying yourself?\u201d He jeered, grabbing handfuls of her rolls in his huge paws, feeling how Medli\u2019s body practically oozed over his toned hands. Medli wanted to shudder, yet instead let out a giggle. He leant through the bars and, with a flick of a huge tongue, gave the side of her belly a lick. THEN, Medli shuddered.  \u201cMmm\u2026 Could defiantly use some flavour, but whatever. Those runts\u2019ll think of something to whip up. So\u2026 Eh\u2026\u201d He paused for a minute, with Medli unable to tell from her position if he was mockingly thinking of a patronizing word, or if he was too dim witted to of actually thought of what to say next. \u201cUm\u2026 Happy? I guess?\u201d He finally let out. Medli nearly screamed her response back, yet her breasts muffled a bit of the loudness. \u201cHappy!? HAPPY!?! I get caught by Moblins, fattened up for their disgusting king to immobility so he can feast on me, then get handed over to another horrible Moblin king who\u2019s not only making me ten times fatter, but also trying to chat me up before gobbling me up, and you expect me to be nothing less than in high spirits?\u201d The king simply chuckled. \u201cWell, for half the time you\u2019re defiantly in bliss. Especially while eating. I wouldn\u2019t call that mistreatment.\u201d \u201cOnly because you\u2019ve drugged me to feel that way while I eat! Why are you even here? Shouldn\u2019t you be shoving my face full with cake or something?\u201d The Moblin started to pace around a bit, perhaps trying to seem more refined and sophisticated then he really was, yet Medli couldn\u2019t see him half the time due to her boobs anyway. \u201cWell, I just want to make sure that my food died happily before I ate it. It\u2019s like being a vegetarian you see, except you only eat things that died while in good spirits. Or whatever tastes good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cackled as he strolled off, yet before he left the large jail room, he pushed a button next to the door, which lowered the bars on Medli\u2019s cell, almost instantly sending her off rolling a bit. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have HEAPS of meals to keep me satisfied until you\u2019re ready. I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re nice and plump, believe me.\u201d He closed the door, and before she knew it, the roars of anger that she\u2019d heard from him earlier were back. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to give you idiots a break, so you have two weeks to fatten the girl up! I\u2019ll only eat her when there\u2019s NOTHING but that girl in the room! Give her every single piece of food we have! Feed her more potion too you runts, she\u2019ll go out of her way to eat more then! Triple her weight every night!

As it went down her through, she almost moaned in delight, and, with considerable effort considering her arms were now about 100 pounds put together, grabbed the cake right out of the moblin\u2019s arms and vacuumed it up instantly, giving a flirty wave to him as he left and starting on the next bakery monstrosity.

Not only that, but her carnal urges were preventing her from doing anything but act on those thoughts.

I eh.. Just like your tits.\u201d Moblins weren\u2019t the most tactful at wooing the ladies, yet considering Medli\u2019s mental state, she loved the statement. \u201cOh gawd, I know! How huge are they? Now, that is what I call an attention grabber.\u201d Medli\u2019s huge urge of food became outweighed by her huge urge for male attention at this point. \u201cMike, you really are a sweet guy\u2026\u201d She started to blush and flicker her eyes a bit, shifting her gaze. Mike, never really even getting close to a before girl before, was lovestruck. \u201cWell, eh\u2026 I guess I could try and make the boss rethink his plan on eating you, Medli\u2026 Duhh\u2026. You\u2019re really cute.\u201d The moblin got up and slid down the hill of flesh that was Medli, and walked towards the door, which was now a great deal closer than it had been earlier that day.

Now, why the hell should I do that, I yell at him. And he tells me that apparently, most\u2019ve you\u2019s would be made of fat and little else anyhows. No idea how dumbo here would know something like that, yet double checking with our Moblin docs, turns out you\u2019d kill me in the first couple bites\u2026. Ouch. So here\u2019s what I\u2019m doing; considering the runts here seem to have a weird fancy for you, especially Mikey-boy here, you\u2019ll still get fed. However, you ain\u2019t EVER going thin again. It\u2019ll make you actually edible, and I doubt the other guys here will still get giddy over your name. What\u2019da got to say to THAT, eh?\u201d \u201cUmm\u2026 Eh, okay. The entire point of this was to get you to feed me yet not eat me, so that\u2019s hardly a bargain. But I accept!\u201d She yelled giddily, giggling madly at the prospect of more junk food going down her gullet. The King grumbled and walked off, obviously confused as to whether he had gotten the best bargain or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the King left, Mike\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She raised a mighty arm and slapped her huge, sprawling cheeks, the slap causing her dimpled rump to quake and jiggle with such force that the rest of her body was practically being massaged by the miniature tremors of Mount. Medli\u2019s ass. \u201cOf course, can\u2019t have too much of anything these days. Heh.\u201d She added mentally to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet before she could do anything else, another troop of Moblins walked in, each with even huger, more appetizing cakes than the day before! \"I knew you guys wouldn't let me down!\" Medli cried, clapping her flabby hands together excitedly. As each one strolled in and shoved a cake down Medli's mouth, she gobbled each one happily, and like usual, flirted with every single one of 'em. This lasted for awhile, and other than her ass getting even huger, yet now with a huge, parachute sized piece of underwear covering everything only slightly better than her last pair (by now, they'd decided if Medli wasn't going to get eaten, she may as well be clothed more properly), her breasts getting even bouncier and her mind getting even more warped, everything was fairly normal. As they walked out the room, she waved at each one with a sweet grin, and then started to lie back, satisfied she'd had a nice meal, started to have some 'alone' time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly relaxing herself after working through one of the hugest and unhealthiest meals ever eaten (with room to spare, of course), she started to rest her head back into her neck fat, that slowly enveloped her head. Grinning at just how much she had gained, Medli lazily did several poses to one of the many mirrors in her room. While it was obvious that they were originally there to discourage her ever escaping, now she just saw them as great way to marvel at her own enormity. She crossed her arms behind her head and gave a quick wink to a non-existent admirer, let a finger hang out her mouth as her eyes did the rest of the talking\u2026 All of this was pretty much her slightly shifting one of her logs of fat she called an arm an inch or two while she winked or smiled seductively, yet to Medli she\u2019d become some kind of goddess. Or to brainwashed Medli at any rate. Half way through this imaginary pose session, she felt something that she hadn\u2019t felt since she\u2019d wound up in this mess\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge build up of gas heading straight for her butt. Less embarrassed and more curious as to how it\u2019d feel to have what would surely have to be a ton of stench rushing against her carvenous ass cheeks, she let it slowly build up\u2026 And let one of the hugest explosions of funk she\u2019d ever heard and smelled out of her body, slamming her cheeks apart and swelling up her panties to the point where they looked like a makeshift parachute for her ass. This was a fart that was thick enough to see. As the last PPPFFFFFFTTTTT escaped her rear, Medli remained speechless, while her fat swished and swashed all over her body. \"That... WAS AWESOME!\" With this, Medli started to let out even more farts, grinning mischievously as each green, putrid crowd emitted from her cavernous ass. As this continued...</span></div></div>",

Large (by fairy standards of course), saggy, pieces of flab, with contrastingly beautiful faces, flew around her, \u2018ooing\u2019 and \u2018aahing\u2019 at her. Aryll, to put it simply, was confused as all hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking closer to the main altar, a huge explosion of smoke erupted, with what seemed like a massive wall clearing through the air\u2026 Yet this was no wall; a huge, brightly coloured wall of flesh greeted Aryll\u2019s eyes, and when she looked up, she realised that she was, in fact, looking at a woman. An extremely fat woman, with waves of fat washing down onto the stone floor, slowly shifting from colour to colour. The body slowly hovered up, and then began to revolve down, the figure\u2019s breasts now lying directly in front of Aryll, only beginning to envelop her feet. A smooth, yet very round face greeted her, with sharp blue eyes and a warm smile made of ruby lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, hello there my child. I do see that you\u2019ve managed to discover this sacred meeting spot for us; the Titanic Fairies. Many assumed that title referred only to our power, but as you can see for yourself, it directly describes our beauty as well.\u201d The fairy\u2019s eyes surveyed Aryll, who wasn\u2019t so much scared as perplexed at how this person could be so incredibly obese. \u201cIt has been long since we have seen a visitor. And just as well that you are the first for many a millennium; I can tell that you are on the brink of death itself.\u201d Aryll jumped back in surprise. \u201cWait- I\u2019m going to die? Wha-\u201c She stopped herself, realising that if ANYBODY would know something so specific, it would be a fairy. This lady. \u201cYes, my child. It is a wonder how one your age can be so\u2026 Small. You must be alone in the above world, without food or comfort. I will take you into my care. Do not debate against this; you shall now be my daughter, and I will make it my mission to make you as vast and beautiful as me! My fellow friends, please gather as much food as possible, and you there, begin to craft a magical dress; my daughter must look stunning!\u201d She smiled warmly at Ayrll, who had only half followed what this mysterious creature had just told her. \u201cEh\u2026 Wait, wha-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet before she could say another word, her mouth was spoon fed, by a small hovering ball of flab, a strange, yellow glittering liquid.

I don\u2019t need to gain \u2013\u201c Yet the enormous fairy interrupted her. \u201cMy child, we were destined to meet. Your name is Aryll, is it not? I have powers beyond yours, and I can see that you are in dire need of a body. A body that will command respect, display limitless beauty and allow an infinite amount of binge eating.

Though that dress is much too small\u2026 Though I wouldn\u2019t worry too much, you\u2019re going to burst of it in no time!\u201d The fairy giggled, which sent small ripples around her wave of flesh. \u201cEhhh\u2026 But I\u2019m not even that hungry, and this dress is pretty loose.\u201d The fairy clapped her hands together, which was easier said then done in this case. \u201cOooooh, I was hoping you\u2019d ask that! So, you know why I fed you that yellow liquid? Here, try eating this:\u201d With a wave of two flabby trunk sized arms, a wedding cake poofed into existence before Ayrll\u2019s very eyes. She took a glance and nearly stepped back from the thought of how sick said get at even nibbling one what had to be a ridiculously sweet cake. Yet, she decided to walk up to it and take a slice. \u201cNooo, don\u2019t bother with that girl! If you want to be a pig, you gotta ACT like a pig! Take a huge hand full! I know you don\u2019t feel hungry, but you\u2019ll know what\u2019s hit you when it comes\u2026\u201d She follows her new mother\u2019s instructions and with a quick swipe, dangles an oozing amount of triple fudge cake over her mouth, and plonks it in. Before she knows it, she\u2019s head first into the cake, taking handful after greasy handful into her small mouth, not even aware that with each bite, the cake seemed to be getting bigger. A small, nearly invisible amongst the neony blubber of the fairy pointed at the cake. Connect the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebris of food flies around her, and after a while, she lies her stomach back just to rub it, letting all the junky goodness to digest. Yet she also lets out a massive URRRRPPPP, loud enough to shake part of the table. \u201cOh\u2026 Excuse me-\u201d The fairy quickly stopped her, with a loud yet calm statement. \u201cDON\u2019T SAY EXCUSE ME. Sorry, but believe me, the more you revel around in your fatness, the huger you\u2019ll become. If you need to pass gas, pass gas! Heck, even if you don\u2019t need to, make a habit to! You\u2019re going to so grand, you should rub it in peoples faces as much as possible! Anyway, that was some great binging honey! Just finish the rest off and one of my lovely friends\u2019ll help you into the portal. \u201cWait- portal?\u201d Ayrll had only been half paying attention, too entranced in sneaking in a couple extra layers of cake and seeing her stomach expand to the size of a huge yoga ball, her dress stretching further and further over it. Though she had mentally made a point of not making a point to have anything resembling manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughed nearly to hysterics. \u201cAhahahaha, ooooh boy. You don\u2019t think we\u2019d just live in this small shrine, right? I\u2019m not even really this dainty: I can just adjust reality here so I can fit all of myself in here! You oughta see how huge you\u2019re mother really is! Now, finish off your cake and as I said, a lady friend will help you out of here\u2026\u201d She noticed Aryll beginning to playfully lie down on her own perfectly round stomach, purring softly. \u201c\u2026 Adorable. Now, come on! I\u2019ve got to show you off to all my friends!\u201d Aryll, being the somewhat simple minded girl she was, felt rather content with everything she\u2019d been told. Except one small detail, which at this point didn\u2019t appear to hold any relevance to anything, but the thought wasn\u2019t going to go away anytime soon. So, lying down with her arms crossed on her bloated stomach that was already beginning to turn into soft, jiggly flesh, with a smile she asked. \u201cMom?

If you\u2019ve already finished that one, just come with me!\u201d Slowly hopping off the table, Aryll had to quickly balance herself to accommodate her new belly, which due to her short height was already hanging low to the ground. \u201cOkay, wait up mom! Or sis! Whatever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two finally made their way through the void, Aryll having to wait a moment as the ocean of blubber that was her mother squeezed itself through what was already a huge opening, she marvelled at the lights and colours. A huge sprawling ancient city, with fairies here and there flying by, yet far larger than anything Aryll had ever seen. When she landed on a street, she realized that width wise, the pavement was wider than half of Outset Island! She was levitated up and placed along side her mom\u2019s huge, obese cheeks, and looked in amazement as her mother managed to take up an entire street, somehow moving as a great big wall of mass. \u201cWow mom, that\u2019s amazing!\u201d Aryll exclaimed, grinning at her mother. \u201cAm I gonna get this huge?\u201d \u201cOf course! Hopefully, very, very soon! Heh, I\u2019m not even at my real size at this point. I think I\u2019ll take you into here; it\u2019ll get some serious meat on those bones.\u201d Seeping along the streets, the fairy suddenly stops outside a shop that has a door just wide enough to let her in. This city would look like one made for giants, yet the fairy\u2019s heights were only increased when their fat piled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Aryll, this is easily one of the best candy shops in this world.\u201d Nodding to another mountainous woman behind the counter, she let Aryll look in awe at the literally mile long rows of sweets, huge towering containers holding millions of pieces of fattening goods. \u201cNow, choose what you want, and I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d Aryll was plopped onto the counter and pointed at a jar that literally consisted of rocky road mixture. She pointed with a flabby arm to it and smiling at the cashier sweetly elatedly yelled \u201cOoooh, that one, that one!\u201d Both of them laughed at her eagerness and her mother was glad she\u2019d remembered to act as greedy as possible. Lying both the jar and Aryll down on the fairy\u2019s immense belly, she started mawing into it right there and then, slamming her entire body into it as she slurped and slobbered her way over it. Pausing only to burp, fart and subsequently giggle, Aryll was an eating machine. By the time she\u2019d worked halfway through the sweet, her feet were already encased in a thick layer of fat, her originally large dress only barely covering her large breasts. Her butt  proudly presented her strained panties, and her entire body was drenched in sticky slime. By the time this titanic binge was over, she was amazed at how unstuffed she was. She\u2019d easily eaten enough to feed an army for a month, yet all she had was the intense pleasure of being so immense and voracious. \u201cMom, that was awesome!

Within 10 seconds, she was done, another ton heavier and looking extremely pleased with herself. \u201cUUUURRRRPPPP!!!!! \u201c she belched, \u201cPass me another FFFFFFFRRRRTTTTT jar please!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours later Aryll had burst through her dress, was now half the size of her new mom and besides the fact she had made a complete and total mess of herself, she looked happier than anyone had ever seen her and was now licking some of the scraps off her body. Her mom looked absolutely thrilled,  \u201cAw sweetie, you look just like I did when I was you\u2019re age, maybe even bigger!\u201d \u201cI UUURRRPPP doubt that!\u201d Aryll said with her mouth still stretched into a huge smile. Her mom laughed, \u201cTrue, but you\u2019ve come very close!\u201d After paying the bill they both left the shop. Aryll was finding it really hard to walk so her mom gave her a shot of magic so she was able to let herself levitate. Aryll found it hard to find room near the ground after the first couple minutes, so her mum let her relax on her mountainous belly. Aryll was only too happy to do so, \u201cOh man mum! This is sooo comfy! You\u2019re so warm and soft, and your rolls are giving me one sweet massage!\u201d Her mom smiled, \u201cGlad you\u2019re enjoying yourself sweetie! So, now that we\u2019re finished that, what do you want to do Aryll?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like, nothing but baked goods?\u201d Aryll asked with a brightly lit face, straining her sunken face to her mom, who burst out giggling again. \u201cHeh heh, if it weren\u2019t against the ideology of being so huge and slothful, I\u2019d probably get you taught. Yes sweetie, they have restaurants for pretty much everything! I\u2019ve got to get you on a healthy diet of calories and sugar, so this is dinner for tonight!\u201d She eyed Aryll again, who\u2019s towering mass gleefully bobbed up and down with hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept almost entirely naked except for her underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough, eh, would they mind me not having any clothes on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was second nature to everyone eles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPppth, nope! Leave nothing to the imagination unless you feel like looking colourful is everybody\u2019s motto here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the restaurant, the queen squeezed her ocean of bulk through the titanic doorframe, yet she could\u2019ve easily made herself a bit smaller. A waitress fairy only a bit fatter and older than Aryll hovered up to them, yet her stomach and breasts still practically oozed all over her uniform, but she still wore a smile. \u201cOoooh, the usual spot miss? And I see you brought a cute friend along!\u201d Aryll waved a flabby arm with surprising ease. \u201cHeh, not just a friend; my new daughter!\u201d The queen pushed and barged her way through the rows of massive tables, ever so often seating a nearly indistinguishable blob, sans either a boy\u2019s or girl\u2019s feverously mawing face. Many of them seemed larger than her mother, yet Aryll remembered what this woman had said about her magic; in reality she could probably engulf the entire city in her butt. She giggled at the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on a lazy-boy chair that was soft enough to slowly swallow up her butt, a simple, small chocolate cake was put on Aryll\u2019s belly after a few moments of ordering. She eyed it a bit, and then frowned a bit. While in her normal petite size, she\u2019d of struggled to finish something this size in a week, it\u2019d only take her a second in this size. \u201cMiss, why\u2019s this cake so small?\u201d The waitress hovered over, yet before opening her mouth, Aryll\u2019s mother glared at her. Instead, she grinned. \u201cSmall? What ever do you mean? It\u2019s an ENTIRE cake! Don\u2019t want to get too large now\u2026\u201d The blobbish blonde knew what was going down. \u201cWell I want MORE, skinny! A THOUSAND more! And LARGER! LARGER than myself!\u201d She crossed her wobbly arms and stuck her tongue out at the waitress, but let out a wink to show her insincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress grinned at the queen, who was practically squealing in delight. \u201cHeh, you\u2019re kid\u2019s grabbing the ropes really quickly miss. So, a thousand? And what flavour-\u201c \u201cALL OF EM\u201d \u201cRighto!\u201d The queen\u2019s grin grew. Though before she had left, she waitress turned around in mid-flight. \u201cThough is it alright if we feed them to her? She\u2019s so nice and large for her age\u2026 And she DID call me skinny!\u201d \u201cOh, sure, I bet she\u2019ll like that!\u201d</span></div></div>",

It seemed that her relief, coupled with her habits of bringing meals to her grandmother, had rubbed off on her. Since that day, she had started to put on weight. She admittedly had been dieting to be assured she would fit inside of her wedding dress, but she never thought of herself as this gluttonous. She had put on a hundred pounds in all since her wedding day and still her waistline expanded with each meal. Kafei seemed to shyly dismiss any questions she shot him regarding her weight and she could swear as she dined, he would steal glances at her belly. Her breasts had become fuller and rounder as well, leading to a generous view of creamy cleavage which she didn't doubt brought in new customers and even her long, sensible skirt did little to hide her full and round plump ass with hips that would even make Hylian royalty green with envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a customer passed by the counter, the plump Anju waved him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, e-excuse me sirt but you didn't pay your rent! You took out a reservation for a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, wearing a magenta robe and cowl and wearing a sizable traveling backpack, turned around. His eyes had a pale glimmer to them under the shade of his hood, not unlike that of a Poe and his skin looked pale, but not sickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how unfavorable of me.\" He said in a surprisingly courteous and timid voice that wavered slightly like a nervous schoolboy. \"I'm sorry, I don't know if this will cover the bill but please, take this as my payment instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man reached into a pocket in his pack and presented a glass bottle to Anju. It wasn't empty however; it's contents consisted of a navy blue colored slime inside. It seemed to be Chu-Chu jelly, but before she could press any further about what it was exactly or what it did, the man had already walked out the door. Anju tried to call for him, but it was a futile gesture. She only sat back and looked at the bottle longingly. Her stomach began to growl looking at it. Anju guiltily looked down and rubbed her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I suppose a drink on the job won't hurt. Chu-Chu jelly is oddly non-toxic, so I guess this can't hurt much...\" Anju pondered aloud to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinching her nose after uncorking the bottle, Anju swallowed the sticky, oddly sweet substance within a single gulp. She sighed as she felt it stick to her throat while it traveled down into her stomach. She nodded her head to the side as she found herself surprised that it actually tasted that good. Her stomach began to rumble as she felt her belly with her right hand. It wasn't hunger it was...something else. Whatever the case, it was almost three now and it was as good a time as any for a break. She decided it would be best to check up on Cremia and little Romani now that their...creature problem was taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to the ranch, Anju felt her gut continue to growl and shake as she began to feel hotter and more tired. She actually started to pant and sweat like she'd just run after Cuckoos to throw them back in their pen, but she still pressed on. Luckily for her, as she passed the gate to the ranch, Cremia was standing near one of the ranch's famous cows with a bucket of milk sat next to her and a crate of glass bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oho~ If it isn't one of Clock Town's latest brides too be? How do you feel, Ms. Kafei?\" Cremia playfully teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine tha-Uuurrrrpp!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju accidentally belched just as Cremia started getting close to her, causing her rancher friend to back up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry must have been something I...IIIIIUUUUUUAAARRRRPPPP!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anju belched her belly shook violently, her body beginning to bloat forward. Cremia was only taken further aback as she backed away from her friend's rapidly expanding body, which seemed to explode with fat. In an instant, she already became a round blob who stood naked, her decency covered by her full, swelling fat belly as her breasts swelled forward atop it and her butt bubbled and ballooned out behind her. She quickly began to spread across the ground like a massive blob as the innkeeper could only belch near-constantly as her bulk expanded outwards. Cremia found herself swept up in her friend's expanding bulbous body and cows began to disappear within her belly and large, deep folds. Anju began to moan in what sounded to Cremia like an erotic fashion as she grew and belched and even hiccuped as her body began to envelop over half the fields.</span></div></div>",

Taking advantage of the opportunity, Anju would use the countertop to rest her stomach as it nearly spilled over on the opposite end, resting her hand on the soft flab and massaging it every so often. <br>\r\nShe had only just begun her routine and already she couldn't wait for lunch. <br>\r\nAnju had been in charge of cooking up meals for anyone who stayed in the Inn, and with the climax of the Carnival she was used to cooking up a meal for every patron. While the Inn had died down, Anju's portions had not, which meant that she was still cooking for dozens when it was just herself and her mother to feed - and her mother didn't have a large appetite...<br>\r\nGrowing ever impatient at the front desk, Anju wondered if she could possibly hold out until breakfast which was still hours away. Perhaps she could abandon her post and whip off to the kitchen to cook, her senile mother probably wouldn't question the time...<br>\r\nAs her stomach grumbled persistently she bit her lower lip, she knew she should wait and stand at her post, but she couldn't shy away from thoughts of rich soups and heavy pastries...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course!\", she grunted as she rose to her feet. Anju wasn't the only one who found herself unprepared for the inevitable end of the Carnival of Time, which found Mr. Barten left over with a few dozen crates of Romani Ranch milk - especially the incredibly think and creamy Chateau Romani which was too rich in flavor and price for most tourists. Cutting his loses, he had donated a few dozen crates of Chateau Romani to the Stock Pot Inn as a gesture of good will - and also to allow himself some space to move behind his counter once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping just short of the massive crate decorated with a cows face, Anju pried open the front to reveal rows of delicious creamy Chateau Romani. <br>\r\n\"Mmm... perhaps two servings will do...\" Anju pondered, bringing the full bottles to her chest, \"Will it be enough? Perhaps three, err...four...\"<br>\r\nLicking her lips, the stout clerk returned to the stove with ingredients in hand - a slow simmer had made the broth just warm enough to begin cooking. <br>\r\nOne by one the ingredients were dropped into the wide bowl as Anju took to stirring the mixture fervently, her raven hair becoming disheveled as the rising steam met her brow. <br>\r\nBreathing heavily, the cook found herself competing with the stirring in her stomach, the bubbling froth rising to the surface in both cases. <br>\r\n\"Nearly there, just need to... add some texture...\" Anju noted, unscrewing the top of the bottle and dumping the rich liquid into her soup which turned a dull white. <br>\r\nWhile this would suit a normal dish, Anju couldn't resist adding a second bottle of heavy milk into the mix, turning the concoction remarkably white.<br>\r\nBeaming at her delicious dish, Anju stopped stirring and began to scoop a heavy spoonful into her mouth for a taste test.<br>\r\n\"Mmm... Oooh...\", Anju swallowed, relishing the flavors and patting her restless belly. \"Too good. But it could use ..another.. serving...\"<br>\r\nShe peered across the counter at the remaining bottles and gathered them up in her arms before dashing them into the soup. <br>\r\nSniffing the air she moaned in ecstasy, the rich smell was simply overpowering, she had to see how it tasted now...<br>\r\nDipping the spoon into the soup, Anju brought a second spoonful to her mouth, followed by a third for good measure.<br>\r\n\"Mmmph, just perfect...\" Anju gurgled through mouthfuls, \"So rich and creamy....\"<br>\r\nPerhaps a fifth spoonful would be even better than the last, Anju was having difficulty making up a proper excuse for digging into her clearly perfected mix. <br>\r\nClosing her eyes and taste testing like clockwork, she left just enough time to swallow before filling up her cheeks once more. <br>\r\nSlowing her pace as she began reaching deeper into the bowl, she had sated her hunger pangs but kept eating anyway - it wasn't long before she was stirred from bliss with a sharp mechanical 'PANG!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes, Anju starred down at her spoon which now scraped the bottom of an empty soup bowl. <br>\r\nHer eyes widened with shock. Had she really finished off the entire soup bowl? That was meant to feed a family of least ten Inn guests...<br>\r\nAnju massaged her taut tummy while she leaned back in her chair, she had gone beyond comfortable and her sloshing stomach was enough evidence of that.<br>\r\nBefore the clerk could begin to relax however, the familiar sound of the irreparable squeaky door sounded at the front of the Inn as a pair of shuffling boots soon followed.<br>\r\nCustomers! They would meander into the Inn right this second, too. Anju rose from her chair, brushing her dress off and fixing her hair before making her way to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her mind finished the sentence for her, and it was true as well - ever since the Carnival of Time had ended she had spent more time in the kitchen than at the counter, tasting every recipe personally, feeling the threads on her wardrobe strain, feeling heavier with every bite...<br>\r\n\"...cooking.

Then another.<br>\r\nA low rumble had started in her stomach, rising in pitch as the innkeeper tried to control herself. Just a few more, don't explode... A few more...<br>\r\nAnju's cheeks had become flushed with red, matching her crimson hair which had become disheveled from the heat. Panting dully, Anju forced another spoonful onto herself, the thick mixture dripping down her chin. <br>\r\nPressing against the fabric of her blouse, her taut stomach seemed to expand an inch every time Anju swallowed a drop of Cucco Chateau Romani. <br>\r\nAnother spoonful as she thought of Romani Ranch, the aroma was nearly intoxicating now. She imagined herself stretched out in cool high grass of Cremia's pasture, basking in the sun. Just keep eating... Another spoonful...<br>\r\nThink of the pasture, in the grass, in the grass like...<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled again.<br>\r\nLike a cow. <br>\r\nAnju was likely filled with more Chateau Romani than any cow could hope to produce on the ranch anyways - if she did live with Romani and Cremia it would be as their prized heifer. Appropriate, since she felt like she had already filled four stomachs. <br>\r\nAnother spoonful and Anju winced. <br>\r\nPerhaps she more suited as a prized pig, growing larger with each passing day. <br>\r\nAnju opened her eyes, she had already made that a reality. <br>\r\nHer soup was nearly finished, and she was sure at least that there was more soup inside of her than left in the bowl, the crowning glory of Stock Hog Inn.<br>\r\nAnju had to gulp as she felt hot soup rise in her throat, threatening to come out - she was too full, but she wasn't about to ruin the floor of the Knife Chamber.<br>\r\nThe innkeeper cradled her stomach as she felt the packed dome through her fabric. Please, please, just a little more...<br>\r\nShe could now see the bottom of the bowl, it was possible, but she couldn't suffer through this any longer.<br>\r\nFive spoonfuls, that's all. If you do it quick enough, you won't even notice...<br>\r\nAnju panted as she dipped her spoon in the reservoir of soup, naturally the thickest bits had sunk to the bottom.<br>\r\nQuick enough... won't even notice...<br>\r\nIn a flash Anju had brought the creamy mixture to her lips, before she had even swallowed, a second spoonful was ready. <br>\r\nOn the third spoonful, Anju swallowed with relish and prepared for her forth when a powerful and painful throb started at her stomach and worked its way through her entire body. She winced as her stomach protested, resisting the urge to massage in case it all went north to Snowhead.<br>\r\nWhat was she doing? She was completely stuffed and yet she continued eating, faster than she had all morning!<br>\r\nMoaning softly, Anju gathered up her composure and another spoonful, draining it into her mouth. Before she could swallow she brought the final bit of soup to her lips, collecting both in her cheeks. <br>\r\nThe Clocktown Jugglers had finished talking ages ago, and were on the final spoonfuls of their own bowls. Luckily they hadn't noticed the frankly overstuffed moaning sow of an innkeeper sharing their room, or if they did, they weren't about to make it known.<br>\r\nClosing her eyes, Anju prepared to swallow - if she didn't explode in a flash like a Deku nut it would be nothing short of a miracle. <br>\r\nShe felt the creamy texture travel down her throat as she gulped, not unlike a grimacing Moon heading towards Clock Tower - with equally cataclysmic results. <br>\r\nAs the mixture hit her stomach, she could feel the hot soup rise in her throat again. No!<br>\r\n\"BRRAP!\" Anju belched, turning a brilliant shade of scarlet as she covered her mouth too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho ho ho! Compliments to the chef!\" red shirt chortled at ease before burping himself. <br>\r\n\"Hoo hoo, and compliments to a fine hostess as well!\" blue shirt added, exhaling a burp to match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimacing, Anju bowed in favor of her guests, a sharp pain digging into her as she bent too low. <br>\r\nThe bed creaked back into form as the innkeeper rose to collect the empty bowls from the twins, adding her own as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for the soup,\" blue shirt called out as Anju plodded out of the Knife Chamber.<br>\r\n\"Yes, we're absolutely stuffed.\" red shirt giggled as Anju bowed and shut the door behind her and losing all composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhaling deeply, Anju backed herself against the wall, resting the bowls on the floor and placing her hands on her nearly spherical stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't *hic* know the half of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Descending the staircase of the Stock Pot Inn had nearly become as difficult as climbing it, as every step served to remind Anju just how overloaded she had made herself. She was swimming in soup, she decided - an entire days worth of rich Chateau Romani had taken its toll on her figure in a few short hours. <br>\r\nHer blouse had become so strained that it threatened to burst off any minute, months ago the white fabric served only to reach the peak of her dress and join the base of her top, but now it was pulled tightly across her round stomach like a drum, thudding in dull pain. <br>\r\nHer dress was hardly faring any better; while its length had remain consistent, the seams had been stressed and several stitches had already broken from the hem, especially, as Anju had noted, around her growing posterior...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh...\" Anju cooed to herself as she rested against the wall. A journey of stairs stretch ahead still, but she was already hot in the face. <br>\r\n\"Oooh...\", the Hostess groaned as she lowered herself onto the steps. Perhaps she would sit here until she caught her breath, just for a little while... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju looked skyward, wheezing on the staircase, her wandering hands had found their way to her stomach, cradling, massaging, coasting along to the ebb and flow that would quell the beast in her stomach. She debated undoing the first few buttons of her blouse after needling her stomach and noticing how strained they felt - but soon thought better of it. What if she couldn't do them back up? <br>\r\nThe fabric stretched with every breath, she could probably pop the button off if she held her breath, but she wasn't about to try...<br>\r\nWith a few more spoonfuls of soup she might explode along with it, she noted, exploring her middle. <br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...\" Anju moaned, closing her eyes and rubbing her stomach gently, her fingers grazing the thin layers of her blouse. Underneath, the raging turmoil against Chateau Romani continued, with each gurgle, tremor and growl sending the poor Innkeeper reeling. Anything more than a light touch would cause a protest, so she traced light deliberate circles with the tips of her fingers. <br>\r\nJust keep grazing... she thought. That was something she had been doing particularly well in the past months, gorging herself hedonistically in the kitchen, or munching on a little snack in the lobby. She had tended to her guests in the same manner as always, but had admittingly tended to herself first when it came to cooking - and the results were obvious. <br>\r\nAnju opened her eyes and craned her neck to get a better view of her burgeoning belly. She was enormous, bigger than she had been in her entire life, and worse still, there was no signs of slowing down...<br>\r\nSomewhere along the way greed and relish had won favor, and she had been paying for it with every pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few labored breaths, Anju strengthened her resolve to continue down the staircase. Wincing, she began to rise to her feet, feeling out to the wall for support. With one hand firmly placed on her stomach, and the other grasping at the railing, the Innkeeper soon found herself standing upright, albeit more out of breath than before.<br>\r\nHer cheeks had become flushed, and her bangs swept over her eyes and each lungful of air send a sharp pain to her middle. She began to descend, each step sending a tremor up to her stomach, each creak on the weathered step reminding just how much she had grown - it was nearly unbearable. <br>\r\nFinally she had arrived at the base of the steps with a sharp exhale that sent her stomach growling. Resting a hand on her stuffed tummy, Anju leaned against the wall until she could think straight once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to the... kitchen...\", she panted aloud, massaging herself, \"wash the bowls... and then...\"<br>\r\nSuddenly a chill had been sent up her spine, Anju's eyes went wide as she spun about to collect the bowls of finished soup, but found that there was none. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four bowls had been stacked neatly atop each other, exactly where Anju had left them outside of the Knife Chamber. The room found at the top of the stairs... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in disbelief, Anju grabbed the railing and steadied herself, her hair falling back into her eyes once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the start of a long day for the overfed Innkeeper... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anju thought to herself she she took the first few steps. <br>\r\nThe top of the stairs seemed impossibly far away, and while she had managed to ascend them before entering the Knife Chamber, her return trip was made under the heavy burden of two thick bowls of Chateau Romani. <br>\r\nShe definitely felt heavier, each creaking step threatening to give way at a moments notice, a wanning echo throughout the Stock Pot Inn. <br>\r\nAnju continued onward, underneath her stuffed belly was audibly sloshing, each step sending creamy liquid to stir around in her massive cauldron. <br>\r\nAnju was already painfully full, and this trek wasn't helping in the slightest, in fact, what she needed more than anything else was to retire to her quarters and sleep off her massive meal... <br>\r\nShe brushed the crimson hair out of her eyes as she took another step. The Employees-Only room that served as her sanctuary was also at the top of the stairs, perhaps she could collect the dishes and bring them inside with her - a short nap and she could find the strength to keep working...<br>\r\n<i>How lazy!</i>, her mothers voice echoed in her mind. How could she think about sleeping the day away when someone had to tend to the Inn, and all of its occupants?<br>\r\nPerhaps she could nap in the lobby, resting her head against the top of the counter and keeping a groggy watch on the door...<br>\r\n\"Oooh...\" Anju exhaled, resting a hand on her stomach. This was just too much, it was too far and even if she did make it to the top, she wasn't sure she could gather the will to descend the stairs a second time. <br>\r\n\"Let me just...\" Anju shifted her weight, stepping to the side. Her stomach thrashed in protest. \"Oooh, oh...*hic* please...\"<br>\r\nIf Anju had drank all of the Great Bay, she assumed that she would feel exactly as she did now - inside the tide seemed to rush the shore, sloshing the <br>\r\ncontents about in a choppy mix. Steadying herself on the railing, Anju took a few short painful breaths, but it did nothing to alleviate the situation. <br>\r\nA wandering hand reached down to massage her stomach, tracing circles around her belly button. Soon she found herself spiraling inward like a drain, a single finger leading the kneading expedition as she traveled inside. <br>\r\nAnju was genuinely shocked at how deep her navel had become - years ago on the Eve of the Carnival, she had worn a revealing crop top that showed off her midriff, and even in the moonlight you could see how trim and svelte she kept herself, with a toned stomach like a washboard. <br>\r\nNow, her stomach had grown round and soft, her navel becoming deeper with each added pound. If she wore the same dress on the Eve of this years Carnival, the townspeople might mistake her for the Moon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explored her body, moving southward, it wasn't long until she found her fingers caving inward as they traveled along the underside of her stomach.  <br>\r\nAnju wasn't as shocked at this revelation, as her toned belly had turned into a paunch she soon grew used to it, by the time it had grown noticeably round, she was using the lobby counter to rest it against. A second hand joined its partner, massaging underneath until Anju decided to see if she could still lift it...<br>\r\nWith a groan, Anju tried to shift her stomach, but it was simply too full of Chateau Romani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotten...so *hic* big...\" Anju whispered to herself. \"So... heavy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju attempted to take another step but was soon bolstered by a sharp growl and slosh of her stomach. She winced and rubbed her swollen belly while panting. Three bowls of soup, the Innkeeper thought to herself, enough to keep someone well-fed for an entire day, and she had finished them off one after another. Her cheeks flushed. She was more than well-fed, she had passed that apex a long time ago, she was overfed in every sense of the word. <br>\r\nA small burp escaped her lips. <br>\r\nShe was completely stuffed to her limit before, and yet she managed to somehow continue eating regardless -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju's foot dangled above the next step as an overwhelming gurgle echoed within her. She was paying for it now. Winching and bearing her teeth, Anju found abandoned the climb and felt out for the next step below, finding it in teary eyes and quickly finishing the descent at the base of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, the Innkeeper clutched her stomach with both hands as the sloshing tyranny continued. <i>This</i> was a stomachache, and the strongest one that Anju had ever felt in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no more...\" she said exhausted, \"No more food today... *hic*... Ooohh...\"<br>\r\nThe Innkeeper slid her back up against the wall, drawing ragged breaths and waiting out the storm. <br>\r\nShe had given up on the stairs entirely, she would return later perhaps and collect the dishes, but right now she wanted to do nothing more than sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju's breathing slowed as she closed her eyes, still wincing every few moments as she tried to rest, sitting in front of the stairwell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to drift off when the Stock Pot Inn was suddenly filled with a cacophony of clanging bells which extended outside to the grandiose Clock Tower with its heavy bells. The Hostess turned her head to face the wall, finding the clock chiming there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 12:00 - Lunch Time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju groaned. </span></div></div>",

She dreaded serving her mother, nearly blind and forgetful at best, she always declined any meal that Anju cooked for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Anju had wisdom beyond her years, she could sympathize with declining a meal, any meal now. She didn't want to see another bowl of Chateau Romani soup for the rest of the year, and here was cooking a fresh batch for her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears ago, the inexperienced Innkeeper could readily admit her lack of concentration in the culinary arts, 'never trust a skinny chef' was often whispered behind her back. But now Anju's skill had grown nearly as quickly as she had, every dish that passed her lips was a refined masterpiece. She personally sampled everything she cooked for flaws, and when her guests wanted seconds or thirds she was obliged to make sure that it would taste exactly as it did before. She was a perfectionist that way, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju brushed the crimson hair out from her eyes as the stovetop bubbled and frothed, boiling a thick mix of Chateau Romani that was nearly as full as she was.  The innkeeper sighed and added the ingredients, leaning in close to sniff. She massaged her overfed stomach gently as she stirred vigorously, the steam rising from the mixture <br>\r\nThe familiar scent of Chateau Romani filled the kitchen as Anju groaned and licked her lips, it should have sent her reeling with painful memories, but somehow the potent smell was still incredibly enticing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to say that Anju couldn't resist, she was still painfully aware of how much she had overstuffed herself already, and had already resolved to deliver the soup to her mother, and then take a long nap at the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, as incredibly over-filled as Anju was feeling at the moment, she knew that the perfectionist inside her wouldn't let her deliver the soup without a... taste test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color flushed from her face as she continued stirring, just one quick spoonful and that was it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large groan escaped both Anju as well as her stomach as she contemplated bringing the spoon to her lips. <br>\r\nShe massaged her throbbing stomach as she pictured the scene, bringing the rich mix to her lips and swallowing hard. <br>\r\nA button on her blouse would ricochet off a nearby pan, her dress would tear down the side completely leaving her in threadbare seams.<br>\r\nAnd her spoonful would follow another, and then another...<br>\r\nAnother button would find itself released as she gave way to ecstasy, Anju would lift the entire pot to her lips, desperately lapping up the soup as the intoxicating aroma of Chateau Romani took her over completely. <br>\r\nShe would keep drinking and drinking, her cheeks filling with impossibly rich soup as she swallowed hard and fast. <br>\r\nHer stomach would send her reeling in sharp pain, completely stuffed to the brim and she would find herself unable to stop. <br>\r\nShe would moan in pain and pleasure, draining the soup and trying to pull away, but finding herself unable to do so. <br>\r\nUntil finally... <br>\r\nAnju would drop the pot, clutching her stomach as the rest of the mix clattered to the floor. <br>\r\nFour thick rich basins of Chateau Romani inside of her, stretching the limits of her completely spherical stomach. <br>\r\nShe would fall to the floor, creating a tremendous tremor through all of the Stock Pot Inn when her eye would catch one last spoonful of soup. <br>\r\nAnju would wince, grasping the spoon under labored breaths...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...*hic* one...little... taste...\" she breathed huskily, bringing the final spoonful to her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would fill her cheeks as she struggled to keep the mix down, her quaking stomach would slosh and growl, and she would swallow hard. <br>\r\nShe would burst at the seams like her dress, pop like a button from her blouse, explode like a Powder Keg! KA-BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju snapped back to the kitchen, lost in thought she had continued mixing. Blinking, she looked down at the mixture of Chateau Romani - it looked prepared, but there was only one way to tell if it were truly ready.<br>\r\nBreathing deeply, Anju brought the spoonful to her trembling lips and with her eyes closed she downed the spoonful in a single swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju didn't burst like a Deku Bubble, nor did she find herself trapped in a ravenous frenzy of Chateau Romani.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was worse than that - lost in her thought, Anju hadn't cooked the soup properly, and her mother would surely notice!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Memories of the Innkeepers less-than-edible meals weren't lost on Anju's Grandmother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not hungry Tortus, please keep practicing your cooking.\" She turned back to her reading once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandmother...\"  Anju began exasperated, \"I've been getting better - a lot better - all of ClockTown has been noticing...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju was suddenly aware that she could have said 'bigger' instead of 'better' and it would still be a true statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just try my soup.\" Anju pleaded, \"I've made it special just for you - and it's really good, honest!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju's Grandmother wheeled herself over to Anju and her tray, craning her neck to sniff the aroma of Chateau Romani before turning back to her Granddaughter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really good, Tortus?\" There was a hint of skepticism in the old womans voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes! It's probably one of my best dishes. Cooked to perfection!\" Anju was never a good liar, and although she tried to sound as genuine as possible, her face betrayed her entirely, which the spry woman spotted immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" She wheeled closer, stirring the spoon into the soup, the thick aroma of Chateau Romani filling the study, \"would you like some, Tortus?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, no! I couldn't poss-\" Anju caught herself, now it definitely looked like she was trying to pass off a bad recipe to her Grandmother, and a slight smirk flashed on the senile womans face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I thought as much Tortus. Not confident in your own cooking...\" Anju's Grandmother began to wheel herself back to the hearth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Anju cried, grabbing the tray and rested it on top of her stuffed stomach, which gurgled in protest, perhaps in expectation on what was to come.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it, just one more spoonful, just to prove that the soup was edible so her grandmother wouldn't go without lunch...<br>\r\nThe Innkeeper stirred the soup slowly, gathering a spoonful and reluctantly raising it to her lips. Anju's grandmother watched with uncertainty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju filled her cheeks with Extra Rich Chateau Romani, tonging the noticeably thicker mixture, before swallowing, hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the Innkeeper felt a wave of illness and regret ebb through her stomach - too full, too stuffed, not another bite! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohh...\" she groaned as she stifled a burp, she was going to pop, any second now, she knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the room, Anju's grandmother chuckled, \"Is there something wrong with the soup, Tortus?

Her grandmother was watching her intently, and any hesitation to eat just one more spoonful would be a sign that the soup hadn\u2019t turned out well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju tentatively took one more sip of the soup, holding back a groan as it went down her esophagus and into the frothing mass that was her stomach.

She hoped Cremia wouldn\u2019t mistake that as being her fault in any way. \u201cHow are you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine. Buisness over at the ranch isn\u2019t as great as it was during the Carnival, but we\u2019re still making enough. How \u2018bout you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust *huff* peachy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCremia wasn\u2019t surprised by Anju\u2019s weight, since she had seen her several times over the past few months, and each time the innkeeper looked bigger and bigger. Truth be told, the ranch girl was starting to get a little nervous about her friend\u2019s rising obesity. There was no way Anju\u2019s sedentary and calorie-filled lifestyle was doing any favors for her health. Anju was getting out of breath easier these days, and her clothes looked like they were going to tear at the seams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her friend had been through a lot during the last Carnival, so she certainly deserved a break. That was the major reason as to why Cremia hadn\u2019t brought the issue up; no need to poke the elephant in the room quite yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju also had thoughts of weight on the brain, but of a different nature. She was looking at Cremia\u2019s body, lamenting the fact that she used to possess a similar physique that had given way to greed and gluttony, one that would probably never return. Yet her friend remaining so thin made her feel even worse; it only highlighted how hedonistic Anju had become these last several months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the innkeeper would never bring this up to Cremia upfront. It wasn\u2019t her fault she sparked just the tiniest bit of envy in Anju at seeing her trim waist and nearly washboard stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, does the chef have any specials on the menu today?\u201dCremia asked, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Anju\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And so she decided to make the same soup dish she had created the entire day, adding just as much milk as she had before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCremia sat over at the table, looking around absent-mindedly as Anju began preparing the ingredients. She noticed that Anju was having a bit of difficulty today even moving around the kitchen, and she swore she heard several growls and gurgles from the depths of her friend\u2019s stomach, but she didn\u2019t make any comments. It was obvious that Anju was well aware of her indigestion- might as well not bring it up and embarrass her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Cremia! I\u2019m making *huff* some amazing soup using *huff* some of your Chateau Romani!\u201d Anju proclaimed proudly, though a bit red-faced from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOoh, sounds delicious, Anju!\u201d Cremia complimented, a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Anju put the bowl in front of her friend, Cremia\u2019s eyes going a bit wide. The bowl was huge! It looked like it could easily serve ten people, yet here Anju was, giving it to her and expecting her to finish it! Did she really expect that? If these were the portions the innkeeper was eating all the time, then it was no wonder she had gained so much weight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively putting a spoon into the bowl, Cremia brought the soup up to her lips and gulped it down. She had to admit, it did taste delicious\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d Anju asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm\u2026 Anju, your cooking skills have gotten amazing!\u201d Cremia cooed. \u201cI love this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ranch girl looked up to see Anju\u2019s expecting face beaming at her with pride.

Cremia had no idea how many calories she had injested, but if she had to guess, she\u2019d say a lot. It wasn\u2019t as if Cremia was unaccustomed to big meals, but this one was just so creamy, thick, and rich that she felt she would burst if she ate anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut yet\u2026 in a way, it kind of felt good. The firmness of her gut, the gurgling of her stomach as it attempted to digest all that soup\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is this what Anju feels all the time?</i> Cremia mused, rubbing her belly. <i>This is what comes with her weight?

And guess what? Since you\u2019re my friend, you\u2019ll get to eat it all for free!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, *urp* really Anju?\u201d Cremia said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nonsense!\u201d the innkeeper said, giving her own gut a subconscious rub, still feeling a bit of the aftereffects of her own much bigger binge. \u201cI know things aren\u2019t exactly booming over at the ranch, and again, you\u2019re my friend. What friends don\u2019t do favors for each other every once in a while? It\u2019s not like you\u2019d be making in our income, or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, when you put it like that\u2026\u201d the ranch girl said, warming up to the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, don\u2019t feel guilty,\u201d Anju said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to her friend and looked down at her, suddenly realizing just how big Cremia\u2019s stomach looked. It used to be unnoticeable underneath her dress, but now it was bulging out ever-so-slightly. Anju gave it a light rub; she knew how well those worked for her when she was feeling indigestion, so they\u2019d definitely work for Cremia, someone who was much less used to the feeling. Her rub was rewarded with another belch from Cremia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, okay Anju,\u201d Cremia said. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to do it, then I\u2019m willing to go along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d the innkeeper exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that, Cremia!

Even the best chefs in the world need to start from somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit more conversation, Anju waved Cremia good-bye from the Stock Pot Inn. Her bloated friend returned the gesture and started her trek back to her cart that would lead her back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Anju remembered\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was no easy feat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm to remain on schedule,\" the Postman began, \"I must have access to the postbox.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithdrawing a small key, the Postman unlocked the base of the postbox and collected the letters inside, taking great care to arrange them in a neat pile. After he had finished, he turned his attention back to the Innkeeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are... Anju?\" he questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju practically froze on the spot. Did the Postman just realize that the once-svelte clerk of Stock Pot Inn now more closely resembled the bell on its rooftop?  <br>\r\nDid she look anything like her old self, or perhaps the Postman thought that she was her own mother for months at a time? <br>\r\nBlushing, she turned her gaze to the Postman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I am Anju\" She tried to smile, but found it wavering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a letter for you from the postbox!\" The Postman exclaimed jubilantly, selecting a white envelope and handing it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju sighed inwardly - it was all just a misunderstanding in formality. She should have guessed after all, the Postman would likely question a mirror if he ever received mail for himself. He hoped that was all it was, anyways...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned the letter over in her hands - it was from Kafei! <br>\r\nOpening the envelope revealed a note written in blue ink: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Anju, my love,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease meet me at the Laundry Pool in South Clock Town,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForever yours, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKafei.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju returned the letter into its envelope as the Postman carried on down the stairs to make his rounds. <br>\r\nAnju wondered what surprises Kafei had in store for her. She wondered if he had kept Kafei waiting at the Laundry Pool. <br>\r\nMost importantly, she wondered how she would manage to get all the way across Clock Town if a single stairway had winded her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still garbed in pink, the waifish girl hadn't changed in the slightest since the Carnival of Time had ended - it made Anju feel envious, guilty and ultimately conflicted all at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she wouldn't notice if Anju slinked past the Inn and into South Clock Town through the alternate route...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hey Anju!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much for that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving locked the Treasure Chest Shop, the girl came dotting towards Anju, hips swaying and feathered hair bounding with every step, her green eyes glistening like Rupees as they met Anjus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya Gal.\" Anju returned, managing to muster a smile that didn't seem too forced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo....\" The shop owner cooed, her eyes faltering from Anju's gaze to explore her body up and down. \".... how's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She doesn't want to talk,' Anju thought to herself, 'She just wants to see how much bigger the girl from the Inn has gotten...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know,\" Anju sighed, \"It's business as usual - guests to serve and rooms to fill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju looked up to see Gal was once again staring at her stomach, which had been pressing up tightly against the fabric that covered her midrift - she seemed distracted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gal?\" Anju tried to break the trance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" She said blinking, \"Oh. Yeah. I'll bet the rooms are... really full....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on command, Anju's stomach growled loudly, turning the Innkeeper an interesting shade of red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, how's the Treasure Chest Shop?\" Anju offered, hoping to save face. Gal seemed to light up in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic! I thought business would have died down after the Carnival of Time had ended, but since I put in that new mini-game maze I seem to keep getting return customers! It's designed so that you can never take the same path twice, but there's always a pattern that you can use to find your way!\" Gal was beaming emphatically, \"You just have to go up, up, down, down, left, right, left, ri-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju's stomach growled once again as Gal's eyes went wide, as they met with Anju's she looked away nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I um... haven't had lunch yet...\" Anju lied - her stomach was still painfully full with Chateau Romani. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Erm, I mean... that's uh...\" Gal was practically tripping over her words as she turned to face Anju. \"We could go for some now, if you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm actually going out with Kafei right now, but maybe later...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju gave an unconvincing smile, hoping with everything that her stomach didn't rumble again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you guys are so cute together!\" Gal was melting with sweetness, \"If you ever want to try out my new maze it's on the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Gal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the two women parted ways - Anju traveled to South Clock Town while Gal took the Stockpot route through for easy access to West Clock Town. <br>\r\nGal did steal one last parting glance at Anju however, as the Innkeeper heaved her way down the steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whao,' Gal thought to herself, 'I can't believe how much she's put on... two Silver Rupees, at least...'</span></div></div>",

Not again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju looked up, but was surprised to see that the Postman hadn't returned, but that the voice belonged to a small boy wearing a yellow bandana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju heaved herself from the postbox, standing up with some difficult as she focused on the boy below - she had seen him around Clock Town before, guarding the small alcove that she couldn't hope to squeeze through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I belong to the Bomber's Secret Society of Justice,\" The boy started, \"If anyone has trouble in Clock Town my friends and I sort it out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju smirked. He was definitely getting brownie points for cuteness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want some water lady?\" The Bomber bounced on the spot, \"You look like you need some water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju sighed with relief, \"Some water sounds lovely. Thank you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy raced off into the alcove and within seconds had returned with a bottle filled to the brim with Spring Water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacking a bench, Anju had improvised, sitting squarely atop the postbox - it was a little awkward but served its purpose. As the Bomber closed in, Anju gratiously took the water from his hands and brought it to her lips. Oath to Order! It was the most refreshing thing Anju had ever drank. <br>\r\nTilting the glass upwards, Anju gulped down the Spring Water with restored vigor and after a few long seconds had managed to drink the entire bottle. <br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief, the Innkeeper handed the bottle back to the Bomber who turned up to her with expectation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More?\" He offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the Bomber had darted off towards his hideout, and had returned within seconds with a second bottle of water. <br>\r\nOnce again, Anju raised the bottle of water to her lips and gulped it down fervently. <br>\r\nThe Bomber watched as the large woman emptied the bottle, the postbox underneath seeming to creak in protest as drank without restraint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...*hic* Thank you so much...\" Anju handed the bottle back to the Bomber as he took out a notebook and began to scrawl a note within its pages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anju returned to her feet her curiosity was piqued. \"Erm, what are you writing in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my Bombers' Notebook,\" the boy explained, \"When I help someone in town with a problem, I make an entry about it, here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bomber turned the Notebook to face Anju, where the entry read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ~Helped nice lady get water~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju giggled in spite of herself - it was just so cute! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you very much for the water - if you come to the Inn later on I might have some candy as a reward for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks lady,\" The bomber began, \"But a good deed is a reward itself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy marched back to his post as Anju turned to enter North Clock Town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the postbox, the wood had begun to noticeably splinter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Carnival of Time had a profound effect on much of West Clock Town, as many shops were forced to close their doors when the flow of customers from out of town had dried up. Only the Clock Town Bank had managed to stay open, after it managed to profit from the boy who had gone off to a strange land called, \"Hyrule\", leaving the many Rupees in trust with the Bank - never to return.<br>\r\nFor Anju, she was pleased that West Clock Town was entirely downhill, no more stairs to climb, no uphill battles; just a gentle descending coast towards the Laundry Pool...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to keep her mind off of the babbling brook within the Pool however, as it reminded her of her own churning and frothing mixture of Spring Water inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anju crossed the front door of the defunct Bomb Shop, she felt a tugging at her dress. <br>\r\nConfused, she spun about to find another boy with a blue bandana at her heels. Anju could feel her stomach drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, hello there.\" She squeaked, her own voice dying a little in her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello nice lady, I'm a member of the Bombers Secret Society of Justice and I have some water for you - Jim says that the Bombers Society of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bomber Boys words had been lost on Anju, who in a dazed state seemed only focused on the bottle of Spring Water, filled to the absolute brim, as she felt now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she would be able to let the boy down softly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju began to kneel to get at the boys eye level, prepared to ease him into a bout of 'thanks, but no thanks', but as Anju bent forward over her stomach a bolt of pain shot through her body. Too full!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...\" Anju shivered, \"I'm sorry but I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to look at the Bomber, who had a look of sadness across his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I helped you, I would have finished my Bomber's Notebook - I've been waiting a whole month for this last entry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju bit her lip as the Boy turned the pages revealing a mostly complete directory of every Clock Town citizen, save for herself, of course.<br>\r\nSurely one bottle of Spring Water wouldn't hurt, would it? She looked into the pouting face of the Bomber boy and sighed, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" she began, \"I'd love to have a bottle of Spring Water...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was overjoyed, handing over the bottle of water with shaking hands as he returned to his Notebook and began scrawling, and stopped to watch Anju enjoy his offering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching her stomach, Anju brought the bottle of Spring Water to her lips, pouring its contents as she took laboured gulps. She was so full, and worse, she had to use the bathroom as well. Anju felt as thought she were inflating on the spot, she could feel her stomach pressing against the light fabric tied around her waist - if she wasn't careful she was sure that it would burst away, revealing her bare midrift to any wanton eye in Clock Town.<br>\r\nCrossing her legs beneath her dress, Anju finished the last drops of Spring Water as she wiped her lips, completely and utterly stuffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank *hic* you,\" Anju blurted, \"I'm full now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bomber boy took back the empty Bottle, scrawling the final passage into his Notebook and reading his entry aloud...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helped. Water. Lady. Get. Full.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju rose to her feet with much shuffling. \"You sure... did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim'll make me the Captain now!\" the Bomber boy exclaimed, \"Thanks Water Lady!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy took off towards North Clock Town with his Notebook in tow, as Anju made her way to the front gate of West Clock Town, steadying herself at the Bank.<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Anju, the doorway was blocked by yet another Bomber boy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello.\" The boy began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju noticed that her lips were quivering, her stomach was so full that it ached and she felt ready to explode if she didn't use the bathroom immediately!<br>\r\nThe sloshing in her belly had grown to a veritable tsunami and it had begun growling under the immense pressure. Still, Anju pressed on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" Was all that Anju could offer, in the tiniest voice imaginable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the lady who likes water right? Jim says that I have to give you this...\" Anju winced as the boy brought forth another bottle of Spring Water - it too was filled to the absolute brim...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... listen....\" Anju began. \"I'm actually um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't helped anyone this month,\" the Bomber Boy offered in a deflated tone, \"Jim says that I'm kicked outta the Bombers if I don't help somebody today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju was still wincing, \"Well...*hic* I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody ever needs my help,\" he sulked, \"I'm gonna get kicked out of the Bombers for sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju watched as tears began to fill his eyes. She bit her bottom lip and clenched her fists. Her stomach was so full and she needed to go so badly that she had begun hopping subtely on the spot which sent ebbing pain through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holdonholdonholdon!\" Anju winced, \"I'll-drink-your-water...Ooh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was suddenly filled with newfound energy as he bolted over to Anju, beaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" He whispered, eyes wide with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju tried to smile, but her lower jaw was shaking. \"Mmmhmm...\" was all she could muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anju took the bottle of Spring Water from the Bomber boy, a particularly violent jolt shot through her body, leaving the Innkeeper briefly cross-eyed as she nearly doubled over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of deep and growling gurgles soon followed, with Anju was relegated to cradling her stomach in one hand and trying not to lose grip of the bottle with the other. This was it, she had reached her physical limit - another drop of Spring Water or Chateau Romani and she was going to pop like a Deku Bubble!<br>\r\nAnju had started to falter on the spot, clenching her teeth, but out of compulsion she had managed to raise the Spring Water to her lips once more. <br>\r\nGulp after gulp the bottle began to empty. The Bomber boy watched on as the shivering Anju tiled the bottle skyward, as the water soon vanished from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Nomorenomorenomore....\" Anju whimpered, seething in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had managed to drop the bottle, though it remained unscathed as it rolled towards the final Bomber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking towards the bottle, and then to Anju, the Bomber confirmed, \"No more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... No more.\" Anju whined through clenched teeth as she sat on the steps of the Curiosity Shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I...\" the Bomber looked on concerned, \"I helped you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnju was now rocking, both hands firmly caressing her roiling stomach. \"Oh yeah. Yep. You did! No more now please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of satisfaction came over the oblivious Bomber as he withdrew his Notebook and began scrawling his entry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helped. Water. Lady. And. Baby.\" He read aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Anju blurted between deep breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bomber looked at his Notebook, then to Anju, then to her massive belly, then back to his Notebook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" He started, conflicted. \"Your belly is... Oh... Okay...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bomber erased the addition to his entry and shut his Notebook with confidence, then stood in a faux-salute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Bomber's Seek-red Suc-i-ally of Judge-stice Forn-ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Bomber darted away back to East Clock Town, Anju sat as her stomach rumbled, filled to the absolute brim with water. <br>\r\n'This must be what it feels like to be a Blue Chuchu...' she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was hungry from playing outside all day, but dinner was still a few hours away, and Cremia always hated when Romani snacked before dinner. She thought for a moment, closing her eyes and placing her hand on her chin. Her face suddenly perked up and she grinned as she thought of plan. Cremia had just finished milking some fresh Chateau Romani earlier today, and left it in shack where the cows stayed. Romani planned to sneak into the shack, not only would she satisfy her hunger, she'd finally be able to try the special milk of her namesake.<br>\r\nRomani carefully creeped up behind the cow's shack, even if Cremia was busy with other farm work, it was still broad daylight. so Romani decided to be extra careful. She look around before squeezing herself into a small hole in the back of the shack. After crawling inside and dusting herself off, she took a look around the room. It didn't take her long to spy the large kegs of the Chateau Romani. Just her luck, it seemed Cremia had left a keg unsealed. The milk seemed to radiate a strange purple glow, but Romani figured that maybe it was supposed to look like that. She approached the open and keg, and carefully lowered her face to the placid surface of the milk. She started at it with huge eyes full of excitement, barely able to contain herself she lowered her lips to the surface, and began taking deep gulps.<br>\r\nThe special milk was the best she had ever tasted. It was rich, creamy, and slightly thick. It even tingled a bit on her lips and on the way down to her stomach. After many moments and even more gulps, Romani raised her head, wiped the milk from her mouth with one swift motion from her arm, and let out a hearty sigh. Her stomach bulged slightly from all the milk she had drank. Romani rubbed her belly, causing a tiny burp to well up from within her. She blushed and slightly covered her mouth, despite her only company being cows.<br>\r\nRomani suddenly felt very warm. She blushed hard as her groin lit up in excitement, not knowing what to do, she pressed both of her hands against her crotch as she slowly fell to the ground. She began to pant and sweat slightly. The warmth seemed to be spreading, but was still concentrated in her groin.<br>\r\n\"Oooooh,\" she moaned, \"What's happening to me... I feel so funny...\"<br>\r\nThe intense heat in her groin suddenly seemed to begin moving.</span></div></div>",

Her face managed to flush a deeper red, as she realized her once full belly now felt disappointingly empty. Romani was quickly distracted from this thought as she felt her fingers begin to sink into her belly. She looked down to her belly and was shocked to see it bulging further outward and showing no sign of stopping. Romain pressed her hands harder against her belly, there was no mistake, she was rapidly fattening up. Her eyes began to tear up, but she couldn't keep her mind off how good it all felt.<br>\r\nRomani slowly managed to pull herself off the ground, her knees buckling from the pleasure of it all. She suddenly felt a new, tickling sensation in her head and ears. She reached up to feel her ears, only to find them missing! Frantically she patted her head until she felt something different. It felt soft and fuzzy, she pulled on it only find that it hurt, though the pain was quickly replaced by the pleasurable warmth. She continued to feel the soft, fuzzy thing atop her head, until finding there was a second one resting atop her head. She quickly grabbed both of them separate hands, after several moments of grasping at them, Romani realized they could be nothing else but pig ears.<br>\r\nShe tried to screech but only managed a soft moan. Before she even had time to get over the fact that she now had pig ears, a small pressure sprang up in her mouth, particularly in her lower canines. She covered her mouth with the palm of her hand, only to quickly remove it as two tiny, yet cute tusks grew out of her mouth and poked her palm. Almost instantly after the tusks sprouted, the tickling sensation began again, this time right above her butt. Just as Romani reached towards her butt she could feel a small, curly tail push against her dress and into her hand.<br>\r\nTears flowed from Romani's eyes as she rubbed her still expanding belly. It had grown into a sizable potbelly and was beginning to strain the fabric of her dress. Just as Romani thought things couldn't get any worse, the intense warmth in her belly began spreading to her entire body. Her knees buckled and she fell backwards, but caught herself against a wall. Her entire body began to fill with fat. She looked down at her legs as they began to surge with fat, she could feel her ass expand rapidly as it pushed against the wall.  Her breasts began to expand as well, but at a much slower rater than the rest of her body. Her small white dress was nearly at its limit. Stretched thin against her breasts, belly, and ass. She could barely move her thickening legs as the dress began to constrict their movement. Romani had easily gained fifty pounds, she looked at her now flabby arms and felt her chubby face. The warmth in her body told her this wasn't ending anytime soon.<br>\r\nRomani's fat belly began to form small tears across the midsection of her dress. soft, creamy white flesh poked out of every tear and continued to pour out and tear the holes larger. Her love handles pushed hard against the sides of her dress, causing tears running up and down the length of the dress. Romani was surprised again, as her hips suddenly swelled outward into a near motherly curve despite her age and size. Her ass and thighs fattened rapidly to match her new widened form, causing  the lower half of her dress to burst off, leaving only her breasts covered by a tight, shredded, and ever-shrinking piece of fabric. Romani's belly gurgled and surged out with fat, causing Romani to tumble forward and land on her now over sized belly. The impact caused Romani to belch loudly and it felt like the warmth was leaving her body.<br>\r\nShe laid there on her belly, looking at and feeling the changes to her body. Romani was almost disappointed to see that her breasts had stopped growing at a large C cup. However, her ass was enormous, each cheek easily bigger than her head. Her thighs were monstrously thick, and her belly was as big as Goron's. Her arms were fat and flabby, and her chubby face was beginning to develop a second chin.  <br>\r\nRomani sighed, hoping it was all over.</span></div></div>",

A healthy belch escaped her maw and she yawned and leaned back, rubbing her robust belly with a free hand.  Her body had bloated almost grotesquely large, for such a little imp, and she sat there rather enjoying the gorging.  Labored breaths escaped from her as she eyed her fat body, \"too much, too quick!\" she thought.  She was heavy, she was fat, and yet she was still a bit hungry.  Her arms and legs, though plumped up, still appeared far too small for her over shapely bod, and her rear end had seemingly taken the brunt of the growth, becoming swollen to comical proportions, her gut hung over her crotch and wobbled with any movement at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple feet away, Link whimpered as he rolled onto his back, side to side, kicking his hind paws into the air, what had gotten into him?  His gut was enormous, the fur had even thinned lightly at the tightest spot.  Though he hadn't put on as much weight as quickly as Midna had, he felt like he'd explode at any second. \"Rrawrrooor...\" he whined, followed by a surprise wolf-belch.  Midna snorted as she turned her attention from the flesh folds on her side to the gasious wolf companion.  \"Hmph!  What're you doing?  Get up!  Get up!  You're so selfish, some of us are still hungry!\"  Midna wobbled and shook from side to side, using a hand formed of her hair to help lift her until she was standing, she squeezed her thick distended belly and turned around, showing off her gigantic rear cushions to the bloated puppy.  \"Some hero you are...I thought you could take it!\"  She teased and playfully slapped at her fat butt, the flesh quivered and shook, and she giggled gently spreading the cheeks for a playful inner-shot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink simply stared at the candid shot, and before he knew it, Midna had disappeared and reapeared on top of him, her fat colored belly pressed tightly into his muzzle, nearly cutting off his breathing, he looked down his snout into her gut and felt his ears warm with blush.  Midna snorted and laughed, his nose, stuffed deep into her navel, was cold, and she was rather liking the feeling.  \"Get up!  We have to find another source of food!  There's got to be food storehouses galore here!\"  She disappeared again, Link licked his muzzle, growled and looked around for the imp, sloshing his gut to one side and rolling himself onto his legs, Link steadied himself and stood up.  Within seconds he was flat on the ground again, his eyes bulging in surprise, the 300 lbs of imp fat had landed on his back.  Link shook and managed to lift the girth of his own gut and Midna's overweight body.  \"Let's go puppet!\"  she wiggled her massive rear end against his back, allowing the cheeks to spread against Link's furry spine.  Midna couldn't go without her valiant steed.  She was being mean, she knew, but Midna was starting to grow more than fond of Link, and as a show of appreciation she was seen leaning in and belching into his ear, a fang-filled smile creeping along her face.

Can your feet even touch the ground now?\u201d she asked, less out of concern for him and almost entirely out of concern for her enormous self.

Taking a glance down, she realized that she was as close to the ground as possible; Link was entirely trapped in her flab. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d Slowly getting up and jigglying her butt, giving a quick moan as Link fell out of a less than ideal part for him part of Midna\u2019s body, she started to pace. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re too much of a pansy to carry me\u2026 Eh...\u201d Caught off guard by Link\u2019s glare, she suddenly realized what his expression was hinting at. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t exactly teleport as\u2026 Well\u2026 I think we\u2019re both too heavy for it.

Link, we\u2019re going to steal this wild boar! Some stupid moblin probably left it here anyway\u2026 Finders keepers!\u201d Toddling over to it, it simply gruffed as a vague sign of recognition. \u201c\u2026 Thanks. Now c\u2019mon Link, push me up here!\u201d Midna demanded, waggling her butt in his face with a smirk. After an arkward minute passed of her invitingly looking at Link, Midna gave up and simply used her hair to place herself on board. \u201cOh\u2026 Eh, didn\u2019t know I could do that, heh\u2026\u201d She picked up Link and placed him on board too, lying him across its back. Link simply gave her back a blank stare. It would be perfectly safe to say that Midna wasn\u2019t exactly a pro at flirting with other people. Or animals at any rate. The sight of both of them on the boar was something to see; as Midna\u2019s height had only changed substantially, it was a miracle she was even able to still move; she looked like a literal mountain of black and grey flesh in a vaguely humanoid shape, while Link was more or less a wolf in the shape of a huge deflated balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two rode off away from the now empty warehouse, half the beast\u2019s huge body draped in Midna and Link\u2019s oozing blubber, the imp started to think over where to go. \u201cWell, there\u2019s the Zora Domain with all that fish\u2026 But on the other hand, I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s somewhere else filled to the brim with tasty food, eh Link?\u201d By the end of this, the first place she decided to visit was\u2026</span></div></div>",

Drawing a gasp from the bloated creature, the boy-in-green danced all over, tickling her clit before darting deep within her. Through the massive wall of flab that buried him, Link could hear distinctive moans, with his continual efforts eliciting a shudder from his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Midna was quite enjoying her experience to say the least. After the initial shock, Link's efforts were lighting a fire within her rather large belly. Midna panted, starting to sweat as Link brought her closer and close to release. The red haired imp started rocking back and forth, grinding her hips onto the hero's face, both hands groping her massive chest. She was almost there....Almost......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Midna began to shift Link redoubled his efforts. He knew that her damn was about to burst, and he knew that if wanted any of that soft, sexy flesh he needed to get her there. The memory of her big, soft, belly and her massive breasts stuck in his mind like burnt cheese on a pan. \"What are you doing down there!?! Don't stop you baboon!\" Midna's cry brought him out of his daze. In his reverie he had paused from eating out the redhead. Once again he thrust his tongue into her open maw, all while he felt his massive hard on throbbing within her massive crack. Going in for the kill, the boy-in-green licked furiously at Midna's clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supersized imp tensed as Midna experienced a wondrously large orgasm. Hot, sticky juices flowed down over the young boy's face, most of which he eagerly lapped up. The red-haired behemoth slowly tipped over backward, winded from the strength of her explosion. Wiping his face, Link scrambled out from under her. Stepping between the parted legs of the still panting imp, he prodded her in the belly with his still massive erection. He then jumped upward, landing on top of Midna's massive belly which sloshed back and forth beneath him, still laden with water. Midna glanced upwards at him, barely managing to see him over her bloated breasts. Still, what she did see pleased her greatly. Link's rock hard member stood proudly at attention, throbbing almost painfully, dripping in precum. The redheaded creature from Twilight smiled coyly. \"Good work boy! *Pant* you did well.

By now, for nearly a mile all that could be smelt was the vastly obese imp\u2019s stench. While she found it hilarious and incredibly comfortable, Link was a good 100 yards away from her. With a bit of effort, she brought the struggling wolf back by her side. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly normal for people to fart\u2026 Even diva\u2019s like me!\u201d She snorted. \u201cAnd besides, I kinda like your company; somebody as self-indulgent as me needs as many servants as possible.\u201d Link couldn\u2019t even really register what she\u2019d said; he had passed out due to the gas. \u201cMeh. More grub for me then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Link came to, Midna\u2019s body had half-engulfed him. \u201cMan, wolfie, that was DELICIOUS. Should\u2019a seen the size of some of those fish.\u201d She couldn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t have\u2026 Yet taking a look into a now nearly empty canyon, he saw she had. And looking behind him, he saw that she was a very large, very soft, very gassy\u2026</span></div></div>",

Buuu-uuuu-uuuuurp!\" Out of her mouth started to rain a long series of fish bones. \"And man, I'm still starving! You know what that means!\" She smiled with a toothy fang, yet Wolf Link decided then and there to bolt, before realizing his own stomach was holding him off the ground a few good feet. \"I felt you'd be a bit hungry to wolfie, though you've still gotta carry me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an amazing amount of strength from her hair, she managed to plonk up all of her belly and land directly on Link, though she still held a great deal of her weight as to make sure he wasn't getting completely squished or anything. On Links side, despite her nice feeling body, it was heavy and stank like nothing had ever stank before. It was near self-explanatory that Midna just wanted to engulf Link in her huge rolls of fat for a laugh. After a few moments, Midna managed to grab her mountainous body again and remove Link from underneath her belly. \"Man, you sure are weak! I weigh like, 30,000 now? What kind of wolf can't carry that!\" Laughing uncontrollably, she picked up Link by the tail and placed him inbetween her breasts. \"So wolfie, where to teleport to? Or more accurately, what to feed my gorgeous self next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink paused for a moment. Teleport? Why the hell not just bring that up at the begining? Though as if she could read his mind, Midna gave him a cute wink.</span></div></div>",

At first he thought she was joking, but an extremely loud grumbling and groaning from her stomach beneath him told him otherwise. Midna giggled as her rumbling stomach jiggled all of her blubbery fat body, rippling everywhere. Link whimpered with worry, fearing just how much she had to eat now in order to fill that massive gut. He looked up to see Midna licking her lips in anticipation, globs of saliva matting his fur. \"Oops! Sorry wolfie, I can't help myself, I'm just soooo hungry!\" She grabbed a roll of fat with her hair and shook it up and down, emphasizing its majestic size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled again. \"If all the fish here are gone, we'll just have to go to the source of the water, now won't we?\" Before Link could even utter a protest, both Link and Midna were being sucked upward bit by bit into a dark hole in the sky. A few seconds later, they were falling a short distance into the lower portion of the Zora's Domain. Midna licked her lips in anticipation of the cool water and all the fish, reekfish included, that were swimming all over. Although it considerably had less water than Lake Hylia itself, strangely enough, there were a lot more fish, and all of them even bigger than anything the Lake had to offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink somehow wedged himself out of Midna's titanic breasts, and hopped toward dry land, where he was hopefully safe from the unabashed gluttonous consumption that was about to take place.

Out of the blue, she spotted a worn looking building, faded with colors, covered with colossal trees that she could just see out of the corner of her eye. Midna glanced over down at Link who she put between her breasts. She teleported them towards the forest, and appeared at the edge. \"Okay Wolfie, Wakey! Time to move!\" barked Midna happily, as the wolf climbed down from her cleavage. She tried to waddle into the forest , but she couldn't budge her fleshy legs. \"Help\" she yelped, struggling to move her legs. Link ran into her calf fat quickly, which pushed her a bit. She then began to waddle. \"Thanks for the push.\" she mumbled patting her stomach and waddling into the forest. Link followed behind as her faithful sidekick, eyes glowing as Midna pushed through trees to get to the building. She was panting as she stood in front of the huge building. It was about 100 feet tall, 50 feet wide (this is also near a mountain which hides most of it in the mist), had trees growing all around it, ivy growing off the sides, and it was faded bronze colored. There was a large sign on the front of it that read: the Grand Bakery, written in script. There was a wide doorway in which Midna continued to waddle through. Link sighed and followed his fatty companion though the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the first room, Link observed the walls, which were covered in articles about \"The Grand Bakery\". One talking about the amazing, large wedding cakes and pies they made that tasted very well and lasted for a very long time, and how a slice of pie would taste fresh out of the oven even after five years since it was baked. Another article talked about how fattening the delicacies were and they seemed to be quite addictive. The next article read about how the bakery was robbed and ever since they relocated and delivered their treats  secretly. The last article was about how people were trying to get recipes to their baked goods which drove the business into closing. Midna didn't notice the articles, when she read \"The Grand Bakery\" all that was in her head was \"Bakery\" and bakery mean't pies, cakes, pastries and other foods to feed her. Midna wobbled into the kitchen drooling when she finally got to the door, meanwhile Link stayed behind and read the articles in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Midna got into the kitchen, she was amazed, there were pies and wedding cakes that were the size of buildings, she waddled over to the nearest pie and grabbed the edge of the crust. Midna tried to hoist herself in ,but she couldn't support her weight enough to get in. \"Wolf, Come Help!\" she commanded, trying to get into the sweet, tasty goodness of the pie. Link growled, then trotted over to Midna, all he could see was her enormous butt and she said \"Push me in!' Link obeyed and pushed her as hard as he could, she tipped over into the pie and let a fart in Link's face which made him fall onto the floor. \"Oops\" she mumbled as she landed in the pie. Midna shoved some cherry filling into her mouth and chewed. It was the most delicious thing she ever tasted. Even though it looked old, it tasted warm like it was right out of the oven. She had to have more, so she shoved it all in her maw. Midna's belly grew more, and was softer, she couldn't move from the middle of the pie tray. She kept trying to move.</span></div></div>",

Ilia noticed a large staff with a humanoid skull on top of it. He had pouches and vials hanging from his belt. He patted one gently and chuckled. Ilia looked up to see him and the larger goblin looking at her and grinning evilly. She blinked.<br>\r\nThe larger goblin, looking surprisingly satisfied, wiped the blue from his face and walked off with the smaller goblin. Ilia watched as the disappeared behind a crooked doorway. <br>\r\nImmediately she spit to rid the remnants of the pudding that was in her mouth. <br>\r\n\"It has to be poison.\" She told herself. \"It tasted too sweet to be goblin food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went on. Or at least Ilia thought it was day. The room was dark save for the small crack which let little light in. It must have been an old abandoned building somewhere deep in the forest. Ilia could hear birds chirping nearby and frogs croaking loudly from what must have been a stream or pond. <br>\r\nShe tried desperately to get the chain loose from her feet but to no avail. She felt her strength leave her as more time passed. She was starting to grow weary with hunger. <br>\r\nShe swallowed and sat back against the wall, her arms wrapped around her knees.

Looking down, she noticed all of the food the goblins left sitting a few feet in front of her. Her mouth watered.<br>\r\n\"No...\" she thought. She wouldn't give in. Though, if it were poison, she might be sick or dead by now, she concluded. If they wanted her dead, she wouldn't be alive by now.<br>\r\n\"Link will save me.\" She told herself. \"He knows I'm here.\"<br>\r\nA few more minutes passed and the smell from the food was stronger than it had ever been. <br>\r\nWith a deep breath she leaned forward and crawled over to the bowls nearest to her.<br>\r\n\"Just a couple spoonfuls will keep me until I am rescued.\" She said with a shred of optimism as she looked down at what there was to choose from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was the blue pudding and the other was full of small blue powdered rolls.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she inspected them in the dim light she noted that they were covered in some strange sparkly blue powdered sugar. It seemed to glimmer a bit but she dismissed it as a trick of the light or her weariness. <br>\r\nShe picked one up and squeezed it gently. It was soft and smelled as though it had been baked this morning. It was about the size of an orange.<br>\r\nShe licked her lips and opened her mouth to take a bite. Her lips met with cool creaminess.<br>\r\nIt was cream filled! Ilia's eyes widened with surprise and a hint of joy. <br>\r\nShe chewed and eventually swallowed. It was delicious. <br>\r\nNo way any goblins could have baked such a thing, she thought as she took her second and third bite. <br>\r\nThe powdered sugar was so sweet and the cream was just right. It was probably the best baked good she had ever had. She finished the first one quickly and then downed another, and then another.<br>\r\n\"Just one more.\" She told her self.<br>\r\nDespite her own words, it wasn't until there was only 3 rolls left in the bowl when she realized how much she was eating. She swallowed and wiped the crumbs from her cheek. Ilia figured she must have eaten at least a dozen. <br>\r\nAfter a couple more seconds, the last 3 disappeared into her.<br>\r\nShe belched lightly and but her hand on her belly. It puffed out slightly.Ilia had never eaten that much in such a short time ever. She wanted to say she was full but she still felt hungry strangely. <br>\r\nA slight tingle seemed to spread through her body. Subtle at first, but then it grew. She took a deep breath as she realized it was stemming from her stomach. It was beckoning her for more.<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of this new feeling she began to feel famished. Her mouth watered immediately when she looked up to the other food. <br>\r\nShe crawled hastily over to the other plates and bowls and began to pick at them. She took small portions at first. Bits of a cooked bird, a couple handfuls of mashed potatoes, a few pieces of sliced ham.<br>\r\nIt was all very good somehow. Ilia figured maybe the goblins had captured a chef and forced him to cook or something. But she didn't care. All she knew was that she was hungry and her hunger seem to grow by the minute. She started taking bigger portions. Slowly, the bowls began to empty.<br>\r\nShe picked up a nearby pail filled to the brim with what she thought was milk and took a sip.<br>\r\nIt was milk and it was fresh and cold. She swallowed, sat back with her legs crossed and tipped it back.<br>\r\nShe took a few gulps but her stomach still seemed empty.<br>\r\nAs the milk poured down her gullet she felt the pressure on her belly from the cloth tunic she was wearing. <br>\r\nIt was soft and ornate, with little designs going around the front and sides of it and it was held together by a large thread lacing neatly up her back to a bow at the top. <br>\r\nFor the first time in her life, it felt tight on her. <br>\r\nShe reached back and untied the bow, letting off some of the strain and then retied it at a looser fitting.<br>\r\nIlia felt the tingle rise up again inside her. <br>\r\nShe looked down to see her belly pushing up the once loose-fitting tunic. It was almost peeking out from underneath. Placing a hang on it, it gurgled slightly. It was tight, and yet she felt no discomfort.<br>\r\nIt felt like she hadn't eaten hardly anything and yet her belly looked 4 months pregnant. Ilia began to get a little nervous, but it didn't help her hunger.<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments, the remainder of the food was gone. All the was left were a few crumbs and bones.<br>\r\nShe pulled herself against the wall and sat back with her legs out. Her tummy was heavy with the food and it was now peeking out from under her tunic. She pulled the cloth up to reveal it in its entirety. She couldn't believe how big it was.<br>\r\nA small smile ran across her face as she looked at it. It was almost as if she was pregnant. She pretended briefly she was pregnant with twins as she rubbed it. Link's twins... <br>\r\n\"Link!\" She said snapping out of it, realizing that she was still not rescued and the light from the crack was definitely fading. She gulped and looked around. Nothing but empty bowls and plates...<br>\r\n...And the pudding...<br>\r\nJust then, the warm tingle rose from her stomach again and her mouth watered. Her belly needed more food.</span></div></div>",

It was just out of reach so she scooted herself a little forward and reached at it with her right foot. She caught the rim of the bowl between her toes and the ball of her foot. With relative ease, she pulled it towards her close enough to grab.<br>\r\nShe hefted it up and looked at it. It rested softly on her belly.<br>\r\nThe pudding was blue like the sky and looked so rich. There was also something else that was odd about it. <br>\r\nIt almost seemed to glow slightly in the dimming light. It had to be her imagination, she thought.<br>\r\nGazing at it, her mouth began to salivate a lot more than usual. She felt like she hadn't eaten in days, and yet, she just ate a feast for a large family herself.<br>\r\nIt didn't matter. She grabbed the spoon, scooped up the pudding and filled her mouth with it. <br>\r\nAs soon as it hit her tongue, her mouth exploded with flavor. It was like her taste buds were thanking her. It was creamy, rich, and sweet. It tickled the roof of her mouth as it went down her throat and into her awaiting belly.<br>\r\nShe exhaled loudly. This is what heaven must taste like. <br>\r\nIlia immediately scooped more into her mouth. With each spoonful, her body seemed to tingle more and more. She began to enjoy the sensation. Her belly started to quiver a bit. So subtle that she didn't even notice.<br>\r\nAnother bite. The euphoria spread from her tongue to her feet. She couldn' t help but eat more of it. It was like nothing she had ever tasted. Ilia leaned her head back to savor the taste for a bit before her stomach cried out for more. She took another spoonful and felt it fill her stomach. It tingled with delight and even started to feel tight at last.<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes to realize that the tightness wasn't from her stomach being full, but from her tunic being too tight. How could this be? I just loosened it a moment ago.<br>\r\nShe pondered quietly but was still so hungry. She finally gave into her desire and threw the spoon away and put her lips to the brim of the bowl. The pudding fell into her mouth, and somewhat on and around her mouth too. She gulped the mouthfuls as it slid down her throat. <br>\r\nWith every gulp, her belly expanded, but she was too into the pudding to notice.<br>\r\nHer breasts even began to stretch the cloth at her shoulders and sides as well as they too ballooned up a bit. <br>\r\nHer thread belt began to pinch her waist as she filled herself more and more. Ilia's pants too began to feel tighter than ever before, especially at her thighs.<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes. She didn't want it to end.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just then she felt a pop which broke her from her trance. Looking down, she found that her belt had popped. But what's more, her belly was huge! She let out a loud gasp and watched it. It gurgled loudly and tingled from within. Her eyes widened as it pushed out further and further. It was swollen like she was pregnant still but something strange was happening. With every heartbeat, it seemed be digesting it. But Ilia didn't feel nature calling. As the warm tingle enveloped her body, she set the bowl down and watched. <br>\r\nHer hips and rear spread out underneath her causing her to lift slightly from the added cushion. Her breasts swelled and began to pull at her tunic even more. Her thighs pulled at her cloth pants and she could see the seems beginning to stretch. The cloth at her base was already at its limit. She placed her hands on her belly. It was still tight and swollen and was still pushing out. <br>\r\nShe wrapped her arms around as much as she could to try to get it to somehow stop, but it was too late. She already ate so much of the strange tasty pudding.<br>\r\nThe tingling sensation suddenly seemed to grow and spread to every inch of her growing body. She clenched her belly and threw her head back as she grew. The pressure on her belly and bust was getting too much. <br>\r\nShe arched her back as her weight increased, trying to desperately release the pressure. Her toes curled.<br>\r\nWith one loud pop, followed by another, and another and a few more, her belly did the work for her. Her tunic was now no longer tied together with a bow. The holes that held the laces together broke and only the bow remained at the top. Her belly was now free to grow. <br>\r\nShe opened one eye to see the mound of flesh in front of her. She looked like she was now full-term with quadruplets. <br>\r\n\"I'm..I'm going to explode.\" She whispered. \"What's happening to me?\"<br>\r\nThe tingling began to dull a bit and she could now feel the her belly softening under her fingers. It began to somewhat deflate very slowly as it seemed to redistribute the weight elsewhere. <br>\r\nHer waist and hips immediately swelled up with fat. Her pants began to strain at her legs and even a few seems popped as her thighs began to grow thicker and meatier. Ilia's sides seemed to start to hang over her pants as they unbuttoned themselves. She could hear the buttons falling to the floor as she watched her belly start to fold over itself at the middle, causing her belly button to disappear under all the new fat. Her arms thickened along with her calves and she could even feel her chin start to swell a bit. It was now a bit harder to look down.<br>\r\nWith a few more pulses of added weight, she could feel the tingling reside and the activity in her body calm.<br>\r\nReaching behind her, she pulled the bow loose and finally removed what was left of her favorite tunic. <br>\r\nShe breathed heavily as she looked over herself. She lifted her hands to her now huge breasts as they sagged down and rested on her belly. Her nipples were much bigger now as she hefted them up slightly. They were so heavy and full of fat. But nothing could compare to her belly. It was flabby and very soft as she ran her fingers across it. Ilia thought she must have gained at least 40 or 50 pounds in the past 5 minutes.<br>\r\n\"This can't be me.\" She told herself. \"I look like father!\" <br>\r\nShe struggled to stand. Placing her feet beneath her, she lifted herself from the ground. Wobbling a bit, Ilia got her balance and felt her thighs push together like they never had before. She was now standing straight, with one hand on the wall and the other on her belly. She looked over her large new breasts to see the the pudge peeking out. Ilia bit her lip as she ran her fingers under the large fold of flesh she now had. She managed to lift her hand from the wall only to place it on her lower belly. Her lower belly fold was like an apron of fat falling down over her popped buttons on her pants which were on the brink of tearing all together. <br>\r\nShe fingered it for a few seconds and moved her shackled foot forward to see her leg fat filling the space up that was once in between her and it. Her feet still were dainty and slender as always, but could they support all this new weight?<br>\r\nShe swallowed and felt tears forming at her eyes. Just then she heard footsteps.<br>\r\nIlia froze as the larger goblin and his smaller shaman-like assistant appeared in front of her.<br>\r\nThe larger goblin's jaw dropped and the other goblin smiled and shouted out the door. <br>\r\nAll the younger goblin assistants ran in and gaped at her new figure. The crack in the ceiling let in just light in on her to really make her stand out of the darkness. She was like a big glowing goddess to their eyes.<br>\r\nSome goblins fell to their knees and others just simply stared.<br>\r\nA few seconds passed before Ilia spoke. <br>\r\n\"W-what have you done to me?\" She demanded.<br>\r\nThe goblins were silent. The larger of them looked at the shaman. He smiled and nodded towards one of the goblins nearby. Ilia watched as he ran out of the room and within seconds ran back in with another bowl. <br>\r\nHe motioned for the larger goblin. The assistant followed the large one as they approached the poor human girl. <br>\r\nIlia backed up a bit with her hands trying to conceal her over-sized breast with little luck.<br>\r\nThe large goblin gave a teethy grin and lifted a spoonful to her mouth.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing the large goblin advance towards her with a spoonful of the pudding in one hand and a bowl of it in the other, Ilia debated about what she should do. She glanced at the door, which was wide open and unguarded. <br>\r\n<i>I could make it, if I didn't have this shackle on...</i> she thought, a glum look on her rounder face. <br>\r\nLooking back at the goblin, she shook her head. <br>\r\n\"N-No! I don't want anymore...\", Ilia said weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a half-truth. She didn't want anymore, because she would end up growing again. On the other hand, the pudding was so good. She had spent her life living on milk and cheese from goats, pumpkins from the fields and, on special occasions, grilled cucco. She had never had anything quite like the pudding, and due to this, she wanted more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large goblin waited. She could tell that he was getting impatient. If she didn't act soon, then they would force her to eat. Ilia glanced at the door again. And then back at the spoon, which was suddenly shoved under her nose. She smelt the pudding...<br>\r\nGrabbing the spoon from the goblin, Ilia shoved it in her mouth. Pulling it back out, she quickly licked it clean. She looked back at the large goblin, who had backed up when she had grabbed the spoon. The smaller goblin smiled in the background and left the room with a couple of goblins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia stuck one of her hands out, but made sure that her breasts were kind of covered up. She wasn't happy with the idea of these goblins staring at her. <br>\r\nThe larger goblin struggled for a second before realising what she wanted. He handed the bowl to Ilia, who turned her back on the goblins and fell onto her backside, which spread out below her. Ilia hated her new body, but was kind of thankful that her backside made the stone floor a little more comfortable. <br>\r\nHearing the door slam shut behind her, Ilia checked that the goblins had actually left before allowing her arm to drop away from her meaty breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! I can enjoy this!\" She exclaimed. <br>\r\nDropping the spoon, Ilia lifted the bowl to her lips and allowed the pudding to run in. A small trickle ran down her chin, which she ignored. After finishing the bowl off, she wiped the small bit off of her chin and licked her finger clean. She didn't want to pass up any of the pudding. <br>\r\nSighing in content, Illia leaned back. She could get used to this kind of life. One where she didn't have to take care of kids in Ordon, or pick pumpkins. Instead, she could be treated like a queen by the goblins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I thinking! I need to get out of here!\" Ilia exclaimed. <br>\r\nShe pushed herself to her feet and immediately regretted it. She heard her stomach gurgle. Looking down, she felt her belly soften and shrink slightly. Her breasts, free from any constraints, grew heavier. Lifting them both, Ilia groaned as she felt them become softer. She let go of them, allowing them to drop onto her belly, which hung down over the front of her pants. Her backside softened and pushed against her pants. Ilia heard a quiet ripping noise from her pants. <br>\r\n\"Please don't rip...\", She whispered. <br>\r\nThankfully, they held, but rips had opened up in multiple places. Her thighs were pushing against each other. Looking over her breasts and belly, Ilia caught sight of her once dainty feet, which were now pudgy. <br>\r\nRunning one of her plump hands over her face, she groaned again when she felt how soft her cheeks were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back down, Ilia wanted to cry again. Her life was slowly being ruined by this delicious pudding that couldn't get enough of, and she couldn't do anything about it!<br>\r\nAn unknown amount of time passed. Ilia didn't know how long ago she had been taken from the spring outside Ordon, but it must have been a couple of days. Hearing her door open, Ilia looked up to see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking up, Ilia just looked at the small goblin, who had a small sack hanging over his shoulder and his staff in his hand. <br>\r\n\"What? Am I not fat enough for you?\" Ilia asked, trying to keep it together. <br>\r\nThe goblin smiled and shook his head. <br>\r\n\"Then what do you want?\" She asked, pulling her knees as close to her chest as possible. Unfortunately, her pants didn't like that. <br>\r\nShe heard them rip. Looking down, she gasped as she saw the remnants of her pants around her. She immediately moved one of her hands downwards, not wanting the goblin to see anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up, she was surprised to see that the goblin had turned his back on her. In front of her was the sack he had brought in. <br>\r\n\"Clothes. Inside\", the goblin said, causing Ilia's eyes to widen in shock. <br>\r\n\"You...You can talk!?\" She asked in disbelief. <br>\r\n\"Speak little Hylian. It enough\", he replied. His voice was unexpectedly high pitched. Ilia had always imagined a goblins voice to be deep, if they even had voices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the bag, she smiled as she saw a top and a pair of pants in the bag. Pulling the top out, she admired the handiwork. It was simple, kind of like her old top, but she could tell that it was made by the goblins. It was brown, and there were loose threads here and there, but after she pulled it on and felt how comfortable it was, she didn't care how it looked. <br>\r\nLooking at the pants, they were made of the same material as the top, and just as comfortable. Standing up, she inspected her body. Someone who didn't know her would think much of it, but a friend or someone from Ordon would definitely recognise differences. Her belly was hidden by her top, but still hung down slightly. A small amount of cleavage was on view, and the chest on the top was pushed out more than her old top. Her chubby arms were uncovered, and gave away her recent gain. The pants hugged her plump hips, but hid her bigger backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You done?\" The goblin asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you so much!\" Ilia said happily. Sure, she was about 70 or 80 pounds heavier than a couple of days ago, but these new clothes hid most of that gain. <br>\r\n\"No thanks. Only listen?\" The goblin asked. <br>\r\nWorking through his broken Hylian, Ilia finally nodded. <br>\r\n\"Good. We goblins no like humans because humans no like goblins. You first human not show fear of goblin. We want you stay with goblin\", he explained. <br>\r\nOnce again, Ilia worked through his request. <br>\r\n\"You want me... to stay with you? Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Goblins like you. You friendly. Not like other humans\".<br>\r\n\"What about the pudding? Why did you feed me it?\" Ilia asked, more curious than annoyed. If she could become good friends with the goblins, then maybe she could get away. <br>\r\n\"It goblin food. Help goblin become strong. You weak looking, need goblin food. Look stronger now\", he said, pointing at Ilia with his staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens if I stay?\"<br>\r\n\"Goblin let you go. Not leave, not yet. You walk around, friend with goblins. Is good?\" He said. <br>\r\n\"And if I say No?\"<br>\r\n\"You stay here. We feed and keep alive, but no walk\".<br>\r\nIlia considered her options. If she said Yes, then she could walk around, maybe work some of this weight off. But then she be friends with goblins. If she met another human with her current clothing, then she'd be in big trouble. She could never go back to living in Ordon again!<br>\r\nBut if she said No, and she was rescued from a cell, then maybe she could go back to Ordon. Sure, she'd probably have to explain why she was locked up, but that was easy. But that was if she was rescued. She didn't know where they were. And plus, the goblins would continue to feed her. At least she could choose what to eat if she said Yes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ilia said...</span></div></div>",

All the new weight was actually working for her - but at the same time she noticed it took more effort to move and she wasn't nearly as fast as before. The Shaman swiftly moved out of the large girl's way and didn't even seem to try stopping her.<br>\r\nShe was at the door!

She brought her hands to her face and wept. <br>\r\nThe Shaman was now standing a few feet in front of her now. She expected to get struck with his cane but instead, he lifted a bit of cloth from one of his pouches and lifted it to her face. <br>\r\nShe watched him as she took it and wiped her tears away. <br>\r\nThe big goblin's voice muttered something from behind and the sound of the younger goblin's feet could be heard as they shuffled around her. Ilia began to get nervous as they placed their hands upon her. She froze in fear wondering what they were going to do to her. Surely attempted escape didn't mean well.<br>\r\nShe found them surprisingly gentle as they peeled the remaining clothing from her body. Her breasts swung freely in front of her and she quickly brought up her arms to attempt to conceal them.<br>\r\nShe turned her head back to see the Shaman once again reaching into one of his pouches. <br>\r\nBut this time, he pulled out a...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The big goblin gently pried her mouth open as one of the small goblins stuck the funnel in her mouth.  Releasing her mouth, the big goblin picked up a large pot from the floor and began to poor it into the funnel.  It was full of pudding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIllia tried to resist.  She was already so big that she couldn't get though doorways!  As good as that pudding was, she couldn't afford to have any more she told herself.  All of these thoughts dissipated as soon as the pudding hit her tongue.  It was different than the strange, blue pudding, but no less irresistible.  It had a flavour that Illia couldn't quite make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it went down her throat, down, down her esophagus into her crowded stomach, she kept trying to figure out what exactly the taste was.  Once it seemed to have the taste of strawberries, but it after a while she decided that wasn't right at all.  It rather tasted like watermelon... no, no... it was like fresh, golden grapes... no again... it was like kiwi.  Actually the taste seemed to encompass all the sweetest fruits.  It may have been magical, in fact.  Surely the goblins could not have made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the contents of the pot emptied, Illia began to grow increasingly sleepier and increasingly rounder.  The big goblin turned the pot upside down and looked inside just to make sure it was all gone.  All the goblins gave a disappointed growl upon finding that it was indeed empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIllia looked down at her naked, bloated body.  Her belly was now larger than her father's.  Her breasts, though large, looked small by comparison.  Her hips and thighs were still about the same size.  Given some time, some of that new fat would migrate to other regions, but for now, Illia's belly was by far her most prominent feature.

Upon noticing her awakening, one called the attention of the others, and sent one out of the room she resided in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nexamining her body, for the most part she was still nude, save for some small cloth the goblins seem to place around her neck that just barely covered over her chest, which had tripled in size as she had slept.

In reality, it was one of the bigger houses in the goblin settlement, which Ilia had redecorated after the goblins had given it to her. <br>\r\nInitially, Ilia had difficulty adjusting to her role as the goblins new Goddess. She had treated them nicely in the beginning, something which they, surprisingly, didn't take to. One of the goblins that had brought her food scowled at her after she thanked him for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after she had adjusted to her role, greed slowly showed itself in Ilia. She began demanding bigger and bigger portions. In her greed, weight had piled onto her form. Completely ignoring clothes now, Ilia lounged on her throne, which was a couple of chairs tied together. Her breasts, not even remotely covered by the bit of cloth she had been given, lay onto of the cream globe that was her belly. They were about the size of her head and probably weighed as much. Her belly lay in between her thighs, which were almost as thick as a tree trunk. It covered her private area from view, not that she cared. Her hips, now thrice their original size, still managed to ooze over each side of her two chairs. Her ass looked like it could've belonged to Epona. While Epona's was (Reasonably) firm, Ilia's was pure fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked a question!\" She yelled angrily, gesturing to the bowl of blue pudding a goblin was offering to her. \"This wouldn't feed a dog!\"<br>\r\nThe goblin bowed his head in apology. While the goblins understood Ilia perfectly, she couldn't make out a word she said, so the goblins used movements to communicate with their goddess. <br>\r\nAs he left, Ilia glared at the back of his head, displeased. <br>\r\n\"All I ask for is food! They can't provide for their goddess, then why keep them around?!\" She complained, grabbing a handful of puddings from the bowl he had left behind. She stuffed it into her mouth, not even bothering with the bits that dripped onto her second chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the bell that was outside her door, Ilia looked up to see the old goblin enter, or the 'Shaman', as she called him. <br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you. What do you want?\" Ilia asked rudely, stuffing another handful of pudding into her mouth. As she watched him, he clapped twice.

On the cart, there was a person, who had a sack thrown over their head. <br>\r\n\"Bring them here!\" Ilia ordered. <br>\r\nTwo goblins poked the person with their spears, forcing them towards their goddess. <br>\r\nAs they neared her, Ilia made out a couple of features. First, the person had a decent set of breasts on her chest, along with an ass to match. She had a cut above her left knee. <br>\r\nThe goblins forced her to her knees and ripped the sack of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, the woman saw a fat girl staring at her with annoyance. She wore no clothes, save for a weird scarf around her neck. <br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Ilia demanded, irritated by the interruption. This was the time when she was supposed to be having lunch, and she hated missing meals. <br>\r\n\"Who am I? Who are you?! What are...\" the woman tried to say, but one of the goblins slapped her. She fell silent. <br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter. Why are you here? To destroy my stronghold?\"<br>\r\n\"No, these goblins destroyed my caravan! We were carrying food from Hyrule Castle Town to Ordon Village, but we were ambushed!\" The woman explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food, you say?\" Ilia asked, leaning forward as far as her belly would allow. \"What kind of food?\"<br>\r\n\"It was some kind of glowing blue pudding, meant for the mayor. All major towns were meant to get a supply, Ordon, Kakariko, the Zoras...\"<br>\r\n\"Bring it to me,\" Ilia ordered, waving at two goblins who hurried off. She immediately thought of the stuff that the goblins made for her, causing her to drool slightly. <br>\r\n\"No, it's not for...\"<br>\r\n\"SILENCE!\" Ilia yelled. \"Take her to the dungeon. I will decide her fate shortly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was forced from the room, the goblins rolled in three barrels. Setting them next to Ilia, they prised the lids off, revealing the blue pudding. However, it differed from the pudding that the goblins made for her. <br>\r\n\"Leave!\" Ilia ordered. The shaman nodded with respect and left, followed closely by the goblins that had rolled in the barrels. <br>\r\nShe pulled a barrel closer and stuffed a handful into her mouth. She moaned. It was much, much nicer than the goblins pudding. She could taste different kinds of fruit, each one distinctive. <br>\r\nAs Ilia started stuffing herself, she didn't notice the faint magical glow that each barrel was giving off.<br>\r\nThe pudding was...</span></div></div>",

Good!\" She moaned, clearly addicted to the pudding. \"Want... more. Need... more!\"<br>\r\nPolishing off the first barrel, Ilia lent back on her throne. Her breasts had almost doubled in size, approaching the size of watermelons. They sat heavily on top of her globular belly. It was now much bigger than her father's belly, something she felt a bit of pride over. Beneath her, the two chairs groaned under the weight of Ilia's ass, which leaked over the edges of the chairs. Her thighs were thicker than tree trunks by this point, and were incredibly heavy. Ilia wasn't immobile, it would just be very hard to move, considering she hadn't moved once since she received her throne room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward again, Ilia started on the second barrel. As her body grew once again, her mind started to alter. What the woman didn't mention was who had payed for the delivery. Hyrule had been liberated from the Twilight, but its current ruler was still alive. While he couldn't reintroduce the Twilight while a hero roamed the lands, he could bring the town's under his control through other methods. Specifically, pudding that was addressed to the leaders of each town. This pudding had been cursed to make whoever ate it cruel, and greedy, much like Zant and his Master. <br>\r\nAs Ilia finished the second barrel, she lifted one of her arms and swatted the barrel aside. She grinned evilly. Her eyes, once a bright hazel, had taken on a reddish hue. Her fair skin had darkened ever so slightly. <br>\r\nLeaning back again, Ilia clapped twice. A goblin ran into her room. <br>\r\n\"I want more of this,\" Ilia said. \"I don't care how you get it. Get it all, and bring it to me!\"<br>\r\nNodding, the goblin ran out. <br>\r\nSmiling, Ilia started on the third barrel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the last of it?\"<br>\r\nA woman, clad in a purple and white dress, inspected a number of barrels. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Princess. Three barrels, bound for Ordon Village, just... disappeared\", one of her servants said. <br>\r\nZelda shook her head. Prince Ralis had alerted her to the blue substance. Almost instantly, she ordered a hunt for the barrels. However, three had gone missing. <br>\r\n\"Keep an eye open for them. I shall head for Ordon Village, and see if I can't lend my aid to the search\", Zelda said, heading towards the door. <br>\r\n\"Your Highness, Zant is still out there. If he were to capture you...\".<br>\r\n\"He will do nothing. While the Light rules Hyrule, Zant's powers are greatly diminished. And besides, Link is out there. While Link roams Hyrule, Zant will keep to his realm,\" Zelda said, grabbing her cloak and wrapping it over her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mostly those with caravans or such that appeared to possibly be carrying the pudding. With three prisoners, the goblins were actually starting to become nervous over Ilia's increasing rage. thankfully, one load they raided at least held food, which they decided to bring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, my eyesight must be bad, because i don't believe that what i see in front of me is pudding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe motioned for one of the larger goblins to come to her, which it obliged.

I should've known that they'd be watching Hyrule Field\".<br>\r\nSpying a couple of goblins charging towards her on boars, Zelda summoned her bow. As the holder of the Triforce of Wisdom, she could summon weapons at will. She wasn't as experienced as Link with a sword or a bow, but she could hold her own, especially considering that the goblins only form of attack was 'Charge at enemy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNocking at arrow, Zelda took aim at the lead goblin. She let the arrow fly, striking him squarely in the chest. He fell off, landing in the path of one of his comrades. The boar tripped over its body before it burst into a cloud of twilight particles. A green rupee dropped from the cloud, causing a small smile to cross the Princess's face. <br>\r\nTurning her attention to the final goblin, Zelda nocked a second arrow and hit him in the head, instantly causing him to burst into particles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a second horn from behind her, Zelda turned around. These goblins were much closer and without any mounts. Dismounting her own, she dismissed her bow and summoned a rapier. A goblin swung for her. Parrying it, she stabbed him. Dodging to the side, she slashed a second before stabbing a third. Turning the face the last two, she was met with confusion as they ran away. Sheathing her rapier, Zelda turned around and saw the reason for running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boar was bearing down on her. She jumped to the side, narrowly avoiding its tusks. Standing up, she watched as the boar turned to face her again. <br>\r\n\"Even without a rider...?\" Zelda asked herself. Normally, boars would just give up without its rider, but this one was unusually persistent. <br>\r\nAs it charged again, Zelda tried to dodged again. However, she made a mistake, one she hadn't made in all her years. <br>\r\nAs she started moving sideways, her foot caught her dress, causing her to trip. Her eyes widened as the boar approached...<br>\r\nIt stopped. <br>\r\nLooking up, Zelda saw a bigger goblin leering down at her. She didn't have time to call out before he knocked her out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake her!\"<br>\r\nFeeling cold water thrown on her face, Zelda awoke with a start. Wet hair hung down into her vision, however she couldn't move her arms to brushing aside. Looking at her arms, she found them tied Beijing her back. She couldn't see her legs, but she felt ropes binding them together. <br>\r\nHer head was yanked back roughly, her hair falling out of her vision, revealing a very overweight female wearing nothing. Her belly was coated with grease from previous meals, and hung in between her immense thighs. Her breasts sat heavily on her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me when I'm speaking to you!\" She spat angrily.<br>\r\nLooking at her face, Zelda saw a pair of red eyes glaring at her. <br>\r\n\"The Princess of Hyrule will not...\" Zelda began to say, but stopped when a goblin hit her. <br>\r\n\"Speak only when spoke to, 'Princess'!\" The Girl shouted. <br>\r\nLooking at her, Zelda kept quiet. <br>\r\n\"Good girl. Now, I seek something. You will help me find it, or else!\" <br>\r\n\"And what would that be?\" Zelda asked. <br>\r\nA grin spread across the girls round face. <br>\r\n\"Barrels of a blue pudding. Help me find them, and I will release you. Fail to help me, and we'll see how long Hyrule will last against my army,\" she said, leaning back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda briefly considered her options. She knew what the blue substance did, and knew enough to know that the girl before her had eaten it. Helping her would, technically, get rid of the stuff, but Hyrule already faced danger from Zant and the Twilight Realm. Unless Link could fight on two fronts, then Hyrule would be in even greater danger. <br>\r\nOr she could do it. <br>\r\nZelda had grown up hearing stories of how the Hero had saved Hyrule time and time again, while the Princess was locked up somewhere and needed rescuing. She could save Hyrule from the goblin menace, while Link saved it from the Twilight!<br>\r\nBut then again, if the girl didn't keep her word and let her go, Hyrule wouldn't last long. The army wasn't that good. They wouldn't last long against a flock of cucco, let alone goblins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What's your answer?!\" The Girl asked, her red eyes still glaring at Zelda. <br>\r\n\"I will...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I will not help you!\" Zelda said defiantly, looking straight into the girl's red eyes. <br>\r\nInitially, she was surprised. She was so used to the goblins taking her word as law that refusal... stunned her. However, she recovered quickly, a look of pure anger replacing the surprise. <br>\r\n\"So be it. Throw her with the other prisoner. And bring me more food!\" She ordered. <br>\r\nThe goblins stood still for a moment before moving. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, did I stutter?! Throw her in the prison and bring me food! NOW!\"<br>\r\nThey quickly got to work. A burly goblin who stood next to the girl moved towards Zelda, while the two that flanked the door hurried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go off me!\"<br>\r\nZelda was thrown into a prison cell. The burly goblin pushed up against a wall while another cut her bindings. Before she could attack them, or even resist, a chain was clamped around her ankle. As they left, the burly one leered at her. Zelda ignored him. <br>\r\nSitting against the wall, she tried to communicate Link with the Triforce. However, she couldn't reach him. <br>\r\n\"Must be in the Twilight Realm. Or in the middle of something...\" Zelda said out loud. In response, a chain clinked in the corner opposite her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Princess Zelda?\" A voice asked. The room she was locked in was incredibly dark, the only light sources being the cracks around the door, and a small crack in the wall. <br>\r\n\"Yes. Who are you?\" Zelda asked. Chains clinked as someone started moving. Squinting, Zelda recalled a power that her mother had used while she had possessed the Triforce of Wisdom. Concentrating, she summoned a ball of light. <br>\r\nOpposite her, a woman was huddled up against the wall. She wore a white dress with a leather coat over it. She was covered in dirt, while her red hair was all over the place. <br>\r\n\"I'm Anise, a travelling merchant who does deliveries. I was payed to deliver supplies to Ordon Village, but these goblins...\" She began to tear up. <br>\r\n\"It'll be okay. They won't harm you, not while I'm here\", Zelda assured her. She would console her better, but the chain around her ankle restricted her movement. <br>\r\n\"You said your name was Anise?\" Zelda asked. She definitely knew that name...<br>\r\n\"Yes... You once travelled with us, while your mother was still alive. Your servant at the time kept us separate, so we never spoke\", Anise explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda would have spoken further, but the door opened. A goblin bearing two bowls entered, along with a note. He handed the note to Zelda, along with a bowl. Anise took the other.<br>\r\n\"Don't eat it!\" Zelda said quickly as the goblin left. \"This stuff... It corrupts your mind\".<br>\r\nAnise dropped the bowl.<br>\r\n\"Why? Who would make it like that?\" She asked, a hint of fear in her voice. <br>\r\nZelda didn't answer. She knew who would, but the people of Hyrule didn't need to know that. It would just cause panic in the streets. Instead, she read the note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Princess Zelda,<br>\r\nAs the Goddess of this tribe, I would like to invite you to a feast. I would also like to apologize for the way my subjects have treated you. Rest assured, they will be punished. A goblin will be along shortly to escort you to my chambers. <br>\r\nThe Goddess, Ilia</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ilia...\" Zelda thought for a second, before it hit her. \"Ilia, daughter of the mayor of Ordon! Link mentioned that she had been captured, but... A goddess?\"<br>\r\nHearing a knock, two burly goblins entered. As they headed towards Zelda, she initially thought of escaping. However, fighting against a stronghold of goblins... The odds were definitely not in her favour. She allowed them to tie her arms behind her back. However, she struggled when a sack hood was produced. <br>\r\n\"I refuse to wear it!\" She protested, however she was ignored. It was forced over her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being marched through the stronghold, she heard Ilia's voice. <br>\r\n\"There. Now, take the hood off, and leave us\".<br>\r\nThe hood was ripped off her head, revealing a massive table laden down with food. Ilia, who was still on her 'Throne', sat at one end while Zelda sat at the other. Her arms were untied, although a rope was tied around her waist, binding her to the chair. <br>\r\n\"From one leader to another, allow me to apologize in person. You should have been treated in a manner that suits you, not like a common piece of meat\", Ilia said, pulling an entire Roast Cucco closer to her. \"Please, help yourself\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda touched nothing. <br>\r\n\"So, Ilia... May I call you that?\" Zelda asked cautiously. She wanted information, and inadvertently insulting her would just result in being thrown back into prison. <br>\r\n\"Of course, Zelda. Now, shall we get down to business?\" Ilia asked, tearing a wing of the cucco. <br>\r\n\"And what business would that be?\"<br>\r\n\"The barrels of pudding. You want them gone, and I want them. You know where they are, so tell me and I'll... dispose of them,\" Ilia offered, taking a bite of the cucco wing. <br>\r\n\"And if I refuse again?\"<br>\r\n\"Then you'll go back to the cell and stay there for the rest of your life. Accept my offer, on the other hand, and you'll be free to go. As long as you tell me where the barrels are\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda, still unwilling, pretended to think. She was taking note of the room, who was in it and where...<br>\r\n<i>Two goblins by the door, two big ones by her...</i><br>\r\n\"Thoughts of escape will not be tolerated. It's a simple yes or no question,\" Ilia said, glaring at Zelda. <br>\r\n\"My answer stands. I will not help you, Ilia!\" Zelda told her. <br>\r\nNodding, Ilia leaned back, her chairs creaking. She rubbed one of her breasts, letting out a quiet moan. <br>\r\n\"I noticed you didn't eat anything?\" She asked. <br>\r\nNarrowing her eyes, Zelda answered, \"I am not hungry\".<br>\r\nHer stomach betrayed her, letting out a rumble. <br>\r\n\"Your body states otherwise\", Ilia smiled evilly. \"If you won't eat...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pondering her options, Zelda hovered in the doorway. If she stayed, she wouldn't starve, but she might end up like the self-proclaimed Goddess looking at her with a look of delight. <br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should... stay. I mean, it would be rude of me to not sample some of your food\", Zelda said slowly. She returned to her seat, where a goblin pushed a plate of roast boar in front of her. <br>\r\n\"I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the food. My subjects may be complete idiots who can't handle the simplest tasks, such as finding something important to their Goddess, but they do know how to cook\", Ilia explained, pulling a second plate of cucco towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zelda looked around the table, she noticed a lack of cutlery. <br>\r\n\"I don't suppose you have any knives and forks handy?\" She asked. Having been raised in the castle, she had grown accustomed to having utensils to eat. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. We don't seem to have any. Why not just use your hands?\" Ilia suggested, not even looking up from her plate. <br>\r\nHearing her stomach rumble again, Zelda shifted uncomfortably. Pulling her gloves off, she hung the over the back of her chair and carefully picked up a slice of boar. It was dripping with fat and gravy. Shaking some off, she took a bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne bite was all it took to sway the hungry princess. Not completely forgetting her manners, Zelda devoured the slice she was holding. Gravy covered her hands, dripping onto the table. Picking up a second slice, Zelda continued. <br>\r\nFrom the other side of the table, Ilia watched her eat an entire plate of boar with glee on her face. She leaned back, rubbing her round belly. <br>\r\n\"I told you, didn't I? Very good food...\" Ilia said to Zelda, who nodded in response.<br>\r\n<i>And quite fattening</i>  She thought devilishly. <i>Maybe if she eats enough, she'll be a bit more sympathetic to my cause!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing off the plate, Zelda relaxed in her chair. She let out a quiet burp. <br>\r\n\"Please, compliment the chef for me. It is very nice, certainly not what I expected!\" Zelda said, her hands on her lap. She had forgotten about the gravy, so when she lifted them, gravy had stained her dress. <br>\r\n\"Well, there's plenty more. Help yourself!\" Ilia said. In her mind, the chef was lacking. Zelda's compliments would NOT be passed on. <br>\r\nPulling some pork towards her, Zelda started on her second meal, a little more ravenous. Gravy dripped into her lap, forming a small pool. She quickly finished it, letting out another burp. Quickly pulling a third meal towards her, Zelda continued her feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia watched the scene before her. The Princess had put away two plates, and was still going! <br>\r\n<i>I should eat as well. I don't want to starve!</i> Ilia thought. She continued on her plate. <br>\r\nAs Zelda ate, she failed to notice weight being packed onto her body. Her trim belly formed a layer of pudge pushing against her dress, which had been tailor made for her. It quickly grew tight around her belly. Her breasts grew fatter, her bra tightening around them. Her panties grew tighter as her ass grew rounder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two leaders, the table rapidly emptied. Once laden down with all sorts of meat and desserts, the only thing remaining was single cucco wing. Looking at each other, Zelda and Ilia both reached for it. Their hands met. <br>\r\n\"Please, Princess. You are the guest here, you should have it,\" Ilia offered. <br>\r\n\"No. You were a most gracious host. You deserve it,\" Zelda replied. <br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks!\"<br>\r\nIlia snatched the wing and quickly chopped through it. Zelda, not expecting the move, was slightly annoyed. She was hoping that Ilia would allow her to have it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? How was the meal?\" Ilia asked, licking her fingers clean. <br>\r\n\"It was good. I'm glad I stayed!\" Zelda answered, temporarily forgetting how she had gotten stuck eating. <br>\r\n\"I'm glad. You look like you enjoyed it,\" Ilia said, eyeing the Princess's body. <br>\r\nHer pudgy tummy had evolved into a full belly. Packed full of food, it was rock hard. A couple of stitches down the side of her dress had popped open, giving her belly room. <br>\r\n<i>Let's see how she looks when she digests it!</i> Ilia thought gleefully. <br>\r\nOf course, her body had put on weight as well. She digested it much faster, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Zelda didn't notice her new belly. She bowed. <br>\r\n\"Oh, bowing? Yes, give me a second...\"<br>\r\nPlanting her hands on the table, Ilia pushed with all her might. She slowly got up. The goblins in the room all stared as their goddess, known for her general reluctance to move, stood up. <br>\r\nIlia's belly hung down in front of her crotch. Her breasts resembled pumpkins, and hung down heavily. Her hips were wider than the table, and her ass looked like two globes. <br>\r\nTrying to bow, Ilia quickly gave up. Her belly simply wouldn't allow it. Instead, she tilted her head, which was just as difficult. Her fat neck prevented it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Escort the Princess to her new quarters,\" Ilia ordered, pointing at two goblins. They nodded. <br>\r\nGrabbing the Princess and tying her arms up, they marched her out. Ilia collapsed back onto her throne, which groaned under the stress. <br>\r\n\"I will break her. She will give me what I want!\" Ilia said to herself, grinning evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was shown to a new room. It had a bed in one corner, but that was it. She was pushed in, and her arms untied. She briefly though of overpowering the goblins, but she was sluggish after her meal. The door slammed behind her. <br>\r\nCollapsing onto the bed, Zelda rubbed her belly, too tired to inspect it. <br>\r\n\"I need... to...\"<br>\r\nShe fell asleep, not even bothering to inspect her cell or think of escaping. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yawning, Zelda stretched her arms above her head. She had a surprisingly good sleep, despite the lack of pillows and a duvet. Sitting up, she felt... heavier. Looking down, she saw why. <br>\r\nHer meal from last night had digested. Her belly had shrunk slightly, but was still quite large and very soft. Her breasts, tight within her dress, were much fuller. Her ass looked like a couple of pumpkins. It had raised the hem of her dress slightly, revealing her ankles. She couldn't see them, but her thighs were much heavier. Running her gloved hand over her face, she felt much rounder cheeks and the beginning of a second chin. Inside her gloves, her fingers were much plumper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this... from one meal?!\" Zelda asked in disbelief. \"Although, it was exceptionally good...\"<br>\r\nA knock at her door interrupted her thoughts. A small slot on the door slid open. A note appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Princess Zelda,<br>\r\nI would like to discuss some things with you. Perhaps we could talk over some breakfast? A goblin will escort you to my chambers.<br>\r\nThe Goddess, Ilia</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite it sounding like a question, Zelda knew it was a summons. Her door opened, revealing a goblin. He gestured for her to follow. Standing up, Zelda felt her thighs rub against each other as she walked. Her ass jiggled slightly, causing her dress to ripple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down in the same seat as last night, Zelda marvelled at the amount of food on the table. There must have been more than last night!<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you could make it, Princess,\" Ilia said. She hadn't moved since last night, her bed in the corner hadn't been used. \"I would like to discuss something with you\".<br>\r\n\"As would I, Ilia. But please, you go ahead,\" Zelda replied. She pulled a plate of stacked pancakes towards her, removed her gloves which were still clean, and started eating. <br>\r\n\"Thank you. Tell me, what is Hyrule's interest in the blue pudding?\" Ilia asked, starting on a plate of waffles. <br>\r\nSwallowing the last of her pancakes, Zelda replied, \"The pudding is a corruptive substance. It was created with dark magic and is meant to corrupt the leaders of Hyrule. I am currently looking to remove it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Ilia finished her waffles. <br>\r\n\"I see... What if I were to help you find it?\"<br>\r\nNarrowing her eyes, Zelda saw her plan. <br>\r\n\"I would rather the soldiers of Hyrule search for it. No offense to your... goblins, but people would be scared if they entered the towns looking for something. Now, how about you tell me your interest in the pudding?\"<br>\r\nIlia ignored her question, instead opting to change the subject. <br>\r\n\"What do you think of this mornings breakfast?\"<br>\r\nNot entirely happy with the direction of the conversation, Zelda played along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very good. Compliment the chef again, if you please\", she answered. <br>\r\nNodding, Ilia made a note to, once again, not compliment the chef. <br>\r\n\"You haven't eaten much. Is there something wrong with it?\" Zelda asked, noticing Ilia had only eaten two plates. She didn't notice that she had eaten about six plates, and was currently on her seventh. <br>\r\nGrinning, Ilia changed the subject again. <br>\r\n\"And your quarters? How were they?\"<br>\r\nFinishing another plate, Zelda sub-consciously moved onto an eighth. <br>\r\n\"They were decent. I don't suppose you have any pillows?\" Zelda inquired. <br>\r\n\"Of course. I'll have a couple moved there\", Ilia responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of breakfast remained uneventful. Ilia ate nothing else, while Zelda cleared the table. Wiping a bit of syrup from her chin, she rested her hands on her solid belly. <br>\r\n<i>And let's see how big she gets after this!</i> Ilia thought excitedly. Her plan was coming along well. Unknown to the Princess, eating most of the breakfast was the next step...</span></div></div>",

She wiped a strand with her pudgy hand, looked at it before licking it off her hand. <br>\r\n\"Delicious! Although...\" Zelda said, licking her plump lips. <br>\r\n\"Was there an issue?\" Ilia asked, as innocent as possible. Hopefully, she hadn't caught on...<br>\r\n\"No, not at all! It was just much sweeter than yesterday\", Zelda explained, rubbing her belly. <br>\r\n\"Oh, that's because it was breakfast,\" Ilia invented quickly. \"It was cooked with honey\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Zelda relaxed in her chair. Ilia carefully scanned her features and saw what she was looking for. She grinned, happy with current events. <br>\r\nZelda's eyes had developed a very faint red hue. Her hair had darkened, leaving her with dark brown hair. Her fair skin had also darkened. <br>\r\n\"You know, I could get used to this kind of life\", Zelda said to Ilia. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Having people do your bidding without questioning you. Yeah, I'm Princess of Hyrule, people listen to me. But I've never actually used my power. Merchants have offered me things, free of charge. And yet I pay for them?\" Zelda said to herself. \"Why should I pay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn evil smile crept onto Ilia's fat face. Her plan was working!<br>\r\nInstead of mixing in the regular pudding that the goblins made, Ilia had sacrificed the last of her corruption pudding. She hadn't eaten much because she wanted Zelda to have it. With Zelda on her side, she would soon have more for herself...<br>\r\n\"Are you listening?\" Zelda demanded, glaring at Ilia. Her eyes weren't as red as Ilia's, but under her intense gaze, Ilia felt something... fear? Lust? She couldn't tell.<br>\r\n\"No, I wasn't,\" Ilia answered, causing Zelda to sigh angrily. <br>\r\n\"Of course you weren't... As I was trying to tell you, I know where more of the pudding can be found\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia smiled. Finally!<br>\r\n\"And where would that be?\" She asked. <br>\r\n\"Don't you worry. I'll bring it back\", Zelda replied, standing up. <br>\r\n\"Be sure that you do. If you don't, I will find you,\" Ilia threatened. <br>\r\n\"You mean your servants will. I doubt you could move very far,\" Zelda retorted. <br>\r\nAs she strode out of the room, Ilia gestured for a goblin to approach her. <br>\r\n\"Send some scouts to follow her. If she tries to take anything for herself, kill her,\" Ilia ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her room, Zelda grabbed her travelling cloak. She caught sight of her reflection in the window. She wiped dirt off it in order to see herself better. <br>\r\nHer belly was much softer than earlier. Her dress was drawn tight around it. Her breasts had broken her bra down the front. Reaching down the front of her dress, she removed it and threw it behind her. They were the size of pumpkins. Her hips had plumped up to accommodate her much softer ass. Her second chin had fully developed, while her cheeks were much rounder. <br>\r\nShe didn't notice her new red eyes, or her darker skin. Smiling, Zelda liked her new body. A bigger body was a sign of wealth and power, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left the goblin stronghold, Zelda headed for...</span></div></div>",

Narrowing her eyes, Zelda summoned her rapier. They didn't have time to react before she had impaled one, and slashed the other. <br>\r\nDismissing her weapon, Zelda smirked at the corpses, before they burst into particles. <br>\r\n\"That'll show her that she shouldn't mess with me... Now, back to business\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention to the barrel in front of her, Zelda pulled her other glove off, revealing her pudgy hands. Grabbing a handful of the substance, she messily stuffed it in her mouth. Small bits dripped onto her dress, causing stains to appear on the purple and white garment. <br>\r\n\"Ahh... Delicious. And there's plenty of it, all for me!\" Zelda said, a grin on her face. Her soldiers had only found a few barrels, all of which were now stored here. <br>\r\n\"They probably won't find anymore... given how useless and incompetent they are!\"<br>\r\nGrabbing another handful, Zelda began eating her way through the barrel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe substance had a more pronounced effect on her, however. As a bearer of the Triforce of Wisdom, which was considered as one of the two 'Good' pieces of the Triforce, it began to corrupt both Zelda's mind and the Triforce. <br>\r\nHer skin darkened further. Her eyes became a bright red. Her brown hair became streaked with black. As the Triforce began to corrupt, the power she possessed due to it changed. Instead of wielding 'Light' magic, she now wielded the powers of 'Darkness'. <br>\r\nHer body began to plump up. Her belly grew bigger, pushing her dress to its limit. Her breasts, free of a bra now, had a little more room to grow. They became fuller and softer. Her ass grew rounder, her panties straining to contain it. Her thighs became pudgier, now rubbing together. Her arms formed a layer of pudge, straining her sleeves. A third chin began to form. Her cheeks became softer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing a barrel, Zelda gave an evil grin. <br>\r\n\"I could start on another barrel... or I could find more. I know exactly where they were destined to go. However, more goblins may have followed. Perhaps I should leave nothing for that self-proclaimed Goddess...\"<br>\r\nDeciding to finish another barrel, Zelda pulled the lid off. Wrapping her hands around the barrel, she lifted it to her lips with surprising strength. She started drinking the thick liquid. <br>\r\nHer body grew at an amazing rate. Her dress, unable to contain the Princess's growing body, finally ripped apart, leaving Zelda in a very tight pair of panties. Her belly hung down in front of her crotch. Her breasts, soft and fat, were twice the size of her head. Her doughy legs squished against one another, while her ass ballooned behind her, resembling two massive globes. Her panties finally gave up, ripping from her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling backwards onto her ass, Zelda finished the barrel. Throwing it to the side, she caught sight of her face in a puddle on the floor. She grinned at her red eyes, her long black hair, her ashen grey skin. Her golden tiara, linked to the state of the Triforce of Wisdom, had changed to silver. <br>\r\nLooking at her body, Zelda didn't see an obese body in place of her old body. She saw how perfect she was. In her eyes, she had no huge belly that lay in between her fat thighs. Her breasts weren't so heavy that they sagged downwards, lying heavily on her belly. They were glorious E-Cups, and she was showing the right amount of cleavage. Her ass didn't look like two massive pumpkins that spread out underneath her. It was round, and firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look so... so... Perfect!\" She cooed happily. Standing up, Zelda wasn't even fazed by the extra weight. Her Triforce piece provided more than enough strength for her to move normally. Walking outside, she didn't care that she was completely naked. Nobody was around Kakariko to see her anyway. <br>\r\n\"I should really pay a visit to the Zoras... Maybe they'll give me what I'm looking for...\"</span></div></div>",

Always a pleasure\".<br>\r\nTurning, Zelda saw a small Zora looking at her from across the Throne Room. <br>\r\n\"Please. In here. We can talk better, and without interruption,\" he said, gesturing to a room next to him. <br>\r\nZelda nodded. She waddled into the room and collapsed heavily onto a chair. It creaked underneath her bulk. <br>\r\nPrince Ralis sat opposite her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you, Princess,\" Ralis said, bowing his head. <br>\r\n\"Likewise, Ralis,\" Zelda responded. She had been rude with the guards, but now that she was speaking with proper royalty and not that fake 'Goddess', she was acting a little more respectful.<br>\r\n\"To what do I owe this visit?\" Ralis asked. He had taken note of the naked Princess, but wasn't going to ask, even though he wanted to. <br>\r\n\"I come seeking the blue substance. As you know, I-We are looking to seal them away and eventually destroy them. You sent word to me that you found some?\" Zelda explained. <br>\r\n\"We did indeed. However, I must ask...\" Ralis said, his curiosity finally winning out. \"What has happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A curse was inflicted upon me by the King of Twilight,\" Zelda lied. \"Until he is defeated, I must look like this\".<br>\r\n\"I am sorry to hear that. Hopefully he will be defeated soon, now that Link has the Master Sword!\" Ralis said hopefully. <br>\r\n\"Yes... Hopefully he is,\" Zelda said, annoyance in her voice. Thankfully, Ralis didn't pick up on this. <br>\r\n\"So, the mysterious substance. I sealed it away when you told me about it. Nobody has tried any. If you'll follow me...\"<br>\r\nRalis stood up and walked over to a wall. He placed his hand on it, causing a section to slide away. Zelda's eyes widened. <br>\r\nFour barrels were revealed. Zelda had to stop herself from jumping at them...<br>\r\n\"Where are they being stored?\" Ralis asked. <br>\r\n\"Kakariko Village. There's an abandoned house opposite that Malo Mart place. Leave them in there, and I'll store them away,\" Zelda said. <br>\r\n\"Of course. I'll transport them immediately,\" Ralis responded, clapping twice. A number of guards came through the door and picked up the barrels. \"They should be there soon\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ralis. Your help is greatly appreciated,\" Zelda said, bowing her head. <br>\r\n\"No problem, Princess. Just glad to help\".<br>\r\nLeaving the room, Zelda stopped when...</span></div></div>",

So, she followed me...\" Zelda said angrily. \"Keep them away until the barrels are out of here!\"<br>\r\nShe waddled to the edge next to the waterfall. Sure enough, she spotted a number of goblins approaching. <br>\r\n\"Bitch... Thinks she can take my barrels!\" Zelda yelled. She was determined to defend them, even to the point where she summoned her bow. She had no loyalty to the Zoras anymore, so she decided to take her leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Ralis!\"<br>\r\nRalis turned to see Zelda looking at him, her red eyes trained on his. <br>\r\n\"Yes, Princess?\"<br>\r\n\"I know why those goblins are here. Their leader was corrupted by the blue substance, and will not stop until she has consumed it all. I will escort the barrels out of here\", Zelda told him. <br>\r\n\"I understand. It must be hard fighting in your cursed body,\" Ralis said. <br>\r\n\"My cursed...? Oh, yes. It's quite hard. I have heard of a shortcut to Kakariko. I suppose your guards are heading that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Zelda waddled off, her body shaking. She knew off the shortcut, having used it in her youth when she was forced to visit Zoras Domain with her father. She would sneak off to Kakariko and play there. Her father would get so mad when she returned to the Domain...<br>\r\nPartway down the path, a couple of goblins appeared before her. Summoning her rapier, which now had a dark aura instead of its golden glow, she stabbed one. Upon him bursting into particles, the second ran off. <br>\r\n\"Coward...\" Zelda growled. She dismissed her rapier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached the bottom, she found a whole group of goblins waiting for her. She saw the goblin that had run off among them. <br>\r\n\"Found you!\" Zelda yelled angrily. She summoned her bow and nocked an arrow. Taking aim, she calmly took two goblins out before they had even gotten close. Dismissing it, she summoned her rapier again. Impaling one, Zelda was knocked backwards by two others. <br>\r\n\"How dare you touch me!\" She roared, causing them to stumble back in fear. She sounded just like their leader...<br>\r\nTheir hesitation allowed Zelda to finish them. She waddled away, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the exit of the Domain, she ignored a couple of guards who were fighting and continued onwards. She saw the exit in front of her...<br>\r\n\"Well, well, Princess. I knew we'd meet again\".<br>\r\nStopping, Zelda turned. She saw Ilia sitting atop a massive wagon, pulled by a number of boar.<br>\r\n\"I see you can actually move. Or did you need help getting up there?\" Zelda asked. <br>\r\n\"I needn't explain myself to a traitor. Though, it isn't too late. Tell me where the barrels are, and I'll forgive you,\" Ilia offered. <br>\r\n\"No, they belong to me!\" Zelda responded angrily. <br>\r\n\"Well, I tried. Kill her\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia's wagon pulled away, leaving Zelda with a bunch of goblins that appeared. <br>\r\n\"Figures... She can get her body dirty, but not her hands!\" Zelda said, irritated. \"Too bad the shortcut is right there!\"<br>\r\nShe stumbled her way to the water, and jumped in. The current swept her huge body down stream, leaving the goblins on the bank. <br>\r\nShe finally ended up in Kakariko. The river had taken her most of the way, but she was forced to stop when she couldn't fit through a tiny crawl space, leaving her to walk part of the way. Down the street, she saw a couple of children, one wearing red and another brandishing a stick. Thankfully, they didn't notice the bulky princess, and she slipped into the abandoned house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zoras had left the barrels in the middle of the room. Opening the hatch in the back, Zelda pushed them down and shut the hatch behind her. <br>\r\n\"Now, how many should I go for?\" She wondered. \"Maybe all of them? Or maybe some of them? Let's go with...\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe it would be easier if she just... disappeared?\" Zelda whispered to herself. She fell silent when she heard footsteps above her. They stopped, only to be replaced with loud banging, and a lot of breathing. <br>\r\n\"Not in here either,\" Ilia growled. \"Next house, now!\"<br>\r\nIlia stomped out, her body jiggling with each step. Zelda decided to stay put, at least until it was safe to leave. She fell backwards onto her huge ass, causing her body to ripple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ilia stepped outside, she heard her goblins chatter angrily. She looked over and saw them waving their clubs at a group of people. As Ilia unsteadily waddled towards them, she made out a group of children and two adults. One of them wore a welding mask and a white top, while the other wore long robes. The one clad in robes looked at Ilia as she approached. <br>\r\n\"The Princess. Where is she?!\" She asked, irritation in her voice. <br>\r\n\"Most likely in Hyrule Castle. Why Princess Zelda would come here is beyond me. Now, I must insist that you leave...\" he told Ilia. <br>\r\nShe looked at one of the goblins, and nodded. He swung his club at him, causing him to stumble back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renado!\" <br>\r\nThe group of children were silenced with a single look from Ilia. However, she had a feeling that she knew most of them...<br>\r\n\"I warn you. This village is protected by a powerful warrior. He already knows about this assault, and will be on his way here!\" Renado said, looking directly at Ilia, who laughed cruelly. <br>\r\n\"Warrior or no, I will find what I want. Keep an eye on them. If they try anything, threaten the children,\" Ilia ordered. \"You, search the bomb shop. You, search that weird shop over there\".<br>\r\n\"It isn't a weird shop...\" The smallest child whispered, but nobody heard her. <br>\r\nIlia left the group and headed back to her wagon. She climbed onto her mobile throne and collapsed heavily onto it. <br>\r\n\"She has to be here... I know she is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour had passed, Ilia's goblins reported back. The entirety of Kakariko Village had been searched, and nothing had turned up. The news didn't help Ilia's mood. <br>\r\n\"Useless! The lot of you!\" She screamed at the goblins. \"I ask you to find one person -ONE- and you can't do it!\"<br>\r\nAs the hostage group watched, a conversation struck up between the children from Ordon. <br>\r\n\"She looks like Ilia, don't you think?\" The one in red said. <br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, Beth,\" The one with a stick said. \"Ilia doesn't look like that!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she isn't that fat...\" The smallest said. <br>\r\n\"But still... What do you think, Colin?\"<br>\r\nColin shook his head. <br>\r\n\"I agree with Talo. Link is looking for Ilia, and he found us! He'll find her!\"<br>\r\nThey were shushed by a goblin, who chartered angrily at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ilia was shouting at the goblins, one of her scouts quietly approached her wagon. He handed her a note, which she snatched from his hand. As she read it, a smile appeared on her fat face. She stopped shouting. <br>\r\n\"At least one of you is competent... Everybody, head for the Desert!\" She ordered. As the goblins hurried about getting everything ready, Ilia smiled. If this information was correct, she would soon have as much of the substance as she could ever want...</span></div></div>",

Ilia was busy munching through a Cucco wing when she heard a horse whinny. She stopped eating, and brushed grease from her belly. <br>\r\n\"Prepare for...\" She started to order, but an explosion cut her off. Three goblins burst into particles. As she watched, another two were struck by arrows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, the goblins were on full alert, pointing at an approaching horse. Ilia glared in the direction of it. The rider looked awfully familiar...<br>\r\nAs the duo approached, the hostages began to cheer. <br>\r\n\"Yay, Link!\"<br>\r\n\"I knew he'd come for us!\"<br>\r\n\"He kinda had to...\"<br>\r\nA young man, clad in green and holding a bow, backflipped off the horse. He shoot an arrow into a goblins head. As the goblins neared him, he sheathed the bow and pulled out a sword. It had a blue hilt with a yellow diamond inset. The blade glowed with an otherworldly glow. Even Ilia, who was raised outside of Hyrule, recognised the blade of evil's bane...<br>\r\n\"The Master Sword...\" She cursed her luck. Having been corrupted by the substance, she was considered an evil being by the blade. For the first time since becoming a Goddess, she felt... fear. <br>\r\nEven the sight of it caused the goblins to stop. Ilia's blood boiled as she watched him effortlessly cut through an entire group of goblins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it... Everybody, retreat! Back to the stronghold!\" She ordered. <br>\r\nThe remaining goblins stumbled over each other in order to get a mount. Some of them charged Link, hoping to overwhelm him with simultaneous attacks. In response, he spun with the sword held out. The goblins flew back. <br>\r\nAs Ilia's wagon left Kakariko, Link pulled his bow out. He took aim at the retreating wagon...<br>\r\n\"Hold your arrow!\"<br>\r\nHe paused as Renaldo touched his shoulder. <br>\r\n\"Would you fire upon your friend?\" He asked quietly. <br>\r\nLink looked at him, confusion in his eyes. <br>\r\n\"That is the missing child... Ilia. She has been corrupted by the one who caused twilight to cover this land\", he explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow appeared next to Link. <br>\r\n\"So, Zant actually used it?!\" Midna asked, worry and amazement in her voice. \"I though he didn't have it in him...\"<br>\r\nLink took note of what Midna said before being overwhelmed by the Ordon children. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, you showed them!\"<br>\r\n\"Did you get a new sword?\"<br>\r\nLink smiled. He was just glad that the postman had reached him in time. He had been heading towards Snowpeak when he had reached Renaldo's letter alerting him to an attack on Kakriko. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, that stuff that she ate? It was a Twilight creation, meant for ingestion by the Twili people. It's meant to help the weak, kinda like those potions you drink. However, it uses ingredients found in my realm. It corrupts Hylians and Humans, basically anything that isn't born in the Twilight\", Midna explained. \"It holds true that Hylian potions do the same to us, which is why I hate handling your potions. Even one drop could prove fatal\".<br>\r\nLink nodded. He was sitting on top of an abandoned house, looking at the sunset. Midna was explaining the Corruption Essence, as she called it. <br>\r\n\"There is a cure, though. If you release the power of the Triforce of Courage in their presence, then the evil will manifest as a... boss fight, kind of like the end of a temple. But with the Master Sword, it should be trivial!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Link stood up and brushed dust off his tunic.<br>\r\n\"That girl, Ilia... She mentioned a stronghold. If we find it, we can help her!\" Midna said. \"But, I've no idea of any strongholds other than the one in the Gerudo Desert, which you cleared out. Maybe gather information before you leave?\"<br>\r\nAs she disappeared back into Links shadow, Link jumped off the roof and was alerted by...</span></div></div>",

Before he reached her, he was approached by Beth. <br>\r\n\"Link, was that Ilia?\" She asked curiously. <br>\r\nAfter a moment's hesitation, he shook his head. It probably wasn't the best idea to tell Ilia's friends that she was now evil and fat. Beth didn't believe him. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure? Cause she looked a lot like Ilia if she was, you know... really fat\".<br>\r\nShaking his head, Link walked away from Beth and mounted Epona. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curse him!\"<br>\r\nIlia, her ass planted back upon her throne, was fuming. Not only did she not find the traitorous Princess, she now knew that she was being hunted by Link. If he found her, she would go back to being a normal girl who lived in the country side, and not a Goddess. <br>\r\n\"If only there was a way to weaken him!\" She mused. Hearing a stick gently tap the ground, she looked up to see Shaman approaching her throne. <br>\r\n\"It's only you... What do you want?\" She asked roughly, annoyed about the interruption. <br>\r\nIn response, he reached into his pouch. Pulling out a red liquid sealed in a bottle, he pointed at the bottle. <br>\r\n\"What's a red potion supposed to achieve? I want him out of the way, not stronger!\"<br>\r\nShaking his head, he pointed at it again. <br>\r\n\"I swear... What is it meant to do?!\" Ilia asked angrily. This language barrier hadn't really annoyed her until now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into his pouch again, he pulled out a piece of paper and a bit of charcoal. He started drawing. <br>\r\nIlia rubbed her greasy belly impatiently. He was taking his sweet time...<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes, he showed the picture to Ilia. It was a rough sketch of some sort of imp. It wore a weird helmet, which revealed a single eye. <br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Ilia demanded, confused.<br>\r\nShaking his head, both parties were now annoyed with one another. Ilia had no idea what the red potion and the imp had to do with each other, while Shaman was annoyed by Ilia's lack of understanding. After a moment's silence, Ilia spoke. <br>\r\n\"Do what you need to. If you think it will weaken him, then you have my permission to command a small group of goblins. However, if you fail, know that your punishment will be very severe,\" Ilia warned. <br>\r\nHe nodded and wandered off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscounting Epona, Link looked at his surroundings, not that they differed much. He was basically surrounded by trees...<br>\r\n\"Maybe Wolfie would have better luck?\" Midna suggested, her shadow appearing next to him. \"Sniff her out, you know? We Twili have a much better sense of smell than you Hylians, and there was a definite aura around her\".<br>\r\nNodding, Link transformed into his wolf form. Midna leapt onto his furry back, causing him to snarl at her with annoyance. Midna giggled. She did it every time, and he never did anything about it. <br>\r\nSniffing, Link picked up a scent. It smelt of sweat and grease and general meat... It was not pleasant, causing him to whimper. <br>\r\n\"Hey, we're both suffering here!\" Midna said, pinching her nose. \"The quicker you find her, the quicker we don't have to smell this stench anymore\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the duo padded off, a goblin watched them from afar. He ran after them, taking care to not make any noise. <br>\r\nAs Link followed his noise, he heard a number of different noises. Birds chirping in the trees, bugs chattering to each other, the breathing of Midna as he ran through the undergrowth...<br>\r\nHe stopped abruptly, causing Midna to yelp. <br>\r\n\"Don't stop so quickly!\" She scolded. \"You know I hate it!\"<br>\r\nSniffing, both picked up the scent of Ilia, but also a new one...<br>\r\n\"Move!\" Midna yelled. <br>\r\nAs Link jumped back, a club smashed into the ground where he was. Snarling, he launched himself at his attacker, knocking them off their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're surrounded!\" Midna said to Link, who growled. All around them, goblins appeared from the trees.

She's trapped in there!\" Link opened his mouth to protest, after all, it was Midna's idea to go ask Zelda. He closed it quickly. Arguments with Midna could last for quite a long time. <br>\r\n\"Lets try the Resistance. You know, at Telmas Bar?\" Midna suggested, morphing back into Links shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed towards the bar, however, a scuffle at the gate behind him caused him to stop. Turning, he saw a couple of goblins attacking the guards, and winning, much to his surprise. <br>\r\nDrawing the Master Sword, he leapt at one of the goblins. Bringing the Master Sword down, the goblin fell back. Swinging it to the left, another fell to his blade. The final goblin tried to run, but tripped over his own feet. Jumping skyward, Link brought his blade down through the goblins torso. Backflipping away, he sheathed the Master Sword. <br>\r\n\"T-Thank you!\" The guard stuttered. He was clearly new, or very inexperienced. He clutched his spear close to his body. <br>\r\nNodding, Link headed for the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?! I guess I shouldn't be surprised. He does wield that blade, after all...\"<br>\r\nReceiving the news that yet another group of goblins had been wiped out, Ilia was beginning to lose her patience. Losing a group to Link was fine, he was an experienced swordsman. But she was still fuming over the wolf.<br>\r\n\"While they're in Castle Town, they cannot be touched. Wait until they leave. Follow them, but do not engage. Once they are isolated, send in the Moblins,\" Ilia ordered. Her group only had a few moblins, all of which cheered when she gave the order. They grabbed their massive clubs and immediately set out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you need our help infiltrating a goblin stronghold?\" Telma asked. <br>\r\nLink nodded. <br>\r\n\"Well, it doesn't sound too difficult. Definitely within our power. I'll send word to the Resistance. Get them to meet you in Ordon Village,\" Telma said, leaning on her counter. \"They're out looking for some sort of ancient temple at the moment. I'll make sure it's a priority mission. You head out there now, they'll be there\".<br>\r\nNodding again, Link left the bar. <br>\r\n\"That sword of his... Looks like he already found that temple,\" Telma mused, watching the door swing shut behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Link rode in Hyrule Field, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being followed. In response to his concern, Midna appeared. <br>\r\n\"I can sense them... Moblins. They're following you. Be careful, okay?\" She said, before disappearing. <br>\r\nRiding on, Link kept one hand on Epona's reins, and the other on the Master Sword. <br>\r\nAs the sun set, Link reached Ordon Village. He didn't dare leave Epona unattended at his house, so he rode her into town. Almost immediately, the mayor appeared. <br>\r\n\"Link! Have you found her?\" He asked quickly. <br>\r\nLink hesitated. Did he really want to tell him that his daughter was now very fat and very evil?<br>\r\nHe finally shook his head. No sense worrying him anymore than he already was. <br>\r\n\"Oh... Well, I'm sure she's out there. Just... keep an eye out for her,\" he said, walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink decided to rest in the centre of town. He didn't really fancy using his house, due to the Moblins stalking him. At least in the village, someone would notice them and raise the alarm. He could handle Moblins, no problem. <br>\r\nLeaning back against the massive tree decorating a corner of the Village, he fell asleep. </span></div></div>",

She had awoken briefly when she had heard a familiar sounding \"Hyahh!\" from outside. She had also felt discomfort and... fear? She couldn't remember. <br>\r\nStanding up, Zelda scratched her gargantuan belly and brushed her black hair back over her shoulders. Fixing her tiara, she looked up at the tiny hatch in the ceiling. <br>\r\n\"No hope of fitting through there,\" she said, annoyed. She lifted her belly, cradling her fat in her arms. Looking around the room for some sort of weakness, she sighed. It was built too well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just my luck... I'm trapped in this godforsaken room, with no food!\" She complained, falling backwards. The impact caused every part of her body to jiggle madly. A glow on her hand drew her attention. <br>\r\nThree triangles had appeared, causing Zelda to smile. <br>\r\n\"Of course... The Triforce!\"<br>\r\nRaising her right arm, she concentrated. A golden glow surrounded her body. She disappeared from the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This hits the spot, brother\".<br>\r\n\"That it is does. I'm glad that that Link was able to calm Darbus\".<br>\r\nTwo Gorons were relaxing in the hot springs. They had just had a sumo match, and were unwinding when an slightly splash startled them. <br>\r\n\"What was that?!\" One of them yelled, jumping to his feet. He clumsily walked over to the source of the splash, the water impeding his movement. As he reached the source, he saw a huge person with dark grey skin and black hair stand up. They were huge, almost the same size as Darbus. <br>\r\n\"Hmmm, a hot spring... Must be Death Mountain\", came a female voice. <br>\r\n\"Excuse me? Are you alright?\" Asked the Goron, surprised at both the size of the girl and how she had actually gotten there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, Zelda eyed the Goron. Compared to her body, he was tiny! Even her belly, which hung down past her knees, was the same size as him!<br>\r\n\"Where is your leader?\" Zelda demanded. <br>\r\n\"Up at the top of that rock,\" he said, pointing up at the massive rock next to them. <br>\r\n\"Damn, I was a bit off...\" Zelda muttered, clenching her fist. The Triforce glowed brightly, causing her to disappear. <br>\r\n\"What was it, brother?\" Asked the second Goron, who had just caught up. <br>\r\n\"I... don't know? But it looked like Princess Zelda!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly. Why would the Princess come up here? She hates the heat!\" He laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we don't know what it is?\" Gor Coron asked, scratching his face. He was looking at a barrel of glowing blue goop. Darbus, who had brought the barrels up the Mountain after a merchant had brought them to the Gorons, shook his head. <br>\r\n\"Merchants left them for us. A barrel for each of us leaders. But, it isn't rocks. So we won't eat them,\" he said, popping a rock in his mouth. He crunched it loudly. <br>\r\n\"Hmm... I sense some sort of... evil from it...\" Gor Coron mused. The Gorons were always cautious, especially when strangers sent gifts to them. \"Get rid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it!\"<br>\r\nA female voice interrupted them. Both Gorons turned to face their interrupter and saw a huge female. Her breasts were huge, three times the size of her head. Her doughy belly was was hanging down in front of her knees. Her thick thighs supported an ass which was almost as big as small boulders. Her face was adorned with three chins, and was busy forming a fourth. But her face was still somewhat recognizable...<br>\r\n\"Princess Zelda?\" Gor Coron asked, amazed at the sheer size of Zelda. <br>\r\n\"Correct. I seek those barrels. They pose a danger to Hyrule, and I am looking to... destroy them,\" she explained. <br>\r\n\"And your body?\" Darbus asked. <br>\r\n\"A curse that the Twilight had inflicted upon me,\" Zelda lied again. \"Until the King of Twilight has been defeated, I look like this\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Hopefully Link is on the case. In the meantime, take these barrels from here. I sense something from them. It makes me... uncomfortable,\" Gor Coron said. \"Where should we take them?\"<br>\r\nZelda, unable to fit in her old basement, thought about it for a moment. She needed somewhere where she could eat them without being disturbed by that fake 'Goddess'... <br>\r\nSomewhere like...</span></div></div>",

All I know is that you will literally become the biggest fisher in the world! Whatever that means!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can I take it back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late. No way to undo a wish. You can't even cancel one wish out with a second one. You're gonna be the biggest fisher in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know what that means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see. Um...wanna make your second wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! Not after you pulled that Monkey's Paw crap on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to! I was just careless, not evil! Please don't eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna eat you, I'm just...angry! And I definitely want to think long and hard about what my next wish should be. And I also gotta see how my first one turns out...and as for you, you're coming with me. You'll be on vacation in one of aquariums for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fair enough...I can't believe it, my first time in a hundred years to grant a wish, and I screw up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was that Hena set the magical fish up in one of her tanks, and went to bed, tossing and turning, worried about what it would mean for her to literally be the biggest fisher in the world.</span></div></div>",

It kind of startled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what's up?\" he asked, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean what I said, I'm out of food. I ate all the food in my house, starting right at the crack of dawn. And y'know what? I'm still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's, uh, weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it would be weird if I didn't know why. But I DO know why. Because of your stupid wish-granting! I'm going to be the biggest fisher in the world, and now, I've got an insatiable appetite! Don't you get it? I'm gonna be FAT! REALLY, REALLY, REALLY FAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But worse than the fact that I'm going to have the fattest ass in all of Hyrule, I'm starving! And I've got no food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how about you go fishing? I don't mind, honest. Most fish are jerks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently so.\" she said, fixing him with an angry glare \"But no, that's slow, and I'm hungry now. Besides, with how hungry I am, there's no telling how many fish I'd end up devouring, and I don't want to wipe out any local populations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So go and buy some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna go bankrupt because of what you did to me! This is your responsibility!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you wanna make another wish? For some food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want food, but I'm not spending a wish on it! This is still part of the first wish! Until I'm the biggest fisher in the world, you are obligated to do everything in your power to make that happen! So, yeah, rustle me up some food, but don't you dare try and use up another one of my wishes doing it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, what kind of food do ya want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate.\" she said, sternly, crossing her arms \"Lots, and lots, of chocolate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go check your pantry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena went and looked, and sure enough, her pantry was now packed with all manner of chocolate, in every shape and size, and with all kinds of fillings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Hena dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while she was too busy gluttonously shoving handfuls of chocolate into her mouth to notices, she was already gaining significant weight. Even after just her early morning gorging, her baggy clothes had begun to fill up, and they would soon be tight. But those facts didn't even register until they begun to feel downright uncomfortable. Shrugging, and now resolved to simply go on and get her growth over with, she simply stripped out of her clothes, and resumed eating.</span></div></div>",

An hour after finding her pantry filled to the brim with chocolate, she had so wildly decimated everything in sight that even now large splodges of chocolate laid all over her body, some of which she occasionally scooped some residue up with a plump finger to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Eh, congratulations?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all you have to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a bit hard to concentrate when you're towering over me as naked as the day you were born...\" It was true, and it stressed just how much the fisher girl had gained. Her breasts were several cups larger, perky and jiggly as they rested on her outstretched belly, which hung low a foot in front of her. Her thighs were no exception; they seemed to now be practically rushing outwards, giving the effect that fat had been painstakingly piled up to create her thick legs. Her dimply ass shivered against the early morning chill, which did nothing to stop the rest of her body rippling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes don't fit anymore. GUESS WHY.\" The fish backed away... Or paddled away, whatever those fish things call it. \"It'd be bad if I couldn't wear my favorite gear, but now the most I can do is wear a shirt as a bib and get my pants half-way up!\" Starting to pace, her footsteps caused small tremors next to the pond, but almost immediately comes to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns over and gives the fish a devious grin. \"Though of course, your obliged to GIVE me new, larger clothes.\" The fish almost immediately quipped in curiosity. \"That's your second wish?\" Hena giggled, yet it didn't seem overly jolly. \"Nope, only a part of the first wish! Lemme explain; if I don't have fitting clothes...\" Quickly muttering under her breath, \"Oh man, I can apply this to ANYTHING!\", she continued. \"Or a constant flow of cash, or luxurious comforts, in addition to food...\" She winked at the fish. \"Well, I guess I'll just be driven out of depression to end it all! And boy, I'd hate for you to not make me the World's Biggest Fisher! Eh... You DO have to make sure a wish comes true, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fish turned solemn, further annoyed that his own blunder was costing him more than it should. \"Ugh... 'By the law's of magic, we're forced to ensure a wish is completed to the utmost satisfaction of the wisher.' So yes, granting you all your stupid junk only counts for your first wish.\" Though an idea fitted into his own head, with a grin that no doubt unnerved Hena as any grinning fish is creepy as all hell. \"But of course, that can wait- You have another pile of goodies in your pantry to work through! I've got to make sure you become the biggest afterall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena shot a mean glare at the fish as her body seemed to take over at the prospect of food, her large legs waddling speedily to the door. Mr. Magical Fish Guy decided she'd been manipulative enough to deserve another go. As Hena walked inside, she could *just* hear one last cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think you're able to skimp out on seconds, fat ass!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cheeseburgers, Hena decided, were the greatest blessing the world had ever recieved. As she lay dreamily by her always full pantry, Hena clutched a massive, sloppy cheeseburger in each hand. Each one was stuffed with so many varieties of cheese, so many slices of bacon, so many onion rings, so many sauces and condiments, and so much thick, greasy beef, that both of them were collapsing under their own weight. Hena didn't seem to mind any of the chunks that slipped out from the wet, disintegrating buns, for once she finished everything in her hands, she merely took slathering handfulls of whatever had fallen onto her belly, or breasts, or into her folds, and brought the slippery mess to her mouth. After she didn't even know how many cheeseburgers, she had developed a system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the cheeseburgers were only the most recent meaty delicacies to come her way. They had come after all the fried chicken, buttered ham, and stuffed turkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gobbled merrily away at her neverending meal, Hena began to take a more philosophical view of her situation. She would certainly never go hungry again. She was completely free to indulge in as much delicious, decadent food as she wanted. And with her wish's end result looming, there was no doubt she'd be a star. Heck, she might be able to swing the situation to work for her...maybe make it seem like she gained so much weight from the untold hordes of fish she so effortlessly drew up from the water, her domain, over which she expertly ruled?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, she had two more entire wishes. And if she planned it right, she might be able to milk them for as much as this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning wide, and bringing to mind a hippo in more ways than one, Hena decided that she had eaten heartily enough to have earned some more beauty sleep...and all things considered, the floor by the pantry wasn't the comfiest place in her home. Alas, getting up took more of an effort than she expected. She flapped her thick arms up and down in a futile attempt to heave herself up into at least a sitting position, but accomplished little more than impressing herself with how much all the loose flesh on her arms shook. She then decided to try to roll over to be facedown, so she could push herself up, but even this proved to be an effort with all her new, meat-induced pounds. As she rolled over onto her side, she looked down as best she could, and marveled at how far her belly stretched out across the floor. In fact, she was marveled that it was big enough to even be seen beyond her fat-swollen breasts, which took up most of her field of vision when she tilted her head down to any degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling over onto such an enormous belly, she realized, would take some doing. She hefted the top of its two rolls as best she could, her hands sinking deep into it, holding tight. With as much strength as the muscles beneath her flab could muster she swung it to the right, then as she rolled in that direction, she swung it back to the left, its momentum driving her back that direction. She continued doing this, swinging her huge, soft belly apron back and forth like a pendulum, and finally she rolled along with it using all her might, and floorboards creaking beneath her, her vast ass rose above her, buns shaking like gelatin, and she finally ended up on her belly, it pooling out to her sides. Even though her body was so soft and heavy that she was considerably flattened laying down, her still relatively firm, and utterly impressive breasts, and the sheer immensity of her belly, still left her face far from the floor, a fact which she marveled at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also marveled at how little she was able to lift her body. Her push-ups were not only exhausting, but seemingly pointless, as even when she managed to push herself as high as her arms\u2019 reach could allow, not a single inch of her corpulence lifted off the ground. Even her nipples were still kissing the floor, and her belly\u2019s two great rolls both weighed on the boards as heavily as if she weren\u2019t holding herself up at all. Her thickened legs further diminished her ability to get up off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she gave up, surrendered to gravity, and as she collapsed back into her blubber, she shook and rippled like a waterbed. All her exertion had put her into a sweat, causing her rolls to glisten, moisture pooling in her folds. She didn\u2019t even want to ponder how much impossible weight she had put on. Did she weigh a ton, now? Or was that an overestimate? Or an under?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo way around it, she knew. She was getting pissed again. If she was already having this much trouble, what sort of trials would she have when she reached her final size? And how long did she have until then, anyway? Magic was tampering with her weight gain more and more, by the looks of it\u2026not only was her appetite fueled by an unnatural ferocity, but as much as she ate, this was still a ridiculous gain. And obviously, it came ridiculously fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena\u2019s mind began to surge with thought. There had to be something to do\u2026there was seemingly no way to avoid the weight gain, but surely there must be a way to make it less aggravating? Unfortunately, all she could think of was to make some kind of wish. And even then, what would the wish be for? Strength? No, strength wasn\u2019t the problem, the sheer volume of her fat was what was impeding her movement. Maybe\u2026flight? Yeah, if she could float at will, or something? But then again, the damn fish might screw that up too, giving her a bunch of silly wings, or something\u2026but still, she felt like she was on the right track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, another idea occurred to her. Get to the lake! Floating around in the water, her hugeness made nearly weightless, would free up a lot of her complaints. But, getting there would be a huge pain. Should she ask the fish for help, after all?\u2026but that seemed like a waste of a wish. Or, could she use this for another free sub-wish? Hmmmm\u2026then again, the fish was starting to annoy her, and while she couldn\u2019t see him, she suspected he was getting a kick out of seeing her this helpless. She didn\u2019t necessarily want to stoop to asking for something as arbitrary as merely getting to the lake, even if it didn\u2019t eat up one of her remaining wishes. If she was gonna ask the fish for something, it would have to be a more creative solution\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Hena thought about various wishes she could use to aide herself in the best way possible, she then decided to just screw it and save her wishes for something more important later on. \"Agh! I've gotta get to that lake myself, that damn fish'll just screw me over for a problem as simple as this...\" Hena said under her breath, not wanting to let the magic bearing fish hear her words. The most likely 2,000 or so lb woman then slowly, shifted her gargantuan body forward, using the momentum of her massive weight to move forward. The fisher-woman sweated each moment as she heaved forward, her doughy rolls filling with more and more of her moisture, her bulging folds on her belly and waist undulating every time she slammed down onto the floor after each shift of her body. Hena huffed and wheezed as she inched towards the door, after about 30 minutes or so she had advanced...4 feet till she heard her slight chuckle coming from the fish tank. \"Heh heh... having trouble moving are we?\" the fish said as he once again grinned creepily and took great pleasure at watching the person who had been currently taking advantage of his magical powers, swimming back and forth with ease, taunting her now almost completely immobile state. Not that he minded her taking advantage of his powers so much, he was impressed the woman had enough common sense and forethought to do so to this extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff...huff shut up, this is all your fault anyway. So once I get into the lake and get rid of my moving problem, I'll make sure to take advantage of my first wish obligations again.\" Hena said as began to slowly heave herself towards the door, only a mere 6 feet away. \"  \"Are ya sure you don't want any help, at this rate you'll be at the lakeside by nightfall.\" the fish said. \" \"Oh I'll get there myself thank you very much. <i>I can't waste another potential manipulation on you just to move...</i>\" Hena said under her breath. After about another half an hour Hena had finally hauled her gigantic, one ton, sweaty body to the door, her fold and rolls were jiggling from her panting and she left a rather large trail of sweat behind her. \"Haha.....now to open the door!\" As Hena reached up with her meaty, sausage-like fingers she reached for the door and opened it. \"Ahhh finally..urrrp!\" Hena said oddly burping despite not having eaten in over an hour. Hena then blushed at what she had just done but, continued on outside. Now finally outside having been overcome with the sensation of the fresh air and just feeling proud of doing the incredible feat of....getting outside her house, she was making her way to the lake much faster now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way into the her private lake, she lowered herself into the cold water, her nipples hardening up in an instant, her belly folds filling with the fresh water. \"Ohhhh this feels so nice, finally I can relax...\" Hena said as leisurely swam around effortlessly due to the water's affect on her weight. Finally her muscles could relax and rejuvenate from trying so hard to lift her monumental body off the floor earlier. As the woman swam, Hena took to occasionally gulping down a few mouthfuls of water, and over time making her big gut quite sloshy. About an hour later at around 7pm Hena had taken to lying on the ground, her body glistening from the moonlight shining off the droplets of water on her naked body. Lying under the tree Hena gazed up at the stars. \"Hmm, I'm starting to kinda enjoy all this weight, it feels pretty good, ...I guess I'll have to think of some way to get myself some mobility from that fish, I can't be crawling around like this forever. Hena said to herself as she scratched  her sloshy belly and rubbed her still slightly tingling breasts, which were almost twice the size of head at this point. Her stomach itself veered outward by a good 5 ft, extending almost to the edge of the lake from the tree she was resting on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting for a few more minutes she picked herself up and slowly waddled back to her house, now since she had time to relax and get more used to her new one ton weight she could now somewhat walk again. As she was walking in she quickly made a realization. Hena then went over to her fishing poles and tried to grab one. \"Hey, did ya have a nice time outside?\" All he got as a response was her grunting trying to accurately and correctly hold her fishing poles. \"Grahhh! It's no use, my fingers are too fat to hold my poles anymore!\" \"Hmm, well guess you'll need to go to the market tomorrow and get some, good luck getting popularity with you being the way you are now.\", the fish said in a half sarcasm half serious way. \"Oh no.... your fixing this for me.\" Hena glared with an annoyed look on her full face still irritated how her equipment was useless to her now. \"Huh? Why, you can buy more larger fishing poles yourself.\" \"Well I would, but I'm not yet ready to show..., Hena then grabbed a chunky handful of her blubbery gut and shook it, making her whole body undulate. <i>this</i> to the entire market townspeople. \"So...what do you want?\" Hena then thought as she walked over to her pantry which was still quite full,despite her gluttonous binging earlier this day, she started to eat as she fueled herself to better get an idea on how to construe this order correctly. \"Hmm...gulp, I want a large rod, a long one, big enough to fit these fat hands of mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fish, who had only been somewhat paying attention was at that moment had remembered a  joke involving the word rod and this in this instance had effected the \"wish\". \"Hmm? Oh yes yes, here you go.\" Hena then looked around waiting for her new fishing rod to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(To anyone out there, sorry for this lackluster end to this chapter, I couldn't think of a proper way to end this based on the choice I came from, so I'll try and make up for it in my next chapter in...wherever.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hena got excited as she walked/waddled over to cabinet of fishing poles and found...nothing new. \"Hey fish!\" Hena yelled as she whipped her head around now quite irritated at the magical talking fish. Being jolted out his leisurely viewing of his own species, the fish jerked his body towards the 2000lb+ woman and responded in an oddly relaxed manner. \"What?\" the fish asked. \"Where the hell is my new bigger fishing rod?!\" Hena barked as shook her arms in the air, creating waves of jiggling fat amongst her body. \"Hmm I'm not sure....\" \"You're not sure?!\" Hena screamed as she almost went up to bang on the fish tank, if not for the fact she remembered just before doing so that would possibly give a nice deep cut on her and a huge mess. \"Well...I mean you didn't specify where you wanted it, it could be anywhere in this place.\" \"Erghhh you...you..stupid..uhhh ohhh what is that sensation I'm feeling?\" Hena said bewildered at this odd feeling she had under her belly. Fitting her stubby hand underneath her flowing gut, she felt around until she felt something fit into cupped hand. Her eyes widened as soon as she felt it. \"No...no there's no way.\" Hena stuttered as she grasped hold of her wide, bulbous belly folds and heaved them upwards so she could get a confirmation on her thoughts. Hena looked down at her crotch and saw above her naturally born vagina, was a rock hard 16 inch dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-wha-WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?!!!! What the FUCK is THIS?!\" Hena screeched and bellowed as she ran up to the fish tank and pushed her new organ up to magic fish's face against the glass tank. \"Woah! Ok, don't shove that thing in my face!\" the fish replied upon seeing the woman's cock inches from him, luckily he had a few inches of glass between him and the \"rod\" \"Oh I'll do more than shove it in your face if you don't fix this, just why do I have a cock?!\" Hena said breathing heavily in anger. \"Hmm...oh I know why!\" the fish responded. \"When you made your wish I....might've been thinking of this really funny dick joke one of friends told me, it was abou--\" \"I don't care about jokes, how the hell could fuck up so royally as to give me this...<i>thing</i> instead of my established bigger fishing rod?\" The fish then answered rather awkwardly, knowing that possibly this action could put his life in danger, being magical sucked when you couldn't actively use it to help yourself under the control of a master. \"Well....when you told me your wish I only really heard the \"rod part\" and I was remembering a joke as I told you so....I kinda gave you big rod on ya instead of a fishing rod.\" the fish smiled awkwardly, which considering it was a fish just smiling would look odd enough. \"Well then...why don't you do a favor and get rid of it hmm?\" Hena asked in a subtly violent tone. \"Sorry I cannot remove it for you until it completely satisfies your needs, namely you wanted a way to fish with your fat hands and well...\" the fish eyed Hena's bulging penis, which she still had pushed up against the glass. Hena jolted back at what he was implying. \"Ohhoho no, I am NOT getting bitten by fish on this sensitive thing for my job.\" \"Well I'm afraid, and believe me I am considering it's you, that since no person in the world sells fishing poles to fit you and you don't really have any means to be able to commission one to be made so, due to my mistake you'll have to fish with your new meat stick.\" \"I can't just ask for an actual fishing rod?\" Hena asked irritated at how this fish was basically telling her she seemed to be forced to use her new-found male genitalia for her job, which she imagined would do <i>wonders</i> for her business with customers. \"Well...\" the fish said seriously hoping this reveal to the woman wouldn't mean grave harm to him. \"You can if you want use up your second wish...\" \"You mean to tell me getting rid of this won't be a favor?!\" Hena eyes bulged as realized her predicament. \"Well I can't give you a favor to rectify the immediate previous favor, even if it was of my own folly. \"However I can use my magic to make the situation better for you.\" \"How?\" Hena said emphasizing her question.  She stepped back folding her arms below her massive bosom, wanting to know just what the fish had in mind to help her make due with her cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I could make it so you're penis is impervious to damage so it won't get hurt when you fish.\" the fish said swimming around daintily.  Hen put her hand to chin in thought, \"Hmm I guess other than the weird, weird feeling it'll give me I guess that won't be too bad then.\" The fish, wanting his safety guaranteed, told the fisher-woman more favors he could do for her. \"Tell ya what, because of my royal screw-up as a magic granting fish, I will allow you to have three more favors, allowing you almost anything before they start counting as actual wishes. \"Well alright, I guess that helps in making up for giving me a huge cock.\" Hena said as flicked the thing, it's flung back and forth, banging into her over 500lb belly, its form pumping every so often with her blood coursing through it. \"Hehe, well at least it feels nice the touch.\" Hena then waddled over to a chair in the room, sitting next to her pet cockatiel  Purdy, \"Hena's a fat blob!\" Purdy said, insulting her owner as she did on a regular basis. Hena shot a glare at her pet, who while she loved very very much, she had to admit the bird had quite a mouth on it. Well now what?\" the fish asked wondering what the one ton woman was going to do now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I really hate to say it....ehhh but this boner is really starting hurt with how much blood is going down there so I guess I'm going to....*sigh* I'm going to have to jerk off.\" Hena winced as she said this noting just how awkward this sounded. \"Ok, just dont get any of your mess near me.\" This surprised Hena, \"Huh? you're not the least bit disgusted by the thought of a woman with a dick jerking herself off?\" Hena said wondering just how nonchalant this fish could be at times.\" \"I'm a fish, our kind don't follow your hylian ways of privacy around self pleasuring.\" Feeling a bit weired out by this statement, Hena responded. \"Well...ok then.\" Hena said as she brought her hands to her full shaft. As Hena took a hold of enormous meaty pole, which by the looks of it out sized even the most endowed of men she could feel just how hard and smooth it felt in her palms. It's plump head was roughly the size of a plum and it was so thick it took both her hands to wrap around it all the way. Hena huffed as she began to pump her hands. \"Well...lets get started.\" As Hena pumped her dick she started to sweat and her gut heaved forward from her heavy breathing. \"Huff...hufff oh jeez this feel way better than I thought it would! No wonder guys masturbate so much!\" Hena moaned as her lower head began to ooze pre-cum form it's slit. As she grew hornier, Hena took one of her hands off her monumental dick and began to grope her right breast, which was rather easy due to it being twice the size of her own head now. Hena bit her lip as she quickened her pace, moving her hand across her entire length and she began to massage and grope her massive stomach, which despite it's girth did not make her jerking off hard due to being set on her counter beside her, and also due to her cock's incredible length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho oh dear goddesses this is damn good!\" Hena bit her lower lip as she quickened her pace even further, her body coated in her own sweat, so much so her many folds, chins and bellybutton were pooling up with the liquid. Hena could feel immense pressure building up in her crotch, telling her she was about to be ejaculate. Pushing into her belly folds as fast as she possibly could and moving her other hand across her cock as fast as possible as well. And then it happened...Hena blew a huge load. \"Ahhhhhh!\" Hena screamed as her cock spurted out glob after glob of cum going all over her flabby body, and on the floor in front of her, cum had landed in her folds, her bellybutton and even on her face and in her numerous chins. Lapping the bit of excess jizz from her face and her chin and double chin she slumped back into her chair letting out a large burp in satisfactory pleasure. \"Bbbbbuuuuuuurrrrrrrrpppppp!!!! Oh man, that was....great!\" Hena said as she rubbed her huge belly, her cock now flaccid, was now a smaller 8 inches though still very long. \"You done?\" the magic fish said after watching the woman's rather lustrous pleasuring. \"Huff..pant...ye-gulp yeah.\" Hena responded with her eyes half closed in exhaustion. \"Oh man, I might just keep this thing if it feels that good every time.\" \"Pfft you're telling me, by your noises I assumed you hated it.\" the fish said in sarcasm. As Hena regained her energy she got up to get a snack from her now always full pantry. Well...snack to her was now  full course meal to anyone else, even a Goron would've gotten nervous about eating so much food, but for this 1 ton+ lady it was just a mere snack to her. \"Mmmhhh so good.\" Cheeseburgers, steaks, and bacon, all straight down her gullet into her ever growing belly.  As Hena ate and ate she gained more and more after about 10 minutes of <i>snacking</i> Hena had gained an extra 100lbs which could probably be explained by the fact the food was given to her from a magic being. As Hena had had her fill for now, she looked at the clock and it was currently almost 9:00pm. \"Oh Uuuuurrrrrrpppppp!!! Well now that I'm full and my cock is relaxed, I'm gonna end this crazy day now.\" Hena said yawning. At that moment Hena felt a sensation coming from her body. \"Ohhh uhhhh...\" Hena moaned. \"Whats wrong?\" the fish asked. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Augh...I was full not two seconds ago and now I'm hungry again!\" Hena shot the magical fish a death glare, causing it to stare off to the side a bit with what looked like a pouting expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess you'll just have to eat more?\" The fish replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena merely shot the fish an annoyed glance, sighing as she resigned. It wasn't like she could resist now, especially seeing how she was unable to fight off the powers of this wish and the only thing she could do now was see what she could do to make it more pleasant. It helped her fish companion could, working within the loopholes of the wish, create more food for the gluttonous fishing woman whenever she needed it, which meant no long and arduous trips to town. Speaking of, she could use an <i>actual</i> fishing rod, seeing as her \"friend\" had just botched it simply due to indulging in, of all things, dick jokes! What was he really twelve in fish years or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Hena sighed as she observed the food placed out in front of her. Burgers, steak, heavy soup laden with choice ingredients and hearty stocks and broths and rather fine cheeses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm~...hey fish. *Slurp* *Munch* *Snarf* Since BBBUUURRRRPP!! it's sorta late..*Munch* *Munch* *Nom* and I'm about to hit the haaaaaaayUUUUUURRRRPP!! ...think you could poof up *Scarf* *Chew* *Ulp!* some wine to go with this?\" Hena requested between mouthfuls of food as she ate and belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fish was surprised by this twist. It was almost out of left field for him. Within a wave of his fins (or however you wanna make it whimsical), a dark green bottle of wine, accompanied by a glass, appeared on the shelf near where Hena had been stuffing her face. As Hena crammed sweet potato fries into her mouth as best as her puffy cheeks could hold, she uncorked the bottle and poured it in the glass, taking a moment to sniff it, before swallowing the food in her mouth, making a visible lump in her flabby neck as she did, and then tasted it, swirling the wine in her mouth before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Good year. Good pick! I didn't think a fish would know too much about wine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I remind you I'm magic. I can \"poof\" up any flavor of that wine stuff you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah what-BBBUURRRRRPPP!!! ...ever.\" Hena said nonchalantly as she stuffed cheese in her mouth before drinking wine after swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to glut herself, utterly confusing the magic fish in how she could eat so ravenously but still stay classy drinking her wine, she had a thought pop in her head. With all this fat, maybe her new dick would be buried under it and she wouldn't ever really need to worry about it anymore. A small smile creased Hena's blubbery face as she looked down. However, her expression soon changed to disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that, as she started to put on weight, her new dick only grew along with her. At first, eight inches flaccid it was now roughly nine and a half inches by this point. By this point, Hena felt like the shock and surprises had run out, coupled with having her nerves cooled and relaxed by the three glasses of wine she'd just drank. Her only reaction by this point was an exasperated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...at least I have that fish to meet any needs I have now.\" Hena sighed, muttering to herself as she poured herself another glass of wine. Gods above knew she could use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">BBBBBRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRPPP!!!</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena sighed and cooed happily as she lay on her bed, which was now basically a futon by this point after the frame broke a ways back. Her belly finally felt stuffed and she, admittedly, let herself get rather tipsy. Such a thing was bound to happen when you polished off a whole bottle of wine. She looked at her billowing fat belly and impressive, round fat breasts as best she could from her perspective. Her weight had, thanks to her second dinner, climbed up to an even more impressive 3,050lbs and her dick was over ten inches long flaccid now. Hena only mumbled to herself sleepily as she curled under her new blankets as best she could after convincing her fish friend she couldn't be the biggest fisher if she died of frostbite at night. Hena muttered, her flushed drunken face for once smiling as she dreamed tender dreams of fishing with her father a while back. Her magical fish companion gazed at her silently before sighing once more, choosing a proper stationary position to relax himself and sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

He smiled as he started having a pleasant dream of swimming through waters, clean and crisp, all by himself with nothing to bother him as the sun shone through the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he was awakened by a rapt tapping on the glass of his tank. The fish stirred, waking up from his slumber as he looked up and stared at Hena's puffy face as best he could past her fat, bulbous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise and shine. Hate to bother you, uh, fish.\" Hena said, not knowing if this fish even had a name. \"But I kind of need to get some things in Castle Town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fish blinked at her, it's tired eyes staring up at Hena as he floated lazily in the tank. He knew if she needed food, she'd ask for it, which meant this applied to something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what...?\" The fish asked, unintentionally sounding indignant due to his grogginess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena puffed up her cheeks a bit as she placed her hands against her wide, fat hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you must know...I could use a fishing rod for one. An ACTUAL fishing rod, seeing as how you botched that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena hefted her flaccid cock in her plump hand, making the fish turn around and stare off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also need to pick up some other things while I'm out; books, mail, maybe some baits. I'd ask you to make those, but...I'm not sure how...you'd feel since you're a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I get it.\" The fish said, letting out a yawn. \"And I know you can't be a fisher if you don't have a rod to your name. But let me ask; how do you plan to get there in your...oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena grinned as she stared at the fish. Realizing she had simply made him spell out the logic behind her latest loophole, he groaned. This time, in order to make sure he didn't make any more mistakes, he summoned something with his magic. Hena looked in her thick hands and saw what looked like a flute of some kind. She, suddenly feeling an urge inside her, held the flute up above her head in a triumphant manner, a grin forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What is it?\" Hena asked, feeling the rush quickly pass by. Her fish friend flopped over belly-up from that question before regaining himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It's a magic wind flute. Simply play a simple tune and you'll be carried where you need to go. Here, I'll demonstrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fish swam over to the left side of the tank. He slowly swam to the right, quickly changing position up and down in accordance with each note. Making sure she got it down, Hena brought the flute to her lips and played the exact melody. She felt as if a bell chimed somewhere to show she had it down. Smiling, Hena made her way out the door, pulling the flute out and trying the song again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...if it's a wind flute, how will this...?\" Hena looked around the ground below her as she found her answer, a column of wind forming around her and a tornado carrying her off. At first, Hena wailed in fear as she was carried off by the sudden wind, but looking around she saw she was in no danger. Sure, she was spinning a lot and getting dizzier then a sea octorok in a whirlpool, but aside from that it was actually not a bad ride. She was dropped off right outside the gate to Castle Town, her full body wobbling as she found her balance after landing on the cool cobblestone in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCastle Town was bustling with activity and commerce, people bantering back and forth as well as trade all over and children playing happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Hena wondered how the hell she could walk by with her vast form lacking an clothes or anything big enough for her to wear. Even clothes made for Gorons would lack the coverage she desired as she desperately dug through her folds. Her face became quizzical, however, as she found something in her folds. A tunic, absurdly wide enough to fit her form and modest in make soon found its way in her hands. It was woven with plain looking green and blue fabrics and attached was a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Figured you would have wanted this. Can't very well shop for a fishing rod when merchants are ogling your chest -Fish</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHean smirked. As far as she saw, that fish of hers wasn't such a bad guy after all. She didn't even need to struggle to get into her tunic, it fit her like a silken glove as it covered her upper body and the trousers that came with it comfortably slid up past her wide, ample hips and amorously large ass, even providing a sort of cup in the crotch area to hide the woman's sizable phallus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena smiled as she observed her reflection in the fountain, some passers by stopping in awe at her girth. Hena smiled as she observed her puffy, chipmunk like face with full cheeks and multiple chins, her massive breasts contained within her tunic and the way her trousers seductively fit around her hips and wobbling ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what it's worth, I don't look half bad...\" Hena grinned as she walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the attention she was drawing, Hena pulled a list out from one of her folds, with everything she needed to get in town scrawled on the paper. A full pouch of rupees jangled in her hand as she lifted them up, making sure she had enough for everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First I need my fishing rod...\" Hena muttered to herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well...I guess I could go out of order...\" Hena muttered as she scratched the top of her head a bit with her free hand, tilting her head to the side a bit which made her chins wobble slightly and softly clap against her bountiful bust. \"Let's see...I guess Telma would be closest from where I am...dear god, I hope I can even fit through the door.\" Hena muttered. She remembered that getting there would mean waddling her way through the back alley and with her current bulk it would be a miracle if she could even make it that far. Even then, she still needed to pray Telma had that door for Goron customers installed or chances of fitting inside were that of an ice cube surviving in the desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Hena picked herself up on her thick bulky pillars which served as her legs and waddled forth to the section where Telma's bar was. It was never exactly hard to forget where it was because there was usually a congregation of cats nearby somewhere. As she approached, wouldn't you know it, there was a trio of differently colored cats sitting around lazing in the morning sun. However, hearing the resounding sounds of Hena's plump feet against the paved stone streets of the town and the soft clapping of her wobbling bulk as her folds slapped together under her sizable tunic shocked them all, making them run for it out of fear this elephantine woman would trample them and crush them underfoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena panted a bit, her puffy overblown chipmunk face red at the cheeks from her fatigue as she tried to press through. Wedging her way in by waddling at an angle so her belly and butt didn't squash against the sides too much seemed to be the way to do it. She was thankful her dick wasn't any bigger or it would poke out from her trousers and graze against the wall, which would NOT have been pleasant in any way. The tight squeeze made her puffy breasts press up against her face, Hena moaning slightly in discomfort as the plush mounds pressed against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally edged her way to the entrance, reaching for the door with a plumped, chunky hand as she reached for the handle, thankful to the Golden Goddesses that it was a push door and not a pull door as she swung it open and just barely squeezed her impressive bulk inside. Hena panted, reaching down and pressing her hands against her swollen belly due to the fact she couldn't find her knees under the massive apron of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Haah* *Haah* Oh sweet Goddesses I...*hff* *hff* freaking made it...\" Hena almost felt like this was some kind of small victory on her part as she tried to regain her composure, lifting herself up to see the faces of all of the patrons. They were staring right at her, amazed it was even possible for someone like her to be alive and kicking while she was this absurdly fat. Hena wondered how herself, but she could easily shrug it off as an effect of the fish's magic and whatnot. Wiping some sweat from her brow as she huffed and puffed, Hena made her way forwards. She had asked Telma a while back to see if she couldn't get in a shipment of some fine wine. It was a reproduction of a traditional Sheikah stock, but it was still a lovely number that had its own unique character and blend traditional in most Hylian wines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena contained to waddle her way past, accidentally knocking over a soldier's mug with her ample hips and frantically apologizing as she turned around, accidentally pressing her belly against her table and pressing it closer against him, which was especially unfortunate as he was seated right by the wall. A bit embarrassed, Hena merely backed up and made her way to the counter, where Telma was impatiently rapping her fingers against it as her pet cat sat by her. The bar maiden looked up, barely able to make out Hena under the fat built up on her puffy face and her massive bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Hena just the person I need. Come with me, I need a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh?\" Hena shifted nervously a bit. That request practically came from left field. Nonetheless, she couldn't exactly bring herself to deny a friend in need. Waddling behind, Hena found Telma leading her to some double doors. As she opened them, Hena saw a rather impressive storage of food. She found herself drooling a bit, her saliva collecting in her massive chins while she wondered if Telma wouldn't mind a morsel or two missing. Telma, however, did not need her help here unfortunately. Instead, she led the blubbery fisher back to a storage room that was packed to the ceiling with bottles upon bottles of wines as well as many kegs of various sizes! Hena's jaw almost dropped to the floor at the impressive display before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, we were supposed to get someone to taste a new shipment of wine we got, but we couldn't really find the guy. Wonder if he got sidetracked or something...? Anyway, the point is since you know one or two things about wine, maybe you could-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes!</i> *Ahem* I-I mean sure! What's a favor to a friend, huh?\" Hena grinned as she regained her composure, smiling widely at her friend. Sure it was still morning, but what could a tasting or two do to harm her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nA few hours later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRRRRAAAAAAAAPPPP! Eheheh man this is some...pretty good stuff.\" Hena said as a thin blush formed on her face. She was pretty drunk, that was a fact. She wasn't outright slurring her speech or wobbling, but she was pretty drunk of her amorously wide, lard laden ass alright. Sure, she was supposed to spit her wine out after she tasted it, but stuff that was this good? No way! It would just be a waste. That was what Hena told herself as she guzzled down a bottle of Chateau as she felt the sweet wine pass her lips and pour down her mouth. All that extra wine felt like it had added a few pounds to her bulk, given the empty calories in alcohol, but for all she knew that could be her hazy mind playing tricks on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURRRRRRPPP! ...man maybe I should quit while I'm ahead.\" Hena laughed, feeling herself relax and limber up from the alcohol in her system. She decided that as long as she was gonna stop, she may as well pour herself one more little glass before she left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Hena tries to be as responsible as possible and tries to leave. She considers heading home thanks to how drunk she is and puts shopping off for when she sobers up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Hena gets wasted. Debauchery ensues.</span></div></div>",

I think I should head home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling upright, the blobby fishing woman found her balance...barely. The empty calories from her constant wine \"tasting\" and all the cheese she had eaten packed an ample 450 extra pounds onto her body, filling her out into a 3,500lbs behemoth, her tunic snug against her fatter body and her trousers barely disguising her fat cock, which began to grow erect as it rubbed against the inside of the cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohh..fffuuuck, not now...\" Hena muttered to herself as she felt herself getting kinda horny as her dick continued to rub against her trousers and between her massive thighs as they meatily slapped together with each waddling step. \"Keep it together girl, keep it together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena blushed, holding down moans as she bit her lower lip. The drunken hornball of blubber needed to get home now. One little stop and she was already feeling as if her trip had been compromised, thanks to her carnal urges working against her. The massive fisher moaned as she needed something to take her mind off the dangling pleasure organ between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smoked cheese! Get your smoked cheese here, finest in Castle Town!\" a vendor cried as he tried to sell his goods. Hearing this, Hena waddled towards him hoping that food would sober her up and that stuffing herself would get her mind off of sexual pleasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much?\" Hena asked as she towered above the man, her shadow utterly enveloping him and his stand. He went ghastly pale at the sight of the mammoth standing before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-ah, well...for someone as...rubenesque as you, madam, how about it's on the house?\" The man nervously laughed, tugging at his shirt collar, fearing that Hena could just as easily sit on him and take his stock for herself anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, don't mind if I do~\" Hena cooed, wiggling her fingers in anticipation as she stuffed cheese down her throat. She ate quickly, her manners going out the window as she scooped handfuls of cheese into her mouth, the stuff splattering against her mouth, staining her lips and dripping onto her clothing, some even filling up inside her chins as she kept gorging, belches passing her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*BBBBUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRP!!!*</b> Ahh that was good~\" Hena sighed as she licked her lips. \"Ahh...this big girl's still hungry. Oh well, a few more pit stops can't harm my girlish figure, can they~?\" She laughed. The drunken behemoth waddled over to another stand where a man was selling roast mutton. Once more, her immense frame won her a free meal as she ravenously devoured the cuts of meat as fast as she could, gravy dripping off her fingers or into her chins and staining her tightening clothes as she grew even fatter and more immense. Next she moved onto a stall selling beef, then an outdoor milk dispenserey, gulping down gallons of milk at a time as it dripped down her face and onto her clothes and into her chins with the rest of her feast-induced mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, near the edge of town, a young Hylian woman with blond hair and blue eyes stepped out, twirling a parasol as she danced about in her white and blue dress, with caterpillars and spiders crawling all around her, butterflies dancing about as if putting on a show for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, very good of you all~!\" Laughed Agitha, the self-proclaimed princess of bugs. \"You all put on such splendid shows for my court. ...Ahh, but I am so sad to say I'm curious about the world outside. That young man brought so many of your pretty selves to my attention...why I just wish someone out there would whisk me away to see the outside world~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a low stomping noise was heard in the distance. Agitha turned around and saw Hena stumbling her way towards the gate, the three-ton blob wearing a slightly tattered tunic that was absolutely coated with spots, stains and spills from her messy meals and her trousers just barely hid the raging hard-on underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aughh...I think tha-*BBBBRRRAAAAAAAAAPP!!!!* last place gave-*BBUUUUUURRRRRPP!!!* gave me indigestion...\" Hena groaned as she rubbed her blubbery belly, only producing more burps. Agitha gasped. The woman standing before her was so massive, so grand, so fluffy looking...it reminded her of how bloated giant insect queens could get when producing offspring. Perhaps this woman was royalty from outside Castle Town!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, big doughy highness!\" Agitha chirped in a childlike tone, getting the hazy Hena's attention. \"Ma'am, if you would, could you take me outside with you? I wish to find all sorts of pretty an adorable subjects for my insect kingdom! All the lovely butterflies that must exist out there...pleas please please, take me! Take me! Take me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, uhh...shouldn't you talk with your parents first?\" Hena asked, not sure what to say. The young woman's eagerness didn't fade as she looked up at Hena quizzically. She felt a bit odd saying that when she must not have been that much older than the Princess of Insects, maybe five or six years at most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parents? Why madam, it is just myself and my pretty insects in my court.\" She said in a cheery tone. This made Hena frown a bit. Maybe it was the booze talking, but something inside said it would be a good idea for her to take Agitha home with her.</span></div></div>",

So far the rod seemed normal, reliable...she hoped the moment she hooked a fish, it wouldn't turn into some kind of cardboard tube and become useless and flimsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That would just be my luck wouldn't it...I honestly wouldn't be surprised if that crafty, scatter-brained fish </i>had<i> made the mistake of...attaching the rod to me...</i> Hena thought, her mind difting off on its own in the peace and serenity of the fishing grounds, frowning to herself a bit. Fishing was a sport of patience. It took time, waiting for the fish to bite and then making sure not to get too aggressive when pulling it in, waiting for your catch to exhaust itself so you could bring it up to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena remembered one time when she was a little girl fishing with her father. She had hooked a great big fish and her father was trying  to help her pull it in. Unfortunately, she was still a child, too weak to pull her catch in. Instead, it snapped her line clean off with such force she was actually pulled into the shallow waters. Her father consoled her by telling her that she had finally achieved her first \"The one that got away\" story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHena smiled as the sweet memories came to her, ignoring a tug on the end of her line for a bit. She looked up, seeing her bobber dipped far into the water. Hena jumped, instinctively pulling back, sending her body into a mad jiggling fit as her breasts bounded up and down against her chins, her belly wobbling to and fro, and the moment she did a great trout flew from the water with ease!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...I shouldn't have pulled it that easily...\" Hena muttered as even with the excessive mass piled onto her body, she felt like there was barely any effort put into that catch. At that thought, she looked at the rod, the facts beginning to dawn on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahah! That fish gave me a rod that can catch anything! I guess he wanted to make up for his last mistake.\" Hena smirked as she placed a hand as close against her fatty hip as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn only minutes, Hena found herself catching a huge pile of fish, big enough to feed a full table at a royal feast. Trouts, salmon, bass...all kinds of fish she knew of that lived in these waters all standing before her as a grand testament to her catch.</span></div></div>",

The only one to come in every day was Ashei who had taken to being a regular at the older woman's bar, enjoying the woman's company and had taken a liking to the various beverages and meals offered at the restaurant Telma was at the moment quite bored, taking a look around she saw her pet cat Louise was being cared for by the young men,stroking her fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking to herself, Telma mumbled to herself about the current situation. \"Well, it may not be lively here...but is quaint to say the least.\" A few minutes of tending to her counter and giving a few alcoholic beverages to the group of soldiers and a glass of milk to Ashei, Telma herself began to grow somewhat famished, rubbing her growling, portly stomach, Telma grabbed some loaves of bread from behind her counter and made some sandwiches for herself. Though she was not one quick to admit it, she did have a rather gluttonous hunger, made apparent by her larger then average frame. As she ate the number of sandwiches and plates increased very quickly from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on. after her 8th plate she had attracted the attention of Ashei and most certainly the men, who were rather surprised by the bar maiden's gluttonous appetite. As Telma devoured more and more food, she had soon completely gotten the attention of everyone in the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gotten even more hungry and for some reason did not mind the fact she was depleting her own stock, Telma yelled out to soldiers for help. \"gulp gulp Mmhh Hey! you men, help feed this dear woman here!\" She said as she gulped down a whole bottle of various drinks. Looking at each other the group of Hylian soldiers shrugged their soldiers and scrambled over to the husky woman and began stuffing her maw with food. Seeing this and getting uninterested with it, preferring to spend her time reading instead of gawking at a friend of hers gorge herself, she propped her feet back on the table to resume her literature which was detailing the interesting events of what she believed was ancient adventure. {As I made my way to caverns of Hyrule, I found myself an enormous mound of....} \"Hey Ashei! you too!\" Telma demanded from the pale female warrior. sighing as her reading was to be for another time, Ashei got up and walked over the bartender, who was escalating from her chubby 186lb body to a much higher weight. \"What has gotten her today?\" Ashei wondered as she grabbed some meat from cold storage room.

The bar maid ate ravenously, allowing food to fall onto her person and stain her face, belching without care or abandon as she only demanded more food between mouthfuls and belches. She was already pushing her clothes to their absolute limits with her bulk as she shoveled more and more food into her mouth with her plump fingers, her much larger and fatter breasts stained with gravy, bits of food and her own drool as her bulging belly, which represented Telma closing in closer to 600lbs, stood out proudly in front of her. Ashei stared, her usually bored and apathetic eyes becoming enticed by Telma's bulk as she stuffed her own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You UUuurrrppp! there!\" Telma addressed some Hylian soldiers who were standing nearby, bringing her more food to cram in her gob<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you *Mmph* geh fuh fanse *Snarf slurp* make an express order for more food when youuuUUUURRrrrpppp!! get back on duty!\" Telma demanded as she greedily fed herself more and more, her clothes ripping and tearing at any given possibility as her bulk continued to ooze and escape from its confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei wiped her mouth as she found herself drooling as she stared at Telma's wondrous, blubbery bulk, her ponderous rear which stretched her pants taut and wobbled at even slight movements and, of course, her sizable, round and soft breasts which bounced as she moved to grab more food, noisily eating and stuffing herself. Telma seemed lazier too as her eyes were closed and uncaring and she had leaned herself against the bar as she ate, as if standing took too much effort, which may not have been too untrue for her with her bulk and the lethargy resulting from eating so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the guards left, intimidated by Telma's glare to bring in more orders of food for her, they could still hear the sound of Telma's ravenous eating and consuming. She began to pop open bottles of milk she had brought in from faraway ranches. She carelessly poured each glass bottle into her mouth, allowing it to flow over her plump lips and fat face as she drank heartily, belching loudly after each bottle and even blowing white milk bubbles out of her mouth as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei approached Telma with her usual calm demeanor, but she was shaken mentally by Telma's appearance. She was so big...and so soft and round looking. And while her slobbish behavior was, of course, annoying and grated on her ears and made her want to slap Telma in the face for eating so loudly as well as wasting so much food, it started to grow on her. Sort of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, the serious black haired girl crossed her arms and stared Telma right in the eyes as best she could while the bar maid's head was thrown back and she shoved food and drink into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuurrrrpp!! Ashei, what are you *hic* doing? Why aren't you feeding me too while you can?\" Telma asked as she took a small break from her gluttony soley to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei stared at Telma with cold eyes, arms crossed and a serious, stoic expression on her face as she tapped her foot. Telma took this as impatience, but it was actually nervousness on Ashei's part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't mind you...getting fatter.\" Ashei said. \"But...try to have some manners about it. You're supposed to be a woman of taste and class last I recalled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelma took a second to let it all sink it. Her mouth stretched into a wide smile across her fat face and she laughed heartily, accidentally interrupting herself with a belch as she rubbed her fuller, rounder belly. Her posture as she leaned back against the bar became different, more relaxed. From a certain perspective, it could also be seen as seductive as well, her belly arched slightly forward along with her hips, accentuating her round, large breasts and her butt squishing against the counter, even oozing over the top slightly due to the impressive girth of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're bothering to only chide me about my manners, I guess you don't mind this woman's got more meat on her bones~?\" Telma teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei was glad she couldn't ever remember the last time she blushed because she felt inclined to do so at this moment. Telma stared at her eyes, smirking as she looked at Ashei studiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again...\"<br>\r\n\"</span></div></div>",

Ashei had spent the entire night stuffing the barmaid, and managed to at least double her weight overnight. There was no way Telma could stand at this point, let alone walk, her tremendous bulk pinning her to the floor. Her belly was splayed out in front of her, forcing her gigantic thighs as far apart as possible, and her massive butt piled up behind her. Unsurprisingly her chest had absorbed a significant amount of the weight, and drooped down the sides of her paunch onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Uuuuurrp* \"Guhhhh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelma closed her eyes and moaned as her fat fingers fondled the sides of her gut, relieving a bit of the tension in it, and then opened them back up when she heard the front door open. In came Ashei carrying a stack of crates, followed by several soldiers carrying crates as well. Placing them on the ground, Ashei took out her wallet and paid a few rupees to each of the soldiers for their help. Ripping open one of the crates, she took out a gallon of milk and brought it over to Telma, pressing it to her lips without even asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelma struggled to keep up with the flowing milk, chugging it as fast as she could, and then gasped for breath once it finally emptied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Huff* *Huff* \"What are youuuuuuuuuu... doinghg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelma's belch made Ashei giggle. \"I got you some more food and drink so we can pick up where we left off.\" She stated bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Huff* \"Don't you... *Huff* thinkh I've... had enougggh... *Huff* for awhilgh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat around Telma's face was making it harder to speak, causing her to slur her words. Her voice had also gotten deeper as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei frowned at Telma. \"Oh come on, you could get so much bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to Telma and began playing with her breasts. Telma moaned as Ashei kneaded her flesh, he body sore all over from growing so big so fast. Her cheeks partially blocked her vision, but she could see the look of pleasure on Ashei's face as she explored every inch of the massive woman's body. Suddenly she turned her face to Telma's and put on her best puppy dog face. \"Come on! Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelma already felt more full than she'd ever felt in her life.

She had hidden it so well all this time, but there was no reason now it seemed, especially given the circumstance. She nodded, acknowledging what Telma was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...how about we work out a deal?\" Telma mused with a catty stare as she further leaned against the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about if you feed me, I'll let you fuck me right here, over this counter, good and hard to your heart's content.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei stared stoically at Telma, her face red in contrast with her expression. Without a work of acknowledgement or protest or anything, Ashei slowly undressed in front of Telma. She took off her uniform slowly as Telma stuffed her mouth, burping as she observed Ashei save her panties for last, kicking them off and revealing a sizable futa dick. It was a rather meaty one indeed, standing at 12 inches fully erect, thick and throbbing with large and smooth balls backed up and swollen with the woman's seed, ready to spend and push it all inside of Telma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelma could feel herself drooling as she stared at Ashei's cock, leaning against the bar and hastily pulling her tight pants off of her large lower body, packed in tightly from all its thick, fat splendor. Ashei leaned in, grabbing Telma's fat, perky breasts as she thrust her hard, bulging cock inside Telma's fat snatch, making the bar maid moan and belch as she felt the throbbing organ inside her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned, blushing as she continued to stuff her mouth full of food as best she could while Ashei enthusiastically thrust into her hard, Telma moaning and belching as she was fucked, drool pouring from her mouth as she ate and rode Ashei's massive cock as best she could stand do, her language reduced to erotic moaning and panting, coupled with gasps for air and belched from each and every thrust as she stuffed her mouth full of food, her form expanding with more fat as Ashei leaned against her, her lithe body squishing against Telma's fat, blubbery form as she grew, making Telma sink in further as the extra fat caused Telma's juicy pussy to become tighter and softer, making Ashei tilt her head back and moan as she fucked Telma harder and harder, making the gluttonous barmaid belch louder with each thrust while she desperately gripped at the bar behind her began to groan supporting the two weights, one slowly growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SNAP!* \"UUUUUURRRrrrrrppp!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the bar to give out, below Telma, snapping in two as she fell on the ground, Ashei with her as they fucked. Telma's blubbery body only helped to act as padding to prevent injury and the impact made her belch loudly in Ashei's face, blowing her partner's hair back as she picked up the wood that had broken off and stuffed it in her mouth, eating whatever was closest in her mindless state of euphoria as she felt her muscles tense up inside her from all the pleasure. Her loins began to ache for release, making Telma feel as if she would explode any moment when Ashei finally came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GOOAAAAAAHHHHH-<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">BBBBBBBBUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRPPP!!!</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelma screamed at the top of her lungs like a demon as she felt the hot cum pass through inside her and finally found release as her orgasm pounded through, making her eyes roll back partially, Telma's tongue flopping out of her mouth as she drooled and belched profusely, her muscles tensed as much as possible as Telma reflexively balled her fat hands into fists as she felt the release of orgasm and Ashei's cum passing through her sweaty body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelma reeked of lust and meat and milk as she laid back on what was left of that section of the bar, Ashei laying on top of her as she blushed and panted, looking down at Telma's fat, tired face with lustful eyes. Ashei leaned down, kissing Telma on the lips, but pulled back as the tired Telma belched down her throat, causing Ashei to find energy enough to cough and sputter as she spat to the side, tasting something strange and foul in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw for the love-! You're brushing your teeth if we ever want to kiss me again-with great fairy's spring water too at that!\" Ashei barked as the blush on her face intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelma only let out an amused laugh, slapping her belly and watching it jiggle. Ashei sighed, not denying the sight of Telma's wobbling blubber presented an...intriguing sight. She felt her shaft rise with blood filling the shaft in arousal as she stared. Sighing, Ashei decided to make the most of her situation, taking her dick as it grew erect and rubbing it along Telma's blubbery belly, sliding it in and out of fat rolls and even sliding it between Telma's breasts, making the bar maid smile, laugh and moan lightly as she enjoyed Ashei's thick cock run along her body, gasping in joy as she felt it slide down inside of her navel. As Ashei played around, she giggled as she leaned forward and stuck her head between Telma's fat breasts, motorboating Telma's fat chest and then, as she pulled her head back, Telma could only laugh in amusement as she saw a cut of meat hanging from Ashei's mouth. Continuing to play around, Ashei munched it down, feeling genuinely like she could use some food after a nice romp, eating that cut down rather quickly for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp! Heh, not bad.\" Ashei said aloud to herself in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelma laughed again, but as Ashei kissed Telma's fat belly and rubbed her erect dick against her thick thighs...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashei paused as she stopped playfully rubbing her cock against the inside of Telma's thighs. She could have sword she felt something, like a bump of some kind on the inside. No, no that couldn't have been. However, as she looked on, Telma seemed to be moaning, her expression one of discomfort it seemed as she grit her teeth, her face flushed as the barmaid panted and sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's...what's wrong?\" Ashei queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...knooooUUUURRRRPPP!! I...augh BBUUURRP! What's happening?\" Telma moaned out between belches, her blubbery, food-stained belly rising and falling with her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Ashei felt whatever this...thing was rise up further. It was long and thick and began to push up against Ashei's cock before she moved back a little. Ashei looked on in shock as she realized what it was; a fat futa cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow or why, she couldn't say, but she looked on in awe as Telma's impressive dick grew out longer and thicker, surpassing Ashei's in no time. The massive member stood at attention with its fully erect shaft pointed up towards the ceiling, thwacking against the underside of Telma's fat belly. Telma cooed as she felt the arousal resulting in her new dick and the hormones that came with it, rubbing her belly with one hand and her cock with the other, biting her lip as she enjoyed how sensitive it felt to the touch. A bit of pre-cum shot out, making Telma rasp as it fell into her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...Ashei...if this is how you feel with your 'appendage' then it seems you live a rather blessed life~\" Telma purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei sighed, showing little reaction in regards to Telma's comment. Instead, she decided to try a neat trick she always wanted to do with another futa. She pulled Telma's dick downwards like a lever, making Telma moan and giggle between burps and belches as she wondered what was coming. Pressing her upper body down onto the shaft to keep it down, Ashei bucked her hips forward, thrusting her dick inside of Telma's dick hole. Telma cried out in bliss as pain and pleasure mixed in a wonderful combination through her body and mind as Ashei plowed her cock inside of Telma's, making the barmaid clench her fists as every muscle in her body tightened up one by one. She moaned aloud, holding onto Ashei's hips with her plump hands, moaning and belching each time Ashie's hips bucked forth, thrusting her cock and and out of Telma's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long, much shorter than even Telma would have expected actually, for those Hyrulian guards to arrive. The brought crates loaded with food, loading it inside. However, there was that awkward moment when they brought the first few in, only to observe the sight of Telma getting her thick futa dick fucked by Ashei. Telma's only response?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you standing there when there's still food to BBBRRAAAAUUUUUUURRPP!!! Bring in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelma didn't even bother asking Ashei to feed her this time. The feeling of having her dick fucked was too sublime to interrupt. She merely took to messily shoving food inside of her own mouth, new fat pouring forth as she stuffed her mouth and belched, bits of food falling onto her form and getting caught between the sticky food and cum stained folds of her belly and her deep cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long, however, for an idea to click in Telma's head. She pat Ashei on the back as a symbol for her to stop. Ashei, feeling a bit confused and disappointed, did so, pulling her dick out of Telma's. Then, something she never would have expected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelma took her much larger dick and thrust it inside of Ashei's! Even though Telma's was much larger and had grown along with her as the nearly blobby woman only continued to feast and gain. Ashei groaned and screamed as her dick bulged and swelled from Telma sticking her member inside, feeling pain and pleasure electrify her body as Telma continued only to fuck and eat, fat piling onto her form as she continued to swell outwards and started breaking the rest of the bar nearby. Ashei groaned, unable to say anything as the speech centers of her brain were shut down by the overload of pain and pleasure as she could only cry and scream and moan, furiously grasping at Telma's cock and squeezing it in her hands as the furious passion inside her demanded that her companion cum inside of her this instant! Telma groaned louder, bits of food falling into her new fourth chin, as Ashei grasped and rubbed up and down Telma's shaft, as if pleasing through her body language for the lusty barmaid to finally cum. Ashei, however, didn't wait much longer to get her wish as Telma pushed her thick and copious seed inside of her, Ashei gasping, then screaming and wailing as pleasure overtook her, a blissfully rapt orgasm washing through her body and pleasure flooding her brain, making her eyes roll back partway as she came alongside Telma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBBUUUUURRRRPPP!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelma belched loudly after her own orgasm, panting and huffing as sweat rolled down her flabby, bulbous body. She took her new cock in both hands, pulling it slowly out of Ashei's, making her tired companion groan and moan as it slid out, Telma's dick wearing a sleek coat of Ashei's seed mixed with her own. Ashei fell on her back, landing on the floor as she panted and breathed heavily, sweat rolling down her brow as her heart raced and her flushed face burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing...\" Was all Ashei could process saying for the moment.</span></div></div>",

Telma, having noticed while she was being fed by the somewhat turned on, somewhat puzzled, and mostly intimidated soldiers,  congratulated her new lover. \"Well...looks like you're starting *gulp* to take *slurp* after me.\"<br>\r\n\"D-don't praise me for that, honestly you might be a humongous and...beautiful slob of a woman, but I still want to hold some of dignity.\" And is fate itself said \"Screw you Ashei\" she began to feel an odd sensation in herself all over. \"Uggh...what is this sensation?\" Ashei grabbed hold of her midsection as the describable feeling surged through her. Feeling herself grow heavy, she began to see her outfit strain and momentarily cause pain as it tightened on her body before ripping all over. \"Ahh!\" Ashei gasped as she saw herself getting fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale woman moaned as her body grew and grew all over, her breasts, which had always been on the small side, now were expanding quickly to the point of being nearly bigger then her head. Her belly was developing several rolls and increased in size till it touched the floor as she was sitting upright, her belly button began to become deep and cavernous unlike Telma's. By now she was completely naked, though to stunned by what was occurring to try and cover up. Her ass grew into two enormous cheeks,growing to push up her body slightly as they expanded more and more. After a few moments, with Telma having demanded one of the soldiers jerk her off as she ate and watched this event unfold, Ashei has ended her sudden gain weighing in at a good 540lbs. Still smaller then Telma but rather close behind, her cock had also undergone a gain, having grown to 17 inches at its hardest, though still smaller then Telma's behemoth of 26 inches.<br>\r\n\"What...how...did this happen?\" Ashei said she placed her thicker hands on her chubbier cheeks and her bountiful belly folds. <br>\r\n\"UUUURRRRPPPP!!!! I think my newfound dick's cum may have had something to do with it.\" Telma belched heartily as she was nearly finished eating what the soldiers had brought to her, which normally would've been enough to feed a normal amount of patrons at the bar for a week.<br>\r\n\"Yeah maybe....but through MY dick?!\" Ashei was astounded at this bizarre turn of events. Getting herself up she waddled over to Telma and shooed off the solders with a wave of her meaty hand. They, not wanting to really take part in this absolutely bizarre scenario bolted it out from the establishment.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing girl?\" Telma asked as Ashei sat her huge ass down on the floor, somehow where in the bar they could hear the surprised shriek of Telma's cat Louise who had been awoken from a deep slumber by the sudden rumbling in the floor. <br>\r\n\"I need to confirm this thought of yours.\" as she said this, Ashei took hold of Telma's dick and began to suck it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasure was great, to feel Ashei's warm, moist lips around immense shaft, it made Telma's flab undulate as she rocked slightly from the exuberant feelings of her blowjob. Ashei, honestly enjoying the moment, took hold of her own dick and jerked it off, pointing it somewhere at Telma's face or belly. \"Ohhh goddUUUURRRPPPPPesses of Hyrule, I'm gonna blow my load if you...keep...doing...UURGGRHHHH!!!\" At that moment, the large dark skinned woman blasted globs of her thick seed down the other woman's throat. <br>\r\n\"Bllrggh!\" Ashei nearly choked, having not been focusing on expecting Telma to release so early, she spat out the cock and coughed up a bit of cum. Swallowing the rest, she blew her own load right into Telma's own mouth and she swallowed the resulting blast as well.<br>\r\n\"...Well now we wait.\" Ashei said as she wiped off her lips, trying to retain her stoic demeanor.<br>\r\n\"Hmm? But it was so tasty Ashei! Don't you want to get fatter alongside me?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course I do!\" she blurted out, embarrassing herself by admitting this so quickly. \"I-I mean I think we make a nice pair...and you don't think any differently of me even though I'm a hermaphrodite. But I just want to see what caused my weight gain, that  way we can really go about this thing with us in a decent way.\" <br>\r\n\"Whatever you say honey.\" Telma smirked as rubbed her gargantuan gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, both of the woman began to feel a similar sensation.<br>\r\n\"I think this is it!\" Telma cheerfully said as her dick grew hard, anticipating what was possibly about to unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ashei groaned, her face turning red as she massaged her gurgling belly. It'd be easier to steel herself if she wasn't bugged by Telma's erect cock pointing right at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei knew she and Telma would get fatter, that their dicks would grow bigger, that Telma would get aroused and likely fuck and eat whatever was closest, maybe even both at the same damn time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could never, however, have ever anticipated the magnitude of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took mere moments before Ashei and Telma's bodies started to explode outwards with fat pouring on. The two squished together, fat slapping together as their growing forms oozed against one another, fat squishing between one another's folds as their fatty breasts pushed together and squished as they grew and grew. Their size made them sensitive, making Ashei bite down on her lip and moan as she blushed and Telma's cock rubbed around inside of her deepening, cavernous navel. Telma drooled and belched up a storm, feeling positively ecstatic about her gaining as she and Ashei began to press against the walls and ceiling with their combined blobby bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOHHH IN THE <b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">BBBBUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPP!!!!</font></b> NAME OF THE GODDESSES THIS <b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">BBBBUUUUUUURRRRPPPP!!!</font></b> IS...INCREDIBLE!!\" Telma cried in absolute glee and pleasure, her face flushed red as she panted and sweat from just how incredible the gaining sensation was for her. Her pulsating, swelling dick fired off cum in a constant stream, filling up Ashei's deep navel with ease as globs of cum splashed out of Ashei and into both women's folds. Ashei also found herself shamelessly cumming hard, only her dick carelessly sprayed her seed all over Telma's blubbery belly, filling her folds up and splashing against her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei felt the bar struggle to contain the two of them, heard the walls groan and creak, heard wood snap and splinter, felt boards and beams snap and bits of wood fall in her back folds, the same happening to Telma. Ashei knew the bar would be unable to hold the two of them much longer, and ordinarily she would have been worried and concerned. But for now, she focused only on the pleasure of the pleasant moment she was currently experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may have thought otherwise if she were, to some degree, clairvoyant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer and Telma's gain did not just stop with the Bar. Not by a long shot. The two got so careless their constant ejaculations started to spray and find their way inside one another's mouths, which only kick-started more and more gaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two swelled out to an insane degree! People ran for cover as the two blubbery futanari women spread out, coating more and more of the city with their bountiful, bulbous bodies. The two of them engulfed more and more under their blubbery bodies and folds. Buildings disappeared underneath as those who ran for the hills could see the pair of Ashei and Telma rise and spread with more creamy, soft fat as their raging, erect cocks rose high. Telma was facing an issue, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her growing and covering buildings with her fat wasn't a bad thing. In fact, she thought it was the best thing to ever happen in her life. It was less pleasant to experience it with a massive slab of wood jammed up her dickhole. Telma's cock swelled around as her balls pumped and churned more and more cum, with no way to release. Telma wailed in desperation as she struggled to whack off her raging, pulsing and swollen cock, her balls rising under her belly as the rest of her body, combined with Ashei, had already engulfed the city a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei noticed Telma's plight and took a much more direct approach. She shoved her hand up Telma's dickhole as best she could, reaching deep into Telma's urethra and reaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop squirming! I'm gonna...get it if you just...augh, stop fidgeting so much!\" Ashei scolded as she reached further with her puffy, thick arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grasped the wood plank, pulling it out as slowly as she could, but as she finally got her arm out, an explosion of cum burst from out of Telma's dick!! Cum flooded under them as Telma moaned and belched loudly, her language degraded only to those two verbal actions as she came and came and came! Cum flooded under the two of them, spreading out under as the town, not only trapped under their flab, but now was flooded with Telma's thick, milky white seed, flowing out into the surrounding water supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBBUUUUURRRRRRRPPP!!! Oh my...aaahhh~ It...that was...\" Telma could only pant and moan as she mindlessly rubbed and stroked her cock in her afterglow, a bit of cum still drooling lazily from the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshei sighed, placing her arms against her amorously wide, fat hips.</span></div></div>",

The people greeted her happily as she passed by, smiling at her and waving hello. She would look them right in the eyes and smile back. It was hard to believe that recently this place had been coated in Twilight, the people trapped within and turned to wisps. If it wasn't for the skills and luck of Link as well as his partner, Midna, the whole town may have been lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, now that things were back to normal there were...other concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf late, there seemed to be a rampant penchant around Hyrule for women to suddenly gain massive amounts of weight, finding themselves pumped full of so much fat they shouldn't even have been able to move. Lately, it seemed apparent that, according to public opinion, quite a number of people seemed to actually be, at the least, neutral to the growing number of fat women in Hyrule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Zelda though of this, she saw a woman pass by who must have been over 800lbs, at the least. Her blubbery body jiggled and wobbled as she walked, showing off her luscious, fat breasts that were bigger than her head by several sizes and, as she passed by, Zelda peeked back at her jiggling, round fat ass jutting out quite a ways from the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda could only sigh. It was puzzling, but something had stirred inside her as well. Considering the large influx of enlarged waistlines among women, Zelda's curiosity had been piqued. She wondered what it would be like for her to get fat herself, to become so large and endowed like so many others. She didn't mind the thought at all, wondering however just how she would get so big...</span></div></div>",

The water flowed from the head at the top from four square holes inside into the base below, with vines snaking around it. This fountain had been around for as long as Zelda could remember, but the townspeople always refused to drink from it at all. It was said the water was, in some way, magically enchanted to change those who drank it. True, Zelda had no reason to question this with the presence and prevalence of fairies, but the brunette princess felt a natural curiosity worm through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up slowly, taking in a deep sigh. If the people avoided drinking from this fountain in so long, perhaps there must have been something to it. Zelda reached in the base of the fountain, cupping her gloved hands and scooping up water in them, bringing them to her lips and sipping up as much as she could before it escaped past her fingers. The water had an odd, natural sweetness to it and an astounding natural clarity. Zelda felt a bit better drinking that water, feeling a sudden warmth in her body...and an odd tightness in her dress that became more and more prevalent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looked down, placing a hand on her stomach as she felt it grow under her dress! Her belly became large and plump right in front of her as it grew along with her breasts, which started to become larger and fuller as they found more fat added to them. Her rear could be felt growing against her dress as well, raising the skirt of her dress. She looked down at her fat, full body and her soft curves, feeling the fat squish between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...wonderful...\" Zelda said to herself, smiling as she felt her new fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided she wanted more<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda dipped her face down into the water, her hair falling forward and dipping into the water slightly and began to drink straight from the well. Her body blew up like a massive balloon as more fat was packed onto her body. It only took moments for the Princess's dress to rip off from the massive amount of fat piling into her body. She started looking bulbous and blubbery, her body fat spilling onto the paved stone street. Her legs became thick and doughy, squishing together while her fat ass bubbled behind her, looking like two massive pumpkins while her breasts continued to billow forth with more fat, by now reaching twice the size of Zelda's head while her apron-like belly squished against the base of the fountain and against the street as well with its growing mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm~\" Zelda moaned audibly as she hefted her still swelling fat tits in her hands, her doughy arms squishing against her corpulent belly. \"This feels so goood...maybe if I have a bit more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin formed on Zelda's fat face as she waddled up over the base, her fat legs displacing water in the fountain and making it splash out. She got up to the fountainhead as best she could, squishing her fat tits against it and grabbing it like a pole. She leaved up against it with her head, then began to drink the water as it flowed right from the source. Zelda moaned in bliss as she felt the water flow into her mouth, her body exploding with new fat. Zelda felt herself blow up outwards as she felt herself double, maybe even triple, in size within only moments. She just moaned and kept drinking and drinking, feeling her fat tits blow out in front of her, making her moan and making her loins feel wet. Her ass soon grew with enough fat and fullness that it began to press up against a nearby building as her blubbery self grew to be large enough to be the size of a house in almost no time at all, her belly cascading outwards with it's massive blubbery girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, greedy Zelda wanted even more fat, she wanted to be even bigger. So, she ripped the fountain out of the ground. Water sprayed forth violently from the hole she made as she pried the relic out with her large, fat arms and she lowered her face forward as she greedily gulped the water down, moaning and even belching as she felt the water spray up into her mouth and down her throat as her body only grew further and further. Citizens of Castle Town watched in awe as their Princess grew outwards, her fat starting to engulf some of the buildings surrounding her magnificent, flawless, alabaster bulk.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In Hylrue Castle Town, a party was being thrown of epic proportions. Distinguished guest after distinguished guest made their way in, to the awe of the masses congregated to see the event. There were lights, music, colour, and practically everybody of any sort of significance was invited; it was the place to be. As each couple started to dance, in their own distinct way, you couldn't help but watch in amazement. They were all decked out in their finest attire, glittering almost as if made of a rich gold material. Even as the guest numbers started to reach into the thousands, the host of this grand event was hardly phased at managing the location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only her house for starters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgitha sighed as she saw couple after couple of exotic insects flitter, crawl and jump together. It'd taken awhile, but after (someone else's) hard work, she'd finally managed to hold her ball afterall. She strolled around, minding not to tread on any of her esteemed guests, and eyed each one. She even occasionally stopped to ask each couple if they were enjoying themselves; taking a simple nod of the small bug's head as answer enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was aware that few of these bugs had much hope of surviving out in the real world (or making it out of the market before getting swatted or stomped on), so she took it upon herself to keep them in her 'castle'. Tiring a bit after so much dancing (by herself), she opened one of her favorite books; the Encyclopedia on Insects. Opening on a random page, she was greeted with a beautiful illustration of a butterfly, its wings made of a rich jade and black pattern. Sighing at its beauty, she suddenly realized that this insect was at her ball right now. She started to daze off distantly as she saw it flutter around gracefully, only snapping out of it when she realized she'd only looked at the sketch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what it says here...\" She mused to herself. When there were any scientific facts she only half-understood, she simply flicked back to a funny picture. This butterfly in particular was from a rather round and stout caterpillar. She giggled at its appearance, and started to read on how it evolved into such a beautiful creature. Some common mention of a caccoon, its habitat... Yet what truely got her attention was its diet. \"... It increases its weight by 5,000 times before going into that caccoon?\" She looked up and wondered. Agitha was definitely 'out there', but she wasn't stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerely disadvantaged due to a lack of a proper education. \"Oh... That's... Interesting.\" Quickly standing up, she dashes to her chest of draws and opens one, meeting the glitter of several million Rupees. Nobody was really sure where she'd gotten them from, but it explained her eccentric and indulgent lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started to leave, she called out to the thousand or so bugs. \"Everyone! I'm off to the market! Soon I'll be able to play as one of you!\" She giggled, and shut the door before strolling off into the open air of Hylrue Market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though what to try first...\"</span></div></div>",

The smell of roasting meat and fresh produce was in the air, and Agitha's mouth started to water just a bit; but she knew what she <i>really</i> wanted, and felt that she'd be all the better for it than binging on what was healthy, yet perhaps not in the army-sized servings she had in mind. She strode out of the other side and into the main plaza. Energy efficient stuff like meat and vegetables wasn't going to help her increase her weigh 5,000 times fold after all! Or atleast, not as much as what she was about to get her maws into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning into an alleyway and sliding along the narrow brick walls that encapsulated it, she found a small doorway. She snuck in without another soul to see her, and found herself in a dusty store room. Though she knew very well where she was. Sliding along side the walls until she made her way to the slightly open door, she peeked out. Not a soul in the store, and she could clearly make out a padlock on the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best thing about sneaking into Hylrue's largest confectionery store on today of all days?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wouldn't be anybody to discover her for at least another three days due to the long weekend, and even then the owner of the store had a reputation for rarely opening. It was the perfect spot for Agitha to... Erm, bloom into a 'butterfly'.</span></div></div>",

She gave a nod of dignified approval to the store in general, as she delicately lifted up a small round chocolate, unwrapped it with a great sense of ceremony, and placed it daintily in her mouth. She chewed it slowly, lovingly, with great care. Then, once the wonderful taste had fully saturated her taste buds, she swallowed it, and then exhaled a little sigh of enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat chocolate was the last piece of candy that day to be given anywhere near that level of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her little opening event, she danced around the store like a dervish, strewing empty wrappers and boxes around like rubble from a tornado. Cookie after mint after jellybean after caramel apple after candy cane was grabbed with a theatrical whirl, and brought with haste to Agitha's mouth. She skipped off towards the rock candy, she leaped, ballet-like, to the taffy. She had no prejudice, every sweet treat one more little piece of her dream, all being brought together inside her. She ate the cotton candy like it was made of magical clouds, she ate the gingerbread men like a monster attacking a village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, the chocolate. The chocolate. The chocolate! Oh, my, the chocolate! Every shape, every size, ever variety, every possible filling! She was deliriously, ecstatically lost in a sugary heaven of tasty delights.</span></div></div>",

Yet damn if she wasn't enjoying herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a large hand-full of oozing cookie dough shoved into her mouth, a small rip could be heard; part of her dress started to tear under the pressure of her rapidly growing boobs. At what seemed more like a mad lunge than what was meant to be a leap to a pile of milky marshmallows, her socks started to split at her thunderous thighs outwards thrust. And with flat out giving up the pseudo-Swan Princess act, she shoved her mouth into tub after tub of ice cream, each one fashioned after the calorific candy she'd just been gorging on. Her belly pratically exploded out of her top like a dam bursting with blubbery goodness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, she hesitated and looked down at her self. There was no way she was 'pudgy'... Agitha was flat out fat, her legs taking the brunt of the gain. With a twirl, she watched as her legs jiggled away with the slightest amount of movement, parts of her clothing continuing to give way as her body continued to go full-steam ahead with its gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say the least in her eyes, she was doing pretty well for only starting a couple hours ago. Revving up her digestive engines, she went back into destroying everything in sight with her unsatisfiable mouth, pausing only to admire her own handwork on her body. 'Heh, caterpillars don't even look half this good before the cacoon process!' she thought to herself in-between shoving entire rolls of liquorice swirls into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne would think that after a few hours and a few hundred pounds, somebody like Agitha would've already lost patience at how slow it was taking to...

I need much, much more! I'm nowhere near big enough yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'mean...you want to get fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. To become a butterfly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I won't pretend to understand what you mean by that, but listen. I really have no idea whether I should be telling you this, but...well, I've got something that might interest you. Y'see, these days, candy's just made either the old-fashioned way, by hand, or the new way, with machines. But for awhile, there was what we in the business call...The Golden Age of Candy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Golden Age of Candy!\" Agitha repeated, entranced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yeah. That. It was called that because some truly bold new attempts at candy-making were being attempted. Some folks even hired wizards, witches, and magicians to add some special mojo to their goods. What resulted were the most delicious...but also most unstable...candies ever made. Some were so delicious that no other taste would ever even register for the rest of the eater's life. Many had a taste so powerful that the flavor linger in mouths months, sometimes years after the candy was eaten. But these candies also came with risks and side-effects. And among the havoc that some of these forbidden candies caused was...well, they made people really, really fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgitha's eyes widened, and her smile grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, girl, just as these candies held more flavor than one could expect to experience in an entire lifetime of normal eating, they also held more calories, too. People ballooned into blobs of flab in the course of a single snack. And, of course, most people thought that the taste just wasn't worth that, so candy-making began to kick the magic elements out. But many still research and collect samples from those crazy times, and I myself am one such historian. I have, in my collection, one of those enchanted sweets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I habftiankf--... Agitha's sentence deteriorated as the saliva her mouth had been building up throughout the man's story came pouring out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem...\" she began again \"...may I have it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may.\" the owner said dramatically \"One two conditions. One, you pay me for all the candy you ate. Two, you promise to eat this away from my store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, girl, there's a good chance you'd outgrow the building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgitha did a heavy little dance of excitement. She would soon be well on her way to butterfly-hood!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Agitha walked out onto the main square of Hylrue Town, looking into a small paper bag, which contained a candy which seemed to pratically radiate its sweetness, with giddy excitement. This was going to be her special day, where she finally placed a foot firmly towards achieving ultimate beauty, wisdom and the freedom of flight which all butterflies were entitled to. She wasn't exactly sure of the science behind her idea, but she knew in her feeling that something BIG was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if it didn't, she'd swiped several handfuls more of the stuff behind the old owner's back just in case the maths didn't add up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter building up the suspense for herself, which amounted to madly giggling as onlookers questioned the sanity of the brightly colored girl, she took a single candy with great anticipation and placed it on her tongue to savor the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't any taste. She licked around for a bit, tried chewing a bit, tried taking it out and eying it a bit, but no-matter what she did, the only thing noteworthy about it was how UN-noteworthy it was. Well, it was a bit weird that it literally didn't have a taste, but other than that, Agitha felt gipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why isn't anything happening? Should I try another?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly shoved another few in her mouth and waited, only to find the same result. Pouting and stomping her feet, Agitha stormed back into the candy store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir?! You're candy isn't making me a buuuutterfly yet!\" She yelled angrily, before the owner came rushing to the front with an expression of panic. \"Oh dear, I forgot to tell you kid; it takes a few minutes to work. You haven't... A-hem, you haven't eaten anymore than one, have you?\" Agitha gave him a blank expression. \"Oh. Excuse me just quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly darting back out of the store, she rushed back to the middle of the square to cause a minimal amount of property damage as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely made it half-way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was quickly running, she suddenly felt her legs unable to move; she looked down and with a cute smile witnessed them shoot outwards, quickly forcing down her stockings until they outright burst through them sans near her shoes, her feet submerged in a sea of pillow-y white flab. While her leg's continued to widen, Agitha looked behind herself to witness her butt quickly growing, to the point where her dress was hitched up and didn't even cover a tenth of the massive crack which had been formed by Agitha's mountainous rump, which quivered and jiggled at the slightest provocation. Amidst all this her thighs were quickly taking over half of the square, the normal towns folk running for dear life from the all-consuming bug girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grinned at the developments in the lower sections of her body, she craned her neck to see her stomach oozing outwards for meters on end, forcibly separating the tree-trunks she had for legs and rushing in-between them like a gushing river of flesh-colored ChuChu. It already draped over her tremendous legs, yet the slight amount of stocking material covering her legs helped anybody who cared enough to differentiate the two bodies from one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying on top of this erupting stomach were a pair of continuously ballooning breasts, which while forcing her entire dress up to her neck (which was by now entirely consumed by a dozen chins and shoulder flab) were completely and utterly exposed, her huge nipples exposed for anybody who again felt like looking at the mountain of jiggly flesh which was quickly enveloping the center of town in its own girth. Agitha's arms had virtually no mobility; she was free to wiggle her plump hands and fingers, yet they too lay deep within the confines of her bloated arm fat. At the top of all this like the cherry on top was Agitha's bloated, beaming face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, this feels absolutely wonderful! No wonder caterpillars always seem so eager to plump-up before their cocoon stage!\" She lightly giggled to herself, slightly purring as she felt street lamps and the fountain crumble beneath the vast ocean of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, from the (relative) safety of the castle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we being attacked!?!\" Zelda demanded, rushing over to the nearest guard to amass what the heck was going on outside. \"Is the Twilight back!? Is the kingdom on fire!? ARE WE IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY!?!\" Zelda screamed, displaying what few members of the public got to see; complete and total incompetency. The guard she was raving at quickly jumped back at the princess' confrontation. \"No! Well, maybe... Eh... We don't exactly know what it is yet. But it's... Big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess calmed herself a bit and sat back on the throne. \"Oh, well that's good then. If whatever it is hasn't made a declaration of war yet then somebody else try and snag a peace treaty out of it. God wars are complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particular descendant didn't exactly get the significance of the Triforce of Wisdom, and promptly hocked it out of her system and sold it to the highest paying bidder to buy herself a new luxurious bedroom and play room. More likely Ganondorf's possession of her included forcing her to sell her single greatest weapon for the dumbest of reasons to ensure the mindless-ness in the princess, but whatever the reason this Zelda had gone from wisest of the land to completely and utterly shallow. And fairly air-headed to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness, we don't even know if this thing is human... Even if it doesn't mean any harm, it's going to trap us under its weight the minute we approach it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah. I'll handle it while you go prepare some lunch; I'll show you how a diplomat handles a crisis!\" She strolled off with an aura of superiority (which came across to everyone else as misguided arrogance), and approached the towering castle doors... Only to be sent flying backwards across the velvet carpet as part of the pasty blob slithered through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww... Right then, there's only one thing I can do in a situation like this people!\" Zelda boldy exclaimed as lifted a sword into the air to strike a dramatic pose.</span></div></div>",

The blinds were closed, the padlock secure, and not a living creature was in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving confirmed that she was alone, Agitha exited the back room. She lit a lamp on the front desk, and her jaw dropped when the contents of the store were brought to light. The ceiling was a good eleven feet high, and the walls were covered in shelves that reached all the way to the top. Each level was stuffed with a wide variety of boxes, containers and miscellaneous baggies full of various goodies. On the floor there was were several large chilled vats wider and taller than Agitha herself that probably contained ice cream. She realized she was beginning to drool, and shook herself. She had all of the long weekend to try everything out, so there was no need to go overboard all at once. Besides that, might make her sick, and then she couldn't complete her metamorphosis into a beautiful butterfly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to the center of the store and turned around a couple times. There was just so much to choose from! Her stomach growled and she bit her lip. What should she try first?  </span></div></div>",

She began scooping up boxes of chocolate and when her arms were full, she sat down on her knees right where she was and began to tear the first one open. It contained 36 Deluxe Choco-Caramel Bars, which gave off such an alluring scent Agitha ripped open the first and began munching on it without a second thought. Once she had eaten through three of the bars, she realized she had eaten them too fast to even really taste the chocolate. She carefully unwrapped the fourth and considered it briefly. She lifted it up to her mouth and gave it a tentative lick. The chocolate was so sweet on her tongue. . . She licked it again. And again. She began to suck on the candy bar, letting the rich chocolate melt in her mouth. Agitha caressed the chocolate with her tongue softly, her eyes closed in bliss. She gave it another tender suck when the inner caramel was revealed. When the taste of the caramel hit Agitha's tastebuds, her eyes flew open. It was better than anything she had ever tasted! Instantly she shoved the rest of the bar into her mouth, but forced herself to chew it slowly and savor all the wonderful flavors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had finished, she paused momentarily. Agitha then methodically began to unwrap each and every candy bar from every box she had gather up. She stacked them neatly in several groups and then regarded them silently. <i>This is butterfly material</i>, she thought, <i>This is what will change me</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to stuff her face with the candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, the chocolate bars were all gone. She rose to her feet, feeling a buzz of energy. She swooped along the shelves, grabbing everything that looked good. . . Which was to say, everything. She spun and swayed as the satisfying candy dropped into her eagerly awaiting mouth. Music from the town outside could be heard ever so faintly as Agitha danced around with her arms and mouth full of candies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelicious candy fruit oranges fell on her tongue, sour pieces of chewy bits were practically drunk straight out of their container, and chocolate peanut butter balls rolled into her mouth. She spun over to a crate full of huge chocolate blocks, each weighing at least two pounds and picked up three, one of which was devoured in route over to a ladder which she scaled to the top of a shelf. Agitha shoved another block in her mouth as she picked up a bag full of warm liquid caramel. She slid down the ladder, swallowed the last bit off the chocolate block and began to guzzle the soft substance out of the bag. Suppressing a petite burp, she danced over to the center of the room, where she had accumulated a rather large pile of empty wrappers and boxes, along with a mound of candy waiting to be eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crammed the third chocolate block in her mouth, chewed it up a bit, then poured the rest of the liquid caramel in after. Her tummy rumbled and she rubbed it, looking longingly at the rest of the candy. Even though she had been eating for several hours, she had barely made a dent in the supplies of the store. Smiling, she patted her stomach and considered her next move. As engaged as she was with her decision process, she did not notice how tight her dress had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgitha was happily well on her way to becoming a butterfly.</span></div></div>",

It seemed as though he had just returned from his quest to defeat Ganon and save the world, but even with the King of Evil vanquished, it seemed that his work was still unfinished...his former neighbours certainly missed him, but life went on all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, Sue-Belle was heading out on her daily task of fetching water for her grandfather Sturgeon from the creek at the top of the island, which she carried through the novel method of balancing water-filled jars on her head.  Hoping to slightly increase her carrying capacity, she had ordered some special extra-large jars from her friend on Windfall Island, capable of carrying at least twice as much water.  Walking up the hill was easy enough; she waved hello to Old Man Ho Ho, who was busy staring out to see as usual, and filled two jars, placing one atop her head and carrying the other under her arm.  However, she quickly found the jars to be a tad heavier than she was used to; understandable, given their capacity, but inconvenient all the same.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...this might be a little tougher than I thought,\" she muttered to herself, straining to keep the jar on her head aloft.  \"But no matter...it's for Grandpa; I'll make it work somehow!\"  That proved easier said than done, however, and just walking forward a few feet was was quite a chore.  She had made it to about halfway down the hill overlooking the village when the predictable finally happened, and the poor girl fell flat on her face, her two jars shattering against the ground.  \"No!  I can't believe this,\" she lamented, gazing wistfully at the puddle and assorted glass shards that used to be her two vases.  \"Great, just great...now I'm gonna have to <i>all</i> the way back to the house, fetch two more pots, run back up the hill, grab more water...ugh, there has to be an easier way to do this!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished her rant, though, an idea for a solution suddenly popped into her head.  The girl's eyes drifted toward the Forest of Fairies, across the bridge at the top of the hill.  She recalled the stories of the mysterious Great Fairy of Fortune who resided within said forest...she herself had always thought it a myth, but seeing as Link made his way over there at the height of the Ganon crisis and came back down with a real, live fairy, there simply had to be something to the rumours.  'My better judgment tells me otherwise,' she thought, making her way toward the bridge, 'But I have to at least try...for Grandpa's sake!'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, Sue-Belle headed over to the forest, wandering around for a while before finding a very large and obvious hole in the ground, surrounded by a multitude of crushed, burnt rocks that suggested the use of a Bomb to destroy some kind of obstruction in the past.  Next to it was a sign indicating the Great Fairy's presence, along with a message encouraging visitors to \"increase their fortune\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This must be the place,' she thought, staring down the deep, dark hole in front of her.  'This can't be safe...but, oh well, here goes!'  Jumping down the hole, she found herself <i>not</i> crushed against a rocky floor many feet below, as she had feared, but instead gently floating to the ground in a large, well-lit chamber, dominated by a shining fountain.  A lone fairy floating above the water spun around and seemed to explode in a cloud of coloured smoke, transforming into a radiant, four-armed Great Fairy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, traveler!\" she exclaimed, laughing heartily.  \"Have you come here to increase your fortune?  I shall be happy to--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no, not exactly...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the Great Fairy raised an eyebrow, immediately dropping her grandiose facade and asking, \"Uh, wait...really?  That's weird...most folks come by here asking to be able to carry more Rupees or something...well, in that case, what <i>do</i> you want?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue-Belle looked down at her feet for a moment, deep in thought.  \"Well,\" she began, sounding rather uneasy, \"I came here because I needed help with my daily chores, specifically carrying water down the hill...\"  The Great Fairy looked even more confused, scratching her head with one of her upper arms.  \"You see, it's become difficult for me to carry as much as I want, so I was hoping you could use your magic to make it easier...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Great Fairy raised one hand, stopping her speech momentarily. \"Okay, look, kid,\" she said, taking on an informal tone.  \"Lemme give it to ya straight...I'm a very specialised kind of Fairy, you dig?  I deal primarily with <i>monetary</i> wishes-- unless you're asking for more Rupees so you can hire off-island workers to carry your water or something, I'm not sure how much I can help...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water-bearing girl was disheartened at this.  \"But, sure, you must be able to do something for me!  You're...you're magic!  You can do anything, right?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded half-heartedly.  \"In...theory, yes...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling slightly encouraged by this, Sue-Belle turned to the Great Fairy and spoke with renewed conviction, saying, \"Okay, then!  In that case, I wish...to be, uh...bigger!  Yes, just a little bigger so I'll be strong enough to carry heavier pots of water.  Can you do that, great one?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...well...again, <i>in theory</i>; Fairy magic can do a whole lot of stuff, but it can also be very fickle, especially when its user doesn't really know what they're doing...but, okay, if you insist!\"  Holding her inner pair of hands together, the Great Fairy materialised a glowing flower in her inner pair of hands, blowing on it and sending a cloud of shining petals toward Sue-Belle.  \"Okay!  That, er, should do it...if I'm right, it should be a gradual effect, so check back with me in the morning if it works.  See ya!\"  An excited Sue-Belle made her way up and out of the cave, running home as fast as she could.  As she went to bed, she thought excitedly about how much easier her favourite task would be the next morning, when she was bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue-Belle awoke the next day...to find that getting out of bed seemed unusually difficult for some reason.  With her eyes still closed, she attempted to roll over, becoming aware of a pronounced creaking sound coming from her bed frame.  \"That's weird...\" she said aloud.  Before she could do anything else, the frame suddenly snapped, sending her mattress clattering loudly to the ground. \"Ouch!  What in blazes is happening to--\"  The young woman trailed off in the middle of her sentence upon opening her eyes and seeing what had become of her body; it seemed that in the night, the Great Fairy's magic had caused her to grow incredibly fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeighing at least a good 300-400 lbs., Sue-Belle's body was now dominated by a massive, round belly, split into several rolls, with two equally enormous breasts sitting atop its shelf of flab.  Both her arms and legs had bloated up thick with fat, with even her fingers and toes now resembling little sausages, and her face's 3 new chins squashed together as she tried to crane her nearly-nonexistent neck forward to survey the damage.  Obviously, her dress had been annihilated by this point, leaving every part of her fattened form visible for all to see.  \"What...what happened?!\" she cried to no one in particular, feeling all over her new body to see if it was real and not some twisted nightmare.  Before she could think of anything, though, the girl was suddenly overtaken by a powerful sensation, and she found herself rising up slightly as her fat rear end seemed to inflate even bigger, soon followed by the rest of her body.  Multiplying rapidly in weight, she caused the floor of her room to break, at which point she dropped down onto the centre of Orca's dojo with a loud <i>thud</i>.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Orca nor Sturgeon was around, which proved a momentary relief...which quickly evapourated as soon as Sue-Belle realised she was still getting fatter!  \"I-I have to get out of here!\" she exclaimed, miraculously hoisting herself onto her feet before attempting to labouriously waddle her way to the front door...which proved easier said than done, as dozens more pounds of fat packed onto her body by the second.  She just managed to reach the door, and quickly pulled it open before attempting to squeeze her rapidly-widening form through it, only to end up stuck!  After several seconds of struggling, though, that problem managed to \"solve\" itself, as her flab quickly grew too huge for the flimsy doorway and split it apart, allowing Sue-Belle to fall forward and land on her belly, at which point her gain finally slowed to a halt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving expanded to about 1500 lbs., give or take, Sue-Belle lay on the ground, panting heavily and praying to the goddesses that no one was around to see her massive, nude form sprawled out on the beach.  The only thought besides that running through her head was, 'That damn fairy's got some explaining to do...'  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sue-Belle, now very angry at what the Great Fairy of Fortune had done to her, she struggled to try and pick herself up. Her great shelves of fat on her upper belly were making her pushing herself up action nearly impossible. Sue-Belle stopped for a moment to catch her breath after her quite short act of physical labor, and to just really get a good look at her massive body in its current state. \"Ah my slim figure...gone!\" Sue-Belle cried as she whimpered, small tears falling into her vast, deep cleavage. Sue-Belle remembered how she had been so proud of her slim, thin figure. Back at her original home at Windfall Island, she had quite a few men taking glances at her on her strolls throughout the town form time to time. But now, she'd be lucky if any glances she got weren't of disgust. \"Good thing it's only...\" Sue-Belle then looked at the position of the moon. \"Wow...4:00 in the morning, wonder why I woke up so early?\". Sue-Belle tried lifting herself up again after a bit of resting and dawdling with her fat fingers in the sand. She brushed the piles of sand off her gelatinous rolls and shook all the folds on her body to let out all the sand that had gotten stuck in her fat, the sand particles pouring from all over her belly, about a handful or so coming straight from her now arm length deep belly button. \"Oh jeez, I can still feel sand in my...fat folds.\" the young woman groaned at admitting she now possessed excess fat, let alone folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue-Belle then looked around at all the houses and saw no lights were on. \"Phew...I guess everyone's asleep and Grandpa and Granduncle are out on another trip again, I'm lucky they are, Granduncle Orca would've been furious at the damage done to his dojo. Oh well, I'll deal with that later, I've gotta find...something to cover up with.\" the one half and a quarter ton woman said to herself searching for any piece of cloth or fabric large enough to wrap around her nude, jiggling form. Sue-Belle griped and groaned as she looked desperately for any left out sheets or blankets from yesterday, she then found two large sails, which had been entangled in some bushes past her house, near the cliffs, the two sails had painted on them two odd looking creatures, a large armor covered being with a huge sword in its hands and a robed bird that was apparently holding a wand of sorts. Sue-Belle realized these must've blown off some poor unfortunate soul's boat somewhere out at sea, as she had never seen the design before. Untangling the two sails from the bushes she wrapped them around her blubbery body, despite a few holes on them, which luckily weren't too numerous in her more intimate regions they fit quite snugly, with a good 4 feet for them to stretch from her belly. That was until her body yet again felt the sensation she had felt a good 12 minutes ago. \"Oh no!\" Sue-Bell yelped as her fat surged outward. Her two bulbous ass cheeks now one and a half times larger than she was originally tall, they swayed with the jolting feeling that surged throughout her body. Her chins which now were at nine in numbers, dangled inches above her monumental breasts, each chin looking like it could easily hold a small glass jar in its fold. The woman's breasts had now gotten to the size of one of her largest pots she had in her collection, which was almost as big as the adult pigs Miss Rose kept as pets. Her belly, which was made up of four giant rolls of flab, bobbed up and down from the sudden gaining of many pounds, her lower belly now almost touching the ground, which was amazing that it didn't given it's girth. Her upper belly rolls took the role of supporting her massive mammaries, all in all her belly was easily the most prominent part of her, It as a whole weighing a grand total of 400lbs alone. Sue-Belle's legs and arms had widened to where they now looked more large logs. Her face, while still very perky and beautiful was full of fat, her cheeks now looking like two balls of goo had been stuffed in her mouth. All in all, Sue-Belle now weighed an enormous 2,800lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh come on!\" the woman whimpered as she flailed her arms into her chest fat, sinking a good six inches inward. The sails now only covering her to the barest of modesty. \"How the hell am I gonna get to that Great Fairy now?! I can barely...hmmph move!\" Sue-Belle then tried, what she thought of as out of her mind, to stand up, as her gain had sent her falling down due to her ginormous jiggly ass filling up first.  Miraculously, she could stand and in fact still walk, albeit slowly. \"Huff..hey I guess that magic made me stronger after all!\" She cheered as she clenched her fat fists in happiness at being able to the impossible task of...walking. Suddenly then she heard a noise from behind her, a rustling in the bushes. \"Oh no,no,no,no! Please gods of Hyrule don't let it be Joel out again on one of his early morning walks!\"  Sue-Belle knew the young boy was known for upon finding something interesting, telling EVERYONE on the island about it as soon as possible. She turned around and for a split second was relived it wasn't him, but then she nearly screamed at what she did see a rather large Red ChuChu. \"Eeek!\" As she saw the blobbish, jelly-like creature slide and shake toward her. Sue-Belle knew while the monster was rather harmless to someone with a weapon, she was however, weaponless and at that had little chance of outrunning the thing in her state. As it the lunged at her the massive woman put up her meaty arms in defense waiting for it to strike her...but that moment never came. Apparently due to her new bulk the ChuChu did absolutely jack-squat to her, merely bouncing off her flab, making both her and the creature jiggle and bounce wildly. \"Huh? Oh my, maybe this fat ain't so bad after all!\" Sue-Belle said as she lifted a chunk of her belly fat in wonder. Looking at the jelly monster, which seemed to be slightly confused as to why it had no effect on the woman, she then got a crazy idea. \"Well hopes this works!\" Sue then rocked her body forward, her tremendous weight sending her falling downward onto the poor, pathetic creature crushing it instantly. The one ton plus woman got up and saw the small remains of the Red ChuChu, she scooped up a bit of the jelly and stuck it in her mouth, remaking on the somewhat sweet taste red chu jelly was known for. Sue-Belle then let out a rather hearty burp, in-proportionate to the amount of chu jelly she just swallowed. \"BBBBUUUURRRRRPPPP!!!!!!!!\", she then gasped afterwards,shocked she had done such a....ill mannered action. \"Oh--oh my! I'm glad only I heard that.\" Sue-Belle said blushing madly. \"I can't imagine what everyone would think of me if they knew I did...<i>that</i>.\" Sue-Belle whispered, not wanting to know how embarrassing that would be to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... now that's done I guess it's time to finally haul my huge body to that Great Fairy and set this straight!\" Sue said, making her way up the up hill climb to the top of the island. After about three minutes of walking she was already feeling exhausted. \"Huff..huff...Well, I guess my strength could only increase so much...\" At that moment however, as she laid against the rock wall of the incline of the island's way to the top, Sue-Belle yet again... gained more weight. \"Oh son of a...! the woman said as her irritation filled sentence was cut off by her body bulging out forward, her belly now almost touching the opposite wall from where she stood. Sue-Belle's body however, was still just barely covered properly by the sails she had been wearing for the past 24 minutes.  The woman, who was now realizing this weight gain of hers was quite random in its time of starting between gains and how much she gained. Now the woman had gained a smaller 200lbs this time, equaling out to a solid 3,000lbs. Fortunately, this new weight also made her strong enough to carry on to the Forest. After 10 minutes of slowly pacing her way up the mountainous walkway, with breaks in between, Sue-Belle had finally made it to the top. All she had to do was cross bridge, go into the forest and go the hole which led to the Great Fairy of Fortune. \"Ah, finally... now here comes hell...\" the one and a half ton woman groaned as she realized she had almost no fucking chance of crossing the bridge at her current weight. Sue-Belle walked up to the edge of the bridge's planks, looking ahead to death's crossing for someone of her stature. \"Taking a gulp she slowly stepped onto the wooden steps, and then heard it creak under her fat foot. Ignoring her racing heart and sweaty palms, Sue-Belle continued across the bridge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, Sue-Belle was at the halfway point on the bridge with only 12 planks dropping below into the sea. \"Okay, just a bit further Sue, you can do this.\" she said to herself her eyes closed as she relied on the ropes guiding her to safety. As, she started to walk again, Sue-Belle heard what was to her quite possibly the most horrifying sound right there. \"SNAP!\" Sue-Belle's eyes shot open, she whizzed her fat head and now 19 chins as fast as she could to see the ropes at the beginning were unwinding and if she didn't move fast, she'd plummet and most likely...die. \"Shit, shit, shit, shit,shit, shit, SHIT!\" Sue-Belle shouted as she ran as fast as her tree thick legs could move her. Then, she did the impossible and lunged forward onto to the other side of the island, thanks to an adrenaline boost. \"Oh...thank the gods!\" Sue-Belle cried, being glad she had not fallen the several stories below into the sea. As she made her way into the forest she took a small rest, to eat some of the local berries and fruits, needing something to fill her now growling gut. Sue-Belle then got up and went over to the hole where the Great Fairy of Fortune resided, however upon finally getting there she felt a little tired. \"Yawn...maybe I should take a little nap before I go down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rubbing the edges of her eyes with her stubby forefinger and thumb, Sue-Belle decided a nap was indeed something she needed, looking through the foliage above she could see it was probably around 6:00am, judging by the color of the sky. \"Well...*yawn* I need to look somewhat presentable when I go to see the Great Fairy, even if I am a huge woman blob of flab.\" the purple haired woman said sheepishly as her eyelids grew heavy, waking up at 4 in the morning was now finally taking it's toll on her status. Putting her hands underneath her head as a makeshift pillow the 3,000lb woman drifted off into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Miss Sue-Belle know that while she slept, the magic from the fairy started up again, and this time it was a big amount. As the woman snored, tossed and turned, and unconsciously scratched her jiggly, soft belly folds, she was slowly taking up more and more space.  As her body grew in size and fat she began to  push back logs and rocks that were near her. Her breasts were now getting near twice the size of one of Miss Rose's pigs, and they were held high by her mountainous rolls of fat on her torso. Her belly was nearing 700lbs on its own and was getting near the hole leading to the Great Fairy. Because the woman was lying on her back, she was slowly being raised higher from her blubbery ass getting bigger and bigger. Each cheek could easy swallow up one of those Bokoblins in their individual globs of blubber. Dozens of minutes went by as unknowingly, the pot obsessed woman of Outset Island was filling up the space of the area of the Great Fairy of Fortune's hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2 hours later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue_Belle groggily woke up from her snooze, her eyes half open until she saw her current size, then they shot wide open. \"Waaaaaahhhhh!!!!\" she said as she gazed in astonishment at how much weight she gained in her nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at a tremendous 9,000lbs, the woman had in a mere two hours tripled her weight. The sails she used to cover herself now torn remains of their former selves by the tremendous fat building up underneath them over her sleep. Her belly was mere inches away from the hole leading to the Great Fairy, her mammaires now being able to fill her room halfway. Her gigantic ass, with masses of twigs and grass stuck in it's fleshy folds took up more space then her body did itself 3 hours ago. It was amazing how large the woman was now, and even more so that upon reacting she could still stand and even move around normally, albeit sluggishly but still normal. Letting out a \"small\" fart and burp which both succeeded in blowing away several leaves from trees around her, Sue-Belle took her meaty hands and grabbed her soft, creamy flab in a combination of surprise, sadness, and anger. \"N-no! Ah dammit, why did I make such a stupid decision?!\" the woman shook her fat in great ferocity. Her belly fat rolls slapped together as she shook it in her hands. In frustration she grabbed her head in her hands and shook it. \"No, no, no, no, no,no, no! When will this crap stop?!\" Sue-Belle screamed as her 52 chins swung for seconds after she stopped moving her head. Getting a hold of herself, her eyes glared forward in intense contempt towards the hole that laid inches from the end of her magnificent gut but actually yards away from her face.\"Grrr....that fairy is gonna get a piece of my mind I just...gotta...*huff* get there!\" Sue-Belle strained as pulled her body to the hole, hopefully if she could pull most of over the hole, perhaps the magic that radiated inside would pull her in despite her size, and if it didn't she just force her way down no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrashing down in front of her, her upper body held up by her belly she crawled as best as she could towards the hole. Inching towards it she reached her hands and then her head into the black, crevasse in the earth. Amazingly seconds after doing so....she was magically sucked into the Fairy's domain, as she were in a powerful whirlpool. \"Waaaaggghhhh!!!\" Sue-Belle screeched as she plummeted towards the floor, though this was unnecessary as seconds later she was daintily floating down via the magic within the realm. However despite her being dropped down slowly from the magic that held her, she still made a rather loud *whomp* sound. Heh, lucky for me this place has magic. \" Sue said whipping her brow. Trudging up to the fountain, her bulbous belly dipped into the shallow water of the pool, water seeping into her deep belly button as it did.  \"Ahahahahaha! What do you come here for now little--uh....\" the fairy paused in mid-sentence realizing the woman she had cast her magic on had changed significantly, in ways neither of them had expected. \"Uhhh I'm guessing I screwed up?\" The Fortune Fairy said laughing nervously as she \"laid\" in the air transforming her spiral bottom into legs to fit the action. \"The hell you did! Look at this!\" Sue-Belle said slapping her 1,000lb belly with her left hand. The fairy squinted and responded aloofly. \"Hmmm....that's quite a belly you got there kid....so....what do you want me to do about it?\" The fairy said in an almost complaining manner, waving two of hands through her long hair, using her two to prop up her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue-Belle was flabbergasted at just how...uncaring this deity was. For so long she and many others had seen and read of the The Great Fairies being majestic, kind, caring, wise, and above all nice.\" If it weren't for the fact she weighed more than a ton she would've lunged at the fairy right now and strangled her. To think this deity could be so....unlike how they were written about, maybe this fairy was just different. \"Well...\" the fat filled woman said trying to hold on to some scrap of her respect for the fairy. \"I'd like for you to get rid of all this fat, please.\" The fairy then let out a sigh and changed her position to where she was on her stomach with her upper two hands holding up her chin, her lower arms folded in each other. She looked on at the woman with an ashamed look in eyes. \"*sigh* Look uhh Sue was it? I'm really sorry, truly I am...but I don't want to help ya, I might just make things worse for ya if I do....sorry.\" \"B-but, can't you just concentrate and really give it your best shot? I mean I'm fine if I can't pick up the heavy pots like I wanted, I just want to be normal again so I won't have to face the other villagers like this.\" Sue pleaded, grasping her hands. \"Hmm well...I could...but as I told ya my specialty is spells involving monetary and financial stuff, wallets and rupees,...stuff lie that y'know?\" The fairy then had an idea to try and cheer up Sue-Belle. \"Uhh hey, maybe it won't be as bad as you think it is...I mean with all that blubber on your gut and ass you could probably hold your whole collection of pots on ya all at once right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this Sue thought for a second never taking in this thought before. \"Hmm, well I guess...but I still don't want to be like this for the rest of my life, it's just....impractical for my life on this island. Besides, I can't go around in the nude like this all the time, it's not like we have the materials to make clothes for someone my size, and knowing your magic I'd rip right through anything made for me anyway.\" The fairy then folded all four of her arms together, getting a little annoyed that she'd have to fix this, wanting to rather just have this woman go with the flow, that's how she dealt with her problems, and she turned out fine. \"Are you sure you want me to try and fix you? I can't guarantee success. Besides...\" the floating fairy then reached down to rub, pat, and shake the woman's grand belly, giggling as it's many, many rolls jiggled from her touch. I gotta say, you like really good like this...it fits ya.\"  \"Yes.\" Sue said folding her arms across her massive breasts.  I...think I want to be normal again.\" she said a little creeped out by the fact that the Great Fairy seemed to be hitting on her at the moment all of a sudden. \"*sigh* Alright...here goes nothing. {What a waste, I  really do love how she looks...if only she would change her mind...} the fairy thought as she began her spell.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sue-Belle let out a groan as she shielded her eyes from the blinding light. After the light dissipated, Sue-Belle opened her eyes to a most surprising sight. Looking around she could see herself...still fat, however she could also more fat...on the fairy? \"What the--?\" the woman stammered as she jerked her head back in great confusion to what was in front of her. <br>\r\n\"Ahh...this feels pretty good.\" the Great Fairy of Fortune said patting her now gargantuan belly fat, which floated above the ground mere inches away from touching it, due to it's far greater size and weight. The dark purple flab expanded forward, nearly grazing Sue's own blubbery folds, her four arms each now wider than her body's former width. The cloth that hung around her body amazingly still fit her rather well, due to belonging to a minor deity. Her massive breasts were a good size larger than even Sue-Belle's, creating an immense valley, of which one could almost fall into if one desired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...Why did you...do this?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh well dear, I thought that if you had fat girl to hang out with yourself you'd be able to see the greatness of your new physique, to be honest I can't believe you don't like this, so soft...and round...\" the Great Fairy moaned as she shook one of plentiful upper torso rolls, her incredible form floating on her belly, turning herself upside down as smiled at the woman.<br>\r\n\"Like you know anything, you don't have to deal with a mobility issue like me, you don't even have legs! <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">You just float everywhere...</font>\" Sue-Belle glared to the side, jealous of how great the fairy seemed to mind her new fat. <br>\r\n\"Hmm? Do you want me to fix that for you?\" she said gliding her fingers across the thick thighs of the cumbersome woman, making a small slicing motion across them as she did. <br>\r\n\"I'd rather keep my ability to walk thank you.\" the woman responded, pulling her legs back as much as she still could. \"Why do you want me to stay like this anyway?\" Sue crossed her arms in confusion. The fat fairy laughed upon hearing this, her many chins shaking in excess as she bellowed. \"Hahahaha! Sheesh kid, you should see by now how good you look! So you can't move all that well no biggie, it's not like I can't fix it for ya.\" <br>\r\n\"I thought I told you I wanted to keep my legs...\" Sue-Belle shot back at the ecstatic fairy's statement, slightly nervous of the deity's stability.<br>\r\n\"Oh relax, I'm just going to use a small gravity-based spell on ya, it should alleviate some of that nasty force on your fat.\" The Great Fairy giggled, poking Sue's gut with her four index fingers. <br>\r\n\"Wha? You can really do that?\" Sue-Belle's eyes gleamed with hope, she may not lose this weight as quickly as she wanted to, but being able to actually move more 4 miles per hour on average would be a definite plus. <br>\r\n\"Sure...just let me spread my magic around you, this type of spell...requires it to be physically spread around specific areas.\" Happy at knowing she could finally be rid of being so tired after moving just a few yards, Sue-Belle failed to notice the fairy's line of drool hanging from her open maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again letting a wave of pure light envelop the two of them, the fairy began to work her magic on the pot carrying woman. Grasping the many folds and rolls in her four hands, the fairy massaged and rubbed the gelatinous regions of fat with intensive care. Taking the time to enjoy the soft touch and gentle feel of the massage, Sue-Belle closed her eyes to relax, lying her head down on the ground floor of the great fairy's chamber. Fiddling her 40 fingers in the grandiose belly and torso rolls, several moving particularly in the vast cavern that was the woman's belly button, the Great Fairy picked and poked deep into the mounds of blubber, enjoying every second of it. Magic spread all across the white flesh, their bellies pushing against each other now, the fairy blushing slightly upon contact. (Hmmph, for a human she's really quite cute...I should've done this to myself eons ago had I known being flabby felt this good.) Finding herself satisfied with her spell, the fairy made one last deep push with nearly her whole body into Sue-Belle's, so much that their faces were nearly touching, centimeters apart, luckily the woman's eyes were closed otherwise she'd have had a fit, not that she really could do anything to the fairy, but it still wouldn't fit well with the other fairies if the people of the island you lived at saw you as something to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright all done!\" the fairy said quickly as she resumed her normal floating position, snapping her fingers to further signalize her statement. Sue-Belle opened her eyes, picking herself up she could instantly feel herself, mainly her belly being significantly lighter, enough to the point that upon bringing herself to standing, her 1,000lb belly shook vigorously from the amount of extra force Sue put into getting up. Sue-Belle then felt herself gain more weight, at first nearly crying as she thought this was some horrid backfire once again, but despite the fact she could feel her body gaining upwards to around another 4 or so thousand pounds, being now above 10,000 pounds in weight, she still felt rather limber and light. \"Oh my...\" the woman clasped her sides with her meaty hands, taking a moment to actually succeed in jumping up and down. Being at almost 15k the fact that she could jump at all let alone a whole 4 inches made her incredibly jubilant. \"I--I can jump!\" Sue-Belle cheered as she continued hopping, making small quakes that no likely even this deep down caused some small shocks to he islanders above.  \"Oh thank you Great Fairy, this is wonderful, I can finally stop worrying about my life being completely ruined now!\" Sue-Belle said, her faith in the fairy becoming more like it's former self.<br>\r\n\"Sure kid, it was my pleasure...(especially since all that groping I did wasn't even necessary.) so whatcha gonna do now, it's about time that everyone's up and about, you ready to let everyone know of the new Sue?\" Hearing this the purple haired woman stopped almost immediately, her color drained of any previous vividness, now a nearly pure white. \"Oh...right, I...I forgot about that, oh...I'll be such a laughing stock, even if there are understanding I'll never hear the end of that constant snickering every now and then.\" Sue-Belle grasped her head in nervousness, wondering just how she deal with this state of hers becoming public. <br>\r\n\"Hmm, well....don't worry about it, if you just say it was my doing I'm sure they'll understand.\" the Great Fairy, said nonchalantly, lying on her side, flicking strands of her hair with one hand, and another scratching her side fat.<br>\r\n\"*gulp* Well...alright if you say so...\" Sue-Belle clenched her fists in determination, ready to face the public eyes. \"Goodbye Great Fairy!\" Sue said as she stepped into the void of light, and floated up back to the surface. <br>\r\n\"Buh bye, come back later and I can really give you a massage, this time without tricking ya!\" the fairy chuckled as she saw the woman fade into the light. <br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" Sue-Belle shouted as she realized what the fairy meant by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the grove of the forest of Outset Island, Sue-Belle could see that despite she had spent from what she felt was a good hour or so in the fairy's domain only a few short minutes had passed, as the sun was still rather low in the sky, not even 6:30 yet. \"Well...time to get out of here and head back down.\" Moving her grand form out of the forest, her massive thighs and belly easily pushing away entire bushes and even some small trees, Sue made it back to the clearing in no time. \"Oh crap...how the hell do I get back from here...\" Sue-Belle looked on as she saw that she was on the edge of a very high cliff, seeing that the bridge had been destroyed by her gigantic body, she had no way of crossing to the other side and as it seemed there was no way down. Sitting down, the woman thought of just how to get back down off this cliff. (Hmm...maybe I can use this spell of the fairy's to aid me down somehow? It could make it easier to climb down, but.....if I fall....) Sue-Belle thought of her current situation and even though she hated it she could see only two options, both were crazy. Either climb down the incredibly steep and high cliff side, and risk plunging into the shallow and therefore instant death waters below, or wait up here until the magic weight gain spell makes her so big, she won't need to climb down, maybe even....ask the fairy to double or triple it's effects to make the wait shorter. <br>\r\n\"Errgh! Alright, here goes nothing!\" At that point Sue-Belle made her decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carefully surveying her position, Sue-Belle weighed the options, and came to the only conclusion she could.  \"Okay...as much as it pains me to say so, it looks like the only way out of this mess is to wait here until I'm big enough to make the crossing unscathed,\" she said uneasily, more than aware that that would likely only cause further problems down the line.  'Better fat than dead, though,' was her rationale.  Having decided her fate, the massive woman sat herself down near the cliff and waited patiently for the familiar feeling of another growth spurt to overtake her...she waited, and waited, and waited...and still, nothing happened!  <br>\r\n\"Oh, c'mon, what gives?!\" she exclaimed, idly grabbing and pinching at her numerous rolls of flab.  \"Pfft...figures; the one time I <i>want</i> this stupid spell to kick in, it doesn't!\"  Even as she continued to loudly protest, though, still nothing happened.  She kept waiting for quite a while, eventually dozing off when the growth still failed to start again.  Of course, true to her luck, it was some time after this that the spell finally decided to take effect once more\u2026and did it ever!  As Sue-Belle slumbered, her blubbery body began to tremble and jiggle frenetically all over, as even more fat began to accumulate on her already-enormous frame. <br>\r\nIt started out slow, but her rate of growth quickly began to speed up, and in no time at all, her belly rolls began to cascade over the cliffside in front of her, while her ass flowed down the hill behind her, toward the village.  This particular growth spurt seemed different from the past ones, as her whole body grew as opposed to her just putting on more weight; she now rose upward as well, casting a shadow over the entire island with her girth.  <br>\r\nBy this point, the other inhabitants had begun to wake up and leave their houses\u2026only to immediately run back in as soon as they saw the pulsating mass of flesh advancing toward them over the cliffs above.  Not that it did them much good; Sue-Belle\u2019s unstoppable rolls plowed straight through the wood-and-bamboo huts like a giant\u2019s boot kicking over an anthill.  Sturgeon and Orca\u2019s house was the first to go, along with Link\u2019s; both were reduced to splinters by a veritable wave of side and ass flab. Young Aryll seemed oblivious, happily bouncing up and down in Sue-Belle\u2019s fat as her Grandma simply stared. The same fate befell Joel and Zill\u2019s house, leaving the two boys, their parents, and their oversized pig trapped in a prison of milky-white folds. <br>\r\nMeanwhile, her belly had easily cleared the cliff and filled the gap between the two landmasses that made up the island, demolishing Mesa\u2019s hut along the way before cascading over the rocks and into the sea beyond.  By this point, she had nearly engulfed the entire island in her flab, and yet STILL continued to grow!  The poor girl had somehow managed to sleep through the entire ordeal, but a combination of the gallons of bitingly-cold seawater now filling her every crack and crevice and the faint screams of the villagers finally jarred her from her slumber.<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?  What the heck is going on here?!\u201d she exclaimed, her voice now booming across the whole island.  Sue-Belle, unaware of her surroundings, tried desperately to tilt her head downward and survey the area, only to be stymied by both the hundreds of chins that now adorned her flabby face and her massive, heaving, house-sized bosoms, which rendered anything and everything beyond them quite invisible.  Growing increasingly anxious (among other things), she then attempted to stand and adjust her position, but quickly regretted it, as the sound of rocks crumbling quickly filled the air, and she felt herself sink slightly downward as the mesa she sat upon buckled under her countless tons of weight.  <br>\r\nThe reality of the situation slowly began to dawn upon Sue-Belle, and, feeling utterly helpless, she stared skyward and attempted to scream\u2026but when she did, the expected sound did not come.  Instead, an earth-shattering belch escaped from her throat, visibly distorting the air around her and whipping the seas into a fierce tsunami.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">BBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</font><br>\r\n The very moment it stopped, the Great Fairy suddenly reappeared, floating in the air above Sue-Belle and looking as fat as ever.  \u201cWhat\u2019s all the commotion?\u201d she asked rather nonchalantly, surveying the devastation with an oddly cool demeanour. <br>\r\n\u201cLOOK WHAT YOU\u2019VE DONE TO ME, YOU BITCH!!\u201d Sue-Belle screamed back, gesticulating wildly in every direction and making her breasts and arm fat tremble.  \u201cThe whole damn island\u2019s a wreck, and it\u2019s all because of your stupid spell!\u201d  At this, the Fortune Goddess simply stared at her \u201cclient\u201d for a few seconds, before lazily looking back and forth for the island that now resided beneath a mountain of fat, her four flabby hands idly pinching and jiggling at her own blubber as she did.  <br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026this place looks different somehow\u2014\u201c <br>\r\n\u201cOf course it looks different; the whole freaking island is probably stuck between the dimples on my ass!  WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING WHILE ALL THIS WAS HAPPENING?!\u201d <br>\r\nAfter taking another few seconds to let the irate fat woman\u2019s message sink in, the Great Fairy simply burst out into raucous laughter, clutching her belly as it wobbled in time.  \u201cHahaha, oh Goddesses, this is rich,\u201d she choked out between guffaws.  \u201cI can see them now, look at all the little folks floundering around in all that fat!\u201d  Before she could say anything else, however, she suddenly found herself clutched in Sue-Belle\u2019s massive hands and held up to her enormous, scowling visage. <br>\r\n\u201cQuit laughing, you bitch!\u201d she growled, having clearly reached the end of her patience.  \u201cYou just made me destroy my whole home\u2026I suggest you do something useful NOW, unless you wanna get EATEN!\u201d  This, coupled with the visible fury in the mortal woman\u2019s eyes, was more than enough incentive for the fat fairy, who immediately complied and began to charge a powerful spell.  Gathering an enormous, multi-coloured flower of energy between her hands, she hastily blew into it, causing it to explode into a blinding, kaleidoscopic light show that enveloped the entire area.  When it dissipated, both women were gone, and the island was devoid of all signs of their presence; the houses were fixed (albeit rather sloppily; magic applied on such a scale in so little time tended to be less than precise), and the citizens were left strewn across the beach, their minds at a loss as to how to process what just happened to them. <br>\r\nWhen Sue-Belle finally came to, she found herself floating in some random, far-off patch of ocean, her body sitting upon it like an island unto itself; much to her relief, she\u2019d finally stopped growing.  The Great Fairy floated next to her, looking visibly exhausted from having exerted so much effort on her spell.  As Sue opened her mouth to speak, she raised her upper two hands to stop her.<br>\r\n\u201cWait!  Before you say anything,\u201d the fat fairy began, \u201cEverything\u2019s okay now.  It took nearly all I had in me, but your island should be pretty much fixed, and you\u2019re no longer in danger of messing it up.  Got that?\u201d  <br>\r\nThe other woman nodded, but was quick to speak afterward.  \u201cWell\u2026okay, that\u2019s fine\u2026but still, look at me!  There\u2019s no way I can go back now!  What are we supposed to do?\u201d  Her despair over her situation was practically palpable\u2026for once, the Fortune Goddess could not help but feel regret for her actions, as well as sympathy for the mortal whose life she\u2019d uprooted.<br>\r\n\u201cHm\u2026well, I obviously still can\u2019t magic you back to normal; that\u2019s out of my skill set, and my powers are nearly depleted all the same\u2026but\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cBut?  But what?\u201d  <br>\r\nWith a thoughtful look on her face, the Great Fairy answered, \u201cWell, my sisters, the other Great Fairies, are a whole lot better at magic than me.  If we could just find them\u2026maybe they could help us!\u201d  It didn\u2019t take much for Sue-Belle to agree; any solution was enough for her at this point.  <br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but how do we find them?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the hard part\u2026but until then, I want you to know that\u2026well, I\u2019m sorry.  I mean, for real; I didn\u2019t realise until now just how much my meddling had screwed up your life\u2026so I\u2019m gonna try and do my very best to make things right!  I\u2019m with you all the way on this one, you hear?\u201d<br>\r\nSue-Belle looked long and hard at the fairy, scanning her expression and mulling over her words.  She wondered if she could really be trusted,but at the same time, it was obvious that she was the only one who could help her.  The choice to make was obvious.<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026alright\u2026we\u2019ll do it together.  But no tricks, okay?\u201d<br>\r\nThe Great Fairy visibly perked up, replying, \u201cOh, thank you!  Trust me, you won\u2019t regret this.  Ah, and one more thing\u2026\u201d  Snapping her fingers, a puff of magic smoke covered her body for a second before parting, revealing her to have grown to Sue\u2019s size in an instant.  Immediately after, the magic glow faded from her body and she touched down on the sea.<br>\r\n\u201cSee?  Now we\u2019re <i>really</i> in this together!\u201d  She swam over to Sue-Belle and draped her four massive arms about her shoulders, squashing their monumental breasts and belly rolls together and causing tons of water to flow back and forth between their every fold.  \"That was the last of my magic, so until I recharge, we're pretty much equals!  This is gonna be fun, I know it,\" the now-depowered fairy continued, running her 20 fingers across the other woman's flab as she wondered just what the hell she'd gotten herself into.</span></div></div>",

Well you can't just expect your body to move normally in water as you did when you weren't this big, you need to do this, here watch me.\" The Great Fairy then put motioned her body forward and downward slightly into the water, the resulting effect ended up with her body moving forward, akin to a kid forcing a ball underwater only for it spring back up quickly. \"See?\" <br>\r\n\"That seems awkward to do, but...alright.\" Sue-Belle then did as she was shown and found herself able to move forward, albeit rather slowly, at least from her perspective. \"Ahahahaha...oh you're getting it Sue!\" The Great Fairy clapped her plump hands as the two floated about The Great Sea. <br>\r\n\"Yeah... thank you....Great Fairy-you know is there anything else I can call you, because your title is a little awkward to use constantly.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 well I do have an actual name, but it is incomprehensible in your language and most other races\u2019 languages of this world.\u201d The fairy said, putting a finger to her chin.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Sue-Belle questioned.<br>\r\n\u201c*!/?+@&amp;~\u201d The Great Fairy said her name in ways that could only be described by most as gibberish.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy name,\u201d Sue-Belle then just floated there in the water, in slight shock over the mess of sound or whatever it was that she had just heard.<br>\r\n\u201cWell then\u2026can\u2019t use that\u2026how about\u2026..Fortuna or Pinkie?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThose do not fit me; I need something to show off my elegant and majestic nature.

No\u2026tha-actually that fits you <b>perfectly</b>.\u201d The woman smirked as she said this, remembering just why she was in this situation in the first place.<br>\r\n\u201cAhahahaha! Glad you agree me with me child!\u201d Miss Fortune wrapped her four blubbery arms around Sue-Belle\u2019s expansive belly, hugging her. \u201cOh how fitting of a name! \u201cNow let\u2019s go forth towards\u2026.\u201d Miss Fortune then triumphantly pointed out to\u2026absolutely nothing. \u201cSomewhere?\u201d the fairy turned around sheepishly realizing that they were out in the middle of the sea with no islands in sight, and no bearings to make sight of their current location. <br>\r\n\u201cUgghh! Well I guess we\u2019ll just have to wait till nightfall then I can figure out where we are.\u201d The former pot holding woman said as she swam forward in a lazy manner. <br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u2026..why?\u201d Miss Fortune asked as brushed past Sue-Belle\u2019s thigh and gut.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! You\u2019re one of the mystical, powerful, and immortal Great Fairies and you don\u2019t know about navigation through the stars?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell we usually keep to ourselves in our own domains, my sisters and I have only spent time out in the world every few centuries or so, besides we\u2019ve never had a use for such skills. Though I must admit, you hylians being able to find your way around in this grand world through the stars <b>is</b> impressive.\u201d  Sue-Belle smiled as the two began to chat and the woman started to become less annoyed with her new companion, despite all that had happened to her in this single day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Link helped you and your sisters?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026the Hero of Winds on his journey ended up saving some of my sisters from Giant Octos, plus for a kid his age he was rather cute ahehehe!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOur Link\u2026I remember when he chased the wild pigs around the island. I knew he was going to probably get into something big when he went to save Aryll, but never had I expected him to be helping the goddesses.\u201d Sue-Belle looked up fondly, thinking of how the young boy she had known had gone on to becoming something great in such a short time. \u201cI remember he used to have a crush on me when he was little, teehee, he\u2019d always help me carry my pots around, and he would always want to go fishing with me.\u201d As the day passed, Sue-Belle and Miss Fortune continued their various conversations as they swam across the Great Sea, occasionally helping each other get pools of sea water out from their fat folds. Sue-Belle laughed as they took to slapping and shaking each others' rolls, though she wasn\u2019t really enjoying being so large and bare, she had to admit, it was at least quite an enjoyable physical sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, night was beginning to fall, after a few spots faraway boats, trying and failing to get their attention, the two looked up to find the beautiful expanse of stars across the black sky. <br>\r\n\u201cSo beautiful\u2026and delicious.\u201d Miss Fortune said as she licked her plump lips. Sue-Belle made an aside glance at her companion\u2019s odd comment. \u201cAlright\u2026so the Hero\u2019s Belt is there\u2026which means\u2026we\u2019re directly north of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe instead she could try the same thing with another Hylian sometime. With her hands clasped together, the Great Fairy chanted to herself, closing her eyes and then casting her magic at Sue-Belle, making the massive blubbery woman wince as she predicted some sudden flash of light resulting as she was hit with a bolt of light or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue Belle was still big and bulbous, her blubber flowing across the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what the hell?

Sue Belle push down on her fat tits, causing a bit more pleasure from their sensitivity as she saw something that made her hair stand on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder her belly, sticking out and growing was a huge, pulsing fat cock that stood out further and further in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what the hell, aahhh~, did you do dammit?!\" Sue Belle shrieked.

Perhaps I used the wrong spell or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WANTED TO LOSE WEIGHT, NOT TURN INTO A FUTA!\" Sue Belle yelled with understandable rage. \"How do you screw that up so badly?! It...ahhh~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue was unable to maintain her seething rage and embarrassment as her thick cock began to overpower her judgement a bit from the feelings of arousal and pleasure resulting from her dick rubbing against her huge fat belly and the ground as the weight of her belly sitting atop her cock pressed it against the ground, the sensitive organ causing waves of pleasure to flow into Sue Belle's mind. She couldn't even focus as her erect cock stood out in front of her, making her moan and pant as it began to drive her further towards sexual euphoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh dammit...this thing feels so wrong...I gotta...get...off...soon\" Sue Belle panted and whined between breaths as she tried to rub at her sensitive dick, hoping she could get a release so she could focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohh let me-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piss off.\" Sue Belle scowled on her blushed red face, which looked like a plump puffy tomato due to how red her fat face had become. \"I think you've done enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Great Fairy frowned as Sue Belle tilted her head back, clenching her fists together as pleasure only continued to build up and she felt her new impressive sack churning more cum underneath as she moaned louder groaning as she gripped her belly with her plump hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...Hwaaaa-BBBBUUUUUURRRRRPPP!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue Belle moaned loudly then belched as she felt a powerful orgasm pass through her, her sensitive futa dick firing off a huge stream of cum that almost blasted into her Great Fairy companion if she hadn't elegantly glided away. Sue Belle moaned helplessly between fits of belching as she felt the euphoria pass through her, the blubbery beauty panting and sweating after the rush of sexual pleasure passed through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh maaan...\" She whined as the blubbery futa looked down at her new cock. She was less then happy with her current situation as she stared at her raging cock as it started to become flaccid and the pool of cum sitting on front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't get any worse for her...could it?</span></div></div>",

That will make it easy for her gaining until she gets fat enough to measure into pounds and whatnot.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In the depths of the Kokiri Forest lived the Kokiri children, each of these children were assigned a fairy to look over them. There was one boy however who still did not yet have a fairy. That boy's name was Link. The guardian of this forest and of the Kokiri inside was known as the Great Deku Tree. One day, the boy known as Link who had been destined as a hero was given his first fairy, Navi. On that day both Link and Navi journeyed on a quest to save Hyrule and the world itself!...Or at least they would be if Navi wouldn't stop to eat every 5 minutes! This is Ocarina of Time: A Fairy's Gain.</i> (Strange last bit to that opening, isn't it?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the vast, deep forest of Hyrule... Long have I served as the guardian spirit... I am known as the Deku Tree...\" said well...the Deku Tree, who resided in a large opening in the forest that was connected to the main village of the Kokiri Forest. The Deku Tree was a very large and very wise tree, he had large, solemn eyes and oddly had what looked like a mustache despite the fact he is a tree and therefore shouldn't have hair, but whatever. \"The children of the forest, the Kokiri, live here with me. Each Kokiri has his or her own guardian fairy. However, there is one boy who does not have a fairy...Navi... Navi, where art thou? Come hither.......and stop eating my leaves!\" From above in the top parts of the Deku Tree was a light bluish fairy named Navi, she had wavy torso length hair and being a fairy wore no clothing. However, there was a few things about her that was quite different. For one thing she was one hell of a glutton, so much so that she ate more than 20 times the average fairy ate, which was about as much a normal sized Hyrulian ate. Second was that, she was HUGE for fairy folk. The normal fairy weighed about 90 to 120 grams she weighed a total 500 grams she was so fat that the natural glowing light that emitted from her body failed to block out her body's form like most fairies. Despite all this she had no trouble flying and was abnormally quick, when she was hungry at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As Navi flew down from the top of the great tree's branches Navi burped rather loudly, spatting out a few pieces of leaves from her mouth. <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">UUURRRPPP!!!</font> Oh I'm sorry Great Deku Tree, you know how tasty I find your leaves...<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">wait since your a tree wouldn't that mean I'm eating your hair?</font>\". Navi said as muttered to herself about the similarities of leaf to hair for trees. \"Yes I know how much you enjoy my leaves dear Navi....<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">you've already eaten 5 branches worth of them in just this morning...</font>\" The large tree said slightly annoyed by the fairy's plentiful appetite. \"As I was saying...Navi the fairy... Listen to my words, the words of the Deku Tree... Dost thou sense it? The climate of evil descending upon this realm... Malevolent forces even now are mustering to attack our land of Hyrule... For so long, the Kokiri Forest, the source of life, has stood as a barrier, deterring outsiders and maintaining the order of the world... But...before this tremendous evil power, even my power is as nothing. It seems the time has come for the boy without a fairy to begin his journey... ehhh?\" The old and wise paused for a moment as he noticed the fairy in front of him had taken to playing with belly flab on the ground, slapping and rubbing it with affection.. Navi, while she did have a great respect for the guardian of the forest, she had to admit he could get into quite a number of long-winded speeches at times, even if they were important. ....\"Ahh hem!\" The Deku Tree cleared his throat, immediately garnering the attention of the blue fairy, looking back up at the old tree with a face that showed her embarrassment and was basically her saying \"Hehe sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Great Deku Tree then continued his speech. \"The youth whose destiny it is to lead Hyrule to the path of justice and truth... Navi...go now! Find our young friend and guide him to me... I do not have much time left. Fly, Navi, fly! The fate of the forest, nay, the world, depends upon thee!\" The wise old guardian of the forest bellowed to the fat fairy. Navi then smiled brightly, gave a quick salute and flew off to the Kokiri village, but not before grabbing a few more leaves from the Great Deku Tree's branches and letting out another rather loud burp on accident. <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"BBBUUURRRRPPP!!!\"</font> Oh, uhhh please excuse me Great Deku Tree!\" she said as she flew off.   ......\"*sigh* I do hope her appetite shan't intervene with the boy's journey.\" The old tree said, unaware of just how wrong his hopes would end up being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Navi flew through the corridor-like walls that led to the Kokiri's village she took notice of the beautiful scenery of the place. She had always loved the quaint serene feel the village seemed to always have, the small pool of water and the waterfall that flowed into it, the small flickering bugs flying throughout the grass, and of course all the fat Kokiri girls who were so fun to watch and play with. The Kokiri girls were all mostly a good 200lbs each, making them quite wide for their bodies. Navi looked around at all the various Kokiri, there were the Know-It-All Brothers who were bickering over who knew more about weird stuff like how the \"c-buttons\" are used, whatever those were. There was that ass Mido who she didn't really care for, he had quite an ego and it made him quite irritating. There was also that odd guy who was either struggling to pick up a bunch of rocks or humping them, she could never tell, and then she saw Fado the cheerful girl who was standing at the end of the bridge peering out st the village. Fado was well-known for her loud and frequent gaseous eruptions of belches and farts. From this everyone had given her the nickname Fado the Wind Sage, which she took great pride in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Navi made her way around the village she looked around for a bit to try and spot Link's house, seeing beyond a wooden fence she nodded to herself and blazed towards the literal tree house, her chins, belly, breasts and ass swayed and jiggled graciously in the air pushing past her,...until she was jerked backwards suddenly. \"Nyaaaaah!\" Navi yelped as she realized her fat gut had gotten stuck in the frames of the fence. \"Oh come on hmmmrph Frrrrrrrrtttt!\" Navi struggled to get herself free as she let out fart from her straining. After about a few minutes worth of struggling and about 13 farts Navi had finally freed her flab and flew onward to Link's house. She then heard a loud crashing sound from behind her, looking back Navi saw that the fence had somehow been dislodged by her fat ass and her getting through sent it falling to the ground, not wanting to get involved with whatever trouble this would bring, the fairy flew backwards slowly for a second then shot off into Link's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Navi had made her way into the boy's house she saw the body of a cute looking ten year old boy in a green tunic, as per the usual garb of the Kokiri boys, unfortunately he was sleeping, much to her annoyance. \"Hey Link! Wake up! The Great Deku Tree wants to talk to you!....uhhhh\" Navi said irritated at the fact that Hyrule's supposed hero was such a lazy boy. \"Sheesh, <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Can Hyrule's destiny really depend on such a lazy boy?</font>\" Navi muttered to herself as she looked downward onto the sleeping child, her 3 chins drooping into her cleavage as did so. \"Hmm well I didn't want to do this but...Navi then stopped her wings flapping and sent herself falling onto the boy... with a rather solid impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhh!\" Link screamed as the force of the fat fairy's body sent him crashing to the floor below face first. Succeeding in waking the boy Navi flew up, happy that she had woken him. \"You finally woke up! I'm Navi the fairy! The Great Deku Tree asked me to be your partner from now on! Nice to meet you!\" she said, completely ignoring the fact she basically just dropped what weighed the same as a few of the many rocks outside onto the poor boy. Link, still wondering just what the hell happened looked up at his new fairy partner. \"A-a fairy? the Great Deku Tree himself?! and so fat for a fairy...\" Link said now having so many questions to ask of the situation. \"Yep! now come on Link, the Great Deku Tree has summoned you! So let's get going, right now!\" Navi said as she tugged on his sleeve. \"W-wait! Can't I ask you some questions first?\" \"Oh we can do that later, come now our guardian is waiting!\" From there Link went  outside to find his good friend Saria waving to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Link peered down from the deck of his house he saw running up to him, his best friend Saria, Saria was a rather caring and one of the more wise members of the Kokiri tribe. Her green, curled hair shined graciously in the bright sunlight casting over the village. Saria was a rather special member among the Kokiri girls in that while the others were in the 200s and 300s, Saria easily out weighed them all at an absolutely staggering 835lbs. Her Kokiri dress was ripped in a number of places and just barely covered her fat filled breasts,  with each of them being slightly bigger than the head of a Deku Baba plant. The girl's cheeks pushed outward with globs of fat laying underneath her skin, her 16 chins swayed down near her bosom, pushing into each other over and over again from her movement. Saria's backside and posterior jiggled with each lumbering step from her stubby feet, each of her \"cheeks\" big enough to nearly engulf Link's head in, which happened accidentally on occasion of her not looking where she sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria's \"running\" could more accurately be described as a fast waddle, but when you're almost a ton in weight, being able to even move more then 8 miles per hour could allow one to call your movements running. As she made her way to the bottom of his tree, Saria waved cheerfully at her friend, seeing that he was finally awake today. \"Yahoo! Hi, Link!\" Saria said as sat herself under his home. \"Hey Saria!\" Link yelled down to the massive Kokiri girl, he then leaped down from his deck, with Navi flying down, landing into the soft, fleshy folds of Saria's gut. Upon impact, Saria let out a small \"oomph\" as Link sank into her flab. \"Careful Link, you may get stuck in there one day! *giggle*\" Climbing out from her deep crevasses, Link showed the big girl his fairy. \"Saria look, I got a fairy now!\" Link said cheerfully watching the obese fairy flutter around him and Saria, dipping up and down in her flight. Wow! A fairy!! Finally, a fairy came to you, Link! Wow! That's great news! I'm so happy for you! Now you're a true Kokiri, Link! ...I didn't think fairies could that fat though...\" Saria said eying the blue blubbery creature before her. \"Yeah she is...quite big isn't she?\" Link said now being able to finally get a good look at his new companion. Navi, wanting to hurry on to the Great Deku Tree, interjected... \"Yes, I am very fat, now come on Link we've got to go and meet with the Great Deku Tree!\" she said as she pulled on his hat. \"Oh yeah, see ya later Saria we have to meet the Great Deku Tree.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs that right? The Great Deku Tree has summoned you? It's quite an honor to talk to the Great Deku Tree! I'll wait for you here. Go see the Great Deku Tree Link!\" Saria then took to picking some flowers near the area. \"Alright see ya Saria!\" Link said as he ran off. \".....Okay now where is his stash of food?\" Saria said, once she was sure the boy was gone, she went to look around for a his secret stash of food he told her about once, she had to have some of it...or all of it. Saria heaved her gut around to try and push through the bushes for some kind of possible alcove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boy and his fairy made their way to the pathway that would lead to the Deku Tree's meadow, they were stopped by the annoying Mido. \"Hey stop! Where do you think you're going Mr. No Fairy?!\" the bully Mido said, somehow blocking the way to the Great Deku Tree from Link, despite Link being more fit and agile. \"Aw come on Mido get out of the way, I've got to see the Great Deku Tree!\" Link said, trying his best to get past the kid, with no success. \"What's your business with the Great Deku Tree? Without a fairy, you're not even a real man!\" Upon hearing this Link smirked slightly, \"Well  too bad for you Mido casue now I do have a fairy!\" \"What?! You've got a fairy?!\" Navi then flew into the Kokiri's face, her  fat ridden belly brushing against his nose. \"Yeah, now move it, Mido! The Great Deku Tree summoned Link here, now let us through!\". Letting this all sink in for a second, Mido burst with surprise. \"Say what? The Great Deku Tree actually summoned you? Whaaaaaaat?! Why would he summon you and not the great Mido? This isn't funny...\" Mido then muttered to himself wondering how he wasn't picked for this thing. Mido grumbled as he continued his dispute over the subject. \" Hmmprh! I don't believe it! You aren't even fully equipped yet! How do you think you're going to help the Great Deku Tree without both a sword and shield ready?\" the boy said, holding his nose up high. Both Link and Navi crossed their arms at this statement. \"But you don't have your equipment either Mido.\" Link said, looking rather irritated and puzzled at his peer. \"Ehhh well yeah...You're right. I don't have my equipment ready, but... If you want you pass through here, you should at least equip a sword and shield! Sheesh!\" Navi grew quite irritated, seeing as she couldn't let her guardian down because of such trivial matters. \"Oh come on Mido, stop being a brat and let us see him!\" \"....Hmmprh.\" Mido simply grunted and tilted his head as to say \"no\" to the fatty fairy. \"Errrgghh...*sigh* come on Link let's go and find a Deku shield, one of my friends said there was one in stock at the store...\" \"Alright, I'll be back Mido!\" Link said with frustration growing in his voice. But before the two could get too far Navi stopped Link and flew back to Mido and let out a massive fart in his face. \"Hmmph, that'll show you...\", the blue fairy said slapping her jiggly behind at him. Mido began to tear up and cough from the smell. \" *cough cough* haack urrrhaaa! W-what was that for?\" Mido shouted as he rubbed his irritated eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the duo made their way to the shop they noticed something odd... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Link and his flabby fairy companion could get to the village shop, their attention was drawn to Link\u2019s house. A large roll of fat was stuck fast in Link\u2019s doorstep. While Navi didn\u2019t know what this meant, Link instantly knew what had happened. As he climbed the ladder to his house Navi heard him muttering about how he knew this would happen. When he got to the large roll he just gave it a firm push. There was a loud popping sound as he saw Saria tumble to the ground after being unstuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria was almost twice as big as when the two had seen her two hours ago. When Link checked the secret tunnel he kept his food in she appeared to have eaten about half of Link\u2019s private stash of food. Of course, it hadn\u2019t been so much of a stash rather then a stockpile for Armageddon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria had gorged herself until she weighed twice her original weight, so now her weight was 1670 pounds of fat. Her dress had been ripped to shreds, and she sat naked in Link\u2019s bedroom. Each of her breasts was about the size of Link\u2019s bed and her ass cheeks were the same size. Her arms and legs were now about 50 inches thick, and her belly covered the entire floor. She smiled up at Link with cheeks that looked like they were stuffed with basketballs and about twenty chins. This still didn\u2019t mar her pretty face, so she tried to give Link the most innocent look she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSaria, what am I going to do with you?\u201d asked Link, \u201cYou know that food was mine and look what happened, You\u2019re too big to get out of my house. So I ask again, what will I do with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeed me some more?\u201d Saria asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow why would I-\u201c Link was interrupted midsentence by the sounds of gorging. He raced down the secret tunnel and saw his new fairy happily munching on a rather large cake. He picked Navi up and brought her back to his bedroom where Saria was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese fairy now weighed about 900 grams, and was only that small because Link had interrupted her feast before she could really get going. She started screaming at Link in a rather pissed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck was that for?\u201d she yelled, \u201cI was enjoying that cake and you had to go and take it away from me! How are we going to get out of here with this silly girl stuck in your house-Ooomph!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi\u2019s rant had been cut short by a slap from Saria\u2019s hand. Amazingly Saria stood up without any visible strain.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I\u2019m not stuck at all!\u201d Saria said calmly. \u201cI just pretended to be so I could talk to Link. I heard Mido telling Link to get a sword and shield before he could go see the Great Deku Tree. There is a Kokori Sword through a small hole near the Know-It-All Brothers\u2019 house. As for a shield, I\u2019ve got a spare right here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria lifted one of her many flab rolls and a Deku shield fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo get the sword and meet me at the Great Deku Tree when you are ready,\u201d Saria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded and jumped down from his tree house. He started walking over to the house he had been told to go to, when one of the Know-It-All brothers stopped him and gave him a long explanation about dungeon maps. Then the second brother started talking to him about equipment. Finally, the third brother started a well-rehearsed speech about buying items. This explanation was so pointless that Link just charged past the brothers and dived into the hole in their garden wall. Halfway through the hole Link realized that he had left his two obese female friends in his house with his food stores still exposed. He groaned, as Saria was liable to really be stuck since the food got more fattening as the tunnel went on. Navi was also bound to make a pig out of herself, and at least double her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink decided he would get the sword and return to his house to survey the damage. He spent a few wild minutes avoiding boulders, until he reached the chest with the sword in it. He quickly took the sword and rushed back to his house as fast as he could. He reached his house, dashed up the ladder and entered his room. He looked  to the center of the room and saw exactly what he had expected. The room was empty but the entrance to his tunnel was open. Link climbed down the hole and began the half mile walk to the back of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the end of the tunnel, Link saw that as he had expected, all of his food was gone. In its place was a gently sleeping Saria. Saria \u2018s flabby body was covering the floor, hiding it from view. In addition there was a small ball of flesh resting on her belly that was emmiting a pale blue glow. Link picked up the ball, which he knew to be Navi, and gave her a slight squeeze. Navi didn\u2019t wake up, but she did turn in her sleep and snuggle closer to Link. Navi had doubled in size and was now a 2lb ball of flesh. She was still too small to make out any real details of her body though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Link looked back to Saria and took in her body. Saria had more than tripled in size and was now weighing in at about 5000lbs. Her belly was a 10 foot long and 10 foot wide apron of flesh, starting out rolly beneath her breasts and becoming an expanse of soft, smooth, flab after that. Each of Saria\u2019s breasts were the size of one of the pehats Link had seen in the sky sometimes. They rested lazily on her belly, and rose and fell seductivly with Saria\u2019s breathing. Her ass cheeks were also each as big as a pehat, and were supporting the flabby girl in her sleep. Her arms and legs were each 70 inches thick, and ended in feet or hands nearly covered by fat. Her face was overwhelmed by pudge, but was still quite cute.

A flaw appeared in his plan almost immediately. Saria was so soft and so fat, that instead of pushing her, Link was just sinking into her flab. Link continued to push anyway, hoping to find some muscle or bone to get a good purchase on. Finally he hit muscle, and with a mighty push, Saria's torso moved. Saria stepped forward, and with a loud pop she shot out the door and smashed through the house's railing, taking Link over the side with her.<br>\r\nLuckily, it was only a 15 foot drop, so Saria's enormous breasts and belly cushioned her fall. Link was also lucky, and fell onto Saria's titanic ass. This made the obese, green haired girl give a small moan, as her sensitivity had increased greatly, along with the rest of her. <br>\r\n\"Hey Link,\" Navi said from the top of the house, \"You enjoying yourself down there?\"<br>\r\nThis comment made both Link and Saria blush, and Link jumped down to the ground as Saria stood up and dusted herself off. Navi flew down and began to hover aside Link.<br>\r\n\"C'mon you two,\" Navi said, \" The Great Deku Tree is waiting for us.\"<br>\r\nThe trio headed off towards the Tree's clearing, but were soon stopped by Mido. <br>\r\n\"So you got a sword and shield, huh,\" Mido said, \" It doesn't matter, I'm still not letting you past.\"<br>\r\n\"Mido, get out of our way,\" Saria said, \" The Great Deku Tree wanted to see us, and he said it was urgent.\"<br>\r\n\"Make me, fat-ass,\" said Mido, \"Why would he want to talk to a whale like you anyway? You look like you can barely walk. Maybe you should fix that by stuffing your face like you usually do.\" <br>\r\nLink saw Saria's face become almost red with rage. With a swing of one of her blubbery arms, Saria sent Mido crashing into a wall with a sickening thud. Then she started down the path to the Tree's grove, and the others followed her. After a mile or so, link started to hear sobs coming from Saria. After a few more steps, he spoke up.<br>\r\n\"Saria, you don't need to pay any attention to what Mido said,\" Link said, \"You've always been pretty, and today you look better than ever. Besides, I know you like being fat, why else would you have eaten all of my food?\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, Saria swept Link up in her arms and kissed him.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Link, She said with a tear, \"You always say the nicest things to me.\"<br>\r\nThen she hugged him tightly, and lowered him to the ground.<br>\r\n\"I wished I could hug people like that,\" Navi thought to herself, \"Honestly, I really wish I was human instead of a tiny fairy.\"<br>\r\nWhen they turned around the corner, they finally saw the Great Deku Tree. The Tree saw them and spoke to them.<br>\r\n\"About time you kids got here,\" he said, \"I don't have much time, so I'll make this quick. Some jerk cursed me so I need you to go to my deepest roots, and kill the embodiment of that curse.\"<br>\r\nWith that, the Tree opened its mouth and the trio rushed inside.

Link was hoping this was just a dream, and that he would wake up to his normal life. (Un)fortunately, this was all very real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll go talk to Great Deku Tree about this, and I'm sure he'll know how to get you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Link started to walk out of his house, Saria's massive gut let out a tremendous growl.

As Link rubbed his ear, he looked at what Navi was pointing to. To the side of the shop's entrance was a sign. \"<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">ATTENTION!!:</font></b><b>Deku Sheild now back in stock! price: 60 rupees.</b> \"60 rupees?! That's ridiculous!\" Navi exclaimed fluttering about in a crazed fashion. \"Hmmph, well I guess you'll have to use up most the rupees in your wallet...\" Navi sighed, placing her hands on her hips. \"Actually...I don't have any rupees...at all.\" \"What? How can not have <i>any</i> rupees?!\" Link merely shrugged his shoulders, up until this point never having nor needing any rupees in his possession. \"*sigh* \"Well I guess we got go around and find some...<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Can't believe the kid chosen by The Deku Tree doesn't even have a rupee to his name.\"</font> Navi said flying towards the many bushes about the Kokiri Forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 20 minutes of Link searching through the bushes and grass for rupees and Navi committing to eating well...all the bushes and grassy roots Link went through, they had amasses a total of 30 rupees and were currently working through the Kokiri Training Grounds. \"Uurrrp, so why are there so many rupees in these bushes anyway?\" Navi belched after eating yet another uprooted bush Link had thrown. \"I've heard rumors of them being placed there by tiny forest beings...\" \"What? That's crazy, that doesn't make any sense at all, anyway are we done yet?\" \"We would be close if you hadn't eaten that red rupee stuck in that bush earlier.\" Link said with a faint annoyance at the fairy's surplus appetite. \"Hey! It looked like big fruit from my viewpoint, besides we only lost 20 rupees worth from it.\" the light blue obese fairy said as she bobbed repeatedly into Kokiri child's body. A few minutes later after uprooting a bush at the south wall, the two found a small tunnel. \"Hey what's through here?\" Link said crouching to peer through. Getting on his knees he began to crawl through the small opening. \"Hey!\" Navi yelled, following him inward. Once Link had made his way to the other side he got and walked into a clearing. \"Woah...what kind of area is this?\" Navi said flying in from behind. Link looked around, taking note of the high walls and straight paths. \"It kinda looks like a maze don't....hmmm?\" At that moment the boy heard a loud rumbling coming from behind him. The two turned around to see a huge boulder rolling towards them.  \"Ahhhhh!\" Link and Navi screamed, in an instant the two of them dove into an alcove, just barely getting run over by the large rock. \"That was close...\" Navi said as she laid on Link's stomach, her belly heaving up and down from her sudden increase of stress.  Link, taking a moment to get his thoughts clear again peered his head around the corner only to see the exact same boulder come right at him. \"Aghhh!\" At that point Navi got an idea. \"Hey Link, let's follow it, that way it won't surprise us anymore.\" Link nodded in agreement and began to run up to the rolling rock, making sure to be close enough to not lose track of it, but far enough to not get hit by it. Oddly enough, instead of crashing into the wall whenever the boulder came up to one it just turned into the path of grass, like a living creature would. As Link and Navi followed the boulder they found several blue rupees making their total a grand 70 rupees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright finally! We got enough to buy that damn shield! and even a little extra!\" Navi bounced in the air, happy she could finally get on with her duty. Navi then noticed something off to the left in another alcove. \"Hey look over there Link!\" \"Hmm?\" Upon looking inwards into the alcove the boy saw a rather large chest at the end of it. \"Ooohh let's see whats in it, maybe there's some food in it!\" Navi drooled at her benign assumption, Link just rolled his eyes,ignoring the insatiable winged glutton flying next to him. Reaching up to open it, Link's eyes gleamed with a great fascination towards what he saw. Picking it up he thrust it above his head. \"Yeah! I found the Kokiri Sword!\" \"Hey look there's a note!\" Navi said flying inside and picked it up. \"This is the hidden sword of the Kokiri, you can borrow it for awhile. Be sure to practice with it before you fight....Well now that we got both a sword and a shield let's go tell Mido to get out of our way!\" Navi said pumping her fist into the air and flew off rather quickly for a fairy her size back to the tunnel. \"Hey wait up!\" Link said following her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon making their way back out from the grounds, down below next to Link's house they saw Saria, only she seemed to be covered in a large amounts of food, and her dress was now the bare minimum of modesty. \"Saria!\" Link said jumping down, landing near the possibly half ton Kokiri girl. \"*chew* *munch* BBBUUURRRRPPP!!!!...Oh hi Link, I....didn't expect you to come back here so quickly, hehe but oh well...I found your secret stash of food!\" Saria said somewhat ashamed of herself but nonetheless overjoyed at getting to fill her gargantuan belly up with more food. \"WHAT?!\" Navi screamed, \"You mean you had a whole stash of food, and you didn't tell me about it?!\" Navi was furious, disappointed her companion had kept what had to have been a large amount of food given how Saria seemed to have gained an extra 200 pounds from it all. Bewildered, Link responded rather angrily. \"It wasn't for you! I was saving that for special occasions, and I kept it secret cause I knew Saria would try and search for it...*sigh* Well, at least you're happy...and you look even better than before. \"Uuurrppp. Thanks Link, and for what it's worth I'm sorry for pigging out on your food, oh hey you got a sword!\" Saria cheerfully said, pointing a thick finger at the boy's new equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah had to get it to because of Mido.\" Link said pointing his thumb over to where the \"boss\" of the Kokiri was standing. \"Oh that bum! I don't know why he's always so mean to everyone! Look you go on and talk to the Great Deku Tree...I'll deal with him.\" Saria said as she smirked about her plans on how to deal with the bratty Kokiri. \"Alright see ya later, come on Link let's get that shield!\" \"Ok, bye Saria!\" Link waved back to his friend, as he ran off to the shop once again. \"Ok, now to get back that baked Baba head in my fifth chin.\" Saria murmured as she dug her fingers into her flabby chin folds for more food to munch upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Link,...\" Navi asked innocently. \"You got any more food?\" \"Believe me, if I had any left from what Saria ate, YOU wouldn't get it.\" \"Ugghh you're so unfair.\" Navi said puffing her cheeks and crossing her arms, just as they made their way into the Kokiri Shop. Link then made his way to the counter. \"Hey welcome to the Kokiri Shop.\" the shopkeeper said in slightly bored tone, due to the slow activity the shop had been having recently.  Looking at the current stock, Link and Navi could see that the store was selling Deku Nuts in bulk of five and ten for 15 and 30 each, arrows 10 and 30 for 20 and 60 rupees each, which was odd considering no one in Kokiri Forest even owned a bow currently. They also saw Deku seeds, Deku sticks, the shield they needed, and these moderately sized hearts for 10 rupees. \"I'll have that shield. Link said to the shopkeep. \"60 rupees...\" the shopkeep responded \"Anything else?\" Hmm....\" Link surveyed the ware, he only had 10 rupees left, should he save for later or buy something else?  \"Oh oh! buy a heart Link!\" Navi pointed at the heart shaped thing. Link was a bit weary in buying it, but...Navi seemed to want it so why not, it's not like he needed anything else from this store. \"Alright give me one those hearts.\" \"10 rupees\" Link gave the shopkeep the last of his rupees and grasped the nearly head-sized item in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this thing?\" Link said. \"I don't know but I'm gonna find out!\" Navi then shot towards Link, grabbed it from out of his hands, and chomped down the whole thing in one bite. \"Hey!, you greedy fairy! Maybe I wanted a taste!\" \"BBBBUUUUURRRRRPPPPP!!!!! Ah that was delicious...ohhhh!\" At that moment Navi plumped up from the contents of the edible heart. \"What the...\" Link said surprised by what just happened. By the looks of it that one heart had made the fat fairy gain an immediate 50 or so fairy pounds.  She now had a noticeable increase in the amount of fat in her belly and breasts, her breasts were about the size of one of Link's eyes, and her belly spilled out even further now, being a fourth the size of Link's head. She now had an extra 5th chin and her arms, legs and ass had filled out considerably. The blue fairy probably weighed about 600 fairy pounds (that's 600 grams for you normal folks) now. \"Oh man, we need to get those more often, I love what they do for me!\" Navi cheerfully exclaimed flying around in a frenzied manner, her flabby rolls jiggling about. \"Yeah, yeah come on you fat blue ball, let's go see Mido and finally get to the Deku Tree.\" \"Right!\" Navi shouted as she flew forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Link I already told you, if you want you pass through here, you should at least equip a sword and shield!\" \"Hmmph well I do have one!\" Link said turning around to show the jerk his newly acquired shield. \"Eh, what's that? Oh, you have a Deku Shield, and what's <i>that</i>? Is that the Kokiri Sword?! Good grief! Well,... even with all that stuff, a wimp is still a wimp, huh? I, the great Mido, will never accept you as one of us!\" Mido said scowling in defiance. \"Whatever, see you Mido!\" Link said running off, laughing to himself. \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Shoot! How did you get to be the favorite of Saria and the Great Deku Tree?</font>\" Mido grumbled under his breath. He then saw Saria coming up to him, looking at him rather... creepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Running past a small group of Deku Babas, swiftly dodging their meek attempts of snapping at the two, Link and Navi made their into the grove of the Great Deku Tree, where Saria was waiting alongside him. \"Hey Link!\" the young Kokiri girl waved at the boy, smiling delightfully as her 800+lb body was sprawled out on the grass.<br>\r\n\"Wha? Saria how'd you get here before us?\" Link said as he approached the giant tree. Rather perplexed how a 800lb girl had somehow gotten here before him, he knew he had seen her only minutes ago just before the two had talked with Mido, completely indulged in eating the rest of her food, so it just seemed impossible.<br>\r\n\"Oh I'll tell ya later, right now you must listen to the Great Deku Tree.\" Looking up at the wise guardian, the tree told the boy his words...<br>\r\n\"Link... Welcome... Listen carefully to what I, the Deku Tree, am about to tell thee... Thy slumber these past moons must have been restless, and full of nightmares...\"<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Why does he always speak like that?</font>\" Link whispered over to Saria. <br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">I think it was the proper way of speech when he was young.</font>\"<br>\r\n\"As the servants of evil gain strength, a vile climate pervades the land and causes nightmares to those sensitive to it... Verily, thou hast felt it... Link... The time has come to test thy courage... I have been cursed... I need you to break the curse with your wisdom and courage. Dost thou have courage enough to undertake this task?\" Navi grew surprised upon hearing the Deku Tree had been cursed.<br>\r\n\"Cursed?! But how?\" the fairy questioned fluttering about haphazardly. <br>\r\n\"That is not of importance as of now, thou must relinquish the curse inside me before I can give you such information.\" Deku Tree bellowed. \"Now Link, dost you have courage to venture inside me and vanquish the evil that lay within?\" Without a moment of hesitation, Link answered back with full confidence.<br>\r\n\"Yes Great Deku Tree, I'm ready.\" the boy immediately drew out his sword and shield.\" The Great Deku Tree then let out a loud rumbling sound as the lower portion of his body opened up, resembling a mouth.<br>\r\n\"Then enter, brave Link, and thou too, Navi and Saria, the boy has never ventured inside and it would be best if you two helped him along...\" the two nodded in a determined manner, their multitude of chins smushing into each other as they did. As the trio ventured into the depths of the tree, the 600g fairy then suddenly flew backwards, flying up to the great tree's hoard of leaves. Plucking several of them off of the branches. <br>\r\n\"Gotta keep my strength up.\" Navi said justifying her gluttonous action. Link rolled his eyes, while Saria merely stifled a giggle, finding amusement in the fairy's obsession with the Great Deku Tree's leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way into first chamber of the tree Link noticed the odd structure of the inner dwellings of the Great Deku Tree. \"What's with this place?\" the Kokiri boy questioned, taking notice of the large webbing on the floor and number of ladders placed throughout the layers of floors.<br>\r\n\"A lot of the stuff in here was added by Kokiris long ago, though pretty much all the ones who did this work have become Skull Kids since then...\" Saria answered looking around with a sort of melancholic look on her face. Waddling over to the huge webbing in the middle of the floor, Saria got down onto her knees, pushed her jutting belly inward as much as she could to get it out of her view, and peered down it's holes. \"Well....we don't want to fall down this thing, we're gonna have to find some way to burn this stuff or something to get down there.\"  Link then nodded, then he suddenly realized something. <br>\r\n\"Hey Saria....where's your fairy, she's not lost in your fat again is she?\" Saria blushed remembering a number of times where due to Sermilla liking to take a nap in the girl's fatty rolls, she often ended up getting stuck in there, needing to be dug out with help from the Kokiris holding up Saria's folds.<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I left her at my house, I didn't think it would be necessary to bring her along.\" crossing her arms she sighed. \"I guess I can't really go back now to get her, not that it would be necessary anyway...\"<br>\r\n\"Hey! Are you two gonna stand here talking or we actually going to get something done?!\" Navi shouted, reminding the two kids of just what was important. Running over to the ladder that was snared deep into the bark of the wall to ensure it keeping strength, Link climbed up, running up the winding pathway until realizing Saria, at her weight might need help. \"Uh...need any help?\" Link called down to his friend, still on the bottom floor.<br>\r\n\"No, I may  be big and full of flab, but I can still move around like you Link.\" Chuckling to herself, Saria grasped the rungs and heaved herself upward, slowly but surely pulling herself up each rung. Straining herself slightly Saria let out a light fart upon making it to the top, after relaxing her muscles. Amazingly, despite weighing nearly half a ton the girl barely showed signs of sweat on her body. Link and Navi could only stare on in amazement and admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you capable of that?\" Navi said flying up next to the girl, her fat grazing Saria's chins as she looked into the girl's blue eyes. <br>\r\n\"Hmmph.\" the girl grunted, taking pride in her athletic prowess. \"You may not know this, cause you have wings and Link over there has never been fat, but we Kokiri are pretty fit, even with a belly like this...\" she said giving the thick layer of blubber a hard slap, a slap which resonated a sound that bounced all around the circular walls of the tree. Continuing up the spiraling pathway, the trio came across a large chest. Opening it up they found that it was a map, oddly named \"Dungeon Map of the Deku Tree\". Perplexed, Link asked Saria if she knew why. \"...Must be some sort of playful name done by whoever drew this... look at this thing Link, whoever drew this map must've been really determined, they've got every nook and cranny of the Deku Tree written on here.\" <br>\r\n\"Well this should really helpful!\" Navi shouted as she fluttered about the piece of parchment. \"Though...I don't suppose you two have any way to keep track of where we go?\" the fat fairy said nibbling on one of her leaves as she asked. Link merely shrugged, unable to come up with a way to do such a task. Saria thought for a bit then remembered she had something in her that just might work. <br>\r\n\"I think I have an idea, Link can you reach around in that roll right there on the left side of my belly?\" Puzzled, and admittedly happy to do so, Link pushed his hand deep into the recesses of fat on Saria's stomach, feeling around he felt a soft, liquidity feel on his fingers, taking hold of whatever it was he pulled out and found several blueberries, that somehow weren't crushed by the girl's tremendous fat. <br>\r\n\"These?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, now Navi... give me one of your leaves.\" Hearing this Navi flew up above Saria's head and held dearly to the piece of flora. \"What?! No, get your own! These are mine to eat!\" Huffing at the fairy's hunger tracked mind, Saria gave her response. <br>\r\n\"Not to eat you winged nut, I just need one for these berries.\" Quickly swiping a single leaf from the determined, albeit weak grasp of the fairy, Saria crushed a few of the berries between her thick fingers, and smeared the resulting liquid and bits onto the leaf. Finding the area marked \"floor 1\" on the map, she brushed the leaf over the large circle on the areas with the blue juices. \"There...now since we know this part of the \"dungeon\" has already been trespassed by us three, we know which rooms we've been to and which ones we haven't, all we got to do is check our surroundings to make sure we don't color in the wrong room.\"<br>\r\n\"Boy aren't we lucky you tagged along Saria? Link would've been stuck here without you.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Link angrily shouted, swatting the fairy to the side, annoyed and embarrassed by her comment. Giggling at the two's odd bond, as even Mido had a better relation with his fairy, Saria injected. \"Oh I'm sure Link can do just fine without me, it's not like marking this map is vital to us getting around in here.\" <br>\r\n\"Well whatever, ok Link, onward!\" Navi said, flying towards the vine wall, near a pair of Skulltulas.<br>\r\n\"Uh Navi...\" Link said pointing a fact out to the fairy, \"We can't climb up there with those spiders there, they'll knock us down.\" <br>\r\n\"Well...yeah you're right, I would just eat 'em for ya, but... I ate one of their babies once, and it didn't agree with me all too well, I'm not risking eating an <i>adult</i> one, maybe we can find something to knock 'em down.\"<br>\r\nMaking their way to the top part of the pathway, the three found what looked like a door in the wall, however it didn't seem to have any way of opening, due to it being flat and bare. <br>\r\n\"How do we open this?\" Saria asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh! Link put some pressure on it with your and hands and push upwards!\" Navi exclaimed excitedly. Wondering just how the fairy figured this out, the two took the fairy's word and followed her order. Placing his hands on the door he put his weight inward onto the door's surface then shifted his strength upwards, and suddenly and surprisingly, it slid up into a small alcove above it. Walking over to it Saria looked up into where it went, wondering just how it worked. <br>\r\n\"How did you know that Navi?\" Saria asked. Scratching her belly, Navi responded cheekily. <br>\r\n\"Hehe fairy's intuition.\" Suddenly the door came shooting down, though given Saria's great girth and huge amount of fat it was stopped in it's decent rather quickly. Belching from the sudden pressure, Saria told to them to hurry through. \"BBBUUURRRPPP!!! Link come on, get in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking ahead, the three saw in the very box-like was nothing. \"Huh?\" Navi said floating about. What's the point of making a room like this with nothing in it?\" Link slowly walked forward, looking for anything suspicious, the boy then stepped onto a small bush, doing so it quivered suddenly. \"Huh? Peering down to get a better look at the plant, Link was then suddenly blasted into the air, knocked off his feet by the bush rising up from the ground. \"A Deku Scrub!\" Saria exclaimed, taking note of the wooden being. \"Whats a Deku Scrub?\" Link rubbed his head, getting himself off the ground. \"You don't know?\" Saria rested her palm on the side of her head. these scrubs are natives of the Lost Woods and some of them take residence inside the Great Deku Tee, like this one here.\" \"The--Ahhh!\" Saria yelped as a fist sized nut hit her in the face, leaving a large red mark across the middle of her face and nose. The scrub chuckled at it's successful attack \"Hey!\" Link ran up, sword ready, the scrub realizing danger plummeted back into the earth. Trying to stab the sword into the top of the scrub, Link found it useless as the sword was simply to small and dull to pierce the Deku's upper layer of leaves. \"Hmmph...stupid weed!\" Link barked at the cowardly plant being, kicking it's leaves with his foot. \"Are you alright Saria?\" Navi said, flying over, having watched everything from up above. \"Yeah...I'm fine, but why is that Deku Scrub attacking us? Most of them are quite non aggressive...\" The scrub then popped out again, and fired a nut at Link who was walking back to Saria. \"Link!\" Navi and Saria both yelled as it hit him in the back, but as it was the nut rebounded off his shield and flew back into the scrub, knocking it out of it's nest. \"Link on its back, look!\" Saria pointed to the thing latched onto the scrub's back, a small purple bulge of sorts was leeching off the scrub. Link drew his sword and dashed at the scrub, and after a few good slashes, the bulge burst, leaving the scrub free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking in a frightened manner the scrub did a small bow and hopped hurriedly back to it's nest and burrowed deep into the ground. \"What was that \"thing\"?\" Saria questioned, disturbed by the image of such a horrid object controlling a scrub like that. \"I don't know...but it's probably due to whatever's cursing the Deku Tree.\" Link repsonded as he walked to the door. Making their way into the room Link saw a large chest on a ledge with a large, gray floating platform in front. Finally a room without danger, alright let's go.\" Saria said hopping onto the platform nearly taking up the stone's space with her whole body. As she tried to jump again, Saria felt an odd rumbling... \"Hmm, hold on you two, I think I'm about to..\" but then the platform fell out of the air, and into the floor, crumbling into dust instantaneously. \"Uwa!\" Link gasped at Saria's fall and the sudden change of gravity on the platform. \"Heh, nevermind.\" Saria said, pushing her bulbous 800lb self up, grasping the ivy wall she began to climb upwards. \"Well, what are you two waiting for? Link and Navi nodded and jumped down onto the opposite ivy wall. Opening the chest Link took out a slingshot, inscribed on it was \"Fairy Slingshot\"  \"Hmm...\" Link pondered at the name. \"Wait a minute how we get back?!\" Navi screamed, realizing there was no way to get back the door. \"Look.\" Link said, pointing up to a ladder covered in webbing. \"Alright Link, now here use--\" Saria said, taking a small pouch out from the chest before seeing Link had other ideas. Link then grabbed Navi, squeezing her flabby 600g body and placing it into the pouch of the slingshot. \"W-wait Link what are you--Ahhhhhh!\" Navi screamed once more as the boy sent her shooting into the ladder. \"Ooof!\" Navi groaned as she pushed into the ladder, falling along with it to the floor. Saria merely looked on in amazement at how Link could do something so...ignorant. \"Uhh Link?\" Saria tapped his shoulder and showed him a small parchment and a pouch in her hand. \"You found our slingshot! Handcrafted by fairies of old from the wood of the Deku Tree himself, this slingshot has helped many a Kokiri in need for ages. NOTE: Despite being called the \"Fairy Slingshot\" it does not shoot fairies.\" \"Ohh..hehe\" Link muttered in embarrassment as Saria dropped the pouch into his hand, giving him a sort of motherly look of disappointment. \"Uhhh... oh man... LINK!!!\" Navi shouted bashing her blubber into his face, pounding into him in furious anger. \"What the hell was that for?! You could've killed me!\" \"S-sorry, it said \"<b>Fairy Slingshot </b>\" I thought that's what it meant...and hey you got the ladder down!\" \"Hmmph...\" Navi merely turned her head, refusing to talk to him for the time being. As the three made their way into more sections of the tree, they found a compass which was useless, and then found themselves at the top of the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...there's nothing else up here...\" Navi said, fluttering about Saria's head. \"Looks like we've got to go down past that webbing.\" Saria noted on her knees, peering down from an outward ledge, taking care to keep as much of her heavy fat on the floor as possible. \"All the way down?! It took forever just to get up here...maybe we can jump down...\" Link said, hoping he wouldn't have to go the long way down. \"Jump?! Link I can barely see the bottom from here, I don't think I could survive that, and I've got all this stuff...\" Saria then took hold of her large belly folds, letting them drop onto her lower side flab with a resounding slap. \"...to cushion my fall.\" \"Aw come on Saria, we'll have the web itself to slow us down, besides I think I see some water down there, that should also help.\" \"Well...alright grab hold of me Link, I want to make sure you survive this, you too Navi.\" \"Why? Unlike you two I can fly.\" the fairy said matter of factly, flapping her wings extra fast for a few moments to emphasize them. \"Oh just get in here.\" Saria said pointing to her bellybutton. \"Fine...\" Navi nudged her way into the Kokiri's girl cavernous navel, making the girl giggle from the ticklish sensation. \"Hahalright...*gulp*...1....2........3! \"Waaaaaaahhhhh!!\" Link and Saria yelled as they fell onto the webbing Navi , it stretching immensely from the massive amount of weight and velocity of the two children. *SPLASH!!!* Nearly blasting out almost a foot's height of water out of the entire pool, the two Kokiri were drenched in water, Saria's blubbery crevasses and folds holding in 20lbs worth of water alone. \"Well...I must say that wasn't as bad as I thought it would, it was kind of exciting.\" Saria admitted as she squeezed her fat all over, getting rid of the water that laid in it. \"Yeah...\" Link said stopping as he noticed how Saria's clothes being wet draped over her body, clinging to her form, her heavy deku scrub sized breasts just barely fully covered by her top. Her bight green hair clung to her head, now a fair bit darker from absorbing water. She looked...different, Link had felt this before about Saria, but this time it really stuck in his mind how good she looked being so fat. \"Hey! Whatcha staring at Link?\" Navi asked to the boy, floating in front of his view. \"Wuh nothing nothing, c-come on let's keep going.\" Link said quickly as her twisted some water of his hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking their way into the next room,they saw a rather odd large iron spiked bar spinning across the entire room, with a platform floating across the water to the other side. \"What?! Okay, who designed this?! How did someone even put this in here?!\" Navi raged over the ridiculousness of the room's environment. \"It looks like some kind of puzzle....\" Saria said surveying the room. \"You think you can swim over there Saria, we could float on top of your body.\" \"I don't know Link...those spikes look pretty sharp, I'll get messed up real bad going under those things, my smooth belly will get all scratched and infected, hey wait...I see some kind of switch down there Link.\"  \"Hmm so there's a switch and a platform here...\" Link said as he thought over how to do this. \"Alright here goes. Hup!\" Link jumped into the pool, swimming down to press the switch which then opened up hidden holes at the bottom, draining the water enough for the platform to pass under the spikes with generous space between them. Quickly the boy swam back, got onto the platform as Saria jumped into the water, too big to get on with him, swimming underwater to the other side. Crouching as he passed under the spikes, Link then jumped off onto the other side of the room, with Saria climbing out alongside him and Navi simply flying over. Taking out the giant skulltula, Link and Saria pushed the block up to the ledge above, climbed atop, and then made their way into a circular room with a Deku Baba. After killing it and taking the stick from it's remains, Link wondered what to do. \"Hmm...\"*twang!* Well these bars on the door aren't going anywhere. \"Maybe we've got to light these other torches using the lit one here.\" Navi said, basking in the fire's warmth. \"How would that work?\" Saria said perplexed by such a concept. \"It makes as much sense as the rest of everything in this place...Waitaminute who puts a LIT TORCH inside the GREAT DEKU TREE?!\" Navi raged again as she realized the stupidity of having fire inside a tree. \"Well whatever... let's try it.\" Link responded, taking out a stick from Saria's flab, lighting it, then using it to light the other torches, then immediately the door's bars lifted up. \"Huh....it worked.\" Saria said astounded, scratching her torso. Making their way into the next room, they stopped as they heard loud rustling from above. *boomp* *boomp* boomp* suddenly the three were surrounded by some very odd looking creatures. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three then found themselves surrounded by fairly large, one eyed arachnoid creatures. \"N-navi what are these things?!\" Saria asked in fear upon looking at the menacing things. \"I remember hearing about these from the the other fairies, they're the larvae of...uhhh some tektite like monster, I don't remember the name of it right now, watch out Link!\" Navi shouted to her companion as one of the larvae charged at the boy, it's eye turning into a reddish color as it narrowly missed the Kokiri boy. \"Ha take this!\" Grabbing his slingshot, Link took aim and shot a seed at the creature right as it turned back towards him. \"Kreeeeee!\" the monster screeched as the nut shot into it's large eye. It's eyelids blinking rapidly in horrid pain, it then called out to the other two larva. The other two, currently focusing on the large Kokiri girl and the fat fairy shifted their attention to the boy. Launching themselves at him, they wrapped their bodies around his arms, bringing Link down to the ground. \"Ugah Hey! Get-get off of me you little bastards!\" Link struggled as the arachnids held him down, keeping him from slashing at them with the Kokiri Sword. As the two continued to assault the boy, the other one readied to charge at the boy. \"Erggh...\" Link grunted as he braced for the impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then suddenly, Link heard the horrid screeching of the two larvae who had held him down,  seeing his friend Saria and his companion Navi fiercely chomping down on the two arachnids. \"Kraaaaaaaah!\" the two beasts shrieked in pain as the Kokiri girl and obese, blue fairy gulped down their bodies. Link quickly got up, blocked the incoming attack from the charging larva, and asked his partners just what inclined them to do such a thing. \"We mmhad to get hem boff you sommmehow Link!\" Saria blathered as she chewed through a thick portion of the beast's leg, now torn off from it's body. Navi, at first tried to reply but found herself too busy gnawing away at the remains of the other monster to attempt speech at the moment. Enraged at the sight of it's fallen siblings, the final larva charged once again at Link, only to be devoured in one gulp by a now horridly gargantuan fairy. \"CHOMP!\", Navi belched with tremendous gusto as her now 5lb blubbery self floated in mid air albeit, it took a tiny more effort then she was used to. \"BBBUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPP!!!!!! Oh yeah that thing really filled me up.\" Saria giggled as she wiped her lips of some left over juices from the remnants of the creature. \"Well... come on let's keep going.\" Link motioned to the two girls. After some more torch lighting and web burning the group found a small hole in the wall of which to crawl through. \"Huh, wonder where this leads to. Link kneeled down looking through the small hole. Crawling through more than halfway he turned back looking past Navi who was right behind him, he could see Saria standing there, not moving. \"Hey Saria, aren't you gonna come with us?\" \"Sorry but I don't think thats gonna be possible Link.\" she said slapping her gut, it wobbled for a few seconds, letting the boy know why she could not follow with him. \"Oh right... well stay safe then Saria.\" Link then crawled out from the hole, coming out into a room that looked rather familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd ya find?\" Saria called out from the other side. \"Its the higher area from the room we first fell into awhile ago....you know come to think of it we could've just climbed up to this part of the room using you as a stepladder of sorts.\" \"Oh yeah, hey wait for me will you Link? I'll get back to the room in a bit.\" After a bit of waiting and taking time to push down the block to the lower area, Saria appeared from the door on the lower area, using the block to get herself up more easily due to her weight. \"Well...now that you're here we can go down this hole.\" Grabbing a deku stick from Saria's folds, he then lit it from the nearby torch, and burned the webbing casing the hole in the floor. \"Is it safe?\" Navi said. Link, peering over the edge looked down below. \"I think I see a pool of water down there, it looks....wait, can't you just fly down there to check for us?\" Link questioned, wondering why his flying companion was nervous about falling. \"Well yeah...but there might be dangerous creatures down there, I'd have no way to defend myself.\" Navi turned around crossing her arms. \"You're gluttonous mouth is more then enough of a defense if you ask me.\" \"What?!\" Navi shouted in response to the boy's comment on her appetite.\" \"Now, now come on let's just do like we did before.\" Saria grabbed Link and Navi and fell into the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SPLASH!\" Upon making impact in the pool, the three...mostly Saria had once again become drenched in water, much of the water was now either in Saria's and Navi's folds are up on the floor of the room. \"Ugh, and I just got my hair dry after our first fall.\" Saria groaned irritated as she lifted and pulled on her flab, letting water run and fall out from her body.\"Sheesh, how far down does the Great Deku Tree go and where is this curse he has anyway?\" Link said in slight amazement at just how deep in the ground the insides of the ancient tree went. \"Well it can't be much farther till we find it's source, we've already been in every other area of his insides, this is the only place left.\" Saria stated as she waddled out onto the floor, shaking loose several pot's worth of water from herself. As the three made their way to the center of the room, walking towards the single door, from the edges of the room popped out three Deku Scrubs. \"You will not get to Queen Gomha!\" the scrubs shouted simultaneously as they attacked the trio. Dodging the attack, Link retorted \"And just who is that?!\" skillfully hitting one of them with a reflected nut with his shield. \"The queen has freed us from the horrid Great Deku Tree!\" \"Yes, she has freed all of us!\" the scrubs cried out in defiance to their ruler. \"So this \"queen\" is the one responsible for the Deku Tree's pain?!\" Navi, enraged flew at one of them using her weight to bash into it and knock it down, giving Link time to slash at the purplish almost egg like thing on it's back like the other scrub before. \"How dare you attack our brother!\" The other two scrubs shot a volley of nuts at the boy, blocking both nuts back the scrubs, the two were put into a daze, again Link destroyed the purple eggs on their backs. \"There, now you're truly free.\" Saria said, glad the scrubs were back to normal. Bringing themselves up, they bowed to their saviors. \"Th-thank for saving us from those parasites!\" \"Yes, but how did you know of their secret code to defeat them?\" \"Secret code?!\" Navi questioned in disbelief at the ridiculous statement. \"Did you not know? It had been set up that only if we were defeated in a certain order that we would truly be taken down, 2...3....1 see?\" the scrub motioned to their nests on the edge of the wall. \"That makes no sense at all...\" Link muttered at the impossibility of such a \"code\" \"Well, no matter, up in that room is the dreaded Queen Gomha, please you three defeat her and save the GREAT DEKU TREE!!! May the goddesses bless you!\" the three scrubs then hopped back to their nests and burrowed deep underground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the door, Link touched the wooden door and looked back at his companions. \"Well...this is it, are you two ready for whatever it is in there?\" \"After all this? No point in going back now.\" Navi responded. \"For the Great Deku Tree, I'm ready to face anything.\" \"Alright then guys...let's go.\" Making their way into the dark, large chamber, the three realized that it was strangely....empty. \"I don't understand, those scrubs told us the queen was in here.\" Link said as he walked slowly, sword and shield ready for any surprise attacks. \"Ahhh! Link up there!\" Saria screamed in horror, pointing up to the ceiling. Looking up Link saw a horrifying creature. \"Krraaaaaahhhhh!\" the monstrous arachnid dropped down onto ground, shaking the three violently. Queen Gomha was a terrifying monster, with 6 long blackish legs with splotches of red and green throughout them each adorned with long yellow, sharp claws. Two of them dangled above her head, with two red horns atop her head. In her head layed a single large, yellow eye with a green sclera and a red horizontal line with two red dots above and below it acting as her pupil.  Scared, but determined to win, Link fired off shot after shot of Deku Seeds, but alas, Gohma closed her eye every time, showing off incredible reflexes the boy simply could not get past. Jabbing her lengthy appendages at the group. Saria's blubber though thick, was not enough to shield her from the monster's attacks, and due to her weight was unable to dodge fast enough, resulting in her getting a rather deep gouge in her stomach. \"Aarrrrggggghhhhh!!\" Saria shouted in immense pain, blood running from her wound as she grasped it in her hand. \"SARIA!\" Navi and Link both said as they moved about the room dodging more attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gomha continued her attacks, Link made a great effort to keep Gomha's attention on him, away from Saria, who was slowly making her way to the door, away from the danger and to rest. \"Link, look, her eye is turning red, just like her larvae, maybe she's vulnerable just like them right before she attacks!\" Navi shouted to Link as she saw Gomha reering back her legs to attack the two. As Link took aim with his slingshot, Navi took to distracting the beast by flying near her eye, her glow being rather irritating to the arachnid. Firing a seed at the beast's red eye, Link made a direct hit, stunning the beast, it's eye turning blue, and her body becoming limp. \"Now Link!\" Saria screamed to the boy, still holding her bleeding fold of fat, her hand now covered in the red liquid. Link struck at the beast with his sword.</span></div></div>",

Link struck at the beast with his sword. Gomha then screeched out in pain, green blood fired out from her eye. \u201cKreeeeeeaahhh Yrraaaaaaggggghhhh!!!\u201d Gomha then suddenly pushed Link and Navi away, knocking the boy and the fairy down to the ground. Crawling back to the ceiling, the arachnid then did something truly bizarre and shot out the same purplish eggs the three had seen before. Crashing to the ground, the eggs shattered, revealing the larvae from before, but bigger looking, more developed. Dropping around eight, Link and Navi found themselves surrounded by the arachnid larvae.  Doing the same strategy from before to Link but in far greater number, the boy found himself completely held to the ground by five of the larvae, the other three charged at the boy repeatedly, bashing into the him, crying in pain as he felt a few bones in his ribs cracking. Unable to fight back and unable to move Link was helpless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on Link!\u201d  Navi, desperate to save her companion\u2026no her friend from death, she did the unthinkable and flew straight at the group of larvae using all her jaw strength to devour them all one by one. Consuming the first, she alerted the attention of the others, as they threw themselves at the fairy in a vain attempt to take her down, she continued biting and eating away at them. In a mere minute or so only one larva was left, Navi, belching out a leg or two, she charged at the last one, opening her mouth to an impossible degree, got most of it\u2019s head into her maw, the creature screeched and shrieked in terror as it was chomped to bits by the now massive 13 pound fairy. \u201cAlright Link, are you okay, can you still fight?\u201d she said flying over to the boy who was clutching his side. \u201cY-yeah, just go and check on Saria, we\u2019ve still got to deal with the queen here.\u201d Link growled as he got up, putting aside the pain in his chest to continue fighting the queen arachnid. Enraged at the gruesome death of her children, Gomha fell down from the ceiling, reeled her legs at Link and struck the ground near him, using his shield to block the attack, Link again shot at her red eye, now more green from all the blood from his previous attack. Hitting it again, the beasts cried out in pain, taking this moment, Link slashed with all his might into Gomha\u2019s eye. \u201cHaaaahh Haaaaah Yaaaaaaaaah!\u201d Link slashed and stabbed, getting the beasts\u2019 blood all over him self and the famed Kokiri Sword. With a final jumping slash attack, Link drove his sword deep through the beast\u2019s whole eye, crying out one final time, Gomha rose up for a second and then crumpled to the ground finally, her body then burst into a blue like energy, and disintegrated into bits of bluish flame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally\u2026 hey Navi how\u2019s Saria handling?!\u201d Link shouted over to the fairy, who was checking up on the Kokiri\u2019s stability. \u201cShe\u2019s not looking too good Link, this wound she got from Gomha looks really deep, and it\u2019s still bleeding. \u201cDamn, come on Navi help me bring her up\u2026can you still walk Saria?\u201d Saria, a little woozy from the blood loss, replied slowly. \u201cY-yeah\u2026huaaah *cough!* Eeehhhhh!\u201d as Link turned back to where the remains of Gomha, he noticed there were some things there that surprised him. A shining circle of blue light was rising from the ground, and near it was a large heart shaped thing, with a silver lining casing the red crystal that made up its structure. \u201cHey Navi, you know what that is?\u201d With wide eyes, Navi smiled in relief as she realized what was before them. \u201c*GASP!* Link, that\u2019s a rare Heart Container, I\u2019ve heard from the Deku Tree that they have incredible healing properties, come on bring Saria and yourself over to it.\u201d Limping over to the heart, the two Kokiri grabbed the large, silver lined heart, and pressed it to their bodies, immediately, the boy and girl felt a grand surge of energy flow through them,  in mere seconds all the blood Saria had lost and all the beginning bruises and bone damage Link had suffered was instantly recovered and back to normal. \u201cOh by the goddesses, it\u2019s as if we never got hurt in the first place!\u201d Saria said, amazed at how her body was fully healed, she made small jumps in response, her belly jiggling in her glee. \u201cOkay, okay, gimme that! I gotta see how this tastes!\u201d Navi greedily flew by them and snatched the container from their hands, eating the whole thing, an immense taste of sweetness and cherry-like flavor poured throughout her taste buds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026BBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazing!\u201d Navi burped tremendously as she then expanded outward in an explosion of blubbery fat, going from her already grand 13 pound body, the blue fairy shot up to 20 whole pounds, now larger then Link\u2019s head, it was a sight to see that she was still capable of flight, and even then, showed no signs of effort or stress, perhaps the heart container had a play in that. \u201cWell\u2026now what?\u201d Link noted as they stood in the deepest part of the Deku Tree. \u201cI think we should go into that ring of light.\u201d Saria responded, feeling as if the ring was something good. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d \u201cYeah, besides, I\u2019d hate to make the Great Deku Tree wait any longer for us, now that we\u2019ve saved him.\u201d \u201cOkay then let\u2019s go guys.\u201d Navi said cheerfully as they went into the ring. As they did the light enveloped their bodies, wrapping around them, they found themselves lifted off the ground, and thrust into a blinding light. The three then found themselves being sent down in front of the Deku Tree.</span></div></div>",

Thou hast verily demonstrated thy courage...

But I thought we removed the curse and turned you back to normal!\" Saria exclaimed, aghast at the sudden reveal that the Deku Tree is going to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thou may have lifted the curse from me, but  the curse had sapped far too much power from me to continue to live,\" the Deku Tree explained, \"Thou must know my time is short, so thou must listen carefully... Especially you, Navi, unless your gluttony is more important than thy tale...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 20-pound Navi, who was munching on the Great Deku's leaves, suddenly stopped to listen after the Deku Tree demanded her to. \"Oh, sorry,\" Navi said as she gulped down the remaining leaves in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...listen carefully... A wicked man of the desert cast this dreadful curse upon me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Great Deku Tree then told the tale to Link, Navi, and Saria about how the man from the desert casted the curse on him.  About how the man from the desert used his evil powers to search for the Sacred Realm and the Triforce. About how the three goddesses created Hyrule. About how the desert man should not have his hands on the Triforce.  Link and Saria were invested in the Great Deku Tree's tale, although Navi appeared to be struggling with holding in her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Though your valiant efforts to break the curse were successful, I was doomed before you started... Yes, I will pass away soon... But do not grieve for me... I have been able to tell you of these important matters... This is Hyrule's final hope... Link... Go now to Hyrule Castle... There, thou will surely meet the Princess of Destiny...\" The Great Deku Tree spoke to Link as he handed Link the Kokiri's Emerald, \"...Take this stone with you. The stone that man wanted to much, that he cast the curse on me... The future depends upon thee, Link... Thou art courageous...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you down, Great Deku Tree,\" Link answered, \"I will stop whoever is going after the Triforce, even if my life is at stake,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Saria, a great responsibility has also fallen into your hands...\" the Great Deku Tree spoke to Saria, \"...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the southeast corner of Hyrule, there thrived the lush forest that was the home of children known as the Kokiri. These children were watched over by the Great Deku Tree... who, to be honest, I never understood. He's a tree. A big tree, but still a tree. How is he supposed to protect anyone? Oh well, let's get to the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the Great Deku Tree could not do much, he could provide knowledge. Within his forest, there was a boy who he would have to inform of the threat that loomed overhead at that very moment, as that boy was the only one who could stop it. But the boy would surely suffer crippling stress if he were alone, so the Great Deku Tree called upon a young fairy girl to be the boy's companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Navi... Navi, where art thou? Come hither...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi quickly fluttered her small fairy wings once she heard the Great Deku Tree call for her. She flew as fast as she could towards the glade where the Great Deku Tree resided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving, the Great Deku Tree spoke of the evil presence that threatens Hyrule, \"Dost thou sense it? The climate of evil descending upon this realm...\" He went on about how he was powerless to stop it, but there was someone who could, \"It seems the time has come for the boy without a fairy to begin his journey... The youth whose destiny it is to lead Hyrule to the path of justice and truth...\" Navi intently listened to the Great Deku Tree, as there was no doubt a reason why he was confiding this information to her specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Great Deku Tree shocked Navi by giving her an order, \"Navi... go now! Find our young friend and guide him to me... I do not have much time left.\" Navi was surprised she was suddenly given such an important task over any of the other fairies, considering how she was... considerably more plump than the others. It wasn't noticeable by the Kokiri, as the light her body emits blocks sight of her form, but fairies, including herself, could see her doughy belly. But her self-reflection was interrupted by the Great Deku Tree, \"Fly, Navi, fly! The fate of the forest, nay, the world, depends upon thee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi immediately darted off to find the boy the Great Deku Tree spoke of. She spotted Mido standing at the entryway of the clearing, acting like he's important, which he isn't. Navi flew between Mido's legs to startle him, which caused him to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi looked around Kokiri Forest, trying to locate the boy who didn't have a fairy with him. All of the Kokiri she saw while circling the village had a fairy, so once Navi reached the edge of the village, she turned back around and headed straight towards the boy's house, as it was unlikely he went somewhere else so early in the morning. Navi aimed herself up with the gap in the gate she had to pass through in order to reach the boy's home, and rushed to it. She aimed too low though, and her belly got caught on the bottom of the gap, flinging her back, \"A-Ah! Did I really gain that much weight?\" Navi muttered to herself as she grabbed her fleshy gut and shook it to see the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter passing through the gate, Navi entered the hollowed out tree, and saw the young boy on a rather small bed, appearing to not be sleeping well. The Great Deku Tree needed to see the boy, so Navi had no other option but to wake him up, \"Hello, Link! Wake up! The Great Deku Tree wants to talk to you!\" Link just continued struggle in his sleep, so Navi talked louder, \"Link, get up! Hey! C'mon! Can Hyrule's destiny really depend on such a lazy boy?\" Finally, Navi heard Link yawn as he sat up, meaning she managed to wake him. Link looked up at the fairy, and...</span></div></div>",

Well, that was due to it being rather small for a forest, but whatever. Navi then saw Link's friend Saria running towards them. Once spotting Link, Saria looked up to greet him, \"Yahoo! Hi, Link!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter climbing down his ladder, Link walked over to Saria, whom he greeted with a handshake. Saria went on about how happy she was to see that Link now has a Fairy for a little bit before they parted ways, waving each other goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComplications arose due to one of Nature's biggest mistakes, but Link was better prepared because of this, having retrieved the Kokiri Sword. Link was eventually able to meet with the Great Deku Tree, who told Link about an evil curse placed upon him. Some monotonous exposition later, and he opens his mouth to give Link entry to the first dungeon he will have to explore: inside the Great Deku Tree himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly felt odd for them, seeing the Great Deku Tree from the inside. They took in their new surroundings of bark &amp; foliage clinging to the walls. Navi fluttered about, scouting out the area, but Link had his eyes focused on the large spider web below them, noting the hole in the floor covered by it. Navi flew back to Link, \"Do you think that's where we have to go?\" Link responded with a simple nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink tried to cut the silk with his sword, but it was too thick, which also gave him trouble pulling it back out. Navi tried to force her way through a gap in the spider silk, but the result was the exact same as when she tried to squeeze through the fence earlier; Navi was flung back up, gravity then pulling her back down, causing the web to stretch upon impact. Navi sighed, \"At this rate, we won't be getting anywhere...\" But Link formed a grin on his face, casting his eyesight upwards, spotting some wood jutting out from the wall much higher up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi followed Link as he climbed some vines up to a higher level. They crossed a wooden path jutting from the wall over to some more vines that led to the highest part of the Great Deku Tree's interior, but these ones wouldn't be so easy, as several highly aggressive Skulltulas were crawling around at the moment, \"They will definitely attack you if you get near...\" But while Navi was talking, Link had already come with an idea to fix the problem; he picked up a Deku Stick that was lying on the ground and attached a rubber band that was in his pocket around the pronged side, creating a slingshot on the fly. However, a slingshot is of no use on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked around for anything that could be used as slingshot ammo. Eventually, he spotted a cluster of peculiar pitch black fruits growing off some vines on the wall. They were small and perfectly round, so they seemed to be just what he was looking for. As he got up to go grab some, Navi noticed them as well, and flew over to take a closer look. They were incredibly alluring to her for some reason; she wanted to try one, but there was the risk of them being poisonous. While Navi's willpower was trying to stop her from taking such a huge gamble, Link stopped, and thought to himself... Navi was about the size of a rock, so maybe...</span></div></div>",

As Navi held onto her belly, she felt her abdomen getting less and less distended.  Navi also saw that her belly is becoming less rounded, meaning that her stomach is digesting the berry, although faster than usual.  She wondered if that was the effect of the berry or the higher metabolism of tiny creatures such as herself.  Her pondering ended abruptly when she felt the walls of her stomach grind against each other; she digested the berry so quickly that she was already starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, I just had that berry! I shouldn't be <b>that</b> hungry right now!</i> Navi thought to herself, <i>Stay strong, Navi. You can wait until Link fixes the Great Deku Tree's curse.  Just give him hints and help him focus on the monsters as usual.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi thought she could make it through the inside of the Great Deku Tree without any food, but she soon realized it would take longer than she thought.  Link insisted to check every room in the base once he found the dungeon map, and through his room-searching he found an item-tracking compass and a slightly better Fairy Slingshot (which made his makeshift slingshot pointless) as well as a bunch of Deku Seeds as ammo.  Navi was hoping that Link would throw away the berries in favor of the Deku Seeds since they appeared to be tougher and far more numerous than the berries, but that thought didn't come across Link's mind as he kept both the berries and the seeds, to Navi's dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi's hunger was reaching its breaking point, and Link barely went through his first major obstacle.  The Skulltula web covering the giant pit in the main room was supposed to be broken by dropping down onto the middle from the highest point, yet every time Link dived into the web from the highest platform, he was off by a few feet, causing the web to trampoline him back to the floor.  Navi's patience was wearing thin, and her hunger feels like it was killing her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Navi couldn't help but to look at how much she had gained, considering that the wobbling of her body fat was hard to ignore.  She reluctantly looked down and was stunned at what she saw.  She had considerably grown from her plump figure, her gaining a couple of units to her BMI.  Her belly had grown noticably rounder and is beginning to show some sag and love handles.  Her breasts appeared fuller, gaining a few cup sizes.  Her thickened thighs rubbed against each other more often, and her posterior was more pronounced.  To say Navi was embarrassed was an underststement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no, I can't believe I let myself go this much!  I can't let Link see me like this!</i> Navi thought to herself, <i>Wait, Link!  I'm supposed to guide him through the Great Deku Tree!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi then flew down the pit, noticing she is going down faster than usual, probably because of her added weight going against her resistance to gravity.  As soon as she went down to the bottom room, she halted her downward momentum, gaining control of her flight back as soon as she touched the surface of the water.  Navi then flew above the water, looking around to see where Link was.  She then spotted Link carrying a burning stick across the water and swinging it at a large cobweb, burning it down.  Navi then flew up to Link, making sure she keeps a good enough distance so that Link doesn't notice her widened figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Link!  I finally caught up to you!\" Navi shouted, \"Looks like you found a way to get to the next room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink:</span></div></div>",

Behind the burning cobweb was revealed to be a door that would lead them even deeper into the Great Deku Tree. They passed through and continued to search for the source of the curse that was placed on the Great Deku Tree. Eventually, Link opened another door, only to be met with the room where they started. Unfortunately, it turned out that the path they were following was actually just leading them in one big circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi let out a massive sigh, \"Oh come on... Now what?\" She halted her wings and dropped down onto a thick vine, causing it to droop from her weight, \"Flying is way too tiring to keep going like this any longer... I'm going to rest over here for now, if that's alright with you.\" There were no objections from Link, not that she was expecting any at this point, so Navi laid back and began to rub her large belly. It had ballooned an incredible amount in such a short time frame, and it would certainly grow even more if she kept eating at the same rate as earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was relaxing, Navi was starting to feel tired from all the moving around she had done. She stretched out her arms and yawned, her mouth wide open, allowing for a repeat of last time. Suddenly, another berry like the ones from earlier dropped down into her mouth from seemingly out of nowhere. Navi's eyes shot open, after swallowing the tasty fruit of course, and looked up to find the cause, that being a smaller vine she somehow hadn't noticed. It was growing even more of the small juicy berries than the last one, and the sight of so many was causing Navi's mouth to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerries continuously dropped down from the vine above into Navi's mouth at a consistent rate, giving her plenty of time to chew and swallow each one. While she had learned that they were incredibly fattening, they were too delicious to pass up. Besides, they probably wouldn't be coming back to Kokiri Forest anytime soon, so she might as well enjoy them while she has the opportunity, right? As to be expected, Navi's body grew slightly with each berry she consumed, with her belly as the most prominent example, slowly beginning to spread over her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvents seemed to keep recurring, as Navi once again heard a snapping sound just like that of when Link broke through the giant cobweb before. Upon looking up again, she noticed that he indeed found another cobweb to break through, and did just that, falling down even further into the depths of the Great Deku Tree. Navi followed him down the hole once more, this time ending up in a much more straightforward room; all that was there was a single door. Navi gulped, having a bad feeling about what would be on the other side. Link didn't concern himself with that though, and entered regardless, giving Navi no choice but to follow him in.</span></div></div>",

The spaceous room was dark and musty from the decaying roots of the Great Deku Tree, most certainly caused by the curse from this Gohma.  As Link and Navi entered the room, they suddenly heard something shut behind them!  They turned around to see that the entrance was now sealed shut, trapping the green-clad hero and the plumped-up fairy inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uwah! We're stuck inside!\" Navi shrieked in panic. Link, however, remained adamant and looked around to find where the Gohma was. Link looked up at the ceiling, only to be greeted by a lone yellow eye staring back at him.  The eye dropped from the ceiling in front of Link and Navi, surprising them and giving them a closer look at the one-eyed being.  The creature resembled a gigantic four-or-five-legged spider, except covered with armor plating and obviously having a single giant yellow eye on its abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Parasitic Armored Arachnid</b></div><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">GOHMA</font></b></div><br>\r\nLink and Navi finally found Queen Gohma, the source of the curse that was draining the Great Deku Tree. Link was ready to defeat the creature, while Navi was a bit cautious yet still determined to help Link.  Queen Gohma crawled up to the ceiling of the room, spawning Gohma larva to attack Link.  Link, in return, slashed away the larva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one of the parasitic monsters inside the Deku Tree! Its eye is vulnerable when it's red!\" Navi instinctively spoke out, not knowing where this information come from or why she blurred that out.  Link, however, got an idea.  He pulled out the Fairy Slingshot, and motioned to Navi to go near Queen Gohma's eye.  Navi reluctantly obliged, feeling a bit nervous to go up close to the monstrous bug, but she knows that she has to perform some well-deserved Z-Targeting for Link.  Apparently, one of the many magical functions of a fairy is to use their magic to help their user greatly focus on an opponent, not only improving the user's dodging and swordfighting, but also making projectiles impossible to miss their focused target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi flew her fat body up to the ceiling near Queen Gohma's eyeball.  Navi suddenly emitted a yellow glow, and four yellow triangles circled Gohma's eye, indicating the Z-Target was established.  Navi was a bit nervous being near the boss arachnid, as the distorted pupil of Gohma's eye was ominously following Navi.  The pressure, along with Navi's body weight, was beginning to disorient Navi with keeping up the Z-Target, but Navi soon saw Gohma's eye turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link!  Her eye is red! You can shoot her now!\" Navi shouted at Link.  Link then pulled back his loaded slingshot towards Gohma's red eye and released, sending the projectile flying at high speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi:</span></div></div>",

Because of this, Link's shot ended up hitting Navi instead, sending her plummeting to the ground below. Gohma then took the opportunity to lunge at the distracted Link, gripping him with it sharp claws, causing him quite a bit of pain. Despite this though, Link withdrew his sword and drove it into the arachnid's single eye, causing it to screech in pain, as well as the muscles in its claws releasing Link. Navi was left speechless at how calm and brave Link was despite how much danger and pain he was in... She realized she couldn't let some spider have its way with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, the tables had turned, and Navi's abilities no longer failed them at any point during the battle. Gohma fled to the ceiling once more, but Navi chased after it, determined to not make the same mistake twice. She fluttered around Gohma's eye and waited for it to turn red before giving the signal. Link once again fired a seed into Gohma's eye, but this time striking directly thanks to Navi managing to stay calm this time. Gohma fell to the ground, and Link ran towards the giant parasite to deliver the finishing blow. Jumping up to where the eye was, he unsheathed his sword once more, gruesomely stabbing his sword deep inside the eye cavity, causing Gohma to wail out in pain once last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Gohma's body suddenly began to turn pitch black. Link jumped down from the insect corpse before it suddenly burned away into ashes in a display of blue flames. That had to have been the source of the curse on the Great Deku Tree so mission accomplished! Link and Navi both turned to each with a look of satisfaction on their faces!</span></div></div>",

He and his Loftwing had just won the Wing Ceremony, despite numerous attempts at making sure he couldn't win by Groose and his cronies. Then there was that hurricane, which had caused her fall off her Loftwing...<br>\r\nLooking around, Zelda's eyes widened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on the Ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and dusting off her pink dress, she took in her surroundings. There was a large structure behind her, and a large pit in front of her. Taking a few cautious steps, she peered into it. It had a long path leading to the bottom, where a pillar of some sort was lodged into the ground. It had a faint glow surrounding it. Zelda felt a dark feeling weigh on her, causing her to feel very uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not your battle\", a voice behind her said, causing Zelda to jump. \"That is another's battle\".<br>\r\nTurning, Zelda saw an ancient woman looking at her. She had a spiral braid swinging from side to side, and a bangle around her wrist. <br>\r\n\"B-Battle? What do you mean? Who... Where..?\" Zelda stuttered. She had so many questions to ask...<br>\r\n\"You and another have roles to play. However, you arrived early. Too early... The forces of Darkness are moving much faster than I thought. There is only enough time to explain your role,\" the woman explained, walking back into the temple. Zelda quickly followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mentioned a role?\" Zelda asked as the woman sat down. She sat opposite her. She didn't particularly like the cold stone floor, but she had no alternative. <br>\r\n\"I cannot explain much,\" the woman said. \"In this land, there are two springs, blessed by an ancient goddess. In order to prepare for your role, you must bathe in them. They will purify your body and make it ready\".<br>\r\n\"Ready for what?\" Zelda inquired. This whole ordeal was really messing with her...<br>\r\n\"I cannot divulge any more information. Knowledge of your destiny could attract the one who summoned you here. Hopefully, now that you are here, your knight won't be too far behind,\" the woman explained. \"I can give you these, though\".<br>\r\nShe produced a white dress, matching white heels and two bangles. She handed them to Zelda, who hesitated. <br>\r\n\"I know this may seem like an awful lot to take in, but you must stay strong. The fate of both the Sky and the Ground depend on both you, and your knight,\" the woman said, laying a reassuring hand on Zelda's shoulder. She nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting on her new dress, Zelda was shown to a door. <br>\r\n\"Follow this path. It will lead you to the first spring. And beware, for these woods hold enemies. Should you lose your way, search for the Kiwi Elder. He will help,\" the woman explained. <br>\r\nNodding, Zelda opened the door. After a minute, she came to a small cliff with a clearing. She saw some sort of green... things that were battling a giant rock with a backpack. Now completely confused, Zelda jumped down the cliff and sprinted past the battle. Neither side noticed her. She ran through a giant gate and into a forest, where she finally stopped. Breathing heavily, she straightened up. She was still on a path, but a new problem arose...<br>\r\n\"I'm... hungry?\" She asked herself, hearing her stomach rumble. It made sense. She had skipped breakfast after hearing that Links Loftwing had gone missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Zelda saw...</span></div></div>",

She didn't recognise the fruit, as Skyloft only had those weird Stamina things that made you feel you could run a marathon... for about 5 seconds. Then you immediately crashed and became tired. <br>\r\n\"If I could only reach!\" Zelda grunted, as she jumped. She couldn't even reach the lower branches. Kicking her heels off, she planted her feet on the tree. She slowly started climbing. She wasn't as experienced with climbing as the rest of her class was, but even she could climb a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching one of the lower branches, she gently eased her weight onto a rather thick branch. It creaked slightly, but held her. Leaning back against the trunk, Zelda reached up and plucked a fruit from above her head. <br>\r\nIt was a bright red colour, and looked like a Stamina Fruit. Taking a cautious bite, Zelda chewed for a few seconds before swallowing. <br>\r\n\"Oh my Goddess!\" She exclaimed. \"It's delicious!\"<br>\r\nTaking a bigger bite, Zelda munched through it. Looking up, she grabbed a couple. She couldn't describe the taste, but she needed more! Plus, it wasn't a huge meal, so she would need a couple to fill her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing off a couple more, Zelda shifted her weight, causing the branch to creak. <br>\r\n\"Looks like it's getting dark...\" She mumbled. \"I should bed down for the night\".<br>\r\nDeciding to stay in the tree, she got up. Holding onto the trunk, Zelda climbed up a bit further. Spotting a rather large branch that she could safely lie on, she climbed up to it. Compared to her bed up on Skyloft, it wasn't super comfortable... But it was acceptable. <br>\r\nLying back, Zelda sighed. She hadn't imagined her day going like this...<br>\r\nLooking over, she spotted another branch with the new fruit growing on it. A couple more wouldn't hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the branch, Zelda snapped it off the trunk. It had a fair amount of fruit attached to it. Taking a couple off, she balanced the branch on her legs. <br>\r\n\"Mmm... So good!\"<br>\r\nWhat Zelda didn't realise was the difference between food from the Sky and the food from the Ground. Having been raised on food solely from the Sky, like Pumpkins from that one island, and whatever the Cook rustled up. However, food from the ground was much different, made for the creatures that lived down there. In the case of the woods, it was directed towards the Kiwis, a race of small penguin like creatures that, despite being quite small, were also quite heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zelda munched through the entire branch, her body was slowly digesting the fruit, and adding weight to her slender form. Her trim belly formed a small layer of pudge. Her breasts became fuller and softer. Her ass became rounder, causing her panties to tighten ever so slightly. <br>\r\nUnder her increased weight, her sturdy branch let out a quiet creak, causing Zelda to freeze. <br>\r\n\"Don't break...\" She whispered fearfully. \"Please, don't break...\"<br>\r\nAfter a few more quiet creaks, it stopped, allowing Zelda to breathe easily. She leaned back and looked at the branch on her knees. It still had a fair amount of fruit attached to it. However, Zelda now had a second problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to sleep...\" She said, letting out a yawn. \"That can be breakfast...\"<br>\r\nBefore closing her eyes, Zelda saw the sun set, light streaming through the leaves. She had never seen anything like it on Skyloft...</span></div></div>",

She slowly peered down the tree, and stifled a scream. <br>\r\nShe saw three red creatures. Two were wielding crude swords, and the third had a makeshift bow. They all wore shorts made from some animal pelt, although the third had a faded blue bandana. <br>\r\nShe quickly returned to her sitting position. <br>\r\n\"Don't look up...\" She whispered. While she could use a sword, as per part of the Knight Academy's training program, she wasn't skilled with it. She always had issues cutting through the logs in the training hall, something Link was always quick to help her with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Link... If only you were here...\"<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Link didn't appear, leaving Zelda stuck up a tree with three... Goblins? She didn't know what they were. Looking around, the only things she saw were branches and fruit. <br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe they're hungry?\" Zelda wondered, reaching out and snapping another branch off the tree. However, the snap alerted the things to her presence. <br>\r\nAll three looked up and spotted her. It didn't help that she was wearing all white at night and in a tree. They started shouting in some sort of foreign language. However, they did nothing to get Zelda down.<br>\r\nMaybe they aren't hostile? Zelda though. But, that woman said there's enemies in this forest...<br>\r\nA rock hitting into the tree inches from her head broke Zelda away from her thoughts. She helped and leaned over, trying to hide herself. A second rock told her that it wasn't working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, stop!\" She pleaded. \"I'll come down!\"<br>\r\nThey stopped. <br>\r\nPlacing her foot on a branch, she froze when it groaned under her increased weight. She waited a moment before resuming her descent. <br>\r\nAs she made her way down, a plan started forming in her head. If she could reason with the creatures, she might be able to get one of their swords. Sure, she wasn't very good with it, but a surprise attack might tip the scales in her favour. <br>\r\nAs she stood on a rather flimsy branch, her luck with sturdy branches ran out. It snapped. <br>\r\n\"No!\" She yelped as she fell to the ground. She landed on her softer backside, but it still hurt. She heard the creatures snicker at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow! She thought. <br>\r\nJumping to her feet, which caused her enlarged breasts to bounce slightly, she reached forward and grabbed one of their swords. The creature, surprised by the agility of the creature before her, let go of the blade. <br>\r\nSwinging it his head, Zelda hit her mark. He flew off and bit the ground, hard. She didn't have time to celebrate, as the other two, initially stunned, were now moving to get her. The other creature with a sword moved towards her, while the one with a bow pulled out a horn. <br>\r\nZelda clumsily ducked under the creatures swing and took out the horn user. She spun and finished off the final creature. Dropping the sword, she yelped as all three simultaneously burst into smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... that's how they die?\" Zelda said, collapsing onto her round rump. She didn't notice her softer belly, or the slight comfort her backside provided on the grassy ground. Regaining her breath, she stood up. <br>\r\n\"I need someplace safer to sleep,\" Zelda said to herself. Before she headed deeper into the woods, she grabbed the branch she had dropped. It had a good amount of food field her to snack on while she looked for a better sleeping spot. <br>\r\nShe headed onwards, munching on a fruit. She didn't notice her thighs brushing against one another, or her gradually tightening dress. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zelda arrived at a clearing. She had just finished eating all of the fruit on her branch. Rubbing her forming potbelly, she let out a contented sigh. <br>\r\n\"Ahhh... Who knew food on the ground would be so good!\" She exclaimed happily. However, a yawn reminded Zelda of her current goal. <br>\r\n\"Somewhere to sleep... Somewhere I won't be accosted by weird creatures\".<br>\r\nLooking around the clearing, she saw a couple of potential sleeping areas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her left, there was a rather tall tree that looked easy to climb. But after the last tree, Zelda wasn't feeling it. She hated the fact that she was dressed in a bright white that made her stand out against everything. Even those monsters, who didn't look too smart, spotted her!<br>\r\nShaking her head, she turned her attention to a suspicious pile of rocks. They were piled up against a rock wall, and much like her dress, looked out of place. Walking up to them, she gently pulled one free. The wall crumbled slightly. Peeking into the hole, she saw a floating heart, with golden lines criss-crossing across its surface. <br>\r\n\"What a weird place...\" She mumbled, replacing the rock. <br>\r\nLooking to her right, there was a huge tree that had snapped in half. She saw a small opening cut into the side of it. She might be able to fit inside, if she could get up there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding on the small hole, she walked to her right. She briefly noted her thighs rubbing against each other as she walked, but forgot all about it when a couple of Keese divebombed her. <br>\r\n\"No! Go away!\" She yelled, covering her head and swatting madly. On night patrols in Skyloft, Keese and Chuchus were the only real danger. She could handle the Chuchus, but Keese? She hated the things!<br>\r\nShe got lucky with one of her wild swings. Her hand collided with one of the Keese, which caused it to spiral to the ground. It didn't burst into smoke, much to Zeldas dismay. Instead, it weakly fluttered its wings. <br>\r\nTaking a chance, Zelda sprinted ahead. Her body jiggled as she did, her breasts bouncing up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sprinting up a hill and past a fancy gate with some sort of symbol on it, Zelda stopped. She planted her soft ass on a tree stump and breathed heavily. <br>\r\n\"What's wrong... with me..?\" She huffed, holding her chest. \"I'm... fitter than this!\"<br>\r\nAfter catching her breath, Zelda looked around. She spotted a tree with fruit growing on it, causing her to smile. She had acquired a taste for the fruit and wouldn't mind some more. <br>\r\nSnapping a couple of branches off the tree, Zelda ate a couple before heading down a hill. She was quickly stopped by a large gap with a single vine hanging down. <br>\r\n\"Guess there's no other way,\" Zelda said before leaping and grabbing the vine. It creaked loudly, causing Zelda to worry. She swung back and forth for a few seconds before letting go and landing across the gap. She stumbled and fell onto her front. Her breasts squished against the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping to her feet, she brushed dirt off her dress. The massive tree was in front of her now. It had a small opening, just big enough for her. Lying on her front, Zelda crawled forward. She just about fit. Her rounder backside and softer hips brushed against the sides of the tiny tunnel. <br>\r\nCrawling through to the other side, Zelda stood up and brushed dirt of her dress again. The tree was completely hollow, and had a makeshift roof in the form of leaves over the opening at the top. Strangely, there was a bed of leaves on the ground, along with a campfire that was still smoking...<br>\r\n\"Someone else must be here!\" She exclaimed hopefully. \"Maybe they're friendly?\"<br>\r\nA simultaneous yawn and rumble of her stomach broke Zelda out of her thoughts. Sitting down on the bed of leaves, she ate some fruit. Her body became a little heavier. Her breasts began to feel tight within her bra, while her belly began to show against her dress. Her hips and ass raised the hem of her dress slightly. A second chin began to form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her small snack, Zelda lay back. She was still having trouble actually believing that this was happening to her. Sure, she had always wanted to go to the ground, but not like this! She had always imagined coming down her with her class from the Academy, with Groose, and with Link...<br>\r\n\"I know Link... He'll find me! He's always there for me!\" Zelda mumbled to herself before drifting off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Meanwhile, in Skyloft-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're the one the legend spoke of\".<br>\r\nThe Headmaster of the Knight Academy and Zelda's father, Gaepora, inspected the boy in front of him. In his right hand, he held a short sword with a green hilt. Behind him floated some sport of spirit, clad in a blue dress. <br>\r\n\"That sword you hold... The Goddess Blade... You are meant for great things, Link,\" Gaepora said, looking at the Goddess Blade. \"The one meant to descend to the surface, and reunite the Sky and the Land!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda awoke with a start. Birds were chirping in the leaves above her. Normally, she awoke to either a loud knock on her door, or her Loftwing being noisy outside her window. Already, she preferred the birds. <br>\r\n\"I should get going,\" Zelda said, stretching. Her stomach rumbled. \"Or maybe I should eat?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A strong wind blew past Link as he traveled through the skies on his Loftwing. Having just recently met and fought against the Demon Lord Ghirahim in Skyview Temple, Link felt like going back to Skyloft to relax for a while before heading back down the surface. It was nice to be back up in the sky, his home, where Link had grown up. His first time down below the clouds was certainly breathtaking, he and everyone else had wondered what might lie beyond them. He had been able to go down to the surface to experience things no one from his home had seen, at least given what their records stated. He just wished it could've been with Zelda, unfortunately that was the whole reason he had even ventured down to the surface in the first place, to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master.\" Fi spoke as she came out from Link's Sword, <br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Link grunted as he turned his head toward the spirit flying next to him and his Loftwing.<br>\r\n\"I would recommend we return back to the surface, With that Demon Ghirahim searching after Zelda, I believe it is imperative  that you go back to continue searching for her before he finds her.\" Fi's voice carried a tone urgency, or at least it felt like it to Link.<br>\r\n\"I know about that horrid Demon Fi, but...I need to relax for a bit after going through all of that. I'm going back to Skyloft to get some food.<br>\r\n\"My calculations show that your health is at optimal levels for comba-\"<br>\r\n\"Its not about my health Fi, this is about energy, I'm a little tired and getting to relax and eat would be good, especially since I haven't eaten all day. Having a full stomach is good for going on an adventure like this, and that means making sure to keep my hunger in check.\" Link said to explain himself. Fi paused, still not fully understanding, but resumed herself back into her master's sword.<br>\r\n'There is much I still need to analyze about the master and his people...' Fi thought to herself as the two flew through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting off of his Crimson Loftwing, the young man made his way into the town's bustling Marketplace. Known for its wide array of assortments one could buy and store there. The many residents of Skyloft that worked there had become especially familiar with Link, given his recent travelings to the surface and needing their wares far more than most Skyloftians, some of which had familiarized themselves with him seemingly more than others.<br>\r\nAfter making an order to Piper, and reminding her multiple times to actually finish it, Link sat down to enjoy a bowl of soup along with some baked bread. The rich aroma, the warmth he could feel rising from the meal, as he brought the spoon to his lips, the familiar chime of Fi rang out, bringing herself out from his sword, the blue spirit guide floated beside her master. It also seemed the general populace of the Market had yet to fully adjust to the blue floating girl popping out from Link's sword at a moment's notice, garnering a few gasps in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh Fi, what is it?\" Link inquired as he slurped from the spoon in a manner Zelda would chastise him for.. Link had learned in the short time he had been accompanied by this spirit from the Goddess Hylia that Fi generally didn't interact much if it did not regard to her stated purpose.<br>\r\nFi took a moment to respond, as if she were contemplating her answer.<br>\r\n\"Master, I believe I feel the sensation your people call \"curiosity\". you said that food was required for you even when your health was not low. I believe it would good to experience food for myself. specifically over this collection of vegetables, liquid collected from various meat, and the meat itself you have. This \"soup\" as it is called. With how my creator formed me, I do not require nourishment to maintain my level of energy like you, however....\" Fi looked away, taking a second to look down at Link's meal. \"...I am curious to how your soup tastes.\"<br>\r\nLink smiled upon hearing this. \"Heh, so you want try it out then?\" he was a little taken back by Fi's motion to want to experience food. She hadn't shown much interest in anything that wasn't Zelda or something pertaining to their quest when he had found the Kikwis via her dousing ability.<br>\r\n\"Yes, my analysis shows that you and others have found it to be \"delicious\", I...want to experience it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink pushed his bowl over towards his guide. Fi reached out with her limbs and \"grabbed the bowl\". Link for a moment tried to see if there were any arms under those elegant cape flaps of hers, he had wondered if the girl even had arms, he could never really tell. Regardless, Fi continued bringing up the bowl to her lips and gracefully let it enter her mouth to taste. A moment passed, Fi then took a few more sips and swallowed. It was then that the spirit girl had begun to realize what Link meant by filling one's self with nourishment even if you were not in critical health. The taste of the broth, the texture and taste of the contents, the feel of it all sliding down her throat into her body. It was beyond any kind of data she currently had. One might say it was delightful. She briefly exhaled as she continued to sip a few more times, taking in a reasonable amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, having now analyzed this soup, My calculations show that its temperature is 90\u00b0C, There is an 85% probability of its quality being improved if the temperature is increased by six degrees.\" Fi said as she sipped more from the bowl, almost vigorously doing so.<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Well then...Oy, Piper, another two bowls, make both of em hotter!\" Link hollered out over to the cook.<br>\r\nComing right up Link!...Hmm maybe a bit more pepper this time.\" the woman began to fervently stir in the next batches of soup.<br>\r\nFi continued to sip from the bowl, tipping it up as more and more entered her mouth and less and less remained in the bowl. <br>\r\n\"There is a 0% probability of any soup remaining in this bowl Master.\" Fi said as she placed the now empty bowl on the table.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I guess you really enjoyed it huh?\" Link said with a smirk, too entertained by Fi's actions to care about having his 1st meal basically hi jacked by her. Propping his head up with a hand, he looked on with content.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I found it to be rather delectable.\"<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\" the young man asked, wanting to see if Fi had any more to speak of about the soup. She paused, taking in her master's question.<br>\r\n\"I would recommend more for a better analysis and more data on what you call \"hunger\".\" Link let out a small chuckle at Fi's comment, it seemed her curiosity over food was bringing the girl out of her shell so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your soup, both extra-hot!\" Piper cheered as she set down the bowls, making sure to carefully lie them down due to the increased heat.<br>\r\nTo the surprise of Link and everyone else who was looking their way, Fi immediately began to down her bowl at a similar speed as she had with the first one, perhaps more so.<br>\r\n\"H-hey Fi, slow down it's hot!\" shocked by Fi's sudden action, he worried the hotter soup would cause possible trouble.<br>\r\nIgnoring her master's comment for a brief second, she set the bowl down after having swallowed about a fourth of its contents. Gulping down remnants in her mouth before responding.<br>\r\n\"I am not as affected by heat as your people are, however this soup's added heat as improved its quality. The texture of the vegetables and meat together, alongside the proper heat make it quite enjoyable. As is proper by your social customs I thank you for this meal.\" Fi said bowing to Piper as a bit of soup dribbled from her lips.<br>\r\n\"Ohh well you're welcome, Miss Fi was it? Uhh let me get that for you.\" Piper withdrew a cloth to wipe Fi's lips of the broth.<br>\r\n\"I would recommend you consume your soup Master Link, before its quality diminishes, unless you would like to give it to me for further analysis and data...\" Fi's eyes briefly shimmered with desire for more, but no one seemed to have noticed.<br>\r\n\"I'll enjoy it for myself Fi, Thank you Piper.\" Link said as he went on to bite into the rest of his bread, savoring the soft fluffiness of the baked loaf.<br>\r\n\"Ahaha no problem Link, as long as I have ingredients and you've got rupees I'll gladly serve you two as much soup as you want!\" Piper beamed with joy as she walked back to her station. Fi quickly went back to finish her bowl, not wanting it lower in heat by any significant amount. Finishing up her bowl, she placed it down and for the faintest amount of time, felt a rush of air surge up through her body up into her mouth, it escaped as a faint belch that went unnoticed by Link ,and Fi herself paid it no attention, finding it unnecessary to put any focus on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she floated there watching her master finish off his own bowl of the soup that had been prepared for them, Fi felt something she herself could not properly designate, something inside her being yearned for more, she wasn't fully conscious of it, but that soup was the beginning of a true hunger inside the spirit. Neither she nor Link knew it at the time, but from that moment on Skyloft, nay the world would fall into a most unexpected turn of events.<br>\r\n\"Mmrghaahh! Link huffed as he finished off the last of his meal. Getting up he called out to Fi. <br>\r\n\"Alright I'm done, let's go Fi. We should check up on everyone around Skyloft before heading out again.\" Fi turned to her master, staring at him in her stoic manner before responding...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ruby Tablet in hand, Link walked up the stairway towards the Statue of the Goddess. Once he put this in its place, he would be one step closer to finding Zelda. He stopped for a moment and looked up at the statue, remembering how she had pushed off from the top of it after he had won during the Wing Ceremony. Although she could have potentially caused him harm in the process, Link still looked back on this moment fondly, a warm smile forming on his face. He then looked back down at the entrance that led inside the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Statue of the Goddess was the pedestal where the Goddess Sword that Fi resides in sits. Behind it though was a fraction of a map made out of stone, and in Link's hand, he held another piece of that map, and once he fit it together with the first piece, it would trigger a pathway to open up to where the map is leading him. He took his time fitting the Ruby Tablet into place carefully, making sure it wouldn't chip or crack, just in-case that would cause it to break. If that were to happen, Link would likely 'crack' as well. Thankfully though, no such disaster happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed light suddenly flew north, out from the Statue, parting a portion of clouds. Fi then came out of the Goddess Sword to relay this information to Link, \"Master, I have confirmed the location of a second opening in the cloud barrier. It is located in the skies to the northeast. This opening will allow you to access a new area on the surface. I suggest you fly there as soon as you make the necessary preparations. I also now know that it would be wise to bring a plentiful amount of 'food' in order to minimize the chances of exhaustion.\" Link nodded, and began to head out to stock up on supplies for the next leg of his journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile on his way back to the bazaar, Link overheard a woman calling out for someone, \"Kukiel! Kukiel! Where could that child have gone?!\" Looking towards the source of the voice, he recognized Wyrna and walked over to her, \"Oh, Kukiel... Where did you go? What will I do if she's been... kidnapped?!\" Link gasped without intending to, being caught off-guard by the sudden mention of a potential kidnapping. Wyrna heard this, and turned around, thankful to see him, \"Oh! Link! What perfect timing! You haven't seen my Kukiel have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he had been exploring the surface for quite awhile, Link had no way of knowing where Kukiel could have gone during that time, \"Nope... I was pre-occupied with something for the past few hours, so I had no way of knowing if she was out and about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyrna's heart began to sink by the looks of things, as she hung her head down low, clutching her chest in her hands, \"I... I see...\" She then looked back up with desperation in her eyes, \"Please, Link, won't you help me look for her? I've been looking everywhere, but I can't find her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course after Wyrna poured her heart out, begging for help to find her missing daughter, Link would have to be heartless to turn her down, \"You got it. I'll be sure to check every possible part of Skyloft.\" He then gave her a reassuring nod, just to show that he was confident that his search would be successful, hoping that would ease Wyrna's worrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaylight had faded before Link even noticed. He spent the entire day searching for Kukiel, yet he hadn't been able to find her despite checking every square inch of Skyloft. Utterly confused, he sat down against the tree in the graveyard and began to ponder what was going on, \"This doesn't make any sense... I checked everywhere. She doesn't have a Loftwing yet because she's too young, so she couldn't have just left...\" Link glanced around yet again, absolutely desperate. Eventually though, he was forced to let out a sigh of defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFi heard that Link was distraught, and came out from the Goddess Sword to hopefully provide assistance, \"Master, if are having trouble finding the lost child, perhaps I could re-calibrate the dowsing feature to help search for her.\" Upon hearing this, Link immediately stood up and looked up at her, speechless, his left eye beginning to twitch. After a few moments of silence, Fi spoke up once again, \"If you would prefer I not intervene for the time being, then I shall leave you be, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then snapped back into reality and finally responded, \"N-No, please help if you can! In fact, I would have preferred it if you told me this earlier...\" He then let out an exasperated sigh... Once Fi had finished configuring the dowsing functionality, Link withdrew the Goddess Sword from his sheath to begin using its magic to scan. To his surprise though, it immediately got a heavy reaction from a nearby gravestone, \"Wha...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFi chimed in once more, \"Odd... It seems the child was here recently, and left traces from her hands on this grave. None of the other graves have been touched either. According to my calculations, there is 70% chance that this is connected to her disappearance in some way.\" As she finished speaking though, she oddly felt some sort of unfamiliar pressure building up inside of herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Link placed his hands on the grave, but gasped when he suddenly felt it shifting backwards. Once it stopped, he then turned when he heard what he used to assume was an old shed opening on its own. Link stood there unsure how to even react. He couldn't just stay there forever though, and eventually, albeit reluctantly, stepped inside. At first, it seemed to be entirely empty, but upon taking another step, Link had almost tripped over the edge of a hole in the floor that led down to another platform; it was one surprise after another... Thankfully there was a ladder to get back up, so Link used it climb down and investigate even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Link was carefully crossing the narrow path made up of wooden planks, the silence was suddenly broken, \"EEEEEEEEEEEK!\" Throwing caution to the wind, Link dashed across the rest of the planks, all of them eerily creaking underneath him. At the end of the path was an old wooden door. This rabbit hole just kept going deeper and deeper... Bursting through the door, Link braced himself for whatever horrors he would have to face on the other side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately upon entering, Link stopped when he saw a pair of giant bat-like wings blocking his view of the back. He wouldn't need to see the back though, as upon hearing Link step inside, the owner of the wings turned their head towards him with a scowl... Once the creature had fully turned around to face him, it had become apparent that this was a demon he was messing with. Said demon let out an intimidating roar, giving the impression it was about to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, Link withdrew his sword-, \"Stop! Please! I beg of you... Don't hurt me! Oh goodness, I know how bad this must look to you right now, but I assure you I mean no harm! We were just playing the scream-as-loud-as-you-can game!\" Link stood there utterly shocked. He turned and saw Kukiel to his left, who just waved to him with a big smile, then back to the demon who continued, \"Isn't that a fun game...? Oh dear... Perhaps an explanation is in order! My name is Batreaux, and I am a monster who resides here in this humble dwelling below Skyloft. But please allow me to correct one popular misconception. While I am certainly a monster, I wouldn't dream of terrorizing the people of this town!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatreaux went on to express his desire to befriend the people of Skyloft, along with the hardships he faced along the way because of his demonic features. Kukiel even eventually chimed in, \"He's not a bad man! He saved me one time when I almost fell over the edge! And he lets me come here and scream as loud as I want!\" It was a real shame that such a nice guy was forced to be an outcast based purely on appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, an enormous roar erupted from inside the room. It was so loud that the sound waves caused all the decorations to either vibrate or fall from their place entirely. All three of them covered their ears to protect their ear drums, though it ended fairly quickly. Batreaux immediately spoke up upon noticing the noise had stopped, \"Goodness me, what was that? Are both of you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded, \"Y-Yeah, I'm fine, are you too Kukiel...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKukiel slowly got up, still clutching her ears, \"Owie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever that noise was, it was loud enough to have woken all of Skyloft. Several people went out to investigate, and found Link and Batreaux having climbed back up into the graveyard. Each of them withdrew their weapon upon noticing Batreaux, but Link ran between them, \"Hey, hey! Cut that out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Link had no explanation for the noise, he did speak up over the mistreatment of Batreaux. Sadly, it took awhile to convince anyone due to their ingrained mindsets. Slowly, he was making a case that was starting to win them over, especially once he brought up Kukiel's side of the story, \"Kukiel?!\" Wyrna pushed past the other townsfolk in-front of her, \"He saved my little Kukiel?!\" Link, taking the opportunity to score Batreaux a few points, nodded hastily. Wyrna covered her mouth in shock, \"Oh my goodness, how could I ever thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, Link saw some orange gems form around Wyrna. It seemed that no one else could notice them though. Batreaux turned to him and whispered, \"Ah! Gratitude Crystals! Those are only produced when a human is truly happy! This is a good sign! If you don't mind, I would like to keep these ones, in honor our new friendship!\" Link didn't see any problem with this and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, there was still one unresolved oddity. Link turned to the Goddess Sword to speak to Fi, \"Still, I wonder what that strange roar was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFi took a moment before uttering only a short response, \"... Indeed.\"</span></div></div>",

Link waved, and she stopped singing, waving back and letting out a happy whinny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link!  It's been forever, how are you?\" she called out, as Malon giggled; as much as she enjoyed having \"Fairy Boy\" around, Epona was always even more fond of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know me...just hanging around, not much to do with all this fate of the world stuff out of the way!\" he joked, sitting down on a bale of hay opposite the two farm girls. He stopped to get a good look at Epona-- a bit taller than the average Hylian, the anthro mare wore a dress similar to Malon's, only with a brooch shaped like a carrot instead of the latter's Bowser-themed one. Her equine lips were curled into a smile, and she seemed incredibly eager to hear whatever Link had to say, involuntarily making an excited nickering sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, girls, what's going on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing much,\" Malon replied, \"Just more of the usual work here around the farm...you know, Epona and I have been experimenting with making some new, special milk from the cows around here-- you wanna try some?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was more than happy to take their offer, having always been quite the fan of Lon Lon Ranch's famous milk. He got up and followed the two girls as they got up and walked toward the barn. Epona smiled and patted her belly, which Link had only just noticed was now a bit bigger and softer than he remembered. \"Oh, you'll really like this new milk recipe, Link,\" she said excitedly, \"Though, er, don't be surprised if you find you can't bring yourself to put it down after a couple of glasses...\" </span></div></div>",

The barn was filled with cows and hay and stank faintly of manure. In the far corner of the barn sat a small desk that had several milk bottles on it as well as several bottles of a greenish liquid that vaguely resembled the energy potions that Link used on his journeys.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 \"I was at the market the other day\" said Malon.  \"And I came across a new shop.  The owner of the shop is from Termina and he sells these really exotic potions.  He claimed that a potion like this--\" here, Malon gestured at the greenish liquid--\"would make milk taste a lot better.  Here, try some\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               Link lifted a glass of milk as did Epona and Malon.   All three took a long drink.  The milk tasted <i>very</i> good indeed even better than the normal milk that the ranch produced and that was saying something!

Epona was about to agree, but her eyes suddenly widened and she pointed at Link, looking surprised.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, look at your belly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Looking down, he was shocked to see that his belly was indeed starting to grow rounder and fatter, bulging out of his tunic and forcing his belt open, causing his newly-gained flab to hang over his waist.  A growl could be heard from his stomach as he packed on more fat, with a sizable pair of moobs making themselves visible through his tightening tunic, while his sleeves and leggings tightened around his fattening limbs.  By this point, Epona and Malon were both giggling uncontrollably as their friend tried in vain to cover up his growing self, laughing even harder when a loud rip came from the back of his leggings, making him blush bright red.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, guys, a little help here?\"  The girls took a moment to stop laughing, eventually calming down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, sorry about that Link, hehe...\" Epona giggled, playfully patting his fattened belly.  \"You and I can head down to the market and talk to that vendor...er, once we get you some new pants...\" </span></div></div>",

Before doing anything else Link had insisted on getting himself some new pair of pants and the only pair of pants that would fit him belonged to Malon's father.  Link managed to get the pants on as well as a rather baggy tunic.    Link was just putting on the baggy tunic when there was a soft knock at the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Are you finished?\" came Epona's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                          \"Yes\" said Link looking at himself in the mirror.  He did look better with the new clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         The door opened and Epona walked in along with Malon.   Link glanced at the two ladies coming in just in time to see Epona suddenly stop walking.  At the same time, Malon let out a low groan and held her belly tenderly.  Before Link could ask what the problem was, both Malon and Epona started to fatten up as Link had some ten minutes before.  It had taken Link that long to change his clothes.  <br>\r\n                                 <br>\r\n                          Malon's belly and breasts started to fatten up causing strain in her dress.  Epona, perhaps because she was a horse, started to fatten up a lot more in the belly and rear end.   Malon and Epona hadn't drank enough milk to reach Link's size so the two farm girls were in no danger of ripping open their dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Oh dear\" said Malon looking down at her fattened self.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"Why are you two only fattening up now?\" asked Link.   \"I drank and I grew fatter right away\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"Perhaps because you drank more milk than we did?\" suggested Epona.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        \"That could be\" said Link thoughtfully.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"We gotta get to that vendor\" said Malon.   \"maybe he can fix this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            </span></div></div>",

She had been running back and forth throughout her kingdom, overseeing repair work, relocating Zora's whose homes were destroyed, calming the populace, and just generally being a queen. It was tiring, but Oren was finally done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuga's attack had done quite a bit of damage to the Zora kingdom. The throne room was trashed, homes and businesses were ruined, and several books in the Zora archives had to be fixed. Eventually, after four days of repairing, the Zora kingdom was returning to it's original splendor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOren retreated to her bedroom and collapsed on her large bed. She was ready to sleep for days at this point. Before she turned in, though, she made sure to put the Smooth Stone back in it's box next to her bed. It had been critical in helping her fix the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Smooth Stone. Oren had always wondered where it came from. She first got it on her 20th birthday, two days before she became queen, in a package with no sender. It was always glowing a yellow light, which Oren thought was pretty, but that wasn't what made the stone odd. Whenever she had it, it always gave her as much energy as she needed: even if she were to run for 10 hours straight, she wouldn't be tired. But that energy came with one odd cost: if the stone was away from her for too long or was stolen from her, she would begin gaining weight at a rapid rate. The Zora mage who checked the gem said the weight wouldn't kill her, but if left unchecked, she could potentially crush the entire land of Hyrule. Oren didn't want that, so she kept the stone with her as much as she could. There were a few instances where it was lost, and it was stolen at one point, but both times the stone was returned before any permanent damage was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOren locked the box with the stone and, for the first time in four days, laid down for a well deserved rest. But during her sleep, something happened to the stone. The non-stop use of the stone had completely burned out it's magic, causing to lose it's glow and become just an ordinary stone. Oren was about to get a nasty surprise when she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Oren felt much better. As she opened her eye's, she tried to get up, but couldn't.

And though she couldn't see it, she could feel that her butt had blown up as well. She could also feel that her face had puffed up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOren couldn't figure this out.

However, she got distracted by a full-length mirror, which let her actually see her butt. It had blown up to the current size of her breasts.

She knows all about mystic artifacts. She may be able to recharge the stone.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is this sorceress?\" Oren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last I heard, she was visting Holodrum. About a 5 days trip. We'll send someone too-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Oren interrupted. \"I'll go myself. The Smooth Stone is my burden after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want to do this?

Before everyone's eyes, Oren bloated up again, growing about a foot all around. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-I'll keep bloating until I flatten all of Hyrule.\" She finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.

Wherever Zelda went, her chosen knight wouldn't be too far away. <br>\r\n\"Forgive me if I offend, Princess, but Hylians have never really understood us,\" Mipha said in her quiet voice. \"They believe us to be less evolved versions of the Rito, which may be true. However, the Zora are a proud race, with a history dating back to the Hero of Time himself!\"<br>\r\nZelda nodded. She had extensive knowledge of the various incarnations of the Hero throughout time. From the Hero of the Sky who battled an ancient evil, to the Hero of Twilight who fought against both the Usurper King and the Demon King, she knew them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may ask one thing, Mipha...\" Zelda asked, stopping to peer over a railing at some Zoras swimming down below. <br>\r\n\"The Zoras eat fish, correct? Yet it was always my belief that the Zoras were descended from fish?\"<br>\r\nMipha let out a quiet laugh. <br>\r\n\"Yes, it is true. Our records don't go back quite that far, but it is believed that the first group of Zora's came into being when the Goddess Nayru took pity on a group of washed up fish that were too far from water. The reason we eat fish dates back to the Era of the Hero of Time, when the Zora race had a guardian deity,\" Mipha explained, joining Zelda at the railing. <br>\r\n\"You mean Lord Jabu-Jabu?\"<br>\r\nNodding, Mipha continued. <br>\r\n\"Yes. Lord Jabu-Jabu's favourite meal was actually fish, despite him being a rather large one. After he disappeared from his lake, we grieved for his loss by eating a feast in his memory. That feast consisted mainly of fish, in remembrance of his favourite food\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And it is a tradition that continues to this day, I presume?\" Zelda asked, her eye drawn to a glint of light reflecting off the Master Sword's blade. Both Mipha and Zelda watched as Link showed a group of young Zoras the Blade of Evil's Bane. Mipha smiled at the \"Ooo's\" and \"Ahh's\" Link received. <br>\r\n\"It was always believed that the Zora Princess could prepare the best fish,\" Mipha said after a moment of silence. \"As the one who fed Lord Jabu-Jabu was Princess Ruto, the secret to his meals was passed down through Zora Royalty\".<br>\r\n\"So you could prepare something like it?\" Zelda asked. <br>\r\n\"I suppose I could. I've never really tried. After all, I was raised a Princess. Meals were cooked for me, not by me\".<br>\r\nThinking, Zelda finally spoke up. <br>\r\n\"Well then, let's try it!\"<br>\r\nMipha looked at her, confusion on her face. Zelda never really got this excited, especially these days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Are you sure? Like I said, I've never really cooked anything...\" She trailed off. <br>\r\n\"I'm sure that between the three of us, we can work something out!\" Zelda said excitedly. <br>\r\n\"Well, okay... I guess I could try. But first, we need to deliver that report to my father,\" Mipha reminded Zelda, who nodded. <br>\r\n\"Of course. We should head there now\".<br>\r\nAs the pair headed off, Link didn't notice them, too busy being mobbed by children wanting to look at the Master Sword. It wasn't until Zelda came back and grabbed him by the arm that he escaped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their report on the Divine Beast, Zelda, Mipha and Link headed up to the reservoir, where they had been camping. <br>\r\n\"Right. Here's how it's going to go,\" Zelda said firmly. \"Link, you can start on a fire. Mipha, you and I will look for fish\".<br>\r\nLink nodded, pulling a bundle of wood out of his magic pouch. Zelda had asked on multiple occasions how he managed to fit extra clothes, spare weapons, food, materials and camping gear in there, but he could never give a proper answer. <br>\r\n\"How about these ones?\" Zelda asked, pointing to a group of blue fish. <br>\r\n\"Armoured Carp... No, I think Hyrule Bass would do just fine. Unless you're planning on heading into battle?\" Mipha asked, smiling. <br>\r\n\"No, of course not!\" Zelda replied, shaking her head. \"Okay, so... Hyrule Bass look like this?\"<br>\r\nShe showed Mipha a picture of a green fish on her Sheikah Slate. She nodded. <br>\r\n\"Pictures are all well and good, but nothing beats the real thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMipha stabbed her spear into the water and pulled it out, a green fish skewered on the end. She repeated this a couple of times, until Zelda could no longer carry all of them. <br>\r\n\"I think that should do!\" Mipha said, pleased with her catch. \"Normally, they are much harder to catch\".<br>\r\nAs they reached their camp, Zelda sighed. She had just seen Link...<br>\r\n\"Oh, have you already eaten?\" Mipha asked, disappointment in her voice. She had been looking forward to cooking for Link, one the reasons she had agreed to in the first place. <br>\r\nLink shrugged, a sorry look on his face. <br>\r\n\"Argh!\" Zelda stamped her foot. \"Mipha was all ready to prepare this nice meal, and you couldn't wait!\"<br>\r\nLink looked away. He never really spoke, unless you really prompted him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its fine, Princess. I can cook for the two of us,\" Mipha said, laying a hand on Zelda's shoulder. She instantly perked up. \"Thank you, Mipha,\" she said, bowing her head in thanks. \"I simply cannot wait!\"<br>\r\nZelda watched Mipha go through the steps of preparing their dinner. She looked on with interest as she took the bones out of the fish, before cutting it into pieces and sprinkling on a little salt. <br>\r\n\"We give thanks to Lord Jabu-Jabu for this meal,\" she said quietly, before closing her eyes and concentrating. <br>\r\n\"A silent prayer,\" she said to Zelda before handing her a silver plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, that was delicious!\"<br>\r\nZelda leaned back against the rock she had chosen to act as a chair. Mipha sat opposite her, a pleased expression on her face. <br>\r\n\"Thank you, Princess. It's kind of you to say,\" Mipha thanked her. Behind her, Link was practicing with the Master Sword, which drew Zelda's eye. <br>\r\n\"Do you think he's ready?\" Mipha asked, hearing the blade cut through the air. <br>\r\n\"Are any of us truly ready?\" Zelda asked, worry in her voice. <br>\r\n\"You needn't worry. With all of us working together, we'll do brilliant!\" Mipha reassured her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Zelda fell silent. Everybody was ready... Everybody except her. She couldn't awaken her power, which was critical to the plan. Sure, Link was good with the Master Sword, but unless she could seal Ganon away, he would be battling for a very long time. <br>\r\n\"I must return to the Domain,\" Mipha said, bringing Zelda out of her thoughts. \"Remember that Lynel up there\".<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course. Be safe, Mipha\".<br>\r\nAs she watched Mipha go, Zelda placed her hands on her belly. She briefly thought that it felt softer, but dismissed the notion. She had just had a large dinner, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stay up too late, please,\" she told Link, who nodded. He normally went to bed after her and woke before her. She used to believe that he never actually slept until she was woken during a storm, which Link had slept right through. <br>\r\nAs she lay down on her sleeping bag, Zelda shifted. Her backside felt a little odd, as did her breasts...<br>\r\n\"It's nothing,\" she said, drifting off to sleep. <br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Zelda slept, Link was wide awake. Despite her earlier order, he was busy keeping watch. He had one eye trained on the sky, and the other on a nearby ramp. The Lynel that Mipha had warned them about lived up that ramp, and while it didn't normally come down the ramp, Link didn't want to be held responsible for Zelda's death. <br>\r\nA clap of thunder caused Zelda to sit upright. <br>\r\n\"What-What?!\" She yelped, looking around. She saw Link sitting opposite her, looking over a nearby mountain. Following his gaze, she saw rain clouds coming towards them, along with some lightning. <br>\r\n\"We can't stay here,\" she said to Link, who nodded. \"The Master Sword is made of metal, which will attract that lightning. We should head back to the Domain\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter packing up their camp, Zelda pulled her hood up. While Link wasn't looking, she adjusted her blue top, which felt quite tight. <br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" She asked, looking at Link. He nodded and set off ahead of her. <br>\r\nA few steps down the path, the pair ran into a Lizalfos, making Zelda thankful that he had gone first. Normally, she would rush ahead, confident that she would run into no danger. <br>\r\nLink drew the Master Sword, moon light reflecting off its blade. The Lizalfos slashed at Link with its crude weapon. Link easily parried it and hit back with his own slash. Unable to dodge, the Lizalfos fell back before bursting into smoke. <br>\r\n\"T-Thank you,\" she said to Link. Even since he had saved her from the Yiga Clan, he never let her go anywhere alone. Even when she needed to go to the bathroom, he would be near. <br>\r\nLink nodded. He gripped the Master Sword tighter when a roar echoed from the mountain next to them. <br>\r\n\"The Lynel... We should hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda ran into Zoras Domain, water dripping off her hood. They weren't able to outrun the storm, something Zelda voiced her displeasure about. <br>\r\n\"I hate the rain!\" She complained, shaking her head and covering Link with water. He pulled his own hood down and hung it over a chair while Zelda looked around. They had ended up in the inn, which was more a coincidence than anything. <br>\r\n\"I would like two beds please. One normal, and one water,\" Zelda asked the owner. <br>\r\nHe bowed. <br>\r\n\"Of course, your Highness. They are on the house, of course. Lady Mipha had a feeling that a storm might hit tonight, and reserved two beds\".<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Zelda said. She jumped when lightning hit the ground outside. <br>\r\n\"I hate lightning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Zelda awoke to see Mipha standing at the foot of her bed. As she sat up, the bed sloshed underneath her. <br>\r\n\"Lady Mipha. I wasn't expecting to see you so soon. I must thank you for reserving these beds for us,\" Zelda said, gesturing to her bed. <br>\r\n\"Not an issue, Princess. I took the liberty of preparing breakfast for you. After last night, I find cooking... relaxing,\" Mipha said, pointing to a plate on the table behind her. One plate was empty, indicating that Link was up. <br>\r\n\"My thanks\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda took a seat at the table. It wasn't the kind of breakfast she was used to, but she still devoured it. <br>\r\n\"Ahhh... You really are an outstanding cook!\" Zelda complimented, rubbing her belly. <br>\r\nMipha blushed. <br>\r\n\"You're too kind, Princess. Anyway, I hated to tell you this, but the storm caused a landslide on the path to the Domain. I'm afraid you'll be stuck here for a while,\" Mipha explained. <br>\r\nZelda nodded. <br>\r\n\"I'll need to inform Daruk. We were meant to inspect Vah Rudania later today,\" Zelda mused, tapping her chin. She didn't notice how it felt softer, her jawline less defined. <br>\r\n\"I'll send a Zora up one of the waterfalls. They won't be able to head up to Goron City, but they should be able to get the message to a Goron\".<br>\r\nZelda nodded. She blushed when her stomach let out a quiet gurgle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still hungry?\" Mipha giggled. <br>\r\n\"I-I... Guess so,\" Zelda stuttered, embarrassed by her stomach. <br>\r\n\"There's still some food left up near the throne room. You're welcome to have it,\" Mipha offered. \"Then again, I have heard that your knight is no slouch when it comes to cooking\".<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\nZelda was surprised to hear that. She had no idea that Link could cook...<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll be here for a while. Feel free to tour the city,\" Mipha said, leaving Zelda alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter adjusting her top, which had grown tighter around her bust, Zelda headed out into the Domain. She was still feeling hungry, and the news that Link was an accomplished chef had intrigued her. She always liked trying new things. <br>\r\nThen again, Mipha's cooking wasn't too bad either...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding upon Link, Zelda looked around for him. Usually, he didn't go too far, but on this occasion, he was nowhere to be seen. It wasn't until she heard a number of Zoras making a fuss that she found him. <br>\r\n\"Oh, Link! There you are!\" Zelda said, relief in her voice. He was surrounded by the same group of young Zoras from yesterday, all of which were asking him to show off the Master Sword again. <br>\r\nHearing them all talk, Zelda fell silent. She wanted to see if he was any closer to mastering it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsheathing the blade, Link gave it a couple of practice swings, which caused the group to step back a little bit. He placed the blade on his shoulder and concentrated for a moment. <br>\r\nSwinging the sword horizontally, a beam of light shot out of the blade, startling the crowd of Zoras and causing Zelda to gasp. <br>\r\n\"He's never done that before!\" She said, a hint of excitement in her voice. \"Maybe the spirit is beginning to trust him?\"<br>\r\nSmiling as he was mobbed again, Zelda leaned back. She missed this sense of normalcy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the crowd dispersed to go swimming. A couple of them voiced their disappointment that Link couldn't join them, but made no protest when Zelda approached them. <br>\r\n\"So, Link. A rather interesting rumour has reached my ears. It seems that you are an experienced chef?\" Zelda asked, raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\nLink hesitated before nodding. He did have experience cooking, but it was his own unique style. He had never told the Princess for a couple of reasons. One, his food was rather, well... fattening, and two, Zelda loved trying new things. <br>\r\n\"I would like you to prepare a meal for me,\" Zelda said to him. He didn't dare protest. She had a bad temper when things didn't go her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Link to a cooking pot inside the entrance to the inn, Zelda sat next to the fire and warmed her hands. She watched as Link pulled out a juicy slab of meat from his pouch, her mouth almost watering...<br>\r\nShe caught herself, just in time to see Link produced a Hyrule Herb and a Hearty Radish. He threw them into the pot and sat back, watching the ingredients simmer. <br>\r\nSniffing, Zelda was amazed at how good it smelt. It was the perfect blend of smells, all combining together to create a beautiful aroma...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped as the ingredients disappeared in a cloud of smoke. <br>\r\n\"You burnt it!\" She complained, looking at Link, who ignored her. He plunged his hands into the smoke and pulled out something that caused Zelda's eyes to widen. <br>\r\nThe Gourmet Meat smelt divine. The Herb had been sprinkled atop it, while the radish had been cut apart and lay around the meat. <br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" She asked, amazed at the presentation. She hadn't even seen him cut it...<br>\r\nLink shrugged. He just kind of threw ingredients into a pot, gave it a few seconds and a meal came out. He had never really thought about how it worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding a plate to Zelda, he left the Inn. Zelda didn't know where he was going, nor did she particularly care when she took a bite of the meat. She moaned as it practically fell apart in her mouth. <br>\r\n\"So good... Mipha wasn't lying!\"<br>\r\nZelda dug into her meal with gusto, not noticing her body slowly growing. Her soft belly bulged outwards, pushing against her blue tunic. Her breasts, reasonably sized for her age, grew tighter within her bra. Her backside, which had been commented on by people thinking she wasn't listening when she actually was, became thicker, causing her pants to tighten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh... Delicious!\"<br>\r\nZelda leaned back and let out a quiet burp. She rubbed her belly, not noticing how soft it was now. Standing up, she wobbled slightly. <br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Odd. Must just be light-headed\".<br>\r\nAs she headed outside, she didn't notice her thighs brushing against each other, nor her jiggling backside. Spying Link looking over a railing, she headed up to him. <br>\r\n\"That was an excellent meal, Link. Thank you very much!\" She said, bowing her head to convey her thanks. Link merely nodded. He had noticed Zelda's thicker body, her bigger breasts, her wider hips...<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\nHe stopped staring at her and shook his head. <br>\r\n\"Very well then. Seeing as we are stuck here until that landslide is cleared, I suppose I could have a look around. After all, we don't stay in these places for very long. I would like you to remain here. No harm should come to me in a major city!\" Zelda said, walking off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exploring most of the Domain, Zelda took a seat outside the Throne Room. She was breathing heavily, for reasons she couldn't understand. <br>\r\n\"Must be... something in the air,\" she said, taking a deep breath. Relaxing on her bench, Zelda looked around. Down in the centre of the city, she saw Mipha and Link talking, much to her annoyance. Off to the right, she saw an elderly Zora teaching a bunch of younger ones. And to the left, she saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zelda looked to the left, Ploymus Mountain towering in the distance. She had heard tales of a Lynel, a creature with the body of a horse, the torso of a human and the head of a lion, that lived there. Link and her had encountered one when they had gotten lost in the Hebra Mountains. Link had drawn the Master Sword, determined to defend her. However, one shock arrow had caused him to drop it, prompting Zelda to order a retreat. The pair had split up to lose him. Zelda made it safely to a nearby stable, but Link had gotten lost in the mountains for a couple of days. She remembered her grief at his loss, and her relief when he had staggered over a hill, sunlight reflecting off the blade of the Master Sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, look out!\"<br>\r\nA shout from a Zora Guard drew her back to reality. She looked around, seeing the guard that had shouted at her pointing to the sky above her. She followed his finger. Initially, she saw nothing. Then she heard a crackling noise, the same made by shock arrows...<br>\r\nShe was pushed from the bench, landing heavily on the ground and causing her to let out a yelp. Her breasts bounced, and her new belly rippled. She looked up at the guard that had pushed her to the ground. She opened her mouth to warn him about the approaching arrow...<br>\r\nShe wasn't fast enough. The arrow embedded itself in the guards back, causing him to yell with pain and collapse next to her. She scrambled to her knees and tried to pull the arrow out, remembering that the Zoras really didn't like electricity of any sort. She let out her own yell as the arrow shocked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a hand grab her shoulder and guide her away from the guard, Zelda struggled against the grip. She only stopped when she was spun around, revealing Link with a serious expression on his face. <br>\r\n\"Link!\" She gasped. \"What's happening?!\"<br>\r\n\"Princess, we must get you out of here,\" a quiet voice answered from behind Link. Mipha walked out of what looked like an armoury, a silver spear in her hands. \"The Lynel that lives on Ploymus Mountain is attacking the Domain\".<br>\r\n\"But, why?\" Zelda asked. She had done a little research into Lynels, and they normally kept their distance from populated areas. <br>\r\n\"He knows he has an advantage over us with his shock arrows. Even touching one would render a Zora unable to attack,\" Mipha explained. \"Link, take her to my room. Then meet me by the eastern gate\".<br>\r\nLink nodded, grabbing Zelda's hand. She yanked it free from his grasp. <br>\r\n\"I can find my own way there, thank you very much!\" She said, annoyed. \"You deal with the Lynel\".<br>\r\nLink nodded again. He looked at Mipha before the pair ran off, leaving Zelda alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briefly considered running after them, but reconsidered. She had no weapons, nor any training with weapons. Sure, she had the Sheikah Slate with bombs and stasis, but Link had told her off when she had tried to help him with bombs. Thankfully, his burn wasn't too severe and healed quickly. <br>\r\nDeciding to do what Link and Mipha had told her, she ran towards the throne room. She stopped halfway up a set of stairs when she heard a roar in the distance. Looking to the east, she let out a gasp. <br>\r\nShe saw the Lynel swing his massive sword. A blue figure backflipped away before jumping forward and bringing its sword down hard, causing the Lynel to stagger backwards. A red figure then jumped over him, stabbing with their spear and forcing the Lynel backwards even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Zelda!\"<br>\r\nLooking around Zelda saw the elderly Zora that was teaching earlier staring at her. <br>\r\n\"Princess, it is much too dangerous out here for you!\" He told her. A shock arrow hit the ground behind her, causing them both to jump. <br>\r\n\"I realise that, but...\" Zelda trailed off. She wanted to help, but had no means to do so. \"Very well. Mipha has allowed me to remain in her room. Where about is it?\"<br>\r\n\"Follow me,\" the Zora said, walking off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on Mipha's bed, which sloshed beneath her, Zelda looked around. Mipha had a nice room, with a view over the Domain. On her dresser sat a blue cloth, similar to the one sent to the four Champions. Beside it was a picture of Mipha and Link when they were younger. Link wore a goofy grin on his face, and had a large cut down his arm. Mipha, on the other hand, had a subdued smile and worry in her eyes. She hated when Link hurt himself, but was always happy to heal any injuries he had. <br>\r\nZelda sighed. Every so often, she heard a distant roar, indicating that Link and Mipha were still battling the Lynel. She felt so useless, just sitting here and doing nothing. <br>\r\n\"Princess?\"<br>\r\nA knock at the door caused her to jump to her feet. <br>\r\n\"Yes? Who is it?\" She asked, opening the door. A couple of small Zoras carrying trays looked at her. <br>\r\n\"We thought you might get hungry, so we brought you some food!\" One of them said brightly, handing Zelda a tray. <br>\r\n\"This one's for Link, for helping Princess Mipha fight the scary Lynel,\" A second one said, handing a second tray to her. <br>\r\n\"Thank you. I'll make sure he gets it,\" Zelda said, bowing to show her thanks. She took the trays and set them on the bed, sitting next to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat, her stomach let out a grumble. <br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it is about lunchtime,\" Zelda said, taking the lid off her tray. A pile of Roasted Bass was revealed. She gently poked one, smiling as she felt how hot they were. <br>\r\n\"Freshly cooked Bass... I must say, the Zora style of cooking is rather nice\".<br>\r\nPicking one up, Zelda dug in, quickly devouring it. She smiled again, licking her lips. Zelda then worked her way through the rest of her meal, eating the next fish faster than the last, until she stuffed the last one in her mouth, chewing madly. <br>\r\n\"URRP... Oh, excuse me!\" Zelda said, embarrassed. She lay back on the bed, listening to the water slosh beneath her. Putting her hands on her belly, Zelda still didn't notice that it was much softer, her tunic tight around it. It formed a noticeable bump against it. Her bra was just as tight, her breast flesh starting to overflow the cups. Her pants were tight as well, the fabric slipping in between Zelda's much rounder ass cheeks. Her face was softer, a second chin starting to form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising a chubby arm to her face, she brushed a strand of hair out of her vision. Her fingers were plumper, her hands no longer dainty. Her thighs rubbed against each other as she sat up, her belly splitting into two small rolls. <br>\r\n\"I haven't heard anything in awhile... Is it over?\" Zelda wondered. The silence in the room was broken by another rumble from her stomach, which caused her to sigh. <br>\r\n\"I just ate!\" She said to herself. \"I can't seriously be hungry again!\"<br>\r\nLooking over, she saw Links tray of fish sitting on Mipha's dresser...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at the tray that contained Links portion of fish, Zelda stood up. Sure, that Zora child had cooked that fish for Link, but surely Link wouldn't know about it? She walked over to the tray, her belly jiggling with each step. She picked it up and took it back to the bed, sitting down with the tray on her lap. <br>\r\n\"Oh, it's cold!\" She exclaimed, a hint of unhappiness in her voice. \"I guess I cannot afford to be picky\".<br>\r\nPicking up one of the fish, she began her second feast, ripping massive chunks away with her teeth. She ate as though she hadn't eaten in months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffing the final piece of fish into her open mouth, Zelda lay back and groaned. She was stuffed!<br>\r\n\"URRRP... Oh...\" She mumbled, her belly painfully stuffed to the brim. She lay her hands on her new potbelly and slowly rubbed it, hoping to alleviate some of the pain. She felt drowsy after her massive meals, and Mipha's bed was so comfy...<br>\r\nWithout even thinking about it, Zelda gently squeezed her new belly, her chubby fingers digging into her soft flesh. Taking a deep breath, she felt her tunic tighten around her chest, her breasts almost twice the size they were that morning. As Zelda pushed her heavier body so her head was lying on a pillow, she reached around to the back of her pants and gave them a gentle pull. Her pants, which had always shown off her ass, was pulled out from in between her fatter ass cheeks. <br>\r\n\"So... tired...\" Zelda yawned, closing her eyes and drifting off to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up, Zelda looked around the room, confused about her surroundings. It took her a minute to remember that she had fallen asleep in Mipha's room, and not the inn. Looking outside, she saw the moon high in the sky, indicating that it was rather late at night. Despite that, she could heard voices from outside. <br>\r\nStanding up, Zelda adjusted her tunic, pulling it down slightly. She then dislodged her pants from in between her ads cheeks before leaving Mipha's room, her body jiggling slightly. She immediately ran into a guard, who was standing outside the door. <br>\r\n\"Princess Zelda!\" He stood to attention. \"King Dorephan posted me here to keep an eye on you!\"<br>\r\nZelda nodded. <br>\r\n\"Thank you. Where would Link and Princess Mipha be?\" Zelda asked. <br>\r\n\"I imagine they would be in the Throne Room. I shall allow them to explain the situation to you,\" the Guard said, pointing to the Throne Room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the Throne Room, Zelda dislodged her pants again. She was considering getting them in a bigger size, just so she wouldn't have to do that. Looking around the room, she saw Mipha and Link both kneeling in front of King Dorephan. Off to the right, a smaller Zora stood behind a pillar, staring at Link with awe. Zelda announced her presence with a cough, causing Mipha and Link to stand and face her. <br>\r\n\"Princess Zelda! A pleasure to see you,\" Mipha said, bowing her head. Link merely nodded. He was never one to show much emotion. <br>\r\n\"Ah, Princess! I'm glad to see you awake!\" King Dorephan boomed. If Zelda wasn't awake before, she definitely was now. King Dorephan was never quiet, his whisper just as loud as a normal person talking. <br>\r\n\"King Dorephan\". Zelda bowed, her belly splitting into a number of rolls. Her pants lodged themselves back in between her ass cheeks. \"How is the Domain faring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link and I managed to drive the Lynel back up to Ploymus Mountain. However, Link wasn't content with merely driving it off, and pursued it,\" Mipha explained. \"He managed to defeat it, however he did sustain a number of injuries\".<br>\r\nZelda couldn't help but smile. For as long as she had known him, Link had always been reckless. He wouldn't hesitate to help anyone in danger, and hated letting his enemies get away. <br>\r\n\"I am pleased to hear that. I don't suppose there's any word on the landslide?\" Zelda asked, not wanting to sound rude. She loved Zoras Domain, however, she really needed to check on Vah Rudania...<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, Princess!\" King Dorephan shouted. \"The landslide has been cleared, so you'll be able to leave whenever you wish!\"<br>\r\nZelda nodded. She would've started for Death Mountain right now, however she noticed Link wasn't looking too good. <br>\r\n\"We shall leave in the morning. Mipha, can you please tend to Links injuries?\" Zelda asked, looking at Mipha, who nodded, the hint of a smile on her face. She lead Link to a side chamber, pausing to smile at the small Zora who was still hiding behind a pillar.<br>\r\n\"Sidon!\" King Dorephan shouted. \"Why are you not in bed!?\"<br>\r\nThe small Zora ran off, giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Zelda awoke to find Mipha at the foot of her bed again. <br>\r\n\"Lady Mipha. To what do I owe the pleasure?\" Zelda asked, stretching. As she did, her tunic rode up slightly, revealing the bottom of her pudgy belly. <br>\r\n\"Just a report. Link is all ready to go, and is waiting outside for you. He packed everything while you slept. And this is for you,\" Mipha explained, handing a bag to Zelda. Looking inside, she saw a number of Roasted Fish. <br>\r\n\"The bag will keep them warm. The lining was made with Red Chu Jelly, which helps trap and produce heat,\" Mipha said. <br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mipha. Hopefully, I should see you soon. Although, there is quite a bit of time before I'm scheduled to visits Zoras Domain again,\" Zelda said, standing up. She tugged her tunic down, covering her belly again. Mipha noticed this, but didn't say anything. Link had explained the situation to her while she was healing him, and had warned her of Zelda's temper. <br>\r\n\"The Domain will always welcome you, not matter when you visit,\" Mipha assured her, smiling. <br>\r\n\"Thank you. Now, I should get going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping outside, Zelda spotted Link, who was showing the Master Sword to the Zora from the Throne Room last night. <br>\r\n\"My younger brother, Prince Sidon,\" Mipha explained, stepping next to Zelda. \"He's always been fascinated by Link\".<br>\r\nAs Zelda walked up to Link, Mipha noticed Zelda's thighs rubbing against each other, and her backside jiggling. Her pants were drawn tight against Zelda's larger ass. Once again, she said nothing. <br>\r\n\"Link. We should get moving,\" Zelda said, grabbing his shoulder. Link sheathed the Master Sword and nodded. <br>\r\n\"Will I see you again?\" Sidon asked excitedly. <br>\r\n\"Yes, you most likely will,\" Mipha said to her brother, before looking at Link and Zelda. \"Be safe out there, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mipha. Although, Link will most likely forget that!\" Zelda joked, looking at her knight, who gave a sheepish smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair left Zoras Domain, Zelda couldn't shake the feeling that her clothes felt... off. Of course, she only had the one set, which she just washed when she could, so maybe they had shrunk? <br>\r\n\"Yes, that must be it...\" Zelda said quietly, pulling up the map on her Sheikah Slate. Death Mountain was a fair distance, and they had elected to leave their horses at the Castle, much to Zelda's annoyance. Her father had insisted that the walk would do them good, to which she had reluctantly agreed. <br>\r\nLooking at Death Mountain, she could see Vah Rudania stomping around its peak. <br>\r\n\"Hopefully, we get there soon!\" Zelda said, adjusting her tunic. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zelda looked up at the peak of Death Mountain, which loomed before them. They had made good time, only stopping a few times at her request to eat. Link didn't eat much, content to just munch away at some apples, while Zelda had stuffed her face with the fish Mipha had prepared for her. <br>\r\n\"Hmmmm... Only one left,\" Zelda muttered, looking inside the bag Mipha had given her. One fish rolled around inside. She briefly considered offering it to Link, but decided against it. Mipha had given them to her, after all. <br>\r\nLooking up, Zelda saw the sun disappear behind a mountain, indicating that daylight was coming to a close. <br>\r\n\"Link, we should stop at the stable for the night,\" Zelda suggested, tugging her shirt down. Despite the long walk, Zelda had still managed to gain a small amount of weight, her belly causing her tunic to ride up. <br>\r\nLink nodded, his eyes looking around. The path up to Death Mountain was fraught with danger, especially from red Chu-Chu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the stable, Zelda headed inside while Link waited outside. Just over the hill next to the stable, they had spotted a Wizzrobe, which had caused Zelda some concern. <br>\r\n\"What if it attacks us at night?\" She asked anxiously. Link merely told her that it wouldn't, Wizzrobes stay in one area and patrol or constantly. Zelda insisted that he do something about it, just in case. <br>\r\n\"Your Majesty,\" the stable owner greeted Zelda, bowing. \"It truly is a great honour to have you stay with us\".<br>\r\nZelda returned his bow, her belly splitting into rolls again. <br>\r\n\"The pleasure is mine. May I request a soft bed and a regular bed?\" Zelda asked, straightening up and tugging her tunic down again. <br>\r\n\"Of course. No need to pay!\" He insisted, seeing Zelda reaching into a bag. \"My treat. All I ask is that you defeat that Ganon\".<br>\r\nZelda nodded. <br>\r\n\"Of course I will. You have my word,\" she promised. Unknown to the owner, she was reaching for the final fish. She never carried any rupees, leaving them to Link and his magic pouch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat at a table, Zelda jumped as she heard lightning strike the ground outside. <br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" She yelped, her breathing speeding up. After a couple of deep breaths, she relaxed. She hated lightning with a passion. Ever since she was a child, and she was almost killed by a lightning strike...<br>\r\n\"Link!\" She said, a hint of joy in her voice. Having Link nearby during a lightning storm calmed her immensely, the lightning electing to aim for the sword on his back. Sure, she was inside, but even so...<br>\r\n\"I assume that the Wardrobe has been defeated?\" She asked, casting her eye over Link, who was dripping wet. He nodded, pulling his soaked hood from his head and draping it over a seat. <br>\r\n\"Good, good... Thank you,\" she said, reaching into her bag and pulling out the last fish. Across the table, Link reached into his pouch and pulled out a piece of cooked meat, complete with diced carrots and herb sprinkled over the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her own meal, Zelda looked back at Link. She briefly glanced at his meal and then back at him. Link pushed it across to her with a silent sigh, pulling out a seared steak which he ate. She dug into her meal, the fish laying at the side of the plate. Juice from the meat dripped onto her tightening trousers. <br>\r\nPlacing the last carrot in her mouth, Zelda let out a contented sigh. <br>\r\n\"Link, you really are an exceptional cook!\" She said happily, patting her belly and causing it to ripple. Link just shrugged, busy polishing the Master Sword. <br>\r\nShe picked up the fish, quickly finishing it off. Letting out a quiet burp, Zelda leaned back on her chair, causing it to creak from her increased weight. Discreetly reaching down, she yanked her pants out from her thicker ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Zelda would've happily slept until noon, only Link shook her awake, much to her annoyance. <br>\r\n\"We aren't all knights!\" She complained, tugging her tunic down over her bigger belly. It bulged out over the waistband of her trousers. Her tunic no longer fully covered it, no matter how much she tugged her tunic. Her breasts were tight within her bra, which was on its biggest setting. Beneath her, her ass spread out over the bed slightly. Her thighs pushed against each other, fighting for space between her legs. <br>\r\nStanding up and stretching, her tunic rode up, revealing her round belly to Link, who looked away. <br>\r\n\"Right then. Shall we continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway up Death Mountain, the pair stopped for a break. Zelda sat on a rock, covered in sweat. Link stood opposite her, digging around in his pouch. Producing two bottles, he handed one to Zelda and drank the second himself. Sipping her own bottle, Zelda asked for a snack. Link dug around in his pouch again, pulling out a couple of apples for himself and a couple of cooked birds legs for Zelda. <br>\r\nShe quickly munched through them, letting out a burp. Link glanced at her as she did, but looked away when she stood up. Downing the last of her elixir, Zelda stretched again, her tunic riding up. Tugging it down, she looked up at the peak of Death Mountain, where Vah Rudania could be been seen. <br>\r\n\"It's amazing, isn't it?\" She said to Link, who raised an eyebrow. \"The technology of the ancient Sheikah? I find it hard to believe that the Sheikah were once as prosperous a race as the Hylians. Now, they are scattered over a small area, almost forgotten...\"<br>\r\nLink stopped listening. Zelda would go on these rants every so often. He never really followed them, but as long as he nodded periodically, she would be none the wiser. <br>\r\n\"Now, we should continue. I would very much like to reach Goron City before nightfall,\" Zelda said, spinning to face Link. Her belly jiggled as she did. <br>\r\nLink nodded, and continued up the trail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, the pair arrived in Goron City. Link walked into the city, paused and looked at Zelda, who started lagging when they hit the hill leading up to the entrance to the city. She eventually stumbled into the city, covered in sweat and breathing heavily. <br>\r\n\"I swear... that hill is much... steeper than before....\" She huffed, bending over. Her pants tightened immensely, almost ripping. Her belly split into multiple rolls, two of which were visible. <br>\r\nLink shrugged. The hill was no steeper, but Zelda was much less fit than the last time she was here. Of course, Link wouldn't tell her that...<br>\r\n\"Ah, Princess!\"<br>\r\nZelda straightened up and wiped perspiration from her forehead. She saw a Goron approaching her, a huge smile on his face. <br>\r\n\"And Brother, too!\" He clapped Link on the shoulders, making his knees buckle. \"Daruk is waiting for you in the usual place!\"<br>\r\nZelda nodded, still trying to catch her breath. <br>\r\n\"Th-Thank you... We'll head up immediately...\"<br>\r\nNodding, the Goron clapped Link on the shoulders again before rolling away. <br>\r\n\"Come on, Link...\" Zelda said, looking at him lying on the ground. \"We should get going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached Daruk's house, they found...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even before they had entered Daruk's house, Zelda smelt it. Food. <br>\r\nRunning inside, she saw a massive rock that had been carved to resemble a table, laden down with all sorts of food. There was different kinds of meat, ranging from ordinary cuts to gourmet slices. At one end, there was something that resembled a rock, presumably for Daruk. <br>\r\n\"Well, well... It's good to see you, Princess!\"<br>\r\nZelda turned, her breasts wobbling. She smiled as she saw Daruk standing in a doorway, a grin on his face. <br>\r\n\"Daruk!\" She said happily. Out of the four Champions, Daruk was probably one of the easiest to talk to. Mipha was too quiet, Revali was just plain cocky and picked on Link constantly. Urbosa was fine when Link wasn't around, but as he was always around, she tended to keep quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope the journey up here wasn't too difficult!\" He said, walking over to Zelda. She shook her head. <br>\r\n\"Of course it wasn't. However, the heat was a little much...\" She said, brushing a stray strand of hair from her vision. <br>\r\n\"Just something you get used to, Princess. And Link, how are you?\" He asked, walking over to Link. \"Good to see that you're doing your job of keeping her safe!\"<br>\r\nAs Link and Daruk chatted, Zelda slowly inched her way towards the table. The smell of the meat was overwhelming her sense of smell, making her mouth water...<br>\r\n\"As per tradition, I prepared a large feast for the two of you!\" <br>\r\nZelda snapped back to reality. She wiped a strand of drool from her mouth and looked at Daruk, who was smiling at her. <br>\r\n\"Well? What are you waiting for? Dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda sat at one end of the table and pulled a massive slab of gourmet meat towards her. She picked up a knife and fork, both made of stone, and cut a bit of meat. Placing it in her mouth, she let out a quiet \"Ahhhh...\" of approval. <br>\r\n\"Up here on Death Mountain, it isn't hard to get things to cook,\" Daruk explained, sitting at the other end of the table. He had a massive rock shaped like a piece of meat in one of his hands, which he used to point at Zelda. <br>\r\n\"All you have to do is drop whatever you want cooked on the floor! Well, on a rock. And there you go, cooked food!\"<br>\r\nZelda nodded. She knew of this already, as Daruk explained it every time they came up here. <br>\r\nFinishing off her first plate of meat, Zelda quickly pulled a second one towards her. Finishing it in record time, she grabbed a third slice with her hands, causing juice to drip onto her clothes. <br>\r\n\"So, Daruk...\" Zelda said through mouthful of meat. \"How's Vah Rudania?\"<br>\r\nDaruk scratched his chin. <br>\r\n\"A little unresponsive. Won't turn when I tell it to. Hopefully, you can fix that?\" <br>\r\nZelda nodded, stuffing the last piece of meat into her mouth and licking her plump lips. <br>\r\n\"Sounds like a simple fix... Daruk, what do rocks taste like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Daruk and Link paused, both trying to process what she had just asked. <br>\r\n\"R-Rocks?\" Daruk asked, confused. Link merely shared at Zelda, who ignored him. <br>\r\n\"Yes, rocks. I see Gorons eating them all the time, and yet I don't know what they taste like. Can you describe it?\" Zelda asked. <br>\r\n\"Well, ummm. They taste... rocky, I guess?\" Daruk tried to explain. \"They're tough to chew through, so Hylians like yourself can't eat them, unless...\"<br>\r\nHe trailed off, seeing Link slowly shaking his head. <br>\r\n\"Unless what?\" Zelda prompted, her curiosity piqued. She loved trying new things, no matter how weird. If she could safely try rocks without losing all her teeth, then she wanted to. <br>\r\n\"Never mind. It's difficult to... to do,\" Daruk lied. He had noticed that Zelda was bigger than their last meeting, but Link had informed him to not mention it if he valued his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda shook her head, seeing right through Daruk's lie. <br>\r\n\"Come now, Daruk... I merely wish to sample food from different races. The Zoras cook fish, the Gerudo have Sand Whale, I'm not sure about the Rito, and the Gorons have rocks. Please, would you mind preparing this dish for me?\"<br>\r\nSeeing how persistent she was, Daruk gave in. <br>\r\n\"Very well... Give me a couple of minutes, I'll be right back. Link, would you mind helping?\" Daruk asked, heading into the adjacent room. Link followed close behind, leaving Zelda sitting at a table filled with food. <br>\r\nGrabbing another plate, Zelda continued her feast, albeit much slower. She really, really wanted to try this new dish that Daruk was talking about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes later, Daruk came back into the room, holding a grey slab of meat that looked like a rock. <br>\r\n\"This is a Rock Roast, taken from a creature that lives in Death Mountain Crater. It looks like a rock, it tastes like rocks... but isn't as tough as a rock. It's more like meat, chewy but not too chewy,\" Daruk said, placing it in front of Zelda, who smiled. <br>\r\n\"Thank you, Daruk. Where is Link, by the way?\"<br>\r\nDaruk shrugged. <br>\r\n\"He's getting something for me. Don't worry, I'll be next door, so if you need me, just shout\".<br>\r\nDaruk headed next door, leaving Zelda alone. Picking up the Rock Roast, she licked her lips and took a bite. <br>\r\nInitially, her face scrunched up. It tasted weird, like warm dirt or something... But as she chewed, the taste grew on her. Taking a second bite, she swallowed quickly. It wasn't as good as she hoped, but at least she knew what it tasted like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll stick with meat and fish...\" She groaned, leaning back on her chair. Unlike the wooden chairs at the stable, this one was made of rock, so it didn't creak as she shifted. Placing her hands on her belly, she burped. <br>\r\nHer stomach was stuffed with food, and was rock hard. Her tunic had ridden up, revealing the lower half of her her growing globe. Her breasts were painfully stuffed into her bra. Reaching down the back of her tunic, Zelda struggled briefly with the clasp. As soon as she managed to open it, she breathed deeply, her chest rising and causing her tunic to tighten. Her thick backside hung over the edges of the chair, and provided comfort for her. Her hips were chubbier and made her pants much tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it?\" Daruk asked, walking back in. He took in the scene before him. Zelda sitting with a stack of plates in front of her, her belly that resembled a rock protruding from her body. <br>\r\n\"It was -URRRP- delicious, Daruk. Thank you very much!\" Zelda thanked him, bowing her head. Her chubbier neck and second chin prevented her from properly bowing her head. <br>\r\n\"No problem. Link mentioned reserving beds down at the inn, so you should head there now. We'll meet up tomorrow to speak about Vah Rudania,\" Daruk said, sitting opposite her. <br>\r\nZelda nodded. She was feeling really drowsy, and was looking forward to bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the inn, Zelda saw Link sitting cross-legged on a bed, the Master Sword lying across his legs. He did this occasionally. He had explained to her that he was trying to awaken the spirit within the sword, but was having no luck with it. According to legend, the spirit had been asleep since the fall of a nameless evil, which she had told him but he still tried. <br>\r\nSitting on the bed next to his, Zelda lay down. She looked at the map on the Sheikah Slate before pulling up the camera. She loved playing around with it. It had the ability to take what she called a 'Picture', which looked way better than a painting. She took pictures whenever she could, as memories of the places she had been. Placing it on the table next to her, Zelda drifted off to sleep, one hand on her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ugh...\"<br>\r\nZelda groaned. She groggily rolled over, groaning again as she did. Light streamed through a window, landing where her head was and blinding the drowsy princess. <br>\r\n\"Why is it... so bright...\" She murmured sleepily, before her eyes snapped open. \"I slept in!\"<br>\r\nSitting up, her belly splitting into rolls and pooling into her lap, Zelda rubbed the sleep from her eye and looked around madly. Links bed was empty. It had been neatly made, presumably by the inn staff as Link left his bed in a mess, the duvet usually hanging off the side. Outside, she could voices and the occasional distant clink of the blacksmith. <br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Zelda stamped her foot, causing her body to ripple. <br>\r\n\"I can't believe he didn't wake me!\" She complained. \"He knows I hate sleeping late!\"<br>\r\nYanking her pants out of her ass, Zelda started jogging, but quickly stopped as her tunic rode up, revealing her larger belly, which hung down past the waistband of her trousers, now reaching for her crotch. Tugging it down, she felt it tighten around her breasts, which had had a second issue. Her bra was digging into them, causing discomfort and slight pain. <br>\r\n\"Stupid bra... Must have shrunk when I washed it!\" Zelda growled, reaching around and taking it off. Her breasts bounced lightly, finally free of their prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChucking it behind her, Zelda headed outside, where she found Link leaning against a wall. As soon as he laid eyes on her face, he knew he was in huge trouble. <br>\r\n\"Link! You know to wake me if I'm not up!\" She shouted, placing her hands on her hips forcefully, causing her breasts to bounce. \"So why didn't you?!\"<br>\r\nLink want to explain that he had tried, but she had pushed his hand away, telling him five more minutes. He didn't get a chance, as Zelda continued shouting. <br>\r\n\"Thanks to your incompetence, we've lost half a day! I could have used it productively, like fixing Vah Rudania! But instead, I lay in bed until the middle of the day!\"<br>\r\nAs Zelda continued chastising him, Link lost interest. She told him off for the most minor infractions, and after a while, he had just gotten used to it. Instead, he looked at her new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zelda yelled, attracting attention from people passing by, her second chin jiggled. Her cheeks were rounder, and red from the immense heat from even being near Death Mountain. Her breasts bounced as she gestured, pointing at various things around the environment. They were approaching the size of Palm Fruits, which were rather heavy and quite big, as Link knew all too well. Her belly was on view, no amount of tugging able to cover it. Her chubby hands were holding onto her new lovehandles. Her hips were much wider, straining her pants. Behind her, Zelda's ass looked like two pumpkins stuffed into a small pair of pants. Every so often, she would reach around and tug at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we've lost half the day, but there is no point complaining about it. What's done Is done,\" Zelda said, crossing her arms underneath her bust, which accentuated it. Link briefly stared at it, only looking at Zelda's round face when she snapped her fingers. <br>\r\n\"My eyes are up here!\" She hissed angrily. \"Now, let's find Daruk and you can explain why we were late!\"<br>\r\nLink nodded, dismissing a number of thoughts about Zelda's breasts. He walked off, Zelda following him, still really annoyed at waking up this late. She hated it with a passion. She grew up with a strict bedtime that her father enforced with an iron fist, so waking up late meant that there was less time for research, which she loved. Tugging her tunic down, which achieved nothing except causing her breasts to bounce, Zelda watched as Link walked into Daruk's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is why we are late, Daruk,\" Zelda finished explaining. She had told Link to do it, but she realised that she should defend herself rather than allow Link to spin some mad story, which he occasionally did. \"I promise, it will not happen again\".<br>\r\nDaruk let out a mighty laugh, causing Zelda to jump. <br>\r\n\"No problem, Princess! We're all entitled to an extra couple of hours of sleep now and then!\" He laughed, placing hand on her shoulder. \"The two of you work so hard, you really should just take a day off sometime\".<br>\r\nZelda's eyes widened in surprised. Behind Daruk, Link smirked. A day off to Zelda was a crazy idea, and if he even mentioned it, it would incite a huge argument between the pair. <br>\r\n\"A... day off?\" She stammered. \"B-But... What about Ganon? The Divine Beasts? My... power?\"<br>\r\nDaruk waved his huge hand. <br>\r\n\"Then let him. The Champions stand ready, as does Link. We can hold him off until you can seal him away!\" He said confidently. \"Just think it over, yeah? If you insist on doing work, then maybe you can fix my steering issue?\"<br>\r\nZelda nodded, still surprised by Daruk's suggestion. <br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah... It shouldn't be too difficult. Perhaps an issue with one of the terminals...\" She mused, tapping her second chin. \"Yeah, that should be it... So a reset of all terminals would be best...\"<br>\r\nDaruk and Link exchanged a look. Whenever any piece of ancient technology malfunctioned and Zelda was tasked with fixing it, she would enter her own world, completely ignoring everything around her. <br>\r\n\"Umm, Princess?\" Daruk asked, waving a hand in front of her face. Link just shook his head. He was used to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... there! That's the final terminal!\" Zelda said triumphantly, placing the Sheikah Slate back on her belt. \"Try it out, Daruk!\"<br>\r\nDaruk nodded. For the duration of the repairs, they had parked Rudania in the crater of the mountain. Zelda and Link were both dripping with sweat, their tunics drenched. They both had an ample supply of elixir, so they weren't in any danger of bursting into flames, unless they fell into the lava. <br>\r\n\"Alright, hold on tight!\" He yelled. Zelda stood next to him, grabbing onto the main terminal. Link was in the centre of Rudania, trying to figure out a way to get a chest. For whatever reason, the ancient Sheikah had locked away chest behind devious puzzles. While Zelda fixed the Beast, Link would attempt to retrieve the contents of any chest, with little luck. Most required the Sheikah Slate, which Zelda protected with her life. He had used it once to blow open a crumbling wall, before Zelda snatched it away. <br>\r\nRudania let out a loud roar. It stomped up the side of the crater. Its body remained level as it did. As it reached the peak, Daruk took control. <br>\r\n\"Alright, take it right!\" Zelda ordered, pointing right. Rudania moved right. <br>\r\n\"And now left!\" Rudania returned to its original position. <br>\r\n\"Link, hold on! We're going to rotate the main body!\" She yelled through down. Seeing Link grab onto a terminal, she nodded at Daruk. <br>\r\nSeeing the body rotate, Zelda clapped her hands. <br>\r\n\"And fixed!\" She said joyfully. Daruk punched the air. <br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah!\" He yelled. \"Bring it on, Ganon! We're ready for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Daruk dropped them off, Zelda found herself sitting in the inn. For some reason, she was feeling really tired...<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, Link...\" She yawned as Link set a plate down in front of her. On it sat a couple of cooked bird thighs, and her favourite meal ever, fruit cake!<br>\r\nShe devoured the bird thighs, letting out a sigh of approval. Grabbing a stone fork, she cut a slice of cake, gently placing it in her mouth. Chewing slowly, she let out a moan, causing Link to look up at her. <br>\r\n\"By Hylia... This is delicious, Link!\" She complimented, placing another piece in her mouth. \"You simply have to give the recipe to the castle chefs! This is much better than the ones they make!\"<br>\r\nPolishing off the fruit cake, Zelda yawned again, causing Link to raise an eyebrow. She had woken late, and it was still early, so why would she be so tired?<br>\r\n\"Fixing the Divine Beasts... really takes it out of you!\" She said, adjusting her tunic. \"Hmmm... I should really get a new one of these...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Link left the Inn, presumably to practice with the Master Sword, Zelda was left alone in the inn. She pulled up the camera on the Sheikah Slate and turned it on herself. She did this often to fix her hair, the heat and the work on Rudania causing her braid to loosen. As she fiddled with it, she failed to notice her forming third chin. <br>\r\n\"And... there. Much better,\" she said, placing the Slate on the table in front of her. Placing her hands on her belly, Zelda leaned back. She tapped her fingers, sending light ripples across her belly. Her small tunic now failed to cover the majority of her belly while sitting. It sat on her chubby lap, covering her crotch. Her wide hips and larger backside hung over the edges of the stone chair, which was an impressive feat in its own, the chairs built for the massive Gorons. Her tunic tightened around her chest as she took a deep breath. <br>\r\n\"So, if Rudania is fixed, then I should be moving onto Vah Medoh next,\" Zelda mused. \"I wonder what special meals the Rito prepare...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing footsteps, Zelda attention turned to the door and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Lady Zelda!\"<br>\r\nLooking at the door, Zelda was surprised to see a guy clad in silver armour bearing the crest of the Royal Family. He ran in, breathing heavily. <br>\r\n\"Princess... Zelda...\" He huffed, clearly out of breath. Zelda could relate, the hill leading up to Goron City also causing her to lose breath travelling up it. <br>\r\n\"Please, take a moment. Have a drink,\" she told the soldier kindly, handing him a canteen filled with water from a Great Fairy's Fountain. It was enchanted to never evaporate, even in the sweltering heat of Death Mountain. <br>\r\nThe soldier accepted the flask, taking a long swig from the flash. He handed it back, wiping a trickle of water from his mouth. <br>\r\n\"Thank you, your Highness\". He bowed. \"Your charity will not be forgotten\".<br>\r\n\"It's no problem, really...\" She said, giving a small smile. \"Now, why have you come here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier straightened up, looking at the plump princess. Her increased weight caused him to hesitate. Like Link, his eyes lingered on her round breasts, which were straining against her tunic. They then travelled quickly downwards, the soldier taking in her multiple uncovered belly rolls and chubby hips. <br>\r\nZelda coughed, glaring at the soldier with impatience. <br>\r\n\"S-Sorry, your Highness...\" He cleared his throat, unravelling a scroll that bore the mark of the Triforce. <br>\r\n\"Your father, King Rhoam, has ordered you and Link to return to Hyrule Castle immediately. He wishes to discuss some important matters with you, and Link must undergo some mandatory training to male sure that he is still fit for duty,\" he read to Zelda. <br>\r\n\"And what about Vah Medoh?\" Zelda asked. She had really been looking forward to seeing what Revali could make for her...<br>\r\n\"Once your business at Hyrule Castle had concluded, you may carry on towards Rito Village. That is all I was told,\" he explained, rolling up the scroll.  <br>\r\n\"Very well. Tell my father that I shall head for the Castle at once,\" Zelda said to the soldier, who nodded and ran out of the inn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Zelda tugged at her pants again before heading outside, her belly rippling with each step. Her fat thighs rubbed against each other as she walked. Spotting Link talking to Daruk, Zelda quickened her pace from a slow walk to a medium walk, the increased speed causing her breasts to bounce. <br>\r\n\"Link!\" Zelda said, touching his shoulder. <br>\r\n\"Ah, Princess! What brings you up here?\" Daruk asked, looking at Zelda's face, which was beaded with sweat and flushed red from effort, rather than heat. <br>\r\n\"Link, my father has sent some new orders for us,\" Zelda explained, pulling out a piece of cloth from her pocket and wiping perspiration from her forehead. She shoved the sweat drenched cloth back into her pocket before continuing. <br>\r\n\"He wants us to return to the castle immediately. He and I have some matters to discuss, and you have some testing to do\".<br>\r\nLink nodded, letting out a silent sigh as he did. He knew of these tests. Below the castle was the lock-up, where they kept a number of monsters. His test was to eliminate all of them, ending with a Stalnox. Occasionally, he got an easy run, some Bokoblins maybe. Nowadays, he got a much tougher challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daruk, I thank you for your hospitality,\" Zelda said to Daruk, bowing to show her thanks. Her belly split into rolls, which caused Link and Daruk to exchange a look. Link shook his head, his meaning clear. He would deal with it... eventually. <br>\r\n\"No problem, Princess,\" Daruk finally said, scratching his head. \"Thanks for fixing Rudania. Now, we'll be ready when Ganon rears his head!\"<br>\r\nZelda nodded sadly. Sure, everybody would be ready. Everybody except her...<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry!\" Daruk assured her, seeing her head droop sadly. He had assumed that Zelda had access to her sealing powers, but Link had just told him that that wasn't the case. \"I'm sure you'll awaken that power soon!\"<br>\r\n\"I hope you're right, Daruk...\" Zelda said, her voice quieter than usual. She quickly perked up when he spoke again. <br>\r\n\"I took the liberty of getting some food for your trip. I know how much you hate that mountain path!\" Daruk said, handing a mountain of food to Zelda. Accepting it, her knees almost buckled under the weight of the pile of food. She could smell fish, meat, baked fruit...<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the fruit. It's... kind of hot up here,\" Daruk said apologetically, scratching his head. <br>\r\n\"It's not an issue, Daruk,\" Zelda said. \"My thanks for this. Link, come. We need to get ready\".<br>\r\nZelda staggered off, the weight a bit much for her. Some pieces of meat fell from the pile, where they were collected by Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we should arrive there tomorrow,\" Zelda finished her plan, looking at Link for confirmation. He nodded approvingly. Normally, he would explain the plan to Zelda, but after a massive argument between the two, Zelda now drew up travel plans. <br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" She clapped her hands, her breasts bouncing lightly. \"Then let's head out!\"<br>\r\nAs they left Goron City, they heard a shout behind them. <br>\r\n\"Hey, you two!\" They turned and saw Daruk atop the gate, waving at them. \"Take care out there!\"<br>\r\nThey waved back. Zelda would've shouted back, but he had already walked away. <br>\r\nAs they started down the mountain path that Zelda despised going up, she sighed in relief as she felt the rocks crumble below her feet, slipping down the hill with her, rather than against her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the stable at the foot of Death Mountain, they stopped for two reasons. One, Zelda had insisted that they stop for food, and two, Link had spotted a number of Bokoblins on the path ahead. He headed off to deal with them while Zelda had a 'Snack'.<br>\r\nPulling out a fish and a couple of slabs of meat, Zelda dropped them onto the table and collapsed onto a chair. Grabbing the fish, she chomped through it, savouring the taste. After her time in Zora's Domain, she now saw fish in a new light. Sure, it wasn't as good as the ones Mipha had prepared for her, but they good all the same. <br>\r\nPatting her belly, which caused it to jiggle, and letting out a burp, Zelda reached for a slab of meat. Pulling it apart, Zelda moaned quietly as she tasted it. It was better than the fish, but not as good as the meals that Link made. <br>\r\nQuickly finishing the first one, Zelda then began on the second, devouring it faster than the first. <br>\r\nLeaning back, she moaned happily, patting her belly. It rippled with each touch. <br>\r\nSeeing Link re-enter the stable, she jumped to her feet, causing her breasts to jump with her. Her tunic now acted as a bra, no longer covering her huge belly. Her belly hung down over her crotch, reaching for her thick thighs. Her ass had caused a couple of rips to form on her pants, through which her fat ass oozed. A third chin now adorned Zelda's round face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" Zelda asked. Link nodded and left the stable, Zelda closely following. They had gotten lucky with the trip between Zora's Domain and Death Mountain. Usually, they would be attacked by wildlife or the occasional Yiga Clan assassin, so hopefully, they would get to the Castle with no incident.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Much to Zelda's relief, they reach Castle Town with no incidents, bar the two Bokoblins that had tried to attack them. Link swiftly disposed of them, leaving them to burst in smoke as they continued on. As soon as Zelda spotted the ranch that sat outside of town, she breathed easy. She loved travelling, but nothing beat Hyrule Castle. <br>\r\n\"Come on, Link!\" She said gleefully, clearly happy to be home. She briefly broke into a run, causing her body to bounce with each step. Her belly jumped, while her breasts bounced madly. The run was short-lived, however. Zelda stopped about five feet from Link and doubled over, breathing heavily. <br>\r\n\"P-Perhaps that... was a mistake...\" She huffed, her face red from the exercise. Link walked past her, ignoring her plight, which irritated her slightly. <br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Wait for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering Castle Town, Zelda couldn't help but smile. She loved Castle Town. From the open farmlands in the west, to the residential area in the west... and she especially loved the centre, where all the restaurants and shops were. As Link continued onwards to the Castle, she stopped at one of her favourite shops, a bakery that made her favourite Fruit Cake. The shopkeeper knew Zelda quite well, as evidenced by his greeting. <br>\r\n\"Ah, Zelda!\" He said joyfully. \"It's good to see you again!\"<br>\r\n\"And you, Ricardo!\" Zelda replied, smiling at the slightly plump man before her. Zelda knew Ricardo well, as he used to work at the Castle when she was young, making her favourite foods and spoiling the Princess. When her father had fired him, she had cried for days, not able to understand why her friend had gone. It was only later that she was told that he had been spoiling her to the point where she beginning to become rather fat and lazy, which her father frowned upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's Hyrule been treating you?\" Ricardo asked, leaning on the counter. <br>\r\n\"Very well, indeed!\" Zelda replied. \"I've been to all sorts of places, like Zora's Domain. They serve such good fish there, you wouldn't believe it... Oh, and I tried Rock Roast at Death Mountain! It wasn't too good, but I could see how some people would like it. And Link... Wow! He's such a good cook. His Fruit Cake wasn't as good as yours, of course, but it was still delicious!\"<br>\r\nRicardo listened with interest. After being fired, he had opened this bakery, where he used his experience as a castle chef to impress Castle Town. After a short while, a familiar girl wearing a blue dress had appeared, looking for a slice of Fruit Cake...<br>\r\n\"And that's mainly it!\" Zelda finished, smiling at Ricardo. \"How's business been?\"<br>\r\nHe shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Not too many people visit here these days. Not with the threat of Ganon hanging over our heads. The sooner you get rid of him, the better! But anyway, I can guess why you're here. Always have a couple of slices on hand, but I'm feeling... generous,\" Ricardo said, eyeing the large princess gleefully. He had always had a thing for larger women, so when Zelda walked into his shop, breasts bouncing and belly jiggling, he had to get quite close to the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't, Ricardo. I really need to get to the Castle...\" Zelda tried to explain, but as soon as she laid eyes on the cake, she changed her tune. <br>\r\n\"Well, maybe a couple of slices...\"<br>\r\nAs she took a seat, Ricardo turned away. He had a prime opportunity to make Zelda even bigger...<br>\r\n\"Change of plans,\" he said, placing a plate with a couple of slices in front of her. \"Just had a look at some of my stock. It won't last long, and it seems a waste to just throw it away...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, no worries!\" Zelda said through a mouthful of cake. \"I might be able to help!\"<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Ricardo asked, stifling a grin. \"There's quite a lot here...\"<br>\r\n\"No, not at all! I'd be happy to -URRP- help!\" Zelda said excitedly. She loved his cooking and would happily eat it all day. <br>\r\n\"Well, let's get started then, shall we?\" Ricardo asked, clapping his hands together. \"First, let's start with this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later, Link finally found Zelda. He had reached the Castle earlier, only to be surprised when he turned and saw that Zelda wasn't with him. He then had to deal with King Rhoam and explain why his daughter was not with him, which took a while. Link was eventually sent away and told not to return until he had located Zelda. He had spent quite a bit of time searching the large town, only to find her in a small bakery down an alleyway. <br>\r\n\"Oh, Link...\" Zelda said drowsily, rubbing her large belly. \"Where have you been..?\"<br>\r\nLink took in the scene before him, surprise on his face. <br>\r\nZelda was slumped on a chair that was creaking rather loudly. Her round face had developed a fourth chin, and was coated with frosting. Her breasts had caused rips to form on her tiny tunic, through which flesh bulged. Her huge belly had split into even more rolls and sat heavily on her thick thighs. Her hips had plumped up considerably, along with her massive ass, which hung of all sides of the seat. Her pants had developed more rips, and were now on the verge of ripping apart altogether. <br>\r\n\"Ah, so you're Link!\" A guy behind the counter said, looking at Link. \"Zelda told me all about you! But, now isn't the time. You're probably looking for her, as is her father\".<br>\r\n\"Father... Oh, no!\" Zelda sat upright. \"I need to get to the Castle!\"<br>\r\nShe got to her feet, her fat sagging downwards. Her belly hung down in front of her thighs now. Her breasts were barely supported by her tunic. <br>\r\n\"Come on, Link!\" She said urgently, stifling a burp. \"We need to go! Thank you, Ricardo!\" She said to Ricardo, bowing her head slightly. <br>\r\nGrabbing Link by the hand, she hurried off, her body jiggling madly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda reached the Castle, breathing very heavily. Her forehead was covered in sweat, and her face was flushed red. <br>\r\n\"Ah, Princess...?\" The guard that approached her trailed off. He remembered a slim Princess, not this massive one that stood before him, panting. <br>\r\n\"Yes... I am here now... Does my father need to see... me?\" She asked. <br>\r\n\"W-Well, he did ask for you...\" The guard said hesitantly. \"He said you could go get changed, or see him directly\".<br>\r\nZelda tapped her chins, causing them to wobble. <br>\r\n\"Tell my father that I...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The guard nodded, heading up the hill. Zelda sighed, looking at the steep hill before her with some distress. She had forgotten about it, and wasn't looking forward to the walk up to her room. <br>\r\n\"Well, I had better get started...\" She muttered unhappily, starting up the winding slope. <br>\r\nAs she reached the first guardhouse, she stopped, partly to regain her breath and partly because she was stopped by a couple of guards, who eyed the fat princess. <br>\r\n\"Well, if it isn't the Princess,\" One of them said, looking at her large belly, which hung down in front of her thighs. <br>\r\n\"Done sampling the finest foods from around Hyrule?\" The second one asked mockingly. <br>\r\nZelda glared at the two guards angrily, her hands on her chubby hips. <br>\r\n\"I'll have you know that I was inspecting the Divine Beasts, not sampling food!\" She said to them, annoyance in her voice. <br>\r\nThe guards looked at each other, grinning. <br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, Your Highness...\" They bowed, still grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda pushed past them, causing them to stumble back as the hefty Princess continued on to her room. <br>\r\n\"The nerve of them!\" She said to herself furiously. \"I have been doing all I can to ensure we are ready for Ganon's return! Not sightseeing and eating!\"<br>\r\nAfter giving off about the two guards, Zelda finally reached the Castle entrance. The guards flanking the massive door bowed as she approached. <br>\r\n\"Welcome home, Your Highness,\" they said in unison. <br>\r\nZelda nodded, glad that they showed her some respect, unlike the pair in the guardhouse. Continuing onwards, she soon reached her room. Shutting the door behind her and sliding the bolt shut, she let out a massive sigh of happiness. \"I'm finally home!\" She said, sitting on her bed. She sank into the soft mattress, her backside spreading over the surface. \"Now, I can take these off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, Zelda grabbed her bra-like tunic and slipped it over her head. Her breasts bounced heavily onto her huge belly, finally free of their prison. Reaching down, she took the Sheikah Slate out of its holder and gently set it on her bedside table. She knew that it was almost indestructible, yet she treated it with care. Knowing her luck, she would find some way to break it. <br>\r\nGrabbing her pants, Zelda pulled them down her legs, revealing an incredibly stretched pair of white panties that looked more like a thong by this point. Her massive ass cheeks had almost swallowed the tiny garment. <br>\r\n\"Finally! I feel like I can breath again!\" Zelda said, taking a deep breath to emphasize her point. Rubbing her massive belly, she lumbered over to her dresser. With each step, her body rippled. Her huge breasts bounced, slapping against her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Zelda asked herself, seeing her familiar blue gown sitting atop her dresser, a note with her father's handwriting placed on it. <br>\r\nZelda,<br>\r\nI took the liberty of having one of your dresses washed and resized for your return. You complained that this gown was rather tight, so it is my hope that it fits you much better now.<br>\r\nYour father<br>\r\nZelda smiled. She had indeed complained about her gown being tight, particularly around her breasts. In the days leading up to her departure, she had wore her Champion's Tunic, which fit her much better. <br>\r\nPicking up her gown, she unfolded it. She admired the handiwork, how the blue colour had been returned to its former glory, rather than the faded colour it was before. <br>\r\n\"It does look rather large...\" She noted, seeing how big it was. Her father had been informed of her recent gain by the messenger sent to Death Mountain. As soon as he heard about it, he commissioned a new dress for his daughter, one that would fit her form perfectly. He did intend to confront her about her gain, but had no idea on how to bring it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting her new dress on, Zelda smiled happily. It fit her form perfectly. Her huge body was completely covered, but didn't hide her huge body. Her belly pushed against it, causing a rather large bump to be visible. Her backside caused the back of the dress to push out, while her hips did the same with the sides. <br>\r\n\"Much better!\" She said, giving a quick twirl. \"Now, I should meet with my father...\" She trailed off, hearing an unfamiliar voice outside. Heading out to her balcony, she saw what it was. <br>\r\nA massive mechanical being sat on the ground, six legs extending from its body. Glowing blue lines were etched upon its surface. Around it stood a couple of Sheikah, who were pointing at various bits and talking. Unfortunately, Zelda couldn't hear what they were saying, but had done enough research to know what it was. <br>\r\nA Guardian. Designed ten thousand years ago, their main purpose was to protect the hero that opposed Calamity Ganon. After her father had heard that prophecy about Ganon's return, he had ordered excavation teams to find them and dig them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at her door drew her away from the Guardian. <br>\r\n\"Princess Zelda! You father requests your presence in his study!\" A muffled voice said from outside. <br>\r\n\"The study... Must be important,\" she noted. Normally, her father and herwould meet in either her room, or the Library. This was the first time that she had been ordered to go his study. <br>\r\nUnlocking her door, Zelda hurried to the Kings Study. Underneath her dress, her belly jiggled, which caused her dress to ripple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father?\"<br>\r\nZelda knocked nervously on the study door. The King may be her father, but when it came to matters that involved Hyrule, that fatherly love would dissipate. <br>\r\n\"Come in,\" A commanding voice answered. <br>\r\nOpening the door, Zelda walked in. <br>\r\nThe study was rather normal. Bookcases that reached towards the ceiling lined the walls. A red carpet adorned the stone floor, slightly faded from years of walking on it. In the middle of the room was a large desk, her father sitting behind it. He pointed at the seat in front of him. <br>\r\n\"Please, take a seat\".<br>\r\nZelda sat in front of her father. Her breasts sat atop her large belly, which sat in between her fat thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda, I have called you here to discuss your power,\" King Rhoam started to say, which prompted a sigh from Zelda. <br>\r\n\"Father, I know you worry that the sealing power hasn't awoken, but I assure you, I am doing everything I can to awaken it!\" She said. \"Before visiting Zora's Domain, I spent a couple of days praying at the Spring of Power in Akkala. Before that, I visited the Spring of Courage in Faron, where I did the same\".<br>\r\n\"Then why hasn't your power awoken yet?\" King Rhoam asked quietly. <br>\r\n\"I... don't know. But I am doing everything in my power to-\"<br>\r\n\"You clearly aren't doing enough!\" He slammed his fist onto the table, cutting Zelda off and causing her to flinch. \"You spend your time playing as a scholar, and not enough training!\"<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n\"No buts, Zelda! You visit the Divine Beasts to research them, not to make sure they are operating at full capacity like I ordered you to!\"<br>\r\nZelda was silent. He was right, she spent more time researching than fixing. <br>\r\n\"From here on, I order you to just fix them. No more research. Once they are fixed, you are to leave immediately. Am I understood?\"<br>\r\nZelda tried to protest, but stopped when he hit the table again. <br>\r\n\"Zelda, am I understood?!\"<br>\r\nShe nodded sadly. <br>\r\n\"Good. Now go. You have a couple of days here in the castle to rest\". As she reached the door, he spoke again. <br>\r\n\"And stop your snacking. I will be watching\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her room, Zelda slammed her fat fist onto her dresser. Her dress lay discarded over the back of  a chair. <br>\r\n\"Snacking?!\" She almost yelled it. \"I do not snack! Yes, I may have put on a few pounds, but nothing too serious!\"<br>\r\nHearing  a knock at her door, she yanked it open. <br>\r\n\"What?!\" She asked angrily, forgetting that she was only wearing a pair of panties. <br>\r\nA guard looked at her naked body nervously. He noticed her huge breasts, which were still wobbling from her opening the door, and her wide hips.<br>\r\n\"What do you want?!\" Zelda barked at the guard, who hesitated. He was rather new at the Castle, and had heard tales of Zelda's anger. <br>\r\n\"I... Ummmm... brought some food?\"<br>\r\nZelda grabbed the tray from his hands, slamming the door shut in his face. <br>\r\nSitting on one of her chairs, Zelda quickly devoured her meal. She didn't even look at it, but her rumbling stomach told her that it clearly wasn't enough. <br>\r\n\"Pitiful portions...\" She complained. \"At least Link makes a lot!\"<br>\r\nAs she stood, she let out a long yawn. It had been a long day, and her bed looked rather comfortable...<br>\r\nThen again, she had had nothing in terms of dinner, and she was starving!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding to just go to bed, Zelda started for her bed. She quickly stopped, remembering the guards stationed near her door. Dinner may have been pitiful, but breakfast...<br>\r\nOpening her door again, she walked out into the corridor, her body jiggling. She spotted the guards, who were standing down the hall. <br>\r\n\"Guards, I'd like to relay a message to the kitchen!\" She ordered, beckoning them closer. One of them stepped forwards, trying ignore the fact that she was wearing no clothes. <br>\r\n\"Tell them that for breakfast, I would like a stack of pancakes, one whole fruitcake and a bowl of fresh fruit. Actually, make it two fruitcakes,\" Zelda said, rubbing her belly. <br>\r\nBewildered by the order, the guard stood still for a second, only moving when Zelda tapped his helmet. <br>\r\n\"Are you even listening? Go!\"<br>\r\nHe ran off, leaving Zelda to return to her room. <br>\r\nCollapsing onto her massive bed, Zelda let out an exhausted groan as she sank into the soft mattress. All around her, her fat billowed out. <br>\r\n\"It's good... to be home...\" She said sleepily, before drifting off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Zelda awoke to a knock at her door. <br>\r\n\"Urgh... Who is it?\" She called out drowsily. <br>\r\n\"Uh... Breakfast?\" A nervous voice answered. <br>\r\nHearing the word breakfast, Zelda sat up, a smile adorning her plump face. She headed to the door, forgetting again that she was practically naked, opening it and revealing the same nervous guard from yesterday. <br>\r\n\"Thank you. And I would like to apologize for yesterday. I didn't mean to slam the door in your face like that,\" she apologised, taking the two trays from the guard. On one sat a stack of pancakes and a fruit cake, and on the other Sat  a bowl of fruit and the second fruit cake. <br>\r\n\"No problem... Uh, enjoy?\" He said anxiously. <br>\r\nZelda smiled at him, before shutting the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at her desk, she pushed her diary to the side and placing the two trays in front of her. She started with the pancakes. Cutting a piece off, she dropped it in her mouth and moaned. It was light and fluffy, and covered in honey, one of her favourite toppings...<br>\r\n\"Mmm... So good!\" She exclaimed. She dug back into the pancakes, stopping occasionally to grab a piece of fruit from the bowl. Finishing the pancakes, she moved onto the first fruitcake, her favourite meal. Looking at it, she could make out apple and durian. Not her favourite combination, but acceptable. <br>\r\nZelda devoured the first cake, stopping only to answer the door. It turned out to be the nervous guard with a pitcher of milk, which Zelda was thankful for. Upon finishing the first cake, she took a giant swig from the pitcher, moaning as she felt the cool liquid run down her throat. <br>\r\nStarting on the second, Zelda saw apples and palm fruit in it. Once again, it wasn't her favourite, but it didn't bother her as she stuffed her face with the fruity treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a burp, Zelda smiled and leaned back on her chair, causing it to let out an audible groan. Her backside was much softer, practically engulfing the chair. Her huge belly forced her meaty thighs apart and sit in between them. It now brushed against her knees. Her breasts were, surprisingly, still rather perky despite their size. They sat heavily on top of her belly, now the size of small Chus. <br>\r\n\"So good! I had forgotten how good the Castle chefs are,\" Zelda said, slowly getting to her feet. She slowly walked to her dress and put it on. <br>\r\n\"Father gave me the day off. If he doesn't want me researching, then perhaps I should head into Castle Town and see if anything has changed\".<br>\r\nLeaving her room, Zelda didn't notice how much slower she was now walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the Entrance Archway, Zelda was stopped by a familiar voice. <br>\r\n\"And just where do you think you are going?\"<br>\r\nTurning, she saw her father looking at her. <br>\r\n\"You gave me the day off. If I am not able to research, then I will simply spend my time in Castle Town. Catch up with some friends,\" Zelda said. <br>\r\nHer father shook his head, much to her dismay. However, she quickly perked up when he spoke next. <br>\r\n\"Not alone, you aren't. Fortunately, your knight passed all his tests with flying colours. He will accompany you and keep an eye on you\".<br>\r\nZelda's couldn't help but smile. A small part of her had worried about Link and his tests. If he had failed, not only would he have been injured, but he would be forced to remain in the Castle until Ganon's return. Zelda would then be accompanied by some random knight, who probably would be followed very order her father gave him. Sure, Link followed some of them, but not all. <br>\r\n\"I can see that his return pleases you. He awaits you at the gate. Be sure that you return before nightfall\".<br>\r\nZelda nodded, starting for the gate. She stopped when her father spoke again. <br>\r\n\"And Zelda? Do be careful. I've had reports of Yiga Clan near the city\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the gate, Zelda spotted a familiar figure clad in blue learning against a wall...<br>\r\n\"Link!\"<br>\r\nHearing his name, Link looked up just in time to be engulfed in a very soft hug. <br>\r\n\"I knew you'd pass! I just knew it!\" <br>\r\nLink tried to nod. However, his head had gotten wedged between Zelda's Chu sized breasts, which made movement a little more difficult. <br>\r\n\"So, we're going into Castle Town. I'd like to see some friends, and maybe visit a couple of shops...\" She released Link, who backed up a couple of steps. His face was bright red, which Zelda didn't notice. <br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" <br>\r\nNot even waiting for an answer, Zelda strode into town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked up to the fountain, she could hear whispering over the bustle of Castle Town. <br>\r\n\"Is that Princess Zelda?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's a bit bigger that the last time I saw her...\"<br>\r\n\"A bit?! She's a whole lot bigger!\"<br>\r\nIgnoring them, she paused in front of the fountain and sat down. The trio down the hill had finally caught up with her...<br>\r\n\"Where should... I go first....\" She panted, looking around. From her seat, she could see the farmland in the west. A ginger haired girl tending to a brown horse with a white mane, which was pulling an wagon, was visible for a moment, before they disappeared behind a large crowd. <br>\r\nShe could also make out the residential area to the east. A number of her friends from childhood lived there, not to mention Ricardo...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking back to the west, the ginger haired girl reappeared. She briefly locked eyes with Zelda, who smiled. The girl waved at her, before she disappeared behind another massive crowd. <br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I think I'd like to visit the farms. I've heard that the crops they grow over there are very good for you!\" Zelda said to Link, who said nothing. It was true that they were good for you, but like most food that was grown or made in Castle Town, it did affect your body quite a bit. By this point, Link had almost given up on the obese Princess. It was clear to him that she wouldn't lose weight anytime soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Zelda brushed some dust of her dress before slowly heading over to the girl she saw before. Reaching the massive crowd, she tried to gently push her way through, but her girth had other ideas. Her wide hips collided with other people, pushing them aside. Cranking her neck, Zelda didn't see the small child in front of her and walked into him, her belly knocking him to the ground. <br>\r\n\"Hey! Watch where you...\" He started to protest, but upon seeing that it was Princess Zelda, he quickly stopped, his eyes filling with admiration. He loved Zelda, she was so beautiful in his eyes!<br>\r\nLooking down, Zelda looked past her protruding belly and saw the small kid sitting on the ground. <br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry!\" She quickly apologised, leaning down and offering her hand to him. He took it, smiling at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you, your Highness!\" He said, dusting himself off. Looking at Zelda, he couldn't believe his eyes. She was huge! Her dress did its job of hiding her huge body, much to the boys dismay. <br>\r\n\"It was my fault. I wasn't looking where I was going,\" she said, returning the boys smile. <br>\r\nHe didn't reply, still in awe of her body. He idolized Zelda, and the fact that she was much bigger only strengthened his love. <br>\r\n\"M-May I ask for a... a h-hug?\" He asked nervously, looking at Zelda's round face. <br>\r\nHis question stunned her for a second. She recovered quickly, leaning down and embracing the small child. <br>\r\nThe child grinned, one arm sinking into Zelda's belly and the other gripping one of her huge ass cheeks. Behind her stood Link, a mix of amusement and disapproval on his face. Still smiling, the child squeezed her backside, which incited a quiet moan from Zelda. It also caused her to move away from the child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!\" He said happily. Sure, he wanted a longer hug and more time to admire Zelda's fat, but he didn't always get what he wanted. Zelda moved on, trying to gently push through the crowd again, but ended up forcing her way through with her wide body. She eventually reached the front, where she saw the girl from earlier selling bottles of milk, a wide smile on her face. <br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" She said, bowing. \"Please, come again!\"<br>\r\nZelda observed for a minute, until the girl held up a sign stating that she was sold out. The crowd let out a collective groan, slowly dispersing until only Zelda and Link remained. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, we've all sold...\" The girl said, placing the sign back on the wagon. Turning, she let out a gasp. <br>\r\n\"Princess Zelda?! I didn't expect- Sorry, where are my manners? I am Malon from the Ranch outside town. A pleasure to make your acquaintance,\" Malon said, bowing. <br>\r\n\"A pleasure to meet you, Malon. I am disappointed to hear that there is no milk left. I had heard that the milk from your ranch is especially good!\" Zelda said, a look of disappointment on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon looked at Zelda for a second, studying her face. <br>\r\n\"Well, I've sold the milk I brought, but there is some back at the ranch. If you would like, you are welcome to come back with me and Epona!\" Malon offered. <br>\r\nZelda nodded, a smile appearing on her face. <br>\r\n\"I would like that\".<br>\r\n\"Then, all aboard! Just jump on the wagon. I'm sure Epona wouldn't mind a little more... weight\".<br>\r\nAs Zelda headed for the wagon, Link followed. As he passed Malon, she stopped him. <br>\r\n\"You look oddly familiar... Almost like I've seen you before... Well, no point thinking about it! I assume you're the Princess's Knight?\"<br>\r\nLink nodded. <br>\r\n\"Then jump on. Shouldn't take too long to get back!\"<br>\r\nLink headed for the back of the wagon, where he found Zelda struggling to pull her girth up. <br>\r\n\"A little... help, Link?\" She grunted. Link let out a silent sigh. He placed his hands on Zelda's back and pushed. He let out a grunt as he pushed Zelda up. <br>\r\n\"And done! Come on, let's go!\" She said excitedly, planting her backside down and turning her backside into a soft chair. Link sat at the back of the wagon, his legs hanging out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're here! Welcome to the Ranch! It used to be called something else, but it was lost a long time ago,\" Malon explained, pointing to the sign over their head. Zelda could make out the word 'Ranch', but the first two words were faded and scuffed. Even with her advanced reading skills, she couldn't decipher it. <br>\r\nAs the wagon stopped, Link jumped down and headed around to the front to help Malon. Zelda slowly lowered herself down and took a look around. <br>\r\nIn front of her was a track, around which a couple of horses were running. In the centre was a pen, where some more horses trotted around. Next to her was a massive barn, where she could hear a number of cows. <br>\r\n\"Ingo! Where are you?\" Malon shouted, leaving Epona to Link. <br>\r\n\"Right here, Malon,\" a voice answered from within the barn. A tall guy appeared. He was wearing a green shirt underneath a pair of overalls, and had a thick moustache. \"What do you need?\"<br>\r\n\"Can you grab a couple of bottles of milk? We have visitors,\" Malon asked, gesturing to Zelda, who tried to bow. Her belly prevented her from doing so, splitting into rolls underneath her dress. <br>\r\n\"Oh, Princess Zelda! A pleasure!\" Ingo bowed, before turning back to Malon. \"Normal, or...\"<br>\r\n\"Normal! That milk is not for drinking!\" She sighed. The way in which she said it told Zelda that she was tired of saying it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngo headed back into the barn, returning with two bottles of milk. He handed one to Zelda, who thanked him. <br>\r\n\"Enjoy!\" He said, trying not to grin. <br>\r\nTaking a sip, Zelda let out a sigh of approval as...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The milk was cold, cooling her throat as it entered her stomach. <br>\r\n\"This is excellent, Malon!\" She complimented, causing Malon to blush. <br>\r\n\"Well, it's really thanks to the cows that it tastes good... But I'll be sure to pass your thanks on to them!\" Malon replied happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda downed the bottle, letting out a sigh. The milk was thick and creamy, sitting heavily in her stomach...<br>\r\n\"Ohhh....\" Zelda groaned, one hand drifting down to her round belly. It gurgled loudly, causing a look of concern to appear on Malon's face. <br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" She asked, placing a hand on Zelda's shoulder. <br>\r\n\"I... I...\" Zelda stuttered. Her hand was now massaging her belly, sending waves across its surface. \"Excuse me!\"<br>\r\nZelda pushed past Malon and Ingo and sprinted into the barn. Well, tried to. Unused to rapid movement, her thighs crashed against one another, causing her to trip. She hit the ground with a crash, causing every part of her body to jiggle madly. Lying on her large belly, Zelda let out a groan as a loud burp escaped her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess!\" Malon gasped, running to aid Zelda. She grabbed one of Zelda's thick arms and gestured for Ingo to grab the other. Together, they lifted the hefty Princess to her feet, where she wobbled unsteadily. Another burp escaped her mouth, causing her face to turn a bright red. <br>\r\n\"I'm -URRP- so sorry...\" Zelda said to Malon, who was staring wide eyed at her. \"Please... Excuse me...\"<br>\r\nZelda slowly walked into the barn, sliding the door shut behind her. As soon as it shut, Link reappeared. Noticing the lack of Zelda, he looked at Malon, who pointed nervously at the barn. <br>\r\n\"She's in there... I think it best to leave her alone...\" She told Link, who nodded slowly, understanding the situation. Malon then turned on Ingo, a look of anger on her face. <br>\r\n\"What did you do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the barn, Zelda sat next to a cow, who mooed at her. Ignoring it, she rubbed her large belly, which was still gurgling. <br>\r\n\"What's -URRP- wrong with -URRP- me?\" She asked herself through her burps. Feeling her stomach rumble, Zelda's face scrunched up. She really didn't want to be sick...<br>\r\n\"I need something... to drink...\" She whispered to herself. Looking around, she spotted a couple of bottles of milk. Strangely, they weren't labelled, which didn't bother her. Grabbing one, she sipped away at the milk, giving a small smile as her belly stopped gurgling. However, she could feel the milk sitting in her stomach, making her feel even more bloated and sluggish...<br>\r\nHer belly pushed forwards as she took another sip. Her dress, enchanted to fit Zelda's form no matter her size, grew along with it. Her breasts plumped up slightly, followed by her backside, which makes her underwear even tighter. <br>\r\n\"Ahh... That helps!\" Zelda said, downing the bottle. Her belly surged outwards, lifting the hem of her dress. Her breasts plumped up, filling with fat. Her backside pushed the back of her dress away. Her panties finally snapped, falling to the ground and leaving Zelda completely naked underneath her dress. <br>\r\n\"Perhaps more will help my stomach?\" Zelda wondered, lifting a second bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gave her bad milk?!\" Malon shouted angrily, causing Ingo to flinch. <br>\r\n\"Well, it was sitting in the delivery batch, so I thought it was good...\" Ingo tried to say, but Malon cut him off. <br>\r\n\"I delivered today's milk! That was the batch I was going to throw out!\"<br>\r\nIngo shifted nervously. <br>\r\n\"Oh...\" He said, causing Malon to stamp her foot. <br>\r\n\"I swear to Din, if she walks away and tells the King about this, we are out of business! I will hold you responsible!\" She turned to Link, who had been watching their argument with interest. It actually reminded him of Zelda, the way Malon argued...<br>\r\n\"Link, was it? Please, do not mention this to the King!\" She pleaded, her eyes full of worry. \"I swear, I'll punish Ingo! I'll give you free milk for life...\"<br>\r\nLink dismissed her worries with a wave of his hand, shaking his head as he did. <br>\r\n\"You... won't?\" Malon guessed, to which he nodded. \"Thank you so much! I'll make it up to you, I promise! Ummm... do you have a horse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Zelda, she had just finished the last bottle, letting out another burp as she did.<br>\r\n\"URRRP! I feel... refreshed!\" She said, jumping to her feet and causing her breasts to bounce. \"I need to apologise to Malon for my manners!\"<br>\r\nSlowly walking towards the door, Zelda didn't realise what she had just drunk. The milk was from a new batch of cows, ones that fed on a special feed that Malon and Ingo had created. It was designed to make their milk thicker and creamier than other kinds of milk, however it hadn't been perfected, and left the milk rather fattening. Having drunk three bottles, Zelda was considerably heavier now. Her breasts now resembled medium-sized Chus, and lay atop her boulder sized belly. Each ass cheek resembled an Octorock head. Below them were her tree trunk thighs. A fifth chin was in the process of forming on her fat face. <br>\r\nLeaving the barn, Zelda was surprised to find  that nobody was there. She had heard voices while she was drinking, but after the second bottle, they had moved away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this one- No, Epona! This one was raised to be- Epona, stop it! As I was- Epona, move away!\" Malon said to a brown horse, who kept sidling up to Link. The first time she did it, Link gave her an Apple. But now, it was beginning to annoy Malon. <br>\r\n\"Please excuse Epona,\" she sighed. \"Normally, she doesn't like strangers. She's taken a real liking to you, for some reason\".<br>\r\nLink pet Epona's muzzle, smiling as she whinnied. She turned sideways, which caused Malon to gasp. <br>\r\n\"She wants you to ride her!\" She said, surprise in her voice. \"This has never happened before!\"<br>\r\nLink wasn't really listening. He grabbed Epona's mane and pulled himself up. Sitting on her back, he remembered a story his father had told him. A story about a legendary hero who battled something called 'The Twilight'. That hero had a horse called Epona, and this one he was riding sounded a lot like the Horse of Legend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nice horse. It really suits you!\"<br>\r\nLink turned, spotting Zelda leaning heavily on the fence. Malon let out a gasp and ran up to her. <br>\r\n\"Princess Zelda! I am so, so sorry about that! I promise, Ingo will be...\" Malon tried to apologise, but Zelda cut her off with a shake of her head. <br>\r\n\"Please, don't worry! Mistakes are easy to make, and I'm sure it was just that. The milk was, truly, very delicious. Especially the bottles in the barn... Oh, I hope it was alright for me to drink them?\" Zelda asked, realising that Malon may have needed them for something. <br>\r\n\"Bottles in the... Oh, no,\" Malon whispered quietly, hoping Zelda didn't hear her. \"Umm... Yeah, completely alright to drink! No problem at all! I can just milk more, you know?\"<br>\r\nShe gave a nervous laugh before looking away. Zelda didn't seem bigger, but she was wearing that dress that hid her body...<br>\r\n\"I was wondering, would you mind helping us back to town?\" Zelda asked. She really didn't want to walk all that distance in her dress heels, which, surprisingly, supported her girth. \"It's quite difficult to walk in these shoes\".<br>\r\nMalon nodded, still anxious about the milk. <br>\r\n\"Town..? Yeah, l-let me get the wagon ready. Shouldn't take too long... Umm, Link? I need Epona for the wagon. The other horses hate it, and refuse to go near it\".<br>\r\nLink dismounted Epona, which caused her to rear up on her hind legs in protest. She quickly calmed down when Malon hummed a quiet tune. <br>\r\n\"B-be ready in a second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they pulled into Central Square, Zelda jumped down from the wagon, landing heavily on the stone ground. The bustle of Castle Town was still quite strong, however people avoided the wagon and Zelda. <br>\r\n\"Thank you for today, Malon. It was truly very delicious milk!\" Zelda said to Malon, who nodded. Zelda didn't see the worry in her eyes as she responded. <br>\r\n\"No problem, Your Highness... Hopefully, we can do this again...\" Malon said before turning to Link. \"Epona took a real liking to you today. If you ever need her help, just play that song I used earlier. No matter where you are in Hyrule, she will find you. Now, I must return to the Ranch and prepare tomorrows deliveries... Goodbye!\"<br>\r\nZelda waved at the wagon until it passed through the gates and disappeared out of her sight. <br>\r\n\"That certainly was an adventure!\" She said to Link, who nodded. \"We still have quite a bit of daylight left... Perhaps I could visit my friends in town?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not even waiting for an answer from Link, Zelda strode off towards eastern Castle Town. Growing up, she had discovered a couple of long forgotten passages that led out of the Castle. When she was younger, she would use these to escape. During one of these escapes, she had encountered a couple of children around her age, who she instantly bonded with. Even now, they were very close friends, and Zelda always made a point of visiting them whenever she was in Castle Town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wandering through the narrow backstreets, Zelda found what she was looking for. A small set of stairs that led to a heavy wooden door. Without knocking, Zelda pushed open the door, grunting as she did. Once opened, she heard  a number of yells. <br>\r\n\"Look, it's Zelda!\"<br>\r\n\"No way! She's actually here!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, certainly took you long enough to visit us again!\" The bartender said, winking at her. She was a rather big woman, a little smaller than Zelda. A white cat leapt up on the counter next to her and purred. <br>\r\n\"Sorry, Louise... I've been busy,\" Zelda said, giving an apologetic smile. Louise laughed, her second chin wobbling. <br>\r\n\"Oh, don't you worry! Just glad to see you again, that's all... Oh, and who's this?\" Louise asked, seeing Link enter the bar. <br>\r\n\"This is Link, the knight appointed to protect me,\" Zelda said, pointing at him. He raised a hand in greeting. <br>\r\n\"Doesn't say much, does he?\" Louise joked. \"Well, I won't keep you. I'm sure those two can't wait to see you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda headed to a table at the back, where two teenagers were sat. They both looked at Zelda. <br>\r\n\"What took you, Zelda?\" The male one asked, grinning at Zelda. <br>\r\n\"Come on, Colin. Give her leeway, yeah?\" The female one said to him, hitting his elbow. <br>\r\nColin grinned again. <br>\r\n\"Just a bit of fun, Beth. Come, pull up a seat,\" Colin said, kicking a chair out. Zelda sat down on it, ignoring its groans of protest. \"So, how's Hyrule?\"<br>\r\n\"Hyrule is well, Colin,\" Zelda answered. Behind her loitered Link, who caught the attention of Beth, who beckoned Zelda forward.<br>\r\n\"Who's the guy behind you?\" She asked quietly. <br>\r\nTurning around, Zelda saw Link standing there, his arms crossed unhappily. <br>\r\n\"Give me a second, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, she stepped towards Link. <br>\r\n\"I know what you want to say. Let me have some time with them, then I'll get ready for tomorrow, okay?\" Zelda said, laying her hand on Link's shoulder. <br>\r\nLink nodded reluctantly. While she loved being in Castle Town, Link wasn't a big fan of it, preferring to be on the road traveling. He took a seat at the table behind Zelda, where he unsheathed the Master Sword and began polishing its blade. <br>\r\nSitting back down, Colin leaned forwards. <br>\r\n\"Is that the Master Sword he has?\" Colin asked, a serious look on his face. Zelda nodded. She knew of Colin's obsession with different swords. On a couple of different occasions, he had asked her to get him different swords from the Castle Armoury, to which she had refused. <br>\r\n\"Yes, it is. And no, you can't have it,\" Zelda said shortly. \"Link has  a much greater need of it than you do\".<br>\r\n\"Man...\" Colin sighed and leaned back, clearly disappointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, guys... Your drinks!\" Louise said, placing three drinks on the table. \"And each has a little... something in it. Hylia knows you probably need it, Zelda!\"<br>\r\n\"How much, Louise?\" Beth asked, pulling her wallet out. <br>\r\n\"First round is on me. Second round is when you pay,\" Louise said, winking again at Zelda. She walked away, stopping to ask Link if he wanted something. <br>\r\nTaking a sip, Zelda tasted something unfamiliar. It made her slightly off-balance, and her head slightly woozy. <br>\r\n\"Hyrule is fine, Colin. All Divine Beasts are currently working, aside from some minor issues. I'm currently travelling around all three to fix those issues,\" Zelda explained, taking another sip of her drink.<br>\r\n\"Cool... So when do we get to see these things?\" Colin asked. <br>\r\n\"We don't. They're for the Champions, idiot!\" Beth said, poking him. <br>\r\n\"Hey, had to try!\"<br>\r\nZelda giggled. Her head felt funny...<br>\r\n\"Hey, you okay?\" Beth asked. \"You're normally all serious and stuff\".<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, completely fine!\" Zelda answered, smiling. She didn't even know why she was smiling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three sat and chatted for a good while. Colin and Beth wanted to know all about Zelda's adventures around Hyrule, which she happily told. Zelda asked about Castle Town, and how things were. Hearing that everything was fine made her smile, however her joy was short-lived...<br>\r\n\"Link! What do you want?\" Zelda asked, giggling. She had felt him tapping her shoulder, and after telling Colin about some Bokoblins that had attacked Link, she turned to face him. <br>\r\nLink shook his head disapprovingly. Not understanding, Zelda made to turn away, but Link grabbed her shoulder and dragged her to a corner... or tried to. Zelda was much too heavy for anyone bar a Goron to be dragging her. <br>\r\n\"Those two get on well, don't you think?\" Beth asked. <br>\r\nColin nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n\"I am completely fine, Link!\" Came Zelda's voice. It sounded funny to Beth and Colin, which made them exchange worried looks. They knew what Louise had put in their drinks, but Zelda clearly didn't. It was a new kind of liquid called 'Alcohol'. When added to a drink, it had all sorts of effects. If you drank too much alcohol, or drank it too quickly like Zelda had, then you ended up 'Drunk', which basically meant that you had a hard time standing up and concentrating in general.<br>\r\nZelda eventually reappeared, her face red. <br>\r\n\"I... need to go. Link reminded me that I have somewhere to be,\" she said slowly, swaying on her feet. She grabbed the chair for support, which caused it to creak. <br>\r\nColin and Beth nodded silently. They watched as Zelda stumbled her way towards the door, her body knocking chairs out of her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zelda reached the Castle, she was practically leaning on Link for support, who was having a tough time supporting her. It also didn't help  that her soft breasts were rubbing against his arm...<br>\r\n\"Hold there!\" A guard shouted down. \"We need to check you for weapons!\"<br>\r\nA second guard appeared from within the building. Upon seeing the slightly drunk Princess, he ran over to her. <br>\r\n\"What happened?\" He asked urgently, helping Link support the hefty Princess. <br>\r\n\"I feel fine!\" Zelda said, giggling. \"Just take me to my room, Link!\"<br>\r\nLink shrugged at the guard. <br>\r\n\"Ah, Alcohol... Best to not let the King see her like this. He'd have your head for it!\" The guard warned, ushering them up the path. <br>\r\nLink continued his struggle, occasionally stopping to catch his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, they reached Zelda's room without her father finding them. Any guards they had run into looked away, suppressing smiles. Link dumped Zelda on her bed, causing the springs to creak. <br>\r\n\"Link, I'm hungry!\" Zelda complained, sitting up and rubbing her belly.<br>\r\nLink shushed her, hoping that the King was on the other side of the Castle. <br>\r\n\"Link!\" She whined, tugging on his tunic. \"I want food!\"<br>\r\nRolling his eyes, Link ignored the childish Princess. Instead, he left the room, intent on finding Zelda some dinner. Zelda, however, had other ideas.<br>\r\nStanding up, she left the room and headed for...</span></div></div>",

She took a fork, and began to dig in. Her body expanding with every bite. When she was done, she adjusted her top to compensate for her enlarged breasts.

She patted her belly, as she walked off to her sleeping quarters, full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCia and Lana watched over the Gate of Souls. They were both in their typical Guardian outfits.

They had no time to argue for the monsters got closer every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the small Hylian Army hit the monsters head on, Cia and Lana rushed through the battlefield fighting and assisting wherever they were needed... Well Cia rushed around, while Lana jogged at a steady pace in order to keep breath. Even at her slow pace, she still was out of breath as she came to a Keep. \"Get ready...to fight...huff.\" Lana put her hands on her knees as she caught her breath. When she looked up, she saw that the Keep was full of Moblins. This is probably their main force she thought. She grabbed her Tome as she got ready to fight. Stepping out of their confusion, the Moblins began to attack Lana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter using her Special Attack and Focus Spirit, which wiped out the Moblins and Keep Boss, she took a deep breath. She hadn't fought in quite a while and was out of shape. As Lana inhaled through her nose, she smelt something. She turned around to find many lightning cooked Moblin Flanks. While Lana had eaten (raw) Moblin Flanks in desperate situations, she usually gave then to the extremely heavy and extremely fat Spirit of the Master Sword, Fi. She had always wondered what Fi did with all the Moblin Flanks. Fi had always told her she needed them to upgrade gear at the Bazaar, before flying off, with a hungry look.<br>\r\nMouth watering, Lana hurriedly collected the cooked Flanks. She put them in her magic pouch, which kept materials warm, clean, cold, or safe, or in her case, cooked. She quickly headed towards another Keep, wanting the battle to be over very soon so she could try her Moblin Flanks.<br>\r\nEventually, with the combined efforts of the Hylian Army and the two Sorceresses, they defeated their Commander and defeated the monsters. Throughout the battle, Lana mainly targeted Moblins, to kill, cook, and collect their flanks. She had gathered a large amount, and more were brought to her as materials they had collected. Hurrying to the Dining Hall, Lana found that in celebration of their victory, the small army was having a feast. Lana's stomach rumbled as she saw the feast laid out through the hall. That morning, she had only had a small 3 person breakfast, and was feeling quite hungry. Lana decided that her Moblin Meal could wait, as she hurried to the celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter filling her plate to the brim, and then some, Lana sat down, determined to have a good meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you... hic ... that Lana could eat that entire table of food over there.\" \"That table? Try 2 tables\" A group of Hylian soldiers sat around a table, discussing whatever came to their minds. They were also completely drunk. \"So how much?\" One of the  soldiers said \"120 rupees\" He replied. The tension at the table rose as the two intoxicated soldiers began to bet. \"140.\" \"160.\" \"200.\" \"5 Lizalfos scales.\" \"3 Gibdo bandages.\" The bets slowly rose as the other soldiers held their breath, waiting to see who would crack first. Eventually, the second soldier, who had had enough of betting, reached into his pouch, and brought out a small bottle of yellow liquid. \"A bottle of Gohma's Acid.\" A gasp of air came from around the table to see if the other soldier would counter it. After a long stare down, the first soldier sighed. \"Deal.\" He stood up as he began to get up, true to his word, to see if Lana could eat 2 whole tables of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana was about halfway through her meal when the soldier came over. She stopped to listen to see what he would say.  \"Hello Mistress Lana.\" Lana nodded \"My friend over there.\" He gestured to his previous table. The second soldier waved. \"Says that you can't eat two tables of food.\" His statement got Lana's attention. He was obviously drunk, and judging by the bottle of Gohma's Acid on their table, they had obviously been betting. She wanted to decline, but her stomach gave a mighty rumble as she glanced at the table full of food. She couldn't eat all that food. Could she? No, she  wouldn't do it. But the food. But she couldn't. But the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana decided she would.</span></div></div>",

The soldier's eyes lit up as he ran back to tell his friends. Lana quickly shoveled down the rest of her meal, as she prepared to eat. \"What have I gotten myself into?\" She muttered to herself, as she swallowed the last remnants of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, a group of men moved the two tables worth of food to her table. Word had traveled quickly around the Dining Hall, as many more (possibly drunk) soldiers gathered around to see if Lana would eat that much food. As the last dish was placed, Lana turned to the two soldiers. \"When do I start eating?\" She asked \"Whenever your ready.\" One of the soldiers replied. Lana, stomach rumbling, began to dig in with much gusto. One dish after another. Much money was lost that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCia walked into the Dining Hall, followed by the Hylian Captains. They had previously been in a meeting to see who organized the attack, their plans and strategies, and to see who stole all the Moblin Flanks. When they walked in, they saw large crowd gathering around something. As they got closer, Cia heard they were chanting and cheering something on. \"One more dish!\" \"She's gonna explode.\" \"My money!\" \"How did she eat another table of food?\" \"One more dish!\" Pushing forward through the crowd, Cia and the Captains emerged to the front to see Lana gorging herself on anything her arms could grab. Cia watched as Lana, now with a belly the size of a small Goron, ate away. She noticed many tall stacks of plates next to her. Cia was about to intervene, when the crowd starting cheering. Lana was about the eat her final plate. She had already eaten the food from all the tables of the feast, and looked quite tired. Lana finished off the majority of her final dish, a bowl of soup, and was now eating the final spoonful. The crowd started cheering again. Lana swallowed the last spoonful of soup as the soldiers started cheering<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCia decided that now was a good time to step in and stop Lana. \"Alright, alrigh-\" She was interrupted Lana raised a hand for silence. The deafening crowd quickly quieted down to see what Lana would say. Lana plucked her pouch off of her broken belt, as she reached inside. Everyone fell to a hush to see what she would do. Reaching inside, Lana pulled out a Moblin Flank, and began to munch on it. Instantly, the hall was in an uproar. \"She's still eating!?\" \"How is she not full?!\" \"My money!\" \"Does she like this?\" \"That's where the Moblin Flanks went!\" \"How is she eating.\" Even Cia was in shock about how much Lana was eating. She had just eaten an entire feast, and was now eating multiple Moblin Flanks.<br>\r\nAfter eating many Moblin Flanks, and an entire feast, supporting the enormous sorceress was too much for Lana's chair, as under the weight of her, it collapsed. The crowd fell silent as they heard the loud sound of the chair snapping and watching the blubbery sorceress fall the ground. Lana was already asleep before she hit the ground. <br>\r\nCia, coming to her senses again, turned around to the Hylian Captains. \"Get this crowd dispersed.\" The Captains then began to break up the crowd. Cia pointed towards two soldiers who were nearby \"You two, help me carry Lana to her sleeping quarters.\" \"Yes Ma'am.\" They replied in unison. Together, the three of them managed to carry Lana to her sleeping quarters and into her bed which creaked loudly under her new weight. As they left, Cia heard Lana roll over in her sleep and mutter \"So much food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lana woke up in the morning. She found that she had gained</span></div></div>",

Lana had never been an explicitly busty woman, but two breasts the size of melons now took their place, sitting on her belly. Her stomach, which was previously slim, now hung down in front of her porky thighs. Her stomach was full of rolls and jiggled every time she moved. Her ass was now huge, with it being the size of pumpkins. It stuck out and wobbled as she walked. Rather waddled, as her thighs now hugged each other with extraordinary amounts of fat hanging off of her legs.<br>\r\nLana marveled at her new size, before realizing that she had grown out of all her clothes. She gazed at her shelf, which now held a pair of two outfits and a note. Lana read the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I took the liberty of resizing your clothes for you.<br>\r\n-Cia</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana smiled at the gesture of kindness Cia had shown her. Cia had also shown her that her recent weight gain had not gone unnoticed. She grabbed her Guardian outfit and changed into it. Lana's clothes had been resized so they fit her new shape. The tights had seen a major increase in size. Her belly fit snug in the bigger shirt. And her breasts sat in their holders, exposing themselves a little more then Lana would like. However, even with all the changes, Lana felt that the outfit was a little tight. She sighed to herself, as she put the Guardian hat on, and hurried as fast as her thick legs would go, to the Gate of Souls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana's stomach rumbled as she stood watch. She was hungry, but she did not get to eat until later that night. She told herself that she could wait, but her stomach disagreed again. She looked over at Cia, waiting for an opportunity. Eventually, when she was distracted, Lana reached into her pouch, and pulled out another Moblin Flank. Eating hastily to avoid Cia's detection, she finished it off, licking her fingers to hide any evidence of food. Looking over, Lana saw that Cia seemed to be in a prayer of spell of some kind. Another rumble told her that it was safe to have another snack. And another snack.<br>\r\nLana, trying to keep secret, finished off the rest of her leftover flanks. She licked her lips. She didn't know how Fi didn't tell her about how delicious they were. She guessed she did it so there would be more for her. Lana sighed. For a robot, she had loads of personality. She put her hands on her gut as she began to rub it. Cia had been in the trance for a while, and Lana wondered why.<br>\r\nIn truth, Cia was not in a trance, and was mearly pretending to be in a trance. She knew that Lana was self conscious, and would not eat in front of her. But she would also get quite hungry if she didn't eat. Cia wondered when Lana would come to her senses and stop eating. She hoped the day would come soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana waddled to her sleeping quarters. She had eaten a ton of food, and was now beyond full. Her stomach gurgled as she walked. Her ass jiggling from side to side. And her breasts bouncing up and down. She was practically carrying her belly as she got to her room. As she walked in, her thighs got caught momentarily in the door frame, but not long enough so the tired sorceress would notice.<br>\r\nLana came to her bedside, plopping down as it creamed heavily. Lana was too tired to notice, but she did notice the bed snap and collapse under her weight as she tumbled to the ground. She let out a little scream as her gluttonous body hit the floor. \"Can't say that didn't hurt.\" she muttered to herself.<br>\r\nShe gathered up the blankets and pillows to make herself a small bed on the floor. She lied down, more comfortably then she thought. Lana realized that her flesh was acting as a large cushion for her. She smiled to herself. 'Maybe all this weight isn't so bad after all.\" She thought \"Maybe even more would make it even more comfortable.\" She touched her belly and gave it a shake. \"And make me softer.\" Lana giggled as she gave it another shake before falling into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Lana decided she would<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wanted to check something in it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the Dining Hall, Lana loaded her plates with every food she could fit on them. Carrying all seven of them, she headed towards a table to eat. Lana hungrily dug in eating all the food in sight.<br>\r\nLana heard strings snap on her skirt as she ate, no doubt a result of her excessive binge. \"Aw, I just had this refitted.\" She took a second to readjust her skirt and shirt, which was also tight, before resuming eating.<br>\r\nLana set down her 7th plate. She had just finished off the last piece of food. She had reached to pat her belly,  when it rumbled. \"Guess I'm still hungry!\" She giggled. Picking up her plate, Lana headed off to acquire more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana sighed as she tried to move her belly. Rock hard, it was so big she had to fit it under the table. However, it had gotten even bigger to the point where it was stuck underneath the table and seat. \"I guess now's a good time as always to check for that spell.\" She sat back down, opening her Tome. While she searched, she ate a small snack which would have been considered a 3 day meal to her slim self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana tried again to remove her belly from underneath the table. It had shrunken just a bit with the food digesting. She took a sigh of relief. \"Now that that's over. Time to cast the spell.\" She pulled out her Tome.

As soon as she did, more flesh rolled out, presumably trapped by her belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that feels better.\" She said patting her enlarged gut. Lana then realized that she was completely nude. \"Uh oh.\" She heard soldiers about to enter the Dining Hall. \"Better get out of here!\" Lana bent over, sticking her rear in the air, and pulled out her Ocarina. She played a short tune, before warping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarping to her sleeping quarters, Lana wiped her forehead which glistened with sweat. \"That was close.

She giggled \"I guess the spell wasn't only weight gain, it made me hungry again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana then used a spell to create a bunch of food in her room. 'Huh, why haven't I used this before?'

Her stomach reached out 3 meters in front of her. Each of her buttocks was as heavy as a Moblin. And her breasts were now twice the size of her head. Feeling tired, Lana decided to go to sleep. \"I'll figure this out...out.....tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana awoke the next day to find herself the same size. \"Yes! It wasn't a dream.\" she cheered.

I'll find a spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana flipped through her spell book as she tried to find a spell that would help her move. Eventually, after much time and many snacks, she found a spell. \"Alright, looks like it's called Farore's Wind. Let's try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana cast Farore's Wind over herself. It shimmered over her in sparkling green light. 'Let's see if this works' she thought. She moved her giant thighs to a crouching position. Her then lifted herself off the ground onto her legs. \"This is so cool! I feel so light now!\" Lana decided to throw a small feast in her accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her feast, Lana was greeting by the Royal tailors who had been assigned the duty of making the sorceress' clothes.

She had just eaten the entire feast down to the bone. \"That sure felt good.\" she said. Lana looked to see if her clothes had been torn off yet. However, when she looked, she saw that they had expanded to fit her. \"I guess these clothes will fit me no matter what...

Lana turned back to Cia. \"I guess I'll see you later.\" She headed down to hug Cia. Cia didn't have any time to say anything and was crushed by the sorceress. It reminded her of a time where a Moblin fell on her. She looked up just in time to see Lana head through the gate. \"Maybe now we'll be able to stop rationing out our food supplies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana stepped out of the portal into Skyloft. Skyloft was a peaceful town in the skys sent up by the goddess Hylia. \"I'm finally in Skyloft.\" she said to herself. \"Now I'll I need to do is find Fi.\" She began to walk around the town, hoping to find some kind of clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink jumped off his Crimson Loftwing into the town of Skyloft. He needed to gather supplies for his next trip into the Eldin region to gather the second piece of the Song of the Hero. Plus, he knew Fi would start to become increasingly annoying and sarcastic if she was hungry. It was not an experience he would like to have again.<br>\r\nHe landed face flat on the ground, and picked himself up. He was so used for Fi to pull out his Sailcloth for him, but as of late she had stopped. Link began to walk towards to Bazaar, but was interrupted by Fi. She began to take form in front of Link, who had taken a few steps back to avoid being hit by her stomach. \"Master Link. I have noticed we have landed in Skyloft, and not the Lumpy Pumpkin.\" Link sighed. One day, he had awoken to a much sassier and sarcastic Fi, and he still didn't know why. It still bothered him what happened to make her much sassier. However Link noted that it made Fi seem less robotic and more, human. Link began to explain why he has chosen to go to Skyloft first. \"Yes Master\" she responded \"But afterwards I recommend we head to the Lumpy Pumpkin.\" She headed back into the Master Sword. Link sighed again. He would never have the last word with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Link began to head around town finishing up sidequests, he spotted Lana waddling around Skyloft. He had never seen anyone, except for Fi, that big before. Link guessed that she was some kind of new monster. No one could be that size, except of course, Fi. He started to approach quietly toward s the sorceress, weary of danger.<br>\r\nHe was about to speak up, when Fi came out of the Master Sword. Link could have easily strangled Fi in those moments. The noise alerted Lana as she turned around. Lana began to smile as she saw Fi. \"Hello Fi!\" She exclaimed. \"Greetings Lana.\" Link put on a puzzled look on his face. Apparently Fi knew \"Lana\" and vice versa. \"Lana, may I ask what you are doing here?\" Fi asked. Lana began to explain her plan to the spirit. After she was finished, Fi fell silent as she processed everything. Meanwhile Link was still very confused. \"So you wish to gain as much weight as possible?\" Fi asked. \"Yes!\" Lana replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't we begin by-</span></div></div>",

Link sighed. It was hard enough having an extremely sassy and extremely fat sword. Link guessed 'Lana' would only add on to the property damage Fi created. He then followed after Lana and Fi, not knowing what kind of things they would get into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after much time, effort, 4 Eldin Ladybugs, 7 Gratitude Crystals, 1 trip to the hospital, 17 lifelong bans from Beedle's Airshop, and a headache, they arrived at Pumpkin Landing.<br>\r\n\"Let us head inside.\" Fi said as she attempted to go through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she flew through the door, Fi's large hips and thighs became stuck on the door frame, preventing her from heading inside. \"I-i will not be able to fit through the door in my current size.

Link soon followed after then Lana, entering the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumm watched Fi, Lana, and Link walk through. Although Link and Fi were regular customers, he had never seen the blue haired woman before.

Pumm then turned to Lana. \"Might I ask who this lovely lady is?\" \"My name is Lana. Nice to meet you.\" She then shook his arm over the counter. \"Well now what can I get y'all today.\" He asked.

Lana looked at the bowl of Chu Jelly Soup. It was smaller then she would have liked. She didn't know why Fi would only order one of the soups, with her size, Lana would have guessed she would've order many more. Not wanting to be rude, Lana picked up a spoon, and took a sip of the soup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, Lana gained a little bit of weight. Lana's eyes widened as she realized that the Chu Jelly must be extremely fattening, causing her to gain weight while she ate. Lana shoveled spoonful after spoonful into her mouth, before picking up the bowl and drinking straight from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana sat on the stool marveling at the weight she had put on. She had gained almost 100 pounds from the soup, putting her at a hefty 2200 pounds. \"I detect a %4.7619 increase in your weight Lana.\" Lana turned around to face her. Fi had put on much more weight then she had. Lana estimated that she now weighed around 3000 pounds. Give or take a few hundred. \"Fi, how'd you get so much bigger. Fi gave a slight smile. \"I do not process food the same way you do. My body has no need for food, so any food is converted into fat.\"<br>\r\nLana looked at Fi. She guessed that soup had put a humongous 300 pounds her. Fi's breasts were now the size of the pumpkins they grew outside.

He stood up in his Loftwing's harness, as he jumped off and began to skydive. Lana followed after him.

Lana smiled again. \"Great! Let's get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out was no hard task. The two ladies began to throw weight around by attempting to bring down a section of the wall with their fat. The prison was fairly sloppy and rushed, and the walls were not secure.<br>\r\nOnce they had knocked down the wall and freed themselves, the duo began to head for a nearby watch tower.<br>\r\nThey stopped just outside of the tower's range. The two then began to come up with a plan to bring down the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a 99% chance this tower will collapse before we get to the top.\" Lana huffed and puffed as the two climbed the tower. Already, Lana heard the tower creaking and cracking.<br>\r\n\"Let's keep pushing for that 1% chance then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana heard it before she saw it.<br>\r\nShe heard a sharp cracking noise, and barely had time to look up to see Fi's rear towards her. Her face was buried in her ass as the two fell from the tower, inadvertently causing it to collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana's eyes snapped open. She was trapped under Fi's body which had landed on top of her. Fi quickly rose, freeing Lana. \"I-i-i am very sorry I happened to land on top of you when I fell.\" \"No, it's okay Fi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana looked at the watch tower's rubble. She saw</span></div></div>",

She had not had any food since the Chu Jelly Soup at the Lumpy Pumpkin.<br>\r\n\"I mean, if we're gonna be throwing our weight around, why don't we stop for a snack?\" She then waddled over to the pile of food. \"I detect that your plan will result in a 100% chance of success.\" Fi then hovered over, and began to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana laid down on the rocky floor. She rubbed her belly as it moaned. She experienced a feeling she had not had in a long time. She was full. \"I haven't...urp...eaten that much in a while. She then looked up at Fi. She was eating the last bits of food that she could find. After a while, Fi collapsed on the ground, sending a huge shake throughout the ground.<br>\r\nEventually, Lana, with much effort, got up and walked over to Fi. The sword spirit was in a deep sleep. Her folds in her belly jiggled as the enormous sword moved in her sleep.<br>\r\nSleep was feeling like a good option for Lana. She then turned around to examine the area for a good place to sleep, when it hit her. She had the world's biggest and softest pillow right behind her.<br>\r\nLana turned back around to Fi. She guessed Fi wouldn't mind if she used her as a pillow. Lana looked at Fi again. Fi had again, grown exponentially. At her size, Lana guessed she could use Fi's belly as a bed.<br>\r\nShe eventually collapsed on Fi's belly. As she landed, a shockwave flew throughout her body. Lana's body sunk into Fi's belly. Lana giggled as she laid in her flesh. \"Man this is comfortable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of playing on her belly, Lana fell asleep, into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Lana woke up before Fi did, and had time to slide off her belly. The two then headed off to find Lana's Tome and Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana breathed heavily as she walked. Every second it got harder to move her humongous legs. She could feel Farore's Wind wearing off. \"We should...probably...find my...Tome first.\" She told Fi.<br>\r\nThe duo eventually came to another Bokoblin camp. The two then sat in silence as they observed the camp. \"Look!\" Lana cried out. She could see a Bokoblin placed her Tome in a chest. \"Come on Fi!\" She then waddled off to the camp with Fi following.<br>\r\nLana and Fi began to circle the camp to look for a way in. \"I...think...we'll...just...have...to...fight...our...way...inside.\" Lana weakly said. As she finished her sentence, she collapsed on her rear. The green aura around Lana vanished as she sat. \"Farore's Wind must have worn off.\" She attempted to wiggle her legs. \"I-i can't get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then noticed<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had seen her fight before against these types of enemies before. \"Fi, do you think you can take them?\" Fi nodded. \"I calculate a 0% chance of loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFi then, rushed off to meet the enemies head on.<br>\r\nAs she met them, she opened with a quick spin kick from her meaty leg. Her belly also aided, as it hit some Bokoblins along with her leg. She then did another spin kick, however she also lifted her other leg in the air, hitting monsters behind her. As she did this, her ass also hit the monsters behind them.<br>\r\nFi then leaped in front of her, crushing Bokoblins as she landed. She then did a vertical spin kick, hitting enemies with her legs and ass. Then, she followed up with a long spin kick, before slamming into the ground, creating a shockwave and crushing enemies. Fi then quickly turned around to face a Bokoblin. Her belly came a spilt second later, slamming into the monster, quickly killing it.<br>\r\nFi heard a roar, and spotted a Moblin heading towards her. As it got closer, it prepared to jump on Fi, knocking her over to have an opportunity to kill her. Fi then bent down as the Moblin belly flopped onto her. However, at the last second, Fi stood up straight, sending her stomach right into the Moblin. The Moblin was then launched into the air where it spun around. Good, Great, Awesome, Outstanding!<br>\r\nFi quickly flew up into the air after the Moblin. She then bombarded his body in midair with slams and kicks. She then hit the Moblin in full force towards the Bokoblin camp wall, where is corpse broke the wall. Fi then flew a little higher into the air, where gravity took place. She quickly flew to the ground, where she hit the ground with her body with enough force to bring down a nearby watch tower. Even Lana was lurched up a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the smoke cleared, Fi flew into the camp to retrieve Lana's Tome. <i>\"With Fi around, we don't even need my Tome anymore.\"</i> She attempted to get up once more. <i>\"Okay maybe I still need my Tome after all.\"</i><br>\r\nOnce Fi had brought her Tome, and Lana was back on her feet, she decided to treat Fi with some food. She then summoned multiple feasts full of food.<br>\r\n \"Here you go!\" She told Fi. \"What is this feast for?\" \"For you! You did beat those monsters earlier.\" \"N-no, I couldn't.\" Lana giggled as she poked Fi in the belly. \"Really? Because I think that your great big ol' gut of yours says otherwise. Almost to prove Lana's point, Fi's stomach rumbled. \"Well, maybe only a little.\" Fi then began to dig into the feasts.<br>\r\nAs Lana watched, her own stomach rumbled. \"Well I guess I always could summon some more food.\" She said to herself. She then began to eat alongside Fi.</span></div></div>",

And the fact he still needed to find the second dragon. And the fact he eruption had blocked out the sky, preventing him from getting any items from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Link heard a loud rumble coming from the other side of the volcano. He quickly checked to see if it was erupting again. Realizing that the sound came from the other side of the volcano, Link set off to investigate the loud noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-excuse me.\" Lana blushed as she put a plump hand over her mouth. She then quickly began eating again. Fi did notice any of this, as she was too busy eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFi was now larger then any other monster in the land, save for a few. Her breasts were now the size of Bokoblins. Her ass and hips were wider then 2 of Lana, and her thighs were on the point of reaching the ground when she hovered.

Eventually, the rhythm of magma flowing put Link to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning, Link awoke, and looked up skyward. The sky was now clear, sending down, almost unearthly beams of light down. Link quickly broke down his camp, as he waited for Lana to wake so they could get going. And he waited, and waited, and waited, and caught a few Eldin Ladybugs, and waited, until she woke up.<br>\r\nEating a \"light\" breakfast, Lana pulled out her Ocarina.

You okay ranch girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon shook her head violently to bring herself back to reality, causing her soft cheeks to jiggle ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry about that... Din, right? What brings you in search for work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you're familiar with me? So you know I Don't really have a job. I make enough money to scrape by from my performances, but I would rather my dances be free to enjoy. You're currently the only person who's hiring right now, so i would really appreciate the chance in return for a bed and some food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon thought about it. She wondered if the girl could handle it, but she couldn't just say no to her when she was near broke. She didn't even ask for rupees, so if she wasn't much help there wouldn't be much of a loss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon held out her thick hand and shook the rathr petite one of her new employee.</span></div></div>",

Bone app the teeth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cookbook seemed awfully complicated, and what the heck was an oven? Link made a mental note to store the cookbook in the Hyrule Castle kitchens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Link just threw in the ingredients into his cooking pot and Voila! Just like Mama taught him. Maybe even better then Mama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then brought his 'masterpiece' over to Zelda, who had been waiting patiently. If only she had been this patient earlier today, Link thought to himself as he presented his dish to Zelda<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Link\" Zelda said \"But where is yours?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne conversation about Link's apple based diet later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There sure are a lot of things I still don't know about him\" Zelda thought \" She looked over at Link struggling to assemble a tent Impa had given him. \"And I presume many more things I will learn about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was then interrupted out of thought by her stomach rumbling. It did not like the fact she had food and was neglected this long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda took a bite out of the skewer and was instantly blown away. The texture, the combination, the flavor, oh sweet goddesses the flavor. She was awestruck as how Link was able to create such a dish.

He could-----get out of bed was the right option in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink exited his text and saw Zelda sitting there, crossed legged, smiling. \"Good morning Link.\" She said in a cheerful tone.

She was big on schedules, and on picture taking. Picture taking took up a lot of time and Zelda got cranky when they didn't reach an area on schedule. One thing led to another and the thing it led to was , more often then not, Link being yelled at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink narrowed his eyes slightly before starting a new dish. He knew Zelda did not like Simmered Fruit (See Link's Apple diet discussion), so he began work on a new dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought out his cookbook and looked up breakfast dishes. He settled on a strange dish called- 'Pancakes'. A cake was normally not a breakfast dish, but he shrugged it off, the author was more likely culinary trained then him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then brought out the ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Bird Egg<br>\r\n1 Tab-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh whatever we've been through this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink brought his Pan-not so-cakes to Zelda.

Link gave his dish to Zelda, and began to pack up camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought the pancakes up to her mouth and the same feeling the overcame her last night, overcame her. She hastily began to eat and finished off one pancake before she noticed a sauce to the side of her plate. Link later told her it was called Maple Syrup, all Zelda could call it was delicious. Zelda finished off her pancakes in record time after discovering the sweet syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink had, at that moment, finished packing up their small camp. \"Thank y-\" She was then interrupted by a small burp. \"Excuse me, thank you Link.\" Link nodded, then began to pick up their packs, and started walking down the trail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda, not wanting to be left behind, followed Link, taking the lead.

The small child made an annoyed expression, as he put his head in his hands. \"They said I couldn't join the meeting because I was too young.\" He looked at Link \"Why are you here, you have the Master Sword, shouldn't you be allowed in?\" Link, mimicking Sidon, put his head in his hands, as he explained only members of a royal family could join. \"Oh\" Sidon expressed, as he looked around \"Wanna play Stone Sheet Clippers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were about halfway through their 87th game when he Chamber doors opened, and Princess Zelda and Mipha, and King Dorephan walked out. Zelda felt heavier then she had all day. While they were discussing important matters, servants walked by, with platters of food, which they offered to everyone. Zelda, not wanting to be rude, accepted every bit of food that was offered to her, a decision which he regretted. Mipha, noticing Link and Sidon, silently waved to them. Link waved back, while Sidon also waved back, but called out \"Hi sis!\".  Link didn't know Mipha had a brother, especially one who was very good at SSC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then-</span></div></div>",

Link, spotting the Lynel, which was now just a small smudge in the distance, began to run off to Ploymus Mountain. Zelda tried to ask Link what he was doing, but he had already left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is he doing now?\" said a frustrated Zelda, to which Sidon replied \"He's probably going off to fight the Lynel on Ploymus Mountain\", he turned to Zelda \"He's really cool in that way of not hesitating.\" Zelda sighed \"It's not my fault if he goes off and gets himself killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later and the Arrows had stopped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 hours later and Link came back with what Zelda presumed to be Lynel parts. As he walked into the domain, he was greeted with cheers and thanks from the residents of Zora's Domain, who had been attacked by the Lynel for weeks now. \"Well then.\" chuckled King Dorephan, \"I guess this calls for a feast in celebration of the defeat of the Lynel.\"<br>\r\n\"Cool\"  replied Sidon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Zelda and Link joined many people for a feast. Zelda had digested all of her food after taking a nap in her room, while Link had given the Lynel parts to the Zora chefs. He had no use for them and he heard Lynel Gut Soup was delicious. Link also gave them some apples. The duo talked and chatted throughout the night before the food came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the food was brought out, everyone served themselves. Zelda didn't know which one she should try. Their were Seared Steaks, Fish plates, and Simmered Fruit (Zelda knew who was responsible for that). She however, decided to go with an orange soup in the middle of the table. She poured herself a bowl, and drank the soup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was delectable. It was spicy and creamy and thick and well seasoned and many other things she couldn't describe. She quickly drained her bowl and poured herself another bowl. Zelda was about to pour a third bowl when she spotted a strange seasoning in the middle of the table. It had no label, and she had never seen anything like it before. She quickly poured herself a third bowl, and put the seasoning on it. Zelda took a bite and was mesmerized for probably the 100th time in this story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seasoning made the already great soup better. After 6 bowls, Zelda felt like she should stop, she had already eaten a ton of stuff already. Yet she still felt hungry, which was odd. Zelda decided to turn to some of the fish based dishes. She picked out a cooked Hearty Bass, and put the seasoning on the fish. As you probably know, she finished that one off in record time, before moving to another, and another, and another and so on. Zelda just didn't feel full, she just kept feeling hungry, so she ate, and ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she stoped the huge platter with Hearty Basses had run out. And coincidentally, so did the seasoning and her appetite. She looked up the feast hall, it was mostly empty except for a group of older Zora that looked like they had been drinking. Groggy and tired, Zelda went to her room, and lied down on her bed. She dreamt that the seasoning had not run out and she kept eating and eating and eating. However when she woke up, she didn't remember it at all, she looked over and saw-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
