            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka was running as he swung his club as a slosh of snow. Reaching for his back he produced his boomerang. Throwing it he leaped over two snow ropes that went for him. The boomerang hit a hoodie girl that wore fur tank top hoodie with skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding Sokka looked at all the guys that laid facing down in the snow. They were knocked out or just not capable of fighting any longer. In front of him were three last girls that wore hoods covering their faces. They wore similar cloths compared to the last one he took out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boomerang laid in the snow as he only had his club left with a machete safely tucked in his belt. His jaw bone dagger was tucked in his boot, concealed as a ankle wrap. For that 'broken' ankle he got that morning. Fighting with favoring only one leg was bothersome, but he had to keep his ruse up just a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaring he then moved as he grabbed his machete and whipped it out. Moving with his left foot the one that was not 'broken' he went for the attack. Two of the female water benders moved their hands to have the snow become a wall. While the third moved her hands to make a large ball of snow to take out Sokka.<br>\r\nThrowing his machete Sokka saw the wall that turned into ice break as the snow ball came at him. Moving his club he took a swing at the snow ball as he broke it into slosh. He was on the machete as he picked it up and ducked as a snow came from one girl. The snow hit the second girl who tried to snatch Sokka in a snow pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka hit the ground with his club stabilizing it temporarily as he moved up and back armed the snow thrower. The two were down and as the other girl moved the snow to render him of his weapons she smirked. She then said to him arrogantly, \"The fact that you took out six water benders that took out almost all the hunters and warriors was impressive. And with a sprained ankle no less, but you have not weapon. Surrender and I might not make you into a laughing stock.\"<br>\r\nLowering his arms and head in defeat he let the girl approach him. Just as she was in range Sokka went to the ground as she gasped in surprise. Going for his dagger he pulled it out as he flipped it to her neck grabbing her hands with his bandage cloth. She could not move her hands to bend and she had a dagger at her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her, \"I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaps and woots were heard as he grinned backing off. The girl then said to him angry, \"You faked that injury? That seems very little in honor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her, \"Strategy when it comes to benders requires a little of the deceit. Sides, no rules and no kills, alls fair in this battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up was Hakoda as he then said to Sokka, \"Alright, you have proven your worth. Now, your responsibility is to protect the Avatar while the Avatar makes her journey to the four nations trying to complete what Avatar Aang could not. Do you think you could do that Sokka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding Sokka then said as he held up his dagger, \"I swear upon my honor and life that the Avatar will receive full protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over to the hut that a pair of older guards were standing watch over was a figure coming out. It was Katara as she smiled at him and said to Sokka, \"Thank you, Sokka I will be trusting you with my protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowing Sokka then said to her, \"It would be an honor, my avatar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling she then closed her eyes as she said to him, \"Sometimes, I wish you were my brother. You'd fit the role so much better, than body guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then replied to her, \"Sometimes I feel as if with how we've grown up together as best friends that we are like brother and sister. But, those feelings will no longer get in the way of my duty. Now, we must complete what the last avatar could not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pang struck Katara as she no longer saw her best friend that she used to go making snow men with. No, what she saw was a young man that had been her long time best friend now turn into a man. A man with a mission of protecting her, this made her miss the old times. But, everyone has to grow up eventually, perhaps this older Sokka might come with better or more advantageous benefits than the younger one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka went to retire to his hut as he went up to a large ice wall with a half hut in front. Inside was a long cavern tunnel that had a few walls in place. There was a square fire place that had Gran Gran tending to some Arctic Wolverine Foxes cooking on a spindle with some fish on sticks and a tray that had sizzling Otter Penguin steaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka had smelled the air as he licked his lips and heard his stomach growl. He noticed at the second fire pit was a stand that held two different pots. One was sea prune stew and the other was the two fish head soup. Under the pots of stew and soup was a lower spindle that had a small pot almost kettle size with six eggs from an Arctic Hen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dinner for the chief was great, and his son deserved some of that. I mean those Arctic Wolverine Foxes were not easy. He was lucky just to get the three he did and those 10 fish he pulled up all his traps to see if he caught any in the fish cages. Plus he dug himself five noodling holes for when the water raises again in two weeks. The Otter Penguins, yeah that was easy to get, once he chased them for 15 minutes. The stews and eggs however, all of that was Gran Gran working her magic on the market man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the nearest wall he saw that there was a cut out section of the segmented room inside the large cavern house. The cut out was a doorway that had a curtain of Polar Leopard. He pulled the fur to the side as he walked in to see his bed that had a Ox Goat fur on top of a bed made of otter seal skins. He had a large wooden box that he opened placing his bone made club inside. Beside it he laid his machete to rest and put the dagger on the bottom. At the top in a triangular slot he let rest his trusty bommerang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small compartment on the under side of the box's lid. It was roughly the size of holding a pair of small scrolls. Removing the side panel of it he pulled out just that two small scrolls. He closed the curtain as he took the bottom hook and attached it to the floor hoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling he unrolled the scroll to see lined art work in ink that was drawn of skimpy clothed girls. He sighed as he then said to himself, \"Now, ladies help me relax before dinner. I should probably save some of this for tonight. Cause after tonight, I am going to constantly be at Katara's side and will have little to no time for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara walked into the hut as she saw the cooking of the meat and smiled. She then asked Gran Gran, \"Hello, Gran Gran, is Sokka around? I'd like to show my appreciation for his getting meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Gran Gran then said replying to the young girl, \"Sure, he's in his room. Polishing his weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Katara then bowed as she went after saying her thanks. She went up to the snow leopard skin and heard a growl as she stopped her motion of knocking on the ice wall by the skin. She listened as Sokka said in his room, \"Oh, yeah, that's a beautiful sheath. I'd like to stick my sword inside there. I mean she's so slim and beautiful. I don't care if she's fake, she's wearing that tight blue satin decoration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what kind of sheath would be made of satin she pulled on the side of the snow leopard skin. She peered in and said Sokka was indeed polishing his sword. She starred at the seven inch machete in his right hand. He was polishing to the picture of a skimpy girl dressed in a blue tube top. Her lower half had white wraps covering her crotch as she winked with a kissy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was way too thin, well as thin as Katara. But, Katara was jealous so the other girl could not have been real. She was just some slut on a paper in black ink and different colored pastels. Polish escaped his machete as he groaned and said taking his hand over a final stroke to see if he could get any extra polish out of it. Taking a blue cloth he cleaned the extra polish as he then sighed and folded the cloth. Crawling over to the corner he pulled out from his shirt a eel shark tooth on a necklace. He placed the tooth in a crease and pried up a piece of ice. He put the soiled cloth in the small hole and laid the ice back down.<br>\r\nGetting up he returned the machete to his pants as he went to the hoop on the floor. Katara quickly retreated to another room, one with a curtain made of Arctic Wolverine Fox furs. She went inside as she flushed and blushed thinking that the machete was just so big. It was also so beautiful, plus kinda fearing thinking that it couldn't fit into a normal sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGran Gran then said as Hakoda walked into the house, \"Dinner's ready kids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka yawned as he walked out of his room. Joining him from across his room was Katara as she seemed angry. She walked beside him and then moved to be in front of him. She said to him, \"A guard should be behind me at all times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to shake her hips as she wore a new skirt. This one was shorter than her usually long skirt that was a large blue dyed fur. Her current skirt was blue with white tassels on the bottom with the blue ending at her thighs. On the back was a white snow flake crest inside three tidal wave icons of the Water Tribe that were surrounded by a pair of white and black fish chasing tails. She wore under her skirt wool leggings and stockings to keep warm. The skirt swallowed her curves as it outlined her back side just right. And the icon was on the back as if the purpose was to draw attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at a table that was set up by Hakoda the four got ready for the food. Gran Gran passed four bowls of stew or soup as Sokka asked for a little of both, but was given Sea Prune Stew. Hakado smiled as he asked her to surprise him as she gave him Two headed fish soup. Katara had the soup as Gran Gran had the soup. The food was being eaten as Katara had noticed that Sokka noticed her skirt earlier. She could feel the heat off his skin as he got heated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then decided to lift her foot and stretch it across the space from across from her. She felt the pants of Sokka as he nearly spat out his food. And moved her foot on his sash as he hit his chest. She quickly drew her foot back and the entire did not lose concentration on her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda went for his son checking on him as Katara smirked when no one was paying attention. Through out dinner she would place little tricks like flicking her chop stick and water bending with slight of hand the stew to hit his shirt and pants. She gasped and got up as she went to him and padded his pants with a cloth. She could feel his machete as she said sorry to him several times. All the while her cleavage was slightly revealed with her loose top coat. Underneath was a blue tube top with a cleavage line of feathers and a blue sapphire diamond in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Katara went outside as Sokka followed her and then confronted her. Sokka opened up the confrontation with, \"What are you wearing those cloths for? And why were you so clumsy today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing she then turned on him as snow flew from her and became spiky, \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I mean am I looking at other boys? And ones on scrolls no less? I mean, I try to be nicely dressed for you. Trying to take in your feelings about other boys looking at me. And yet, you'll look at a scroll and wink at the girls on the streets? I am not just your best friend Sokka, and I am certainly not your sister. Gran Gran is my grand mother, my mother was abandoned by that low scum that I call a father. She died in child birth and your father a widower thanks to the late winter took me in with Gran Gran insisting she could cook dinners for his son. And what did I get for a child hood? A wonderful best friend and great guardian, but I want more than that. I want to have my first kiss, I want to dance with the boy of my dreams. Not someone who sees the Avatar, someone who sees me. The girl that rides otter penguins, goes and lays fish cage traps, guts blubber head walrus, wrestles with you in the snow and fights you when you want to be on top of your game. You see me as these things which I cherish, but you don't see the woman standing in front of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara began to tear up as she sniffled as she heard his answer, \"Cause, I don't see you that way. I see you like a best friend, a sister and a bit of a mother. When I get hurt, I go to you, not Gran Gran I go to you. When I have a crush on Notai, I talk to you. When I am having trouble with Wolfie I ask you to hand me the dagger so I can remove his ice ticks. You help me with personal issues, ones that would not fit the lover detail of my life. I'm sorry that you see me like that Katara. Maybe you'll find someone like that some day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon was raising to the sky as Katara then looked to the moon. She then had to retire and deal with tomorrow's awkwardness of her confession tomorrow. Hopefully, first stop for them after a four or five day boat ride would be meeting the Earth Kingdom noble daughter Toph. Maybe meeting a representative would distract her mind. But, first she had to deal with five awkward days with Sokka.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka was on a ship as he fished off the side as he held his fishing rod. On his back under the boomerang holder and his club sling was a small cylinder of wood. It was brown with a water tribe icon on its triangular door. At the top of the cylinder was a round top with a small shaft with ring on it. The cylinder was big enough to hold a small bird or animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka reached back as he pulled the pin out til it stopped. The doors opened sliding inside the cylinder showing a white animal. It was an Arctic Wolf Bat as it opened it's wings and went for flight. The arctic wolf bat was small and white with brown at the belly with face. Sokka then said to the flying animal, \"Go out and have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out a small whistle pipe he blew into it pressing his fingers on small holes. The bat listened as it nodded to take flight. The bat flew out catching small insects as it ate them after it heard that the whistle stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little boy walked up with his wolf tail as he smiled. He had blue eyes and brown hair with his tanned skin. He wore a tight blue dyed fur shirt and pants with white collar. Strapped to his back was a bone club as he asked Sokka a question, \"Why is Wolfie so small? I thought Wolf Bats were huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to the young boy, \"Gukki, when I found Wolfie, he was prematurely born and I begged my dad to not kill him. It possibly would have been the best thing for him. He would never survive on his own, he would never get any bigger. But, I told my dad the chief of the tribe that I would raise him. To be a big and strong warrior like my dad. And before I knew it Wolfie grew six times in size. So big that he fetches my boomerang and serves as my right hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked at his right hand as he saw a large scar going from his palm to mid length of his forearm. He then moved his hand into a fist, but a lot slower than should have been okay. He then looked at Wolfie as he heard Wolfie bark and yip after catching himself several bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka felt the line pull as he pulled back. He growled as he yanked up a fish. He dropped the white fish with four tentacles instead of fins into a bucket. He then said as he looked at his collection of two fishes of the same kind, \"Two white tetra tentacle fish, those will make some good steaks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the front of the ship he went up to the guard standing in front of the set of stairs leading to the cargo hold. The guard in front of him was a beautiful girl with shoulder length curly brown hair. She had six hair loopies leading to the back where they collected in a bun that lead to the nice braided tail in the middle of her shoulder length curly hair. Her eyes were steel gray with her lips painted red. She had a healthy c-cup bosom held in her bindings that would be hinted at from her fur tank top. The tank top stopped at her midriff with wrapping going down her waist and above suggesting leading to her bindings. She had fur made arms warmers and had attached long sleeve over her left hand that hid her left hand. Her legs were covered in wool leggings with large fur calf warmers and a blue skirt much like Katara's from the other day with an icon of the front of a wolf's head that was a real wolf's head pelt. She wore a pair of boots that were brown and on her back she had a quiver, with a bow held in a place holder by the quiver of arrows. At her waist was a bone machete with a few animal drawings on it telling a story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to the girl as he sat down gutting the fish, \"Notai, how are you doing today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Notai then said to him, \"Just fine, how are you my captain? Making fish steaks for Lady Katara I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka said as he cut out the steaks with his dagger, \"I'm doing just fine. I'm hoping that Katara is willing to share one of the steaks. While the rest goes to Kyra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai replied to him, \"I'm sure, Lady Katara surly won't ear all of that. She has to watch her womanly figure after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said as he was finished with the steak and pulling off a small pouch from his belt, \"Your push ups were a little slacking this morning. Is your figure getting a little heavy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing with anger she then said to him, \"No, none what so ever. I just sprained my wrist a week ago. It hasn't fully healed why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was pouring a fine mix of spices and minerals on the steaks as he needed the meat. He mixed it well as he then poured a small amount of liquid from a water skin. The liquid smelt like alcohol. Taking a hand full of the liquid Sokka drank some as he licked his lips. He then said outloud, \"Nothing like Seawy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai then replied to him, \"You do realize that's not for drinking right? I mean we only have a little seawy. Fermenting seaweed takes a long time, I should know, my family makes a living doing it. And it's not fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding Sokka then said to her, \"Yeah, I know it's for curing meat. But, it wasn't a swig, it was a small amount in my hand. I can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing her hand Notai then said to him, \"Fine, is the fish ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up with the small wooden tray he had used to hold the spices and fish he presented their smell to Notai. Notai then licked her lower lip as she hummed and said to him, \"I don't know how you do it Sokka, but you are a looker, a cooker and a kick ass warrior. The woman that you finally marry some day, will be the luckiest woman on this planet. Too bad, that you don't hunt like Tukke. Otherwise, I'd take you and bed you like you have never been before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara sat at on her bed in the cargo hold of the ship. On the bed was a large mouse with lynx like features. It was white with blue eyes as it sat with its beard of fur on her lap. The animal was about a foot long and was rather slim. Katara then asked the animal a question, \"Kyra, why doesn't he like me? I mean, I want us to be more than just guard and avatar. Why can't he see me as a woman? Why did my mother die when I was born? He's been the boy that I know I can count on. No matter what unlike my father or mother. Hakoda, Gran Gran and Sokka are all I have. And when everyone around you and only see you as the Avatar. Then you look to the only person that doesn't see you as just that. What do you do when he doesn't accept your feelings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing up to her owner Kyra rested curling up on Katara's lap as she nudged Katara's hand. Katara looked at the ink drawn paper on the small dresser. It was an ink drawing of her and Sokka smiling, holding hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Katara's door was Sokka as he had a plate of fish steaks. He looked down and then back up after what he just heard. He then said to himself, \"She's been the best friend I'd ever had. We'd wrestle in the snow together. Track blubber head seals and fight to make sure I could be there for her at all times. Yet, when Notai kissed Tukke, it hurt me a lot. So much that she went and fought for my honor so that Notai would apologize to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashes of memory appeared in his head as a younger Katara fought Notai. Notai moved with her machete as she went for Katara. Katara looked up with white eyes as she said to Notai, \"You will apologize to Sokka. All he has in his heart is love and in a time of constant tension with conflict. Death to a few friends of ours, and his innocence taken from him. And you turn him down? Any girl would be lucky to have his eyes look at them with love. But, no a witch like you turns a hand to his face. And I'll turn one to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka remembered running in front of the blast of ice. He took it to his palm as he groaned and felt the ice go down his right arm. He nearly screamed as he felt the warmth leave his arm. Gasps and shock came from everyone as Katara returned to normal in fear repeating a simple sentence, \"What have I done?\"</span></div></div>",

Katara then said behind the door, \"Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then replied to Katara, \"Sokka, I have some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara then said to him some what angrily, \"I don't want any, I told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka sighed as he said worried, \"You haven't eaten in two days. You don't want to get sick. I don't want you to get sick. I like having you around, to... eat with. It's lonely.\" Sokka almost mumbled the last part as he scratched the back of his head with a slight blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara was looking through the small peer hole as she saw his slightly flushed face. He was thinking about her, embarrassingly. She had to work fast, as she told him just to wait a minute. She went to her small dresser and pulled out the outfit from the other night. She pulled off her light robes and put on her outfit. She pushed up her d-cup breasts trying to show them off. She double and triple checked her hair. She pulled out a small reflective stone as she pulled out a container with purple face paint. She placed some on her eye lids and put a little on her lips. She then checked her looks as she then smiled and made a test wink with kiss. She looked hot, so she then ran a hand over the wrinkles in her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door she water bended some water to her hand to get rid of the extra paint. She then smiled as she said with a slight alluring pitch, \"Come in, Sokka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in Sokka went to sit down and eat with Katara. He immediately took in her looks as he went to sit down with her. He presented her with the fish as she smiled and said to him, \"Oh, my fish steaks with Sokka's secret spices. I still don't know what spices you buy from the merchant to make these so good. And Gran Gran still can't duplicate it, care to share the secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said as he tried to impress her, \"Only hint less you pry my tongue is that it's bag of rich blubber and 5 Polar Bear Dog coins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShock came to Katara as she asked, \"Polar Bear Dog coins? That's like really expensive. I mean to just kill a Polar Bear Dog so you can make coins out of it's ribs is dangerous. Making their value some of the highest on the water tribe. When did you get them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning nervously he replied, \"Gukki's dad carved them for me at a 10 percent cut of my first hunt. On my first hunt, I killed that Polar Bear Dog and dad mounted it next to his first kill that was next to the long line of first kills. I took it's ribs and gave them to the best coin maker in town, Gukki's dad. And I got about 200 coins out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara was shocked as she said to him, \"That's worth like 4 Earth kingdom gold per coin. Sokka, that's like rich, no wonder you never run out of your secret spices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning and rubbing his finger nails against his chest he said confident, \"Yeah, I kinda am. Anyways, let's eat this tetra tentacle fish before it gets bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Katara then took out a pair of chop sticks. She began to eat some of the meat that was precut. She hummed as she savored the taste of salt, garlic, nut and pepper. And that was just four of the flavors of probably a couple of dozen more. Sokka took a bite as he chewed on it as he then swallowed. He pulled out a small bag as he placed it on the ground open. Kyra went to it eating the parts the humans weren't eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara then noticed a piece on Sokka's face as she moved in with her chop sticks. She moved the piece from his cheek and ate it, licking the sticking on purpose. Sokka flushed as he gulped and stammered a bit. Smiling she dropped one of her sticks on purpose at her cleavage. She then gasped as she said trying to pull it out, \"Oh, how clumsy of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka had some blood come out his nose as he felt slightly faint. Then as Katara noticed his reaction she whispered lustfully, \"Sokka, do you perhaps want to k-i-s-s?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping he then moved in shakily as he was about to kiss her. Katara's heart was pounding like a polar bear dog running on the snow. She felt faint as she let her lips almost touch his. Then, boom! The ship rocked and shook as Katara fell back tumbling. Sokka whirled into the air as )he hit the floor with a thud. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katara soon got up as she then looked at Sokka and saw he was knocked out. She growled as she said angrily, \u201cWhoever fucked up my chance to get Sokka is going to regret pissing me off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara exited the cargo bay as she saw Notai swing her clothed hand. Produced from her sleeve was a hidden wrist blade as she went for a strike. It was a Kyoshi warrior that dodged the attack and used her fan to quickly make Notai go on the defensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kyoshi Warrior had long black hair in twin tails that were braided half way down and curly at the ends. She had a gold head piece that had a pair trees in front of a dawn all made of gold. Her eyes were violet with her facial make up being regulation with her nose being more flat than pointy. She moved to her waist where she pulled out a ninjaken as she moved with it to attack Notai.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNotai moved with her wrist dagger to knock the blade down. Gukki moved as he swung his club at the Kyoshi warrior. Moving her fan she blocked the attack and hit the club into the air. She kicked Gukki in the chest, sending him away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more figures came up behind Katara to help guard her. One was a man wearing a pair of fur pants and a fur tunic with wool under armor shirt. He had the wolf tail that most warriors wore with his face paint on. He carried a pair of boomerang and had a small bag strapped across his chest. He looked to be in his young twenties with his eyes gray.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe woman that stood with him was wearing a fur tank top hoodie with skirt. There were white seems on it with the arm warmers being blue. She had her hood down with short brown hair with the hair touching her jaw line. She had two hair loopies go to the back with a top knot. She wore a water skin back pack. Her eyes were blue and she looked like she was in her middle twenties, possibly the older sister of the man protecting Katara.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBato stepped off the boat with Sokka on his shoulder as Sokka had his right leg damaged. He winced as he saw a pair of sticks and went for them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKatara was drawn to the battle as two figures flipped on down the hill to the beach. They were Kyoshi Warriors that looked like exact twins. With black hair in buns and green eyes, only their tails were on opposite shoulders. They wore gold head pieces that had kanji for 'Far' and 'Near'. They each pulled out fans as they moved in a zig zag approach switching with each other every other step. Like an intricate dance for battle as they then sprinted to the two older guards.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKatara moved her hands to water bend a blast at them. One of them leaped and turned over the water as she threw her fan at Katara's wrist. A boomerang took care of it as the older guard went in to battle reaching into his satchel producing a boomerang. He went to strike her as she ducked and leaped, kicking his head he hit the sand unconscious.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe female guard bent the sea as she pulled up a wave at the other Kyoshi Warrior. The sister moved as she pulled off her back a shield as she blocked the water. She moved out from under it as she threw her fan. The fan was blasted, but in the shadow of the first was a second fan hidden. The fan severely cut the water bender guard's arm.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKatara pulled water to her as she was ready to strike. When the Kyoshi Warrior pulled for a sword she went at Katara. Katara threw the water in six shots as she then bent a source of water from the sand. The sand came to her in four tentacles as she fought the Kyoshi Warrior.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe Kyoshi Warrior moved to the right and left, then rolled as she leaped into the air throwing the ninjaken. The ninjaken went for Katara as she moved the wet sand to block the blade. The Kyoshi Warrior landed and went with a new burst of speed with her new produced fans. She went in for a crossing swing at Katara's midriff as she went for the final blow.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA club flew in the way as it broke in two and in the debris could be seen for a second was Sokka. A punch connected with the Kyoshi Warrior's nose. A crunch could be heard and felt as Sokka then stomped on the Kyoshi Warrior's foot. Moving his sprained and splint leg behind her other leg he pulled back. Elbowing her bosom he hit her to the ground as he pulled out a boomerang taking it to her neck.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe was defeated and could not believe it. Her sister growled as she went for her sister. She pulled out a ninjaken as she went at Sokka. Sokka looked to Katara as she nodded securing the prisoner in ice. Sokka then struggled up as he then threw his boomerang and pulled his small whistle. He blew in it as Gosmier flew to them from the air.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe Kyoshi Warrior ducked to the boomerang as Sokka pulled his machete. He swung up as he called to Katara, \u201cKatara, need some water.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNodding and looking determined she sent some water at Sokka. Sokka had swung his machete as the water surrounded it and broke through the metal ninjaken. Shock came to the Kyoshi Warrior as Sokka used the hilt of the machete to gut hit the Kyoshi Warrior. Moving his other elbow he hit her back as she hit the sand unconscious.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSokka looked up as he saw Notai moving on her Kyoshi Warrior. The Kyoshi Warrior was then captured to have her back at Notai. Notai took the opportunity to capture the Kyoshi Warrior's arms in a bind behind her back, holding her wrist blade to the warrior's neck.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFrom the top of the hill came a powerful Kyoshi Warrior that everyone could tell. She then said to the water tribesmen, \u201cI am Suki, the leader of these warriors that more than half your warriors had trouble with. And I will defeat the rest of you, to free them. The rest of the Kyoshi Warriors are on their way to capture you. Now, you can surrender, or you can be defeated with little waste of time.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe captured warrior then bit her lip as smoke came from her lips. Notai was surprised as she was hit the ground and was held down with her hands bound with a rope. Sokka looked at Suki as he kept his eyes solid with the enemy.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nReaching for his club he then starred down the enemy. He moved as he said to Katara, \u201cGot my back?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNodding Katara then replied to him, \u201cAlways.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSokka moved with pain in his leg as he winced and swung his attack. Suki moved dodging the club and moving her arm up to take his elbow out with the machete. The wet sand came at her as Sokka took a moment to recover pulled out his dagger as he went at her. Suki ducked and back strafed as she moved a fan in the way of Sokka's attack. She then used the hilt her her ninjaken to Sokka's gut.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSokka hit the ground as he groaned and saw the Suki turned around going after Katara. Katara moved her wet sand to attack Suki. Suki side stepped most of the attacks as she then saw a flurry of needles made of water go at her. Suki jumped twisting and turning as she landed, pulling out her ninjaken. She swung as she heard Gosmier squawk as she looked back for just a second.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe boomerang was dropped in Sokka's hand as he laid with a single eye closed in pain. Flinging his wrist he threw the boomerang as Suki moved to side step it. She grinned as she said to him, \u201cNot even close.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSokka then said to her, \u201cThat's what you think, but I cut your neck like a tetra tentacle fish.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuddenly Suki felt warmth travel down her neck as she took a hand to it. There was a nick, nothing fatal, but it was not possible to hit her. She was the leader and no one on the island could touch her. How could some off islander touch her? This warrior in half pain and disabled could still touch her? Was she too confident or was he just that good of a warrior?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhile Suki was distracted by her thoughts Gosmier flew into the back cylinder as he went to his upside down perch. The perch pulled down letting the pin fall back into place and the doors close.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTen other Kyoshi Warriors came up to the top of the hill as they threw nets over the bodies of the Water Tribesmen. Bato had moved to elude the warriors as Katara was surrounded and then held up her hands. She figured that she might as well as surrender as the odds were against them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waiting in the cells were all the members of the Southen Water Tribe Avatar protection detail. Sokka was sitting on a cot as his leg was being looked at by Katara. There were many guards waiting outside of the cell as they were girls and eying Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka saw blushes on their cheeks as they then looked elsewhere when Katara shouted at them, \u201cHEY! DON'T LOOK AT US LIKE ANIMALS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki approached as she said to them, \u201cHe's the one that they are looking at. The one with the sprained leg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up Sokka then said to her, \u201cYeah, well, if they want an ass kicking. I can give it to them, just open the cell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering at the boy she then replied, \u201cI might just let you do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara looked up at her, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki then replied to Katara, \u201cIf your warrior can hit me in battle, give me some real damage. I'll let you go and believe that you are indeed who you say you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka stood up as he asked her, \u201cWhat weapons do we get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki then said to him in reply with the slightest hint of a blush, \u201cAny two weapons that you choose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding Sokka then stood up as he approached the cell door. The cell door was opened as Sokka walked with her and approached a door. Two blushing and smiling Kyoshi Warriors opened the door for him. Walking inside he saw a table with all his weapons and items found on him at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a door passed the table as he grabbed his cylinder belt and boomerang. He walked up to the door as he walked inside a large room. This room had a door opposite to him as he saw it open with Suki walking in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki was armed with two fans as she opened them and took aim at Sokka. Sokka nodded as he then pulled out his boomerang. Suki then said to him, \u201cThat weapon doesn't have much room to fly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then took aim as he aimed above her head, \u201cI don't need boomerang to fly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing the boomerang he let it hit the wall with a bounce on it's angle. The boomerang spun bouncing from wall to wall as Suki ran at Sokka. Sokka jumped back and ducked as he dodged an attack. Kicking for him Sokka grabbed her leg with one arm holding it in place with his armpit. With his other arm he pulled the cylinder pin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened and out came Wolfie as he grabbed one of her fans. Surprise came to her face as Sokka thrashed his head into her guts. The other fan hit the ground as Suki hit the ground with it. Sokka lifted his hand as he caught his boomerang and lowered it to Suki's neck where the nick was at. Suki was impressed to say the least as she said to him, \u201cYour freedom lies just beyond the door that I entered through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka went to the door as Wolfie went back to his cylinder. Sokka went through the door as he then felt a bag hit his head. He panicked as his arms were then tied behind his back and his leg kicked hard. Groaning Sokka hit the floor and felt his body being moved.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe bag disappeared as Sokka laid in a room with a chain on his other ankle. He had his wrists binded behind his back as he looked at the three kyoshi warriors he had defeated that morning.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe Kyoshi Warrior had long black hair in twin tails that were braided half way down and curly at the ends. She had a gold head piece that had a pair trees in front of a dawn all made of gold. Her eyes were violet with her facial make up being regulation with her nose being more flat than pointy. She walked up as she smiled and went to his pants. She then introduced herself as she took a hand over his clothes penis, \u201cMy name is Lie Ying, and I want to meet with my sisters this great polar bear dog bone.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two Kyoshi twins with black hair in buns and green eyes, only their braided pony tails on opposite shoulders stood to his sides smiling. They wore gold head pieces that had kanji for 'Far' and 'Near'.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe one wearing the 'far' kanji introduced herself first with the twin wearing the kanji for 'near' second, \u201cI'm Ti and I'm Genqian.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuki approached from behind Sokka's head as she smiled wearing a green dominatrix outfit. With yellow spots at the private parts. She carried a small flail as she grinned sexily dominating. Sokka gulped as Suki then said to him, \u201cAnd now to help us welcome our newest sister is Sokka. You will be her introduction to the world of man.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLie Ying moved to the side as a figure came from the shadows. A young orange haired girl with green eyes that has her hair wavy and long with a top knot. She wears a head piece that is gold with and pair of chevrons pointing up that are over lapped by three chevrons pointing down with a diamond in the middle of the two sets of chevrons made of gold. She appeared to be slightly shy as she was looking away.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuki then said to Lie Ying, \u201cOur sister Xin Xing. Lie Ying, prepare him.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSmiling Lie Ying said as she uncovered Sokka's penis, \u201cWith pleasure my mistress.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLicking her lips Lie Ying saw Sokka's semi hard pecker cock as she licked it up to the head. Kissing the head of his pecker cock she then said to Sokka naughtily, \u201cWhat a wonderful bird you have here, like a male wood pecker rooster. Maybe that's why it I want to call it a pecker cock.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBiting her bottom lip as she sniffed the musk off the pecker cock Lie Ying hummed. Suki then said to the twins who were undressing each other and feeling each other's breasts, \u201cEnough of that, and get over here.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLooking at Suki the twins Ti and Genqian went to their mistress as they began to paw at Suki's breasts. Licking their lips they dove into their mistress's bountiful breasts. Humming satisfactorily Suki moaned as she saw Lie Ying licked the ball sack of Sokka. Looking at Xin Xing she saw that her sister was shy. That had to change, right now. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuki pursed her lips as she then said lightly pushing Ti and Genqian off her breasts, \u201cXin Xing, pleasure him. Lie Ying, induce him to eat your wonderful moon peach pie.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nExcitement came to her face as Lie Ying went to Sokka's face as she kissed his throat. She bit it ligthly as she raked her teeth down his Hakoda's apple and pinched his nipples. Smiling and panting was Lie Ying as she moved up to his jaw and kissed it until she got to his right ear lobe. She breathed hotly on it as she licked the ear lobe and pulled it into her lips. Sucking on his ear lobe made Sokka moan as she smiled between her lips as she giggled.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nXin Xing approached Sokka's pecker cock as she licked it and then liked the taste. She licked it again and found that the flavor was indeed what she was seeking in her puberty. She then went on it as she licked it and drooled on it, getting slick and wet. Sokka's pecker cock was hard, like his boomerang, a pure bone.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSokka moaned out as he asked Suki, \u201cWhat about Katara and Wolfie?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSmiling Suki then replied to him, \u201cYour bat is doing just fine, I'm having some of the girls feed him some meat. As for your comrades, they are being treated appropriately as your victory. Now, lie still while I get ready.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTi and Genquian moved to their mistress's crotch as they undercovered it. They began to lick and eat at Suki's moon peach making her moan and squeal. Suki moved her flail at Ti's back side as she moaned with a scream in her throat. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nLie Ying moved to Sokka's mouth as Sokka began to lick her pussy. Moving her hands to his wolf tail Lie Ying pulled it undone as she moaned at his tongue licking her out. She moaned as she pulled his head further into her pussy.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nXin Xing was licked and nearly eating Sokk'a apple banana. She put five inches of his apple banana into her mouth as she was trying to get the full seven in. She moved as she moved down his pecker cock. She got to his leechi nut sack as she licked them and moaned at the musky scent with manly taste.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSokka moaned as he shot up his white sperm as Xin Xing pulled off and coughed out as she chocked slightly. Gasping Suki saw the pecker cock pump out the strings of sperm. The pecker cock was just as hard as before as she approached his pecker cock.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe then lowered herself on his pecker cock as she moaned out. Untying his wrists Ti and Genqian felt his hands go to their pussies. They both screamed out as they heard Lie Ying squeal with pleasure and seeing their sister cum.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLie Ying hit the ground as she looked at Sokka and smiled licking up her own moon peach juices. Ti and Genqian were moaning as they met above him and kissed. They were licking each other's tongues as they moaned out.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSokka then asked as he licked Lie Ying's make up, \u201cWhy does your face paint taste fruity?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLie Ying then replied to him, \u201cBecause there is some apple syrup in it.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuki bounced on her prize as she grabbed her breasts and moaned. She massaged her breasts as she moaned and groaned. Cumming on his pecker cock Suki felt him eruption deep inside her. Her eyes went to the back of her head as she hit the chest of the warrior. The twins came on Sokka's hands as they moaned out and screamed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPulling off their mistress was Lie Ying and Xin Xing. The pair placed his pecker cock in between their pussies as they began scissoring. Moans came from the pair as Sokka groaned and the three came. White sperm shot high into the air as it rained down on the girls. Sokka was sweating as were the girls as they all went into a sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katara was scowling darkly as she boarded the ship along with Bato and Notai. Aside from Sokka, they were the last to return to the boat, and the Avatar could not help her expression darkening even further at that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced back down to shore, where the Kyoshi Warriors were saying goodbye to her bodyguard and crush. Aside from the Commander, Suki, there were also the twins Ti and Genqian, as well as Lie Ying and Xin Xing. These five, Katara could not help noticing, seemed suspiciously close to Sokka as they bid him farewell, bowing each several times in apology for the misunderstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara did not like the way those painted up harlots were looking at Sokka, and she felt very much like summoning up a wave to wash the women out into the sea. But she restrained herself, in part because there were four warriors boarding with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne, who had introduced herself as Ai, a Kyoshi Warrior with short, dark brown, almost black hair that she wore loose (except for her bangs, which were pinned up to one side), chuckled softly at Katara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like him,\" she observed in a teasing singsong, and Katara resisted the urge to backhand the girl overboard, even as her cheeks flushed dark red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why it should matter to you,\" Katara snapped, and even Notai, standing off to the side, recoiled just a little at the bile in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Kyoshi Warrior simply giggled and waved it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you,\" she said. \"We rarely see such fine specimens of manhood around here, and even rarer still is the warrior who can actually keep up with the commander. It's no wonder she's taken such a shine to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf looks could kill, the expression on Katara's face at that moment would have reduced Kyoshi Island to an uninhabitable wasteland. She glowered viciously down at the shore, where she saw Suki getting all too cozy and touchy feely with her Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the older Kyoshi Warriors, slender and slight (flat-chested, some might call her, but not where she could hear it), with soft brown eyes and brown hair done up in a ponytail, smiled warmly. Her name was Tae, or at least so she had introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to get jealous,\" she said. \"You are the Avatar, and so we loyally serve you...\" she licked her lips, glancing with unmistakable hunger down at Sokka, who was starting to walk up onto the ship. \"...and those who speak for you, also.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidori, another Kyoshi Warrior, with her short, black, tied-up hair and annoyingly generous curves, nodded, a dreamy smile on her face even as she blushed a faint pink, which was faintly visible even beneath the face paint of her order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, especially him...\" she said softly, sounding a little bashful in tone. \"That bodyguard of yours is really something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's huge, yes?\" came the deceptively childlike voice of the greenish-blue-eyed Kagura, one of the younger Kyoshi Warriors, who wore her light auburn hair up inside two black and gold bun-shaped ornaments, one on either side of her head. \"Down there, I mean. That's what Xin Xing said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hardened ivory railing of the finest of the Water Tribe's longboats all but splintered beneath Katara's grip, even as Sokka walked up onto the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't wait until they left this accursed island behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they left, though, did they take anyone with?</span></div></div>",

Suki claimed it was practice when in reality she was showing how great a warrior he was to her girls. Sokka's frame and form were epic, his leg was healed now and he was at the top of his game. Suki then saw that he nearly vanished in front of her eyes. He landed behind her as he leaped into the air. The boat had moved ahead thus throwing off his landing spot, but he was still behind her and a little too close to the railing for his comfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw his boomerang at her fan as it hit the floor. Katara cheered as the ship rocked and crashed on the sea. Sokka was thrown for a loop as he stumbled into Suki's bosom. His right hand grabbed her breast as she giggled with a moan. She hit the ground as Sokka's lips met hers and she accepted the kiss with gusto. Katara then steamed as the water around them began turbulent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi giggled at how jealous Katara could be. Notai was standing at the crow's nest. She snapped her spy glass as she then looked at it. She then growled and said as she tried to hide her blush, \"Dumbass, doesn't he know that he has someone's eyes on him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTae then made a comment, \"More than one person obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping her head at her Notai then said dignified, \"I happen to be married to my husband Tukki, I am just watching after my captain.

The Pelican Raptor wore a scroll pouch with a Kyoshi Island emblem on it's chest.

The sixteen year old prodigy of earthbending, and inventor of metalbending, was not happy with what she was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean they haven't even left yet?\" she irritably asked her loyal manservant, Ohev. \"I didn't travel halfway across the world just to sit here on my ass in White Lotus City! I could have done that back in Gaoling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man who acted as Toph's personal aide, assistant, and gofer in all things, sighed just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was an unexpected Elephant Koi off the coast, so they had to postpone the trip,\" he explained patiently to his lovely, but also incredibly trying mistress. \"According to what they said in the letter, though, they will actually be arriving the day after tomorrow's morning -- assuming weather permits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph scoffed. The Avatar would be there in two days the letter said. Well she would tell that letter to shove the news up it's own butt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, it is so boring in this stupid city,\" she griped. \"You won't even let me go and explore the ruins up in those cliffs! What do you expect me to do while I'm out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhev shook his head, appearing all too accustomed to his mistress's attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those ruins, as you call them, milady, are the hallowed grounds of the Western Air Temple. Only the Air Nomads and select pilgrims are permitted to set foot up there,\" he explained. \"After the Century Comet Massacre, the Western Air Temple was declared a holy place in memory of those who lost their lives there. To just go traipsing around willy-nilly in those ruins would be of the utmost disrespect to the memory of the Western Air Temples nuns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Air Nomads,\" she muttered. \"Don't let anybody have any fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I wouldn't say that...\" Ohev responded with a weak sort of laugh. \"I mean, Sister Ikki seems to be quite the playful young woman...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean the one who was squealing and drooling over that picture of the Avatar's bodyguard?\" she asked bluntly, tactlessly. \"Or do you maybe mean the one who spent half the day masturbating in her room while reading some dusty old pornography scrolls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhev blushed deep red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that would be the first one,\" he said. \"And the only scrolls Sister Jinora had on her person were the collected writings of Fire Lord Iroh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph whistled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would this be his political stuff, or his poetry?\" she inquired, \"Because I've heard some of the latter, and I gotta say: that is some pretty steamy stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhev coughed weakly, pointedly staying silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought so,\" Toph muttered, before shrugging (the motion causing her modestly sizable breasts to do some very interesting things) and adding: \"So, when should they be here? From what Ikki was saying, it sounds like this Sokka fellow might be pretty easy on the feet. What was it she said?

He had his dagger on him as he swam looking out into the sea. He saw a fish as he went in and attacked it. He was holding breath rather impressively as he fought and took the fish to the basket. The basket was near full of fish as he went for one last four tentra tentacle fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing out of the water Sokka gasped with a large breath of air. He saw the water tribe long boat waiting for him as he swam after slipping his dagger into it's sheath. Sokka enjoyed hunting he loved to hunt and forge. It was his primary role when he was growing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the men were trained as warriors by nature believing that only the ice produced the best warriors. Man was like any other animal to them, and the ice would judge which was the better warrior. Swimming also came natural to the Water Tribe capable of holding their breath for 8 to 10 minutes at a time. Which to most people was unheard of, but for Sokka he was a great specimen of a young water tribe man. He was known best according to Bato for being the first water tribe non bender to hold his breath for 13 minutes in the last 500 years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki was rather impressed to hear this as she smiled staring at his swimming body. Oh, that body could do a lot more than just swim. It could and would pleasure her than no girl could do. She liked girls and boys alike, there was nothing wrong with either of them. What most men lacked in foreplay or paying attention to a woman's needs. They made up for it for being rough and wild in the sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka went up to the long boat as he grabbed onto the bone made ladder. The entire boat was made of animal hide, bone, teeth, shell, tanned leather and sea weed. Nothing was wood and nothing was metal, it was all stuff you could find on the ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka climbed up the ladder finally as he set down his basket that was as long as his back. The basket was four feet in diameter with a hide chest belt. The basket was made of seaweed and armored with leather to prevent water damage. Sokka took off his leather jerkin as he showed off his eight pack and his stone chiseled pecs. Midori fell onto her butt in staring at the carmel god as she thanked Kyoshi for letting her see such a magnificent sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka went over to his cloths that were being washed by Katara. She pulled the water from them as she then presented him with his fur cloths. He put on the light hide jerkin with thin hide pants and a pair of wool socks from the arctic saber cat sheep. He lastly put on a pair of tanned leather gloves and turtle shell elbow pads. His boots he choose not to wear as the ship wasn't moving yet. They had set anchor this fine morning in a bay of an uncharted uninhabited island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka went and dropped the fish off to Gukki as he said to the waking boy, \u201cTake your pick and gut 'em, three fishes only.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGukki picked out three fishes as he then put in on his whale shark tooth that he used as a plate. Sokka then picked up the basket as he went to Notai and did the same thing. After them he went to Bato and the other two guards of the Southern Water Tribe (They don't have names yet, if someone wants to give the two of them names and personas you can. There is one guy and one girl, the girl is a water bender and the boy a hunter). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then went up to the Kyoshi Warriors as he said to them with a sauve grin, \u201cLadies, pick three fish and take care of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kyoshi Warriors picked some of the smaller fishes. Sokka then finally took a look at the basket. There were seven fishes left as he went to Katara. He grabbed the whale shark teeth as he cleaned the fishes. He hit them with seaway to clean them as he prepared the cold cuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then hit the fishes with spices as he saw that the last of his spices were finally used. He did have three more boxes of it along with a years worth seaway. All of it lost in the crash on Kyoshi Island. Thank goodness the Water Tribe sent them another long boat. The Seaway was partial replaced along with preserved meat with salt from salt water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka whimpered at the fact of being empty of his spices. It cost him nearly all of his honor (The name to Water Tribe currency that is made of bone, the animal that died for the honor will be judged on how it died and how much damage it did to the hunter. The longer the combat the more the bone made coins are worth.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka so was going to miss his spices as he dearly loved them. It was still two days before they reached their destination. He pulled on his boots as he let out Wolfie. Wolfie flew out as he went and got himself a couple of fishes and bugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then began to eat his fishes fillets. He really wanted to have more of his spices. He was used to more spices, but he had to ration it. As he then fished his breakfast and then went to the wheel. Bato and Gukki after the breakfast was eaten the pulled up the anchor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boat went out to the sea away from the bay as the boat sailed towards White Lotus City. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in white lotus city<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was sitting at the Avatar house that was meant for her and the teachers that would be teaching the Avatar. The city was grand and made of entirely of stone and metal. Buildings were nearly reaching the sky as there was seven buildings that had 20 floors with statues on top of them. They were made of white stone that were 25 feet tall each. The statues were of Aang, Kuzon, Bumi, Ilah (Azulon's Wife), Lee (The caretaker of Piandoa), Annigan (Northern Water Tribe General and Grandfather of Yue) and finally Lo Ten (Cabbage Merchant's grand father).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was with Ohev as she laid back on the stone bed. She liked it as she was then bombarded by a sound. Ikki has crashed through the window as she smiled. At the upset earth bender. Toph then said to her deadly, \u201cWhat is your good reason for destroying the glass window?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki then hopped up as she landed on her feet and said to her with a smile, \u201cThe hot stuff is here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph then replied to her, \u201cYou mean the Avatar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki then said to her as she forgot, \u201cOh, yeah the avatar too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><b><u><i>With Katara and Sokka</i></u></b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara and Sokka were sitting in the personal room of the avatar. They were on their knees with their buttocks on their feet. Their heads craned back with eyes closed as they meditated. Their hands were behind the backs holding each wrist as they relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then breathed in as he said to her, \u201cCalm your mind, this is the way the Water Tribe Elders practice the mind. This is how the warriors strategize and this is how the Water Benders exercise their chi. Release your mind and seek out the former Avatar. Seek him out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara then opened her eyes with a gasp as her eyes became white as she tapped into the avatar spirit. Sokka then released himself from his meditation and sat down leaning back. He watched her as he waited for her first vision to halt itself.</span></div></div>",

Kuzon had snuck into his father's study and discovered a plot to destroy the Air Benders. Aang looked up as he saw in the sky on this cloudy day a raise of light. He had to do something as he then leaped onto Appa. He had just gotten back from his temper tantrum of running away. He was frozen in the iceberg for two days before he decided that he needed to face his fears. That his people's way of life had to be in danger if they were letting him know he was the Avatar before his 16th birthday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang flew off as he went out flying over the sea. He saw the smoke from the sky. It came from the directions of the Western Air Temple and Northern Air Temple. Fire Benders must have landed their ships before hand and attacked two temples at once. That was the only explanation as saw a green dragons flying up with fire benders on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragons flew into battle as they breathed their fire and the fire benders attacks the air temples. Aang could not believe his eyes, this was horrible as he then felt a pit in his stomach. There were 25 dragons heading to his home, he would stop them. He had to stop them as he then leaped off Appa. He focused as his body went into the Avatar State. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire unleashed from the dragons struck back at them as Aang came down with a kick. The air became toxic to them as it hit them and pelted them to the water. Aang landed above the water with a sphere of air around his feet. He lifted his arms as the water came up in a giant tidal wave. Pushing his hands forward the dragons were sent crashing into the Patola Mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Sozin appearing on a red dragon as he shot forth a red flame. Aang then sent the stones that lined the Southern Air Temple at him. The dragons were defeated and Sozin retreating with his tail in between his legs. The two temples were lost and Aang recovered. The Sozin war had begun as he starred out to the world. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was sweating and shivering, and her skin was pale. Her heart was racing, and it was all she could do to keep the trembling of her hands in check as she picked herself up off of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" she heard Sokka ask, and under other circumstances she would have perhaps been a little pleased to hear the concern in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now, she was too shaken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... I think so...\" she murmured softly. \" I just... wow... I never realized how awful it must have been... I was so young... So many of my people were slaughtered on that day...\" she said, and while speaking these last two sentences, her voice sounded distant. Remote it was, almost, and the manner of her speech seemed odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept, to Katara's ears it did not sound like her voice. She was not the one speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the voice of an old man, old before his time, aged sooner than he should have by hardship and grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katara?\" said Sokka, and she became aware that his hands were gripping her by the shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay...\" she said, she whispered, her voice weak and croaking but hers once more. \"I made contact...\" she mumbled, her words slightly stronger now. \"I definitely made contact,\" she repeated, affirmed. \"I saw... well, I think I must have been seeing the Sack of the Western Air Temple... It was surreal. I could feel emotions that weren't my own; my thoughts weren't my thoughts....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You communed with Grandfather Aang, then?\" came a voice, feminine and even, cool and calculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" came another voice, vaguely similar to the first, sounding from out in the hall, coming through the door. \"Don't tell me I missed my chance to talk to Grandpa!\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the door flew open, and a young woman, maybe a year or two older than Katara, with a slender, athletic figure dressed in Air Nomad clothes, burst into the room. She had arrow tattoos, indicating a mastery of airbending. Somewhat strangely, though, her hair was not shorn or shaven the way Air Nomads traditionally did. They could see the point of the arrow on her forehead, and the smaller arrows on her arms, but her hair was held up in buns, and not shaven the way Katara had seen in the pictures back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl was shortly followed by a pale, curvy young woman with black hair and pale skin. This one's eyes were the color of cloudy jade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot Stuff!\" squealed the first, spinning through the air to come landing immediately right between Sokka and Katara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Avatar frowned darkly when she saw the way the airbender was eyeing her bodyguard and crush. Gray eyes twinkled and gleamed as they bored into Sokka's deep sea blue, and Katara noted that this girl did not seem to have any concept of personal space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl had a wide grin on her face as well, grinning predatorily in Sokka's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" Katara heard her say, \"something to do around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not like the way the girl licked her lips to punctuate that remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she noticed a third girl -- probably the first one she had heard speaking. This one was also an airbender, from appearances, and she bore a remarkable resemblance to the first -- though Katara noticed that she seemed to have a slightly curvier figure. This girl was also eyeing her brother, and Katara glowered darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great. More competition.</i></span></div></div>",

They were standing in the open in a practice circle with the Earth Bending teacher. She had introduced herself as Toph of Gaoling and had even accidentally caught Sokka in her bosom after an Earth Bending accident. Sokka had to admit the 17 year old's bosom was rather soft. She stood at 5 foot 9 which was a couple inches shorter than Sokka. Toph was a very attractive girl along with Masters Ikki and Jinora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisiting with the sisters were two other Air Nomads from the Northern Air Temple. The Northern Air Temple Sokka had heard was a unique group. After the Century Comet Massacre, the Northern Air temple lost all of its Guardian Monks to the dragon raids. The survivors trained in a new system, 12 monks known as the Zodiac would rule over all the males and female air nomads. They would split them into groups of 12 just like the Zodiac monks. If an enemy was captured by a group called a Zoa then it took a unanimous vote to kill the enemy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka did not trust people who would not kill to protect their skin. So, these air nomads were more his style. There was a girl that was a representative that did not have the air nomad tattoos of mastery. But was still revered highly by her friend who was there. He was a bald 20 year old with steel grey eyes and a brown mustache. He had the air nomad tattoos signalling him to be a master. His name was Ran while the girl's name was Statci.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph was instucting Katara to do push ups and earth stomp building her muscles. Toph walked around behind Sokka as she then patted his butt. Sokka made a yelp as Katara glared at her and stomped. Toph stomped in turn as two earth bending attacks hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki made a cat call shouting, \"Whooo! Fighting for hot stuff. Hey hot stuff why don't you show your boomerang already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka grabbed his boomerang in question with a quirked eye brow as Ikki then smiled shaking her head, \"Nope the other one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara growled as she water bent the two basins at Ikki.</span></div></div>",

She spun in midair, the air swirling around her feet to push away and scatter the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good portion of it was sent right back at Sokka and Katara, and Sokka had to duck aside as the Avatar caught the water with her bending, pulling it back together and forming it into a whip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara pushed her hands forward, and the water froze and shattered, shaping into dozens of icy flechettes that she shot angrily at Ikki in a wide dispersal. The bubble, energetic airbender easily slipped between and blew aside all of the frozen darts, but in doing so she inadvertently sent several of them flying wide, shooting towards the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph swore when she felt some of the ice pelt her skin, the pointed bits tearing at her clothes a little, cutting up her blouse in some very interesting places. And Jinora, on the opposite end of the training field from Toph, only barely looked up from her book in time to conjure a defense sphere of spinning air around her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still got scratched on the cheek by one of the ice shards, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph, snarling, stomped down hard on the earth training ground, and it felt like the whole house shook and trembled under the force of the resultant tremors, ripples of force traveling through the floor in the shape of cracking, curling waves of earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was nearly tripped by one of these waves, and he was hard pressed to evade the rest. Especially since Jinora, having been seemingly enraged by her sister's carelessness, was swinging her arms in furious swinging, spiraling arcs, setting powerful, focused winds to blow this way and that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Jinora's gusts caught Katara off-guard, hitting the Avatar like an invisible slap in the face. The young tribeswoman, angered even further by this than she already was, hit the broken, shattered ground with her foot, causing several good sized rocks to fly up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph, were she in a less frustrated, irritated, sex-starved mood, might have been impressed by how well Katara was earthbending right now, perhaps unconsciously tapping a little bit into the memories and experience of past lives as she swung out her arms and shattered the rocks, sending the resultant earth shrapnel flying outwards in nearly every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka hit the deck, narrowly avoiding getting brained right in the temple. He still got pelted a good deal on the back, though. And Statci, he noticed, was next to him, though she seemed to somehow have completely avoided getting caught in the crossfire, so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki, for her part, danced in between the shards of stone with a preternatural grace, and Sokka, from his low vantage point, could see a bit of light jiggling beneath the girl's robes as she moved. Jinora, in contrast, appeared to prefer a comparatively more brute force defense, once more compressing the swirling winds into a vertiginous shell of air, which turned aside and shattered any missile that attempted to penetrate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph merely sank into the ground, completely avoiding the hail of shooting gravel, before quite suddenly shooting up out of the ground behind Katara on a swiftly rising stone pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Avatar just narrowly managed the evade in time when Toph then kicked the pillar, snapping it out of the ground and sending it straight at Katara with a fearsome speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pillar collided with the opposite wall in a great, mighty CRASH, and it seemed like things were only going to get worse, when...</span></div></div>",

Then he would leave to let the Avatar focus on her training. Sokka walked with the three Kyoshi Warriors as Lie Ying, Xin Xing, Suki, Ti and Genquin stayed at the Avatar's house. <br>\r\n<b><i><u><span class=\"cnavy\"><br>\r\nIn the Northern Water Tribe</span></u></i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn walked with a fast pace as he had four warriors escorting him. He temper was not calm as he went to the docks. There at the docks were the four fastest ships and the three most heavily arms ships with the Tribal Chief ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four ships that were the fastest in all of the Northern Water Tribe were canon like with a large sail. They each had two warriors one armed with a bow and arrow while the other had a machete. They were also equipped with two water benders to allow the ships to move along the sea much faster aided by the wind they were like the wind itself, there one moment and gone the next. These ships were called Sea Skippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three heavily armed ships were large bone made boats like the Sea Skippers with the exception that they were Galleys. They had 40 oars on each side giving a grand total of 80 oars each manned by 2 men. The Galleys were armed with six Polybolos and an additional 10 men with bows and arrows. These three war ships were called Tundra Incarnates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tribal Chief ship was a Brigantine ship that was made of animal as well. Only it had wooden masts which was a rare material in the Water Tribes. The ship was named justly as the Chief Ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn walked up to the dock that Yue was walking down. Pakku stood at the end as he then said to Hahn, \"I'm sorry master Hahn, but this is as far as you go. Princess Yue has called off the engagement, you are not permitted to be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn said in rage, \"You have no right to tell me old man where I am permitted and not permitted. Now, I shall go and see Princess Yue whether you like it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPakku then said to him as he bent up the ice in front of him, \"I do not like it, now I will give you one more chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn then made a mistake as he reached for his back and pulled out his whale tooth scimitar. He did this even in the presence of Pakku who then bent the raised ice at Hahn's gut. He then bent the water to splash the young hunter into the water. Pakku then spun and slammed his flat hands down freezing Hahn shoulder deep in the ocean encased in ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPakku then said to him, \"Now, stay you shall, I shall report your behavior to the chief. And he will deal with you how he sees fit later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPakku walked to the ship as he boarded it and the ships set out. Hahn was released from the ice by one of his guards who was a water bender. Hahn climbed out as he stalked back to the city. He would go to the coast villages as he would use his family's influence to get what he wanted.

Sokka walked inside the house as they directed him to the Kyoshi Warriors room. Sokka asked them, \"Uh, how are you going to distract me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTae smiled as she pushed him to the large bed that could hold all the girls at the same time. She then said to him as she began to take off her kimino starting with her shoulders. Taking off her sash was Midori as Kagura shook off her pants under her kimono. The three were getting nude soon as Kaura took her hair piece off letting her hair fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTae and Midori crawled onto the bed as they began to strip Sokka. Kagura went to a basin in the room as she put a cloth inside and wrung it out. She began to wash off her war paint. She tossed it into a hamper as she gathered two more wash clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was being caressed by Tae as she crawled behind him and pulled his head into her bosom. She pulled his hair string out of his wolf tail letting his beautiful hair out. Midori pulled off his loin cloth as she gasped at his incredible length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagura went behind Midori as she rubbed her face making her war paint disappear in front of Sokka's eyes. Midori then went to his cock as she stroked it. Kagura tossed the clean cloth to Tae who washed her face. Throwing the clothes the girls went at Sokka's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTae wrapped her arms around the shorter boy as she stroked the bottom shaft of his cock. Kagura got beside Midori as she licked his testicles as Midori swallowed hard. Her nervousness gone as she licked the head of his cock. Sokka moaned as he saw Tae put her upside down face into his. His head was still in her large rack as she kissed him. She kissed his nose and upper lip. Straining Tae kissed him as he kissed her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidori squealed as her and Kagura got shot at by his cock. His cock shot out a pair of ropes of cum. Midori then got on her knees as she had her wet pussy swallow the head of his cock. She moaned as she began to ride him and Tae pulled back her kiss. Deciding to just watch the show and wait for her turn. Kagura was massaging her breasts as she licked Midori's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka closed his eyes in restraint as he was holding back his cum. But, the girl kept on bouncing on his cock. He then came inside her as she had her eyes roll to the back of her head. Her face was that of someone who's brain blew to pieces. Pulling her off his cock was Kagura as she then stroked Sokka's cock. Midori hit the bed as she sighed out and began to rest. </span></div></div>",

His clan would have ruled the entire tribe if he did get married. But, he was turned down for some Southern prick. Riding the sled that was pulled by Polar dogs he went to one of the coast villages along the Northern Tundra. This village was ruled by the Thunder Crab Shrimp clan. His clan the Sword Tooth Tiger Bears were a fierce clan named as such as they wiped out the last of the Sword Tooth Tiger Bears about nine generations ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Hahn of the Sword Tooth Tiger Bears clan rode into the village as he went to the clan leader house. This village mainly earned honor for the Tribe by killing some of the most fierce animals. Honor was the Tribe's form of money, this was the way of both the Tribes the North and the South. It was first started by the 9th Water Tribe Avatar, Kumak of the Thunder Crab Shrimp clan. He had hunted animals and used their useless bones as a form of barter. This system would be passed down through the generations and still continued 40,000 years later. It had been so long that the first 8 Water Tribe avatars had been long forgotten not serving as high a purpose as Kumak. Who was thought in the North as the wisest of all Avatars stopping the Hunting Wars with the first form of Water Tribe currency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn got off his sled as the Polar dogs stopped. He walked up to the steps as there were six guards. These guards were a form of water bender warrior that served the Thunder Crab Shrimp clan only. Using a weapon made of a pair of bones with a seaweed weaved chain connecting them called a Norimari. The Norimari was a weapon of great control of water bending that allowed constant push and pull with every swing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn then announced to them, \"I am Hahn of the Sword Tooth Tiger Bear Clan, let me through, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six stomped as they snapped the Norimari allowing the steps to be covered in snow to allow traction. Hahn climbed them as he went inside the clan house. Inside was an old man as he sat with five guards each a member of the Warrior Caste. Unlike the Southern Water Tribe which believed that the a warrior was also a hunter and thus it's only form of military. The Northern Water Tribe had a four Caste system in it's military. The Hunters corps, the Warrior Caste, the Water Benders and the Navy with Marine detachment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn then said to the man, \"Isi of the Thunder Crab Shrimp clan, I ask you. Are you happy with the current chief's policies? Every year he has been chief which was 14 years ago he seems to bring more and more Fire Nation influence. Fire Nation money should not be worth more than a honor. It cost now 30 honor to buy a wolverine fox rib and yet the Fire Nation money known as brass coins cost them only 2. People in the main city carry purses full of jingle and people leave the Tundra and Outskirts. Two of the biggest fishing, hunting and honor seeking grounds. So, are you happy with the chief's policies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsi looked up at him as he then spoke to him, \"What you speak of is treason. The Moon Eel clan has been in line of Tribal succession for nearly a hundred generations. The Sword Tooth Tiger Bear clan like the Thunder Crab Shrimp clan has not been in ruling for generations, many winters and summers have passed. We can not go against the Chief, it would be treason. The last time someone went against the chief was when the 100th Water Avatar resided here, Korma. What makes you think that we can go against the chief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at him center of the eyes Hahn then said to him coldly, \"By looking like heroes. If we can convince one of the clans to try and take over the city while the chief is gone. Then you and I can swoop in and kill the clan's head. Thus absorbing the clan, and with the people's chief gone on a 4 month voyage. Where will the people turn? The successor to the line is gone with him and the chief's brother is dead. Who would that leave in place of the throne?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsi then said with a grin, \"The Thunder Crab Shrimp clan, but if you want power. What assurances do I have of you not turning against me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn then began to pace as he said to the wise clan leader, \"I do not want to be chief, no that power belongs to someone who is either too old to fight. Or is for someone all too wise like yourself to not be fooled. What I want is to be general of the military. I want the power of the military at my call and of course follow your ruling. With this, I give my word to not betray you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsi then said to him, \"It is done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i><u><span class=\"cplum\">In the Outskirts, Geko Wolf clan village</span></u></i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn stood in front of a clan leader as he said to him, \"And with you taking over the city, the chief will be gone. Who will the people turn to with you forcefully holding the reins over the city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man known as Mikar said, \"Me, Mikar of the Geko Wolf clan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn then said to him, \"And all I ask is to be the general of the military.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><u><i><b>In the Outskirts, Arctic Wolf Bat Clan<br>\r\n</b></i></u></span><br>\r\nHahn stood in front of Nanuq, \"And with the honor of the Ostrich Elk, Caribou Bear and Fox Owl clans that you receive yearly you can buy the power to defeat the Moon Eel clan. All I ask is to be the general of the military.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i><span class=\"clteal\"><u>In the Outskirts, Ostrich Elk clan village</u></span></i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn stood in front of Shikoba, \"And with the surprise yet elite attack of your clan, the people will have no choice but to obey you. All I ask is to be the general of your military.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikoba put his hand out as he shook hands with the very evil in physical form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\"><u><b><i>In the main city</i></b></u></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn stood in front of the two remaining generals of the military. Ujarak and Tiriaq the twins of the military. The only twins that in the entire history of the Nothern Water Tribe to make general in the same year. Hahn then said to them serious, \"And those are the clans that will attack in a week's time. You do not have the man power to fend off such a deadly attack. So, I offer my clan's services. And all I ask for in return is to be made a fellow general.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUjarak who like his brother had long black hair only his was in twin tails inside of a warrior's wolf tail. The warrior's wolf tail was instituted by the first Southern Water Tribe's Avatar which came after Kumak. The twins had blue eyes and they were both tall and broad shouldered. Ujarak said to Hahn, \"Very well, but first tell me, how did you get this information?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn then said to him, \"I killed a traitor to my clan.\" Hahn put on a great show pretending to be remorseful, \"My own cousin, Uhirak, he went to the Ostrich Elk clan. He planed on ruling as the new chief with their help and Shikoba would be given great power. Uhirak tried to kill me, but I killed him in the fight.\"</span></div></div>",

Him and his clan stood by and watched. Healers were killed, mothers were raped. Daughters taken, son killed. Father's tortured by the vision of daughters being taken and sons being killed. Blood hit the snow as Hahn held up his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sword Tooth Tiger Bear clan archers walked forward. They took their arrows and knocked them as let them fly into the high air. The arrows rained down on the warring clans. Soldiers, hunters, honor bringers, navy men and innocents were all hit. The shooting of 40 arrows lead to more than 20 deaths as 15 men walked up and threw boomerangs. The throwing clubs hit people down in the city from the large cliff wall that his benders had built the day before the attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn then reached for his belt as he pulled out a piece of ice. He shined a code as members of clans suddenly attacked their own brothers. Hahn had paid handsomely several traitors as he grinned. Hahn's water bending cousins and body guards water bent. Large icy boulders rolled down into the city. Hahn then saw the water benders of several clans and the main military water benders caste go after him. They had finally realized that Hahn was a traitor to them, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn then threw the ice as his who stood by his side water bend it into the explosive armory. The mines of the city blew as they hit the ice bridges and buildings. The shock wave made water bending lost for a few moments. But, those hand full of moments were all Hahn needed as the archers shot more arrows. Soldiers of the Sword Tooth Tiger Bear clan threw spears and javelins at the enemies. The water benders who were predictable to Hahn's plan died there as they were struck and fell from the blast. Even if they water bent the snow to break their fall they had died by the arrows and spears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHahn then made a fist in front of him. It was the signal, the signal to the domination of the Water Tribe. Under it's new chief, Chief Hahn of the Northern Water Tribe and Clan Master of the Sword Tooth Tiger Bear clan. The warriors went down the ice made bridges by the Sword Tooth Tiger Bear water benders. The archers knocked arrows as they no longer volleyed them, but shot with accuracy. The foot soldiers ran down the bridges as they took out their axes and swords. The fought and sprayed their bodies and the ground with blood. The boomerang throwers grabbed more boomerangs from their backs that they carried several in a pack. They went into battle as they threw boomerangs and attacked with jaw blades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe domination was a success as Hahn walked down one of the bridges. With his whale tooth scimitar he beheaded several warriors and traitors to the Tribe. Hahn made his way to the chief's building as he walked there escorted by his cousins. As he walked up the steps he sat killed several soldiers. Tiriaq's brother, Ujarak, had died earlier that day and he would avenge him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiriaq went into battle with his axe as he clashed with Hahn. But, Hahn was younger and more devious. And he held less honor than this man. He stabbed the man's gut as he slammed in a small hand held mine. Kicking him to his men, Hahn watched as Tiriaq blew up with his men. The doors were blasted open as Hahn then walked to the seat of power.</span></div></div>",

Tae smiled at the way his manhood twitched and shivered as it delivered its load, and Kagura sniggered at the expression on the male warrior's face. They had been going at things in this manner for a number of hours, now, and they marveled at what stamina Sokka had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOstensibly, they were just supposed to keep him distracted and away from the Avatar and her teachers, but the three Kyoshi Warriors were having very much fun playing with Sokka. Certainly, he was easily the finest specimen of masculinity they had ever beheld, and he was just so much fun to tease and please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting late, though, and they knew that they would want to wrap things up -- and soon. If somebody were to walk in on them, they knew that a fight would probably break out. And the chances of this handsome hunk of beefcake getting damaged in the crossfire were too great to risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was only with great reluctance that they finally removed themselves from Sokka and put their clothes back on. Their war paint they could not reapply, as they did not have the proper pigments with them, but they knew that the only ones who would understand the significance of this would be the other Kyoshi Warriors. Because the only time a Kyoshi Warrior was permitted to remove her makeup, in uniform, was when she was anticipating an extended period of leave for... maternity related reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficially, at least. But unofficially, it was generally just a sign that the warrior in question had recently got some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd oh how had they gotten some. And then some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even more, still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka had some truly remarkable stamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><u><b>With Katara and her teachers</b></u></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki and Ty Lee clapped excitedly as Katara let a large, perfectly cubical chunk of earth drop back into the floor of the training ground. Jinora was perusing a scroll, only one eye on what the Avatar was doing. Mai appeared to be busy cleaning her knives, and both Ran and Statci looked like they were meditating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula had a small smirk, though, and Toph was grinning approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, Sugar Queen,\" said the latter, giving an only half sarcastic thumbs up in Katara's approximate direction. \"That was actually some halfway decent earthbending.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara huffed at that remark. She did not like Toph's cocky attitude, especially not when the famed 'Blind Bandit' saw fit to make such frequent comments regarding what all a certain Southern Water Tribe warrior happened to be packing in his loincloth. Just because Toph's tremor sense let her \"see\" through people's clothes didn't mean she had the right to make so many damn crude remarks about Sokka's apparently peerless phallus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it was,\" she said irritably. \"I'm the Avatar. I've mastered the elements a thousand times in a thousand lifetimes. Bending comes to me as easily as breathing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe waterbending and earthbending do,\" Azula interject, a vaguely smug look on her face. \"But according to my studies, the Avatar traditionally has difficulty with mastering their third element -- the one diametrically opposed to their native element. In your case, fire.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara muttered darkly under her breath, not in a good mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" she grumbled. \"Let's call it a day. The sun's almost down, and I've been training for hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" said Toph dismissively. \"If you think you need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara bristled at this jibe, but she did not rise to the bait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was too tired to want to fight, right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katara went into the house to relax after finally learning out to cut out a cube of earth and lift it. It was a lot harder than she thought it was going to be. According to Ohev, Toph's servant, she had more than likely a another year or two to truly master the Earth Bending art. Even Aang the last avatar took several years to master the bending arts. She was told by her spirit trainer and body guard, Sokka. That Aang may have taken on Sozin with just air bending on the century comet massacre during the beginning of the Sozin war. But, he still had to master the bending arts and to truly be a master. You could learn no more from your teacher. And, Toph still had much to teach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara decided after all the Boulder lifts to strengthen her upper body strength that she needed a dip. Katara moved the Water Tribe quarters as she decided that she'd check on Sokka. Katara walked up to an archway, with heavy water pouring down. Only a water bender or water tribe member could go through the water was too heavy for Earth Kingdom Hussies and the water was too cold for Fire Nation sluts. The Air Nomad Harlots wouldn't go in cause the speed of the falling water, thus allowing the Water Tribe quarters to be truly cut off from the rest of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara swung her arms out as the waterfall broke apart allowing her to walk inside. She saw the three doors as she heard the water fall begin again. She went to the last door as she opened it she saw something that truly made her blood boil. There he was with Notai, that bitch. There she was married to Tukki back at home as she massaged Sokka's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her as she giggled with a smile at his comment, \"Man those girls fighting really was bad for my back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara remembered who Tukki was, he was the only man in the entire tribe who solely ate seaweed. He was one of those vegans that the Earth Kingdom merchants were talking about. How Notai turned down such a fine warrior and hunter such as Sokka. He brought back from the hunt of marriage a polar bear dog. He was the only hunter under 20 years old that ever killed three Polar Bear Dogs. Sokka was a legend called the Apex Hunter of the Ice by members of the Tribe. And yet she married that Tukki who brought her spicy sea weed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka moaned out as he felt his back be popped as he groaned out with a spasm. Sokka then hit the ground with his head as he felt the hot water that was ankle deep against his jaw and chin. His body was so fine as Katara starred at it and felt her cheeks heat up. Then it happened she heard Notai say to him, \"You know Sokka, now that we are away from the chief. I can become more than just your soldier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's eyes widen as he then got up as Notai got off him. He said to her, \"But, you're married to Tukki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai then said to him, \"Come on that pathetic excuse for a hunter? I only married him so that if you and I got married that the chief would not see any further rank advancements as sexual favors. I mean come on Sokka, I love you and you love me. But, I worked hard to become the first woman hunter of the Southern Water Tribe. I don't want the next women hunters to follow in the foot steps of someone they think is a skank. You can understand right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he said to her, \"Yes, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara then decided as she heard this reasoning and decided that it was the truth that she would forgive Notai. The only question was how much forgiveness should she receive.</span></div></div>",

She was certain that would give her the courage to go through with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an ease of graceful movement that did nothing to belie how nervous she really was, Katara opened the door and walked into the room. She did not burst through, throwing the door open and throwing herself at Sokka. Neither did she sneak in and try to take the pair unawares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she simply opened the door and walked in, putting forth a flawless facade of 'I have every right to be here and you should not question it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka and Notai stared at her, and Katara saw that the latter had been removing her skirt, and that the former had been undoing the shirt of the latter. They looked like a pair of children who had been caught sneaking pickled seaweed out of the larder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite herself, Katara felt her lips curve up into a remarkably sensuous grin, and she flicked her eyes from Sokka to Notai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't stop on my account,\" she said, sounding much more confident than she felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka blushed, but Notai narrowed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" the hunter asked her, probably unsure how to take this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting back the trembling of nerves, Katara said quite simply:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To share my first time with Sokka. And you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai's eyes widened, and her cheeks were bright red as she processed what Katara was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...\" murmured Notai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will forgive you for your deceit,\" said the young Avatar in a lofty tone, almost casually beginning to undo her blouse. \"On the condition that you do not try to keep him to yourself. You accepted Tukki's proposal of marriage. Sokka can never truly be yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai met Katara's eyes, and she saw that the hunter's eyes were hard as the tusks of a narwhalrus, as cold and sharp as a spear of ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will never stop me from loving him,\" said Notai fiercely, determination smoldering in her sapphire eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara smiled, silently approving of this firm resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's show him,\" she said, her fears and hesitation melting away into the giddy high of hot lust building up in the pit of her stomach, the fluttering of her heart, the bittersweet taste of desire upon her lips, \"just how much love we really have for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai smiled, seeing Katara strip now boldly, fearlessly out of her clothes, leaving herself naked. And she was doing likewise, herself, even as she examined the gorgeous nude body of the Avatar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon both girls were naked, and they smiled down at Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would give him their first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They both would.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's eyes widened as he looked up at Katara and Notai's nude forms. He could see their pussies perfectly, from this angle, and he could see how wet they were already with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent of their blossoms was intoxicating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced higher up, seeing the two girls' bosoms side by side. Katara had the larger breasts, by a decent margin, but Notai was no slacker either, in that department, and he knew from a number of furtive glances in the past that the latter had one of the roundest and firmest asses in all the South Pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked into their eyes, two pairs of gleaming cerulean lamps. They were bright, gleaming with love and lust, longing and desire. Their color was pure, sublime, and they seemed almost to cast their own light in the dimly lit room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling himself harden, Sokka knew at once that he could not bring himself to deny the girls what they wanted. Because he wanted it too, he knew. Almost more badly than he had ever wanted anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips, he leaned forward and placed a kiss on the lips of Notai's womanhood, and then one on Katara's as well. The girls moaned and shivered at the contact, and Sokka could not help a small smile quirking his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tasted delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to eat Katara out, licking her pussy. He explored her womanhood with his tongue, lapping up her womanly juices and stimulating her sex. After a bit of this, he then every so softly gave her clitoris a light nip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara came with a gasp, her juices rushing out unto his face and into his mouth. He drank gladly of her nectar, gulping it down like a man tasting the sweetest of wines for the very first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka did not neglect Notai, though. No, even while he was eating out Katara and lapping up her juices, the strong, handsome warrior also attended to his subordinate's blossom with his fingers. He stroked and plumbed and teased Notai's aching, starved, virgin womanhood, thrusting long dexterous fingers in and out of her gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came around the same time Katara did, and her juices splashed all over Sokka's hand and fingers, leaving them wet and sticky. Smiling, Sokka pulled his mouth back from Katara's pussy and brought his hand up to his own lips. He licked Notai's nectar from his hand, savoring her unique taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flicked his eyes up to theirs, and the girls saw hot animal lust smoldering in his glistening aqua pools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey smiled, knowing what he asked, and silently they nodded, spreading their legs a little, giving him their permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's grin widened, and he stood up. He embraced Notai first, pressing himself into her tight, athletic body. She gasped and moaned and squirmed as he pushed himself in, though he encountered no resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that this surprised him. Sokka knew that Katara had lost her own hymen a few years ago during a particularly strenuous waterbending session, so of course it did not bemuse him that Notai, whom he knew to train as hard as himself, should have also lost her own, even though she was still a virgin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough as Sokka felt Notai's body meld into his, her starving womanhood eagerly taking in and embracing his hardness, he could not help thinking of Tukki as a fool for never touching his wife, never wanting her in that way when she was so beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHungrily, feeling anger in his belly at the thought of the man who had taken Notai as his own, only to neglect her needs, Sokka furiously, passionately mashed his lips against Notai's. She moaned into his mouth as he slipped his tongue between her lips, and he did things to her mouth that she had probably never even dreamed of, judging from the way she all but melted away at his touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai came, and Sokka could not pull out before he came also inside of her. She did not look regretful at this, however -- if anything it seemed to please Notai even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Sokka pulled out of Notai, and turned his attention to Katara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Avatar gladly, eagerly took him inside of her, and Sokka passionately attending to every contour of her wonderful, beautiful body as he made love to her. He thrust in and out her fervently, zealously, making her a woman in the most final and satisfying way Katara could ever possibly conceive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai embraced him behind, as he made love to Katara, but Sokka did not let this break his rhythm. For so long, he had been torn between these two girls, having loved Notai, but having also loved Katara. And he knew, now, how badly it had hurt her, seeing him pine after Notai. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew how much she truly loved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved him. Not as a sister loves a brother, nor as one friend loves another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she loved him as a woman loves a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, Sokka realized, as he joined with his adoptive sister and mistress and charge, that he loved her, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loved them both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they both loved him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka came. So did Katara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came as one. They became one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an instant and for eternity, so everlasting and fleeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey collapsed in each other's arms, all three of them did. They were spent. But they were also content.</span></div></div>",

But, he still was, but not in the way he would have suspected. There was only a one and four chance, just a one and four chance. There were only three women and four men that went on the trip to White Lotus City.

Sokka stood up at the boy's face as he then asked his teacher, \"What are you doing with the Avatar and Notai, Sokka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said the only thing that he could think of, \"I'm calling the Eagle Storkes, magical animals that listen to the passionate noises from men and women. Known as the ritual of calling for the Eagle Stork. And when the Eagle Stork hears these noises it begins to look for a babe in the garden of babes.

I don't want anyone to walk in on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding Notai began to lightly push Sokka while Katara pulled on his cock gently to follow him. They walked out of the spring/spa/sauna as they went up tot the waterfall door. Katara water bent the door opened allowing them to walk through. They walked the halls naked as they went to the kitchen where Katara used her earth bending to raise the floor to the top of the top of the arch way. She had some trouble doing so, but she was driven by her love for Sokka and the desire for privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she fully bent the wall up she hit the ground with her knees as she breathed a bit exhausted. She then turned to Sokka to see his cock as she smiled at it and decided she needed a drink. Since her throat was parched and the essence of Sokka was delicious. Like a rare wine, a white wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips she reached out to his cock as she groped it's shaft. She then licked the head of the cock as she began to swallow it. She pushed her head up sliding Sokka's cock down her throat as she gagged a bit. Katara had never really practiced deep-throating, but the look on Sokka's face was one she wanted to see more of. Shoving her face into his groin she took his cock a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai was using Sokka's right hand to finger her and kiss his lips turning his head to the right so she could kiss him while being behind him. She pressed her bosom into his back, as she rubbed his shoulder blades with her nipples. Sokka felt the nipples dug into his back as he moaned out. As Sokka came down Katara's throat, and she tasted the fine white wine, the wall to the door way crumbled like a piece of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked as there was a wall of dust where stone used to be. Stone came up at Katara around Katara's legs as she was dragged across the kitchen. Stone flew at Notai as she jumped back and attempted to dodge. But, she was grabbed by clay around her legs and slammed into the stone table. The table moved and locked Notai onto it as Katara then tried to bend out of the wall. But she could not as she said out loud, \"Why can't I Earth Bend this stone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph's voice said as her buxom 15 year old trim waist from working out body walked in, \"Because you have much to learn my young student. I used a much denser stone to bind you and Notai to your places. You only know how to bend light rocks and pathetic walls, that and lift a cube of light weight sand stone. So, now that I have you what shall I do with big stock over there, or should I call you Snoozles? Yeah, I like that much better, for snoozling.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Notai and Katara glowered at Toph, struggling futilely against their stone restraints. The earthbender smirked, feeling their attempts to break through. The girls had been foolishly doing some very interesting things with Sokka in the kitchen where Toph could reach them, and the Blind Bandit was very much in the mood to have some fun of her own with the warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery little indeed went on in this house that Miss Bei Fong did not know about, and she was well aware of what all these two had been doing with the studly snow savage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fight it,\" said Toph to Sokka as much as to Notai and Katara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latter two hissed curses under their breath, saying some very rude things about Toph's parentage, personal hygiene, and sexual preferences, but this did not bother the earthbender. Her mother and father were stuck up assholes, she preferred to coated with a healthy layer of earth, and as for her sexual preferences...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she did not care what they thought about that. She was only interested in one thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extremely well-endowed young man was staring at her, and from the way his heart beat and his weight set on his frame, and from the way she could feel his facial muscles stretch across the bones, Toph had a fairly good idea of the disbelieving look he was sending her way. She could also feel the way a certain part of him stood tall and proud, hungry and filled with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph licked her lips as she walked towards Sokka, thinking about what she had felt her pupil and the female warrior doing with this wondrously built specimen of manhood. And also about what this incredible hunk of man had been doing to the girls in return. She had felt their reactions to how he had pleasured and serviced them. She had felt the way they shuddered and came and cried his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnoozles, it seemed, was a very skillful and attentive lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph smirked, beginning to undo her blouse and sway her hips as she stalked up to her prey. With every step she took, the soles of her feet impacting lightly with the stone floor, she got another snapshot of the house and everything in it. And also of Snoozles, which was what attracted the most of her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe perceived his frame best, his skeletal structure tall and hard and dense. He was lanky, at least a little, but his bones were also rather thick, particularly when compared to those of Katara, or even Notai. They were strong bones, bones which had grown larger to accommodate the mass of dense, corded muscle which stretched all across his body. He was lean, perhaps, compared to the sort of thickly built muscleheads that flourished in the Earth Kingdom, but that did not mean his body lacked strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Toph could tell that his muscles were strong ones, and there was much power in his limbs. But he was agile, also, swifter and nimbler than men of the Earth Kingdom, Toph's homeland, were wont to be. He was built for speed as much as strength, and endurance as much as power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was well rounded, by all accounts, exceptional in nearly every way. A renaissance man, a man of many talents and disciplines. He was strong enough, a talented fighter for a non-bender, but he was also intelligent, Toph had observed. He had a sharp wit, when he deigned to use it, and she had found that he was quick to discern purpose and meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph could not remember the last time she had met a man as interesting as Sokka. He intrigued her. She wanted to find out what made him tick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...starting, of course, with his large, meaty dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph let her shirt drop to the floor with a grin, exposing a sizable bosom which her bindings could only barely contain. Sokka could not help his eyes staring hungrily at the generous curve of her breasts beneath the fine, white wrappings, or at the considerable expanse of soft, milky white cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked his lips, which felt so dry, so chapped as his eyes greedily drank in the sight of Toph's chest, and the earthbender smirked at him, and she tucked her fingers beneath the waistband of her trousers. Slowly, enticingly she teased them down her waist, until they rode so low that Sokka could see quite clearly the shock of jet black pubic hair above her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis member twitched, and he shivered a little at the sensations which shot up his spine. He gulped, his throat feeling suddenly quite parched as Toph let her trousers hang there a moment, riding just high enough to cover her most intimate of places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbidden, he found his feet carry him a step forward in Toph's direction. Then another step, and another, until he was practically all but on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was smirking at him, coy and playful and teasing, silently goading him on as her eyes stared sightlessly through him. Those lips of hers, so soft and pale and inviting, seemed to swallow him up, seemed to draw in his gaze until they were all he could see, until the only thing his eyes perceived was that lusty, vulpine smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHungrily, angrily, unthinkingly, Sokka leaned forward and mashed his own lips against them. He felt the young woman's smirk change into a satisfied grin, and then her tongue was wrestling with his, coiling and curling in a sensual dance of blind animal desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands traced figures down his back, describing a teasingly circuitous path from his shoulder blades down to his buttocks. But, then, his own hands were also tugging at the bindings of her breasts, pulling them loose and letting them unwind and fall until Toph's large, soft, shapely tits were bared, exposed. And they mashed so delightfully against his chest, Toph's breasts did, pressing so warmly against his bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost fancied he could feel her heartbeat, feel it synchronize with his own as he lowered his hands to Toph's trousers, yanking them down the rest of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer womanhood was bared now, though, and his own manhood pressed up against it, hungry, lustful, filled with hot desire. Toph, not one to stay back from what she wanted, eagerly slammed her hips -- thick and meaty, but also firm and tightly toned -- against his own, greedily impaling herself upon his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka gasped, a little taken aback at how forward Toph was being, but it did not dismay him, or keep him from fervently reciprocating. He thrust into Toph, quickly matching her pace as the earthbender ground herself on his bone. They furiously slapped their hips together, each ravenously devouring the lips of the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did not make love. There was nothing tender, nothing soft or gentle about this. This was just sex. They were just fucking, each using the other for their own pleasure. Not to say that there was no hint of affection in what they did, but any such traces were simply overwhelmed by the raw lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were hard and passionate, fast and furious and frenetic, zealously fucking for countless long, wonderful minutes before finally coming, finally achieving orgasm at the same time. Their juices mixed together inside of Toph, and she gave Sokka a satisfied smirk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But, I give you my word that the traitors who did this shall be hunted down. My clansmen in the Navy has sent me a messenger Seal Turtle that the Chief ordered his clansmen to erect an dictatorship in his leaving to which he would eliminate and liberate the people to trick you into following him blindly. We know this to be possible as the Chief has be opposed by several political enemies. Most of them gathered here to take them out and stop their plan. But, a last, they did not have the numbers and the blizzard that took them two days ago was too powerful for anyone to survive. So, I, Hahn of the Sword Tooth Tiger Bear clan promise to kill the chief who has deemed you and us unworthy of freedom. As the next one in the chain of royalty I proclimate that there be an election to elect a just leader. For those who wish to oppose me, stand up and walk up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour people walked up as Hahn then said to the people, \"Cast your ballet and let it be drawn, let the moon and ocean decide the next leader of the Tribe until his death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sword Tooth Tiger Bear water bender instructor and Pakku's most impressive student drew from the basin. He pulled out a bone that was in the large basin full of bones with names written on them. As he pulled it out he read on it and lied as he crushed it after reading, \"Hahn of the Sword Tooth Tiger Bear clan is now our new leader, so says the Moon and Ocean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople cheered and threw up their fists. Hahn looking burdened said to the people, \"It burdens me and hurts me to do this. But, it must be done, now that you have elected me by lottery. I shall take your cheers of trust and sent word to the White Lotus City. That the Chief and Princess Yue are traitors and that this is a Water Tribe matter. And if the White Lotus, Fire Nation, Air Nomads or the Earth Kingdom are swallowed by his lies.

With the power of the White Lotus members and my father the Avatar defeated the Fire Lord. Now, ten years later the Avatar was assassinated letting the last airbender die and the world with a doomed cycle of Avatar. Then the Lady of the Moon came to the Southern Water Tribe as the only current tie to the spirit world. Seeking knowledge from the world to find a new cycle of the Avatar spirit. As the Avatar now doubted that cycle of the elements would not last long cause of the benders need to be more powerful than another element. Not understanding that no one element is stronger than all elements. And this is where we begin our story.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka after a bow said to the gathered council, \"Lady of the North, Chief of the South and Elders. I present to you the boomerang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue said to him unimpressed, \"Your idea is a boomerang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda embarrassed, \"Just hear him out Lady of the North. You've heard all others, the least you could do is listen to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue nods as Sokka continues, \"It flies through the Southern Skies, not evil, not good. Just a boomerang, it did not ask for this life, but it lives it none the less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue looks on as she whispers, \"If this were a poem I'd wait until the theatre.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda then nodded as he whispered back, \"He is a bit melo dramatic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka threw down his arm as he then shouted at them, \"Each of you benders is amazing and so great. But, I'm not, I'm just the guy who's regular. But, you need me and I will never turn my back on you. So, don't turn your back on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue shocked with someone, anyone for that matter just yelling at her, decided to hear him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then continued, \"The boomerang is meant to fly and attack, like any warrior. But, the problem is that anyone can pick it up and throw it. But, if you train with it. You become a master with it. If anything all benders that out weigh the regular unamazing guy are all different. Can a firebender master water bending? No, this is why I say that fire and water don't mix. Cause, in reality they do mix, haven't you ever had soup? It's water and fire working together, but you put a bender from each in a room and there will be the steam of war in only 5 minutes. But, no matter what warriors I've met and fought. After a little bit of combat we both realize that we are the same. We're both the regular people that use weapons as our elements. And any person, bender or not, that fights with a weapon will have just as much advantage as another person. So, the my proposal to the next avatar is not to learn the new ways of knowledge, or start the air nomads again. But, to learn the basic tool of man and woman, the boomerang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit of the Avatar then said outloud, \"This mortal is a genius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue smiled as she then said to him, \"Congratulations Sokka you are a genius, I will put you incharge to be the next avatar's teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka shocked complained, \"I'm the guy with the boomerang I didn't ask for all this bending and magic. I just presented this cause my dad asked me too. I don't even want to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue then looked at him as if looking down upon him\" You don't want to serve the Avatar? What kind of warrior are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then explained, \"The kind that protects his people, not the world. If you want to put the world on someone's shoulders. Find the avatar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue then said to him, \"I would if I could, but the Avatar won't be ready for another 16 years. But, if you establish a equal system of weapon for the Avatar to learn then you'd serve the world and your people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then looked at her as he said to her, \"Alright, I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue said to him seeking his advice, \"Alright, so what is the proposed balance to the world of weapons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then smiled as he said to her now that the light was on him, \"There are four classes of weapons like there are four elements. The distance fighter like the Boomerang, my personal favorite. But, then there is the blunt item such as the club my second favorite. The third is blade such as the whaleshark tooth scimitar not my favorite. And lastly, the unarmed combat such as Polar Bear Dog Wrestling that we of the Southern Water Tribe Warriors learn for basic learning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue smiled as she then said to him, \"Very good Master Sokka. Then I have but one assignment for you, find the next avatar. You will be equipped properly and given time to harness your teaching skills among the Southern Water Tribe. Take any means that you deem necessary to complete this task. You have 13 years to accumulate what you need to know to teach the next Avatar in the art of fighting without the aid of the elements. As Avatar spirit has choosen to not be in a child with the elements at their call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then shook his head as water benders looked worried struck. He then asked questioningly, \"Wait, when you say the Avatar will not be one with the elements do you perhaps mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue cut him to it as she said with a nod, \"Yes, Master Sokka, the next Avatar shall be one of weapons and body. They will be learning to harness something anyone can harness but be the ultimate champion. Capable of leading any man, woman or young into battle with confidence behind them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding Sokka then grinned, \"Then, I'll enjoy training the next Avatar for sure. But, I, humbly decline to be the teacher of the Avatar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShock came to Yue as she was about to ask why when he explained, \"I am but one person, from the Water Tribe. Sure, I've mastered the Southern arts. But, what about the Jian Sword of the Fire Nation? What about the true Spear Masters of the Northern Water Tribe? The Hammer wielders of the Earth Kingdom? And other people that use weapons of all kinds. If any thing I could be a master of the basics. But, I would like to search the world for the real teachers of the Avatar. Four people that I would deem to be unique fighters of the world that would open a school and teach students of any origin. Rich, poor, man, woman, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, Water Tribe, talented or not. I want to find the true master of unarmed combat. The true emissary of distance weapons. A true devotee to the blunted and a true veteran of the blade. I am a master of basics of the Southern Water Tribe arts. I know as much about the Boomerang as my dad, no more. I'm definitely no Notai when it comes to the blade. So, I will teach the Avatar the knowledge of the basics and nothing more. That is if life will be a kind enough mistress and let me live to see that day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue nodded as she said to him, \"Then that is your mission, until you find the Avatar or someone else does. You are to find the true masters and learn all you can from them. Then notify them that they are a master. I will make sure word gets out to the world. In the mean time learn all you can here and select your traveling party to go with you on your journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding Sokka then turned as he was dismissed and walked over to a group of warriors. One of them cheered as she ran up to him and tackled him into a hug followed by a noogie. She then pulled back and regained her demeanor saying to him in her velvet voice, \"Good job, captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beautiful girl with shoulder length curly brown hair. She had six hair loopies leading to the back where they collected in a bun that lead to the nice braided tail in the middle of her shoulder length curly hair. Her eyes were steel gray with her lips painted red. She had a healthy c-cup bosom held in her bindings that would be hinted at from her fur tank top. The tank top stopped at her midriff with wrapping going down her waist and above suggesting leading to her bindings. She had fur made arms warmers and had attached long sleeve over her left hand that hid her left hand. Her legs were covered in wool leggings with large fur calf warmers and a blue skirt much like Katara's from the other day with an icon of the front of a wolf's head that was a real wolf's head pelt. She wore a pair of boots that were brown and on her back she had a quiver, with a bow held in a place holder by the quiver of arrows. At her waist was a bone machete with a few animal drawings on it telling a story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he said to her, \"Thank you, Notai. So, meeting at the Chief's hut tomorrow second in command.\"<br>\r\nNodding Notai then turned to six other soldiers wearing wrapping around their necks and lower half faces, \"Tomorrow meeting at the Chief's hut for mission duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six stomped their right foot and took their right fist to their left shoulder. Then they said to her, \"Yes ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking their arm's back down they then went out to their houses. Sokka then looked to the sky as he said outloud, \"Looks like I have a new chapter in my life starting soon.\"</span></div></div>",

Bato was also sitting at the table as they smiled. There were several older men standing guard with scarves around their necks and lower half of their face with a hood. They each held a Battle Club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding behind Hakado were five men that wore a Whale Tooth Scimitar. These five men wore turtle shell shoulder pads and a brown wolf armor helmets. Each goatee with jawline beard and a pair of dread locks on the left side of their face with blue beads at the bottom of them. Other than that they wore fur clothing for warmth like any other soldier that was blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six faceless young men stood behind their commanders, Sokka and Notai. Hakoda then called the pair to attention, \u201cCapitan Sokka and Second of the Arctic Wolf Bat Regiment, Notai. Please extend this to your troops after this, congratulations on clearing that Wolverine Fox problem over on the Jagged Cove. Also, if you could have Somar come up that would be nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the faceless cannon fodder, I mean, one of the six young men of the Arctic Wolf Bat regiment stepped up. He unlike the others wore no weapons on him. Hakoda then said to him, \u201cSomar, please show me your face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar then pulled down his hood and pulled off his scarf. He was a chicken scratch goatee and jawline beard that was barely grown. He had two dreadlocks on the left side of his face that had blue beads at the bottom. His right eye was brown and his left eye was blue. He had a scar up his right jaw in a diagonal direction that went just below the temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp walked was Hakoda as he pulled out a blue blanket. He unwrapped it as he showed a brown wolf helmet. It was brand new and in the bundle of the blanket was a whale tooth freshly polished and a pair of turtle shell shoulder pads. Hakoda then said to him as he placed the helmet on his head with one hand, \u201cFrom this day forward you are the seventh member of the Southern Water Tribe's most sacred pack. The Coyote Wolf Pack, the brotherhood of the Whale Tooth Scimitar. You like a young wolf cub played and fought with your old pack. But, now you have graduated to a new pack, the pack that is above all others. You have practiced with this pack for six years and now have earned your tooth. Now, take this tooth and make the finest Scimitar from it that you possibly can. From now on this is your one true weapon, it is the very thing that shall set you apart from all other soldiers. Be proud brother Somar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar nodded as he put on the shoulder pads and took the bundle wrapping up the tooth. He stomped his right foot then took his right hand and took it to his left shoulder as he said to Hakoda, \u201cThank you chief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda then back to the table as he sat down and said to Sokka, \u201cSokka, Somar is now your third as per your request of promotion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar smiled with the left side of his lips going up where the right side could not making it look like a grin. He had nerve damage in his face obviously. Hakoda then said to Sokka, \u201cAlright, lastly, your next mission Arctic Wolf Bat Regiment. In two to four days time the Princess of the Fire Nation shall be here. You are to escort her and protect her as she observes the Avatar Trainer Training Program. Basically she's here on a assignment to find out what the next Avatar will be capable of by observing the Avatar's future first teacher. And as per Lady Yue's request, she is bringing one of each fighting style to practice sparring with you Sokka. One Yuyan Archer, Yeh-Lu the explosives expert, one chi bender, one shadow dagger fighter and upon her request the best fire bender the Fire Nation has ever produced.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda then dismissed the group as they exited the hut. Somar was patted on the shoulder by each of the members as they each congratulated him. Notai then went up to him as she said to him serious, \u201cJust because you no longer are a bat doesn't mean you are anything special compared to me. I am the second and Sokka is the first. And just because you are a brother of the Coyote Wolf Pack means nothing to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she broke into a smile as she patted him and said to him, \u201cI'm just playing with you Somar, relax. Congratulations buddy, you really earned this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to him as he reached into his waist pack, \u201cI have a little something for you Somar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a bundle as he held it out to him and said to Somar, \u201cThis is yours. I know it looks bad, but I'm a soldier not an artist remember that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar unraveled the bundle of cloth to find a bone made badge. It was bone made badge that had a blue painted wolf bat screeching on it with two whale tooth scimitar facing different directions. It was badly carved, but it was still seen it its image. Taking the badge he placed it on his shirt with the sharp piece piercing the fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said stoically, \u201cYou have earned this badge which I've deemed as the Arctic Wolf Bat Badge of Discipline. For having a honed mind and body to be on the path that very few travel. You had the discipline to travel this path and face it's many trials. We are proud to have you in our regiment. Let you fly ahead now as you soar the night sky with us. And welcome to the commanders position as well.\u201d Sokka then raised his fist as he shouted, \u201cTonight Seaway is on me at Norrick's!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group cheered as Notai then smiled as she knew that this was a great day for her commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><b><i>Fire Fire Fire Fire Fire</i></b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a ship out in the sea was Azula as she sat with Mai and Ty Lee behind her to her sides. She looked up as she peered out. Ty Lee then asked Azula, \u201cAzula, is this Sokka really all that cute as I hear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then replied with a slight growl that was somewhat sexual yet frightful as well, \u201cFrom what I hear he's down right a man with muscles so hard as if chiseled from stone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee then gained hearts in her eyes as she said with a blush followed by a sigh, \u201cOh, hunky, nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\"><b><i>Water Water Water Water Water<br>\r\n</i></b></span><br>\r\nSokka was drunk as heck as he breathed out with rosy cheeks. He was barely able to hold up his posture. Somar was inebriated a bit and Notai was sober as she did not touch the stuff. She knew better than to get smashed the night before possible duty. She was still on her first drink of seaway and wasn't going to go past that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then threw a bone coin across a table as it landed between a girl's breasts. The soldiers threw up their drinks in a hooray. The girl giggled as she wore the skimpest outfit that could be seen on this side of the world. The room was fire lit and rather warm especially with the drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door opened as a soldier then came to a stomp and shoulder touch (From now on, I'm just going to type Salute.). The soldiers of the Arctic Wolf Bats then said to their commander, \u201cAnother drink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then tipped his head back as he took the drink. He hit the ground as he struggled to get up. He then got up and said shaking his head, \u201cAnother drink Norrick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man with missing right arm got another glass out placing it on the counter. He had a wrapping of blue clothe over his right eye. He was tanned with his hair tied in a wolf tail and his left eye being blue. He was a muscular man that wore typical civilian fur clothing. He poured a green liquid into the glass made of ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka put down a bone coin as Norrick then gave him the drink. Sokka then tried to take a drink as the liquid hit his shirt. He then said to Norrick with a slight belch, \u201cO-o-one more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai then grabbed her captain's arm as she pulled it and said to him, \u201cEnough, Sokka, you've had enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her, \u201cNo, I-i-i...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then turned to his left as he vomited onto the floor. He then coughed a couple times as he then said to the barf, \u201cAlright, I think I can have one more for the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai began to haul him saying, \u201cHow about not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai dragged him out and around the hut to another hut. She then walked inside and went to the middle of the room. She pulled up a ice door on the floor and walked down some steps. She dragged her captain into a underground home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dragged him to a room with a Arctic Wolverine Fox pelt made curtain. She put him on the pile of pelt that was on the floor. She then grabbed the blanket of blue cloth and pulled it over him. She then laid down on him to prevent him from getting up. She then said to him, \u201cDon't go anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then eventually fell to sleep as she got up off of him. She then smiled as she went out of the room. She went to a room with a polar dog inside it. She wrote up a note as she said out loud putting the note on a dried skin like paper, \u201cI know chief will understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tucked the rolled up skin that was used as paper into the collar of the polar dog. She then said to the animal, \u201cChief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polar dog ran up the stairs and out the open door that was left open when Notai was dragging Sokka. The polar dog ran for the chief as Notai then said out loud as she sat down with a sigh, \u201cWhen will he find happiness?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Katara began to run in the direction she was pointed as Notai then waited until Katara was out of her vicinity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed as Somar's voice was heard by her, \u201cYou tricked her. You usually help her out, why you being different today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing Notai then said as she turned around and said with a slight peak, \u201cN-n-no reason, just figured that it was a little early for vulgar activities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned back around now the blush died down. She then said to him, \u201cAnyways, what are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning Somar then pulled out his whale tooth scimitar as he presented it to his Second. The hilt was very beautiful made of bone with blue cloth wrapped around it. On the cloth was cut outs of a boy growing up from a burning house. Then killing a bird of some sort and finally joining a group of seven stick figures. With a bat under the seven stick figures indicating his regiment, the Arctic Wolf Bats. The blade had a etch on it above the hilt that was of a forward pointing arrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping Notai said in amazement, \u201cOh, wow, Somar what a beautiful sword. It is sure to be treasured so long as it stays willing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning he then said as he placed it on it's special hoop. The hoop broke with a small switch to it as the hilt went in the hoop and the hoop locked back into place. As he let go the pummel was caught by the hoop thus stopping it from falling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then said to her, \u201cOh, by the way we better get Sokka. I heard that there was a messenger dragon hawk this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai in shock said out loud, \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar then replied to her, \u201cYeah, seems the Princess is early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"><i><b>Fire Fire Fire Fire Fire</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boat pulled in as Azula then walked down to see Hakoda there at the end of the ramp. She walked with six guards and her escorts, Mai and Ty Lee. Azula took a bow as she said to Hakoda, \u201cChief Hakoda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda then bowed to her as he said to her, \u201cPrincess Azula.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood up straight again as Azula looked and asked, \u201cWhere is the Arctic Wolf Bats, I did get their name right, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda nodded as he said to her, \u201cYes, unlike the Fire Nation as you know we name our groups of age related individuals based on the first animal the group slays together. And as leader of the Sword Shark Regiment and leader of the Brotherhood of the Whale Tooth Scimitar along with the current title of Chief of the Southern Water Tribe welcome you to the Southern Water Tribe. Currently, my son leader of the Arctic Wolf Bats is probably hunting or coming back from one. Knowing him he was hungry for meat and couldn't find what he calls fresh in the fridge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula says to Ty Lee, \u201cFind him and teach why it's bad to be late for one's duties. Also, give him a very good glimpse at what you'll be holding in the future match up they requested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee nodded as she took off and Azula then said to Hakoda, \u201cDo not worry, she'll just play with him. No one will be permanently damaged from this.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka was sitting at a fountain as he was eating a freshly cooked leg meat of Wolverine Fox. He then took out a bone coin and tossed it to a woman that was in charge of a fire pit with the Wolverine Fox legs being cooked. She smiled as she put the coin away and served another person some leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then lifted his head as he saw Somar running up with Notai slightly behind him. He saw behind them in the distance was a pink dressed person. It was a girl as he saw the long brown braided tail whipping in the air. She ran at so high of a speed the snow flew up behind her and she did not slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was an expert on the ice that was for sure. Somar and Notai were swallowed up by the snow as the pink clad girl ran past them. She leaped into the air as she dove in with a fist at Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka got up as he said pulling his leg with him, \u201cHey, I'm eating here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee landed as she missed her target and went in for a muscle tap. Sokka was hit in the bicep as his hand dropped his leg. Sokka looked at the leg that hit the ground as Somar then ran to hide. People were walking back as they knew that dropped meat was ruined meat for Sokka. And no one messes with his meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked up with a glare as he said to her, \u201cNo one, no one makes me drop meat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his good arm he grabbed his boomerang as he threw it at her. She back flipped dodging the attack. She then landed and went in for another attack. Sokka kicked the snow up to cover hit escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee then pulled back as she squealed as she then stepped back. Sokka then pulled off his only other weapon he took with him this morning, his club. He then said to Notai, \u201cHey, get the guys, we got an intruder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai began to carry out the orders as Sokka went in for an attack. Ty Lee ducked dodging the club as she then moved up past him. She tapped his shoulder twice as he dropped the club and he fell to the ice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the boomerang came back at it hit her in the neck. She backed up with a long set of coughs. Sokka looked like he was trying to do the worm as he then used the mix of motion, snow and gravity to push him up. He then went in for a kick as she moved out of the way and tapped his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his body as he barely stood. He then went in with his last leg as she went for a tap. But, the snow tripped him up along with his limbs as he smacked her tap with his head. She groaned as she pulled back her hand with a shake as Sokka looked at her. He then said to her, \u201cGood try, but no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee then looked at him as she then said to him, \u201cCute. Alright, time to go again, cutey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka stood up with a limping leg and useless arms. He then glared as he then used the power in his remaining leg as he pushed off and turned his ankle. Ty Lee was surprised as Sokka spun like a tornado. Snow was kicked up with chuncks of ice as he went a bit off the ground. A full body tackle made her hit the ground as she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then realized after the thud what softness was touching his face. Blushing Ty Lee then looked down at him as he looked up. He then grinned as he said to her, \u201cOops, sorry, but good fight. Looks like I won.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouting at first she then felt her right hand could move as she then grinned and said to him, \u201cThink again, cutey.\u201d<br>\r\nTapping his neck he felt a unique tingling sensation as she moved her hand like a puppeteer does on a puppet. He moved up and off her bosom then rolled over as she then tapped again paralyzing him from the neck down. Ty Lee then got up as she then said to him, \u201cI win cutey, now what should I claim for my prize?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then began to try and move as he said to her, \u201cHey, prize? What prize?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping her fingers she then said as she hit her open hand with a fist coming up with an idea, \u201cA kiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then saw him nervous as he said to her, \u201cNo, no, wait hold on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning seductively she bent down as she said to him, \u201cOh, is it Cutey's first kiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a blush and nod Sokka said to her embarrassed faintly, \u201cYe-e-eah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling she then said to him with a lick of her lips, \u201cWell, let me take that v-i-r-g-i-n-i-t-y.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went down as she pulled a couple of hairs passed her ear as she kissed him on the lips. She moaned as she deepened the kiss. She moved a bit as she then licked his lips and pushed her tongue inside. She licked his tongue and explored his mouth as she giggled at his laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai got back as she came to a stop shocked. Azula arrived on the scene as she grew jealous and said with a increase of her voice, \u201cTy-Lee! That's enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee pulled away as she smiled and giggled as she went up. She genuflect and straightened out her clothes as she said to him with a wink, \u201cHawk me sometime, cutey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked away after tapping his neck with her right hand she proceeded to stand up. She walked with a sway in her hips as his head hit the side starring at her round cheeks. She had made his neck turn and yet returned the feeling to the rest of his body with that tap. She then went behind her mistress as she smiled at him with wink to the boy who then got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to Azula, \u201cYou know this assailant? Who is she and as a matter of fact who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to him with a grin, \u201cI am, Princess Azula of the Fire Nation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReeling his head back he then looked at her with suspicion as he said, \u201cIf you are supposed to arrive tomorrow then how do I know you are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to Hakoda, \u201cThis is the brillant man to inspire the Avatar spirit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding he then said to her, \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to Sokka, \u201cWhat do I have to do to prove I am me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then replied to her, \u201cWell the real Princess Azula could summon lightning according to rumor.\u201d</span></div></div>",

That's child's play.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing her arm out she let out a blue flash as lightning went into the sky. Sokka backed up as he saw this and gasped. He then said to her, \u201cThe rumors are true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then looked at her nails as she said, \u201cOf course, I mean I am me and I am awe inspiring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka bowed to her as he asked her, \u201cI suspect that I was late and you sent your best soldier to teach me a lesson in punctuality?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming Azula then said with a pleased voice, \u201cVery good. Now, as my escort in this city. Your first service will to show me my place of staying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka rose up as he saluted and said to her, \u201cOf course, Somar you are with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar came up as the pair walked with Azula and her group of guards to the place she would be staying at. It was a large hut as they went inside and opened the ice door. The stairs led down to an series of tunnels with lovely ice bent carving of animals and vines with flowers. There was enough rooms and kitchens to suggest it was made for a visiting dignitary such as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to Sokka, \u201cI've had a long voyage, I would like you to take me to a room with a fire place. Preferably one with a bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he took her to a door as he pulled the curtain out of the way. He lead her inside as she stopped Ty Lee from entering along with Mai, \u201cGo with this Somar and find your own rooms. I will be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee pouted as she then walked with Somar. Azula then said to Sokka, \u201cYour second duty is to stand guard while I take a nap. You are to be in this room at all times til I wake. Wake me before dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding he said to her, \u201cUnderstood princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then threw fire at the fire place with animal fat covering what little wood there was. The fire began as Sokka then took a pail of animal fat and carefully surrounded the fire. He let the fire spread as he stood up and turned around. What he wasn't expecting was Azula to stand there as if expecting something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then said with a sigh, \u201cWell, get over here, I can't go to sleep if I'm not properly assisted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then looked at her questioningly as he walked over. She then turned around and said to him, \u201cUndo the latch on the back armor and lift up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked Sokka was about to back up as she said to him threateningly, \u201cIf you aren't man enough to simply undo a latch. Then I will remove what most think makes you a man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping his head he then went to her back in the middle and pulled up a latch. Her armor in the front loosened falling forward. She then grabbed it and lifted it up around her head. She then put it on the ground. She pulled the zipper on her front as she said to him, \u201cThank you, now I'm good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka backed up as she then turned around and began to pull the zipper down. Her bosom appeared entrapped in a red bra. She then pulled off the long sleeves after taking off the bracers. She then covering her bosom as she tossed the shirt to him. She then said to him, \u201cSlip it under the 'door' and let the servant know that she can wash my shirt now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded with a gulp as he went and took the shirt to the door. He slipped it under the door as he turned around. He nearly backed up into the door and lost his footing when he turned around. There standing was Azula with her bra off as she said to him as she crawled to the pile of furs, \u201cWhat never seen breasts before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then turned around as he said to her, \u201cI think I will able to protect you better if I look at the only point of entry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging Azula go under the large blanket made of white hamster pelts as he laid on the many pelts of animals. She then said as she tossed her panties at him, \u201cHere entertain me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to accidentally catch them. He tossed them around as he then let them it the ground. He heard her giggle as she then tucked herself in and proceeded to go to sleep. Sokka sighed in relief as he then sat down with his club out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, in the story as I said 10 years ago Katara's mother died and Hakoda's second wife. This would be 90 ASC which would be when Katara was 4 years old and Sokka being 5 years old. The death of his second wife ushered Hakoda, of this story, to leave the Southern Water Tribe to go to war. He and his four regiments of soldiers plus the Coyote Wolf Pack went out to attack Yon Rha's lead ship. They succeeded in killing him by using the morning mist to hide their tangle bombs. Then attacking the lone ship they surrounded the fire benders pushing them into the water thus temporarily defeating them. But, when Yon Rha got on deck the Coyote Wolf Pack personally handled him. On his death he pointed out the source he got the information from about the last water bender. A Coyote Wolf pack member known as Sokkara, the very man who saved Hakoda's life when he was young and was inspiration for Hakoda's son's name, Sokka. Sokkara was dealt with by Hakoda personally in a duel to the finish. The fire benders used their combined efforts of fire bending to launch themselves back onto the ship. But, the fire was so hot on the water that it came to a boil. The boil began to melt the near by glacier enough that Appa awoke. The glacier broke into pieces thrusting the boat on the rough sea. The fire benders were dealt with in the frenzy of the sea and attacked by the Coyote Wolf Pack along with the four regiments. The four regiments were the following named Sword Shark Regiment (15 soldiers the largest regiment with Hakoda being the first and Bato as it's Second), Wolverine Fox Regiment (14 members the second largest regiment), Tiger Seal Regiment (with 12 members) and the Arctic Wolf Bat Regiment (Being the youngest that had 3 members and were ultimately victims to the war.) As explained in the last chapter each regiment is made of members of the same age group and named after their first combined kill. Thus there can be multiple regiments of the same name, but never the same age group as each of the regiments never increase in members. You start with your peers and die with them, that is the way of the Southern Water Tribe regiment system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn 90 ASC the Southern Water Tribe (SWT) entered the war and with the help of the Avatar ended the war 2 years later in 92 ASC. 100 ACS the death of Avatar Aang happened at the hands of escaped war criminal Zhao. Yue was contacted by the spirits and she appointed Sokka to be in charge of learning ways of future Avatar training where the story started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, in the current story there are 5 regiments of troops. The Sword Shark Regiment (5 soldiers), Tiger Seal Regiment (2 soldiers often called the Tiger Seal Brothers), Wolverine Fox Regiment (6 members), Arctic Wolf Bat Regiment (8 soldiers led by Sokka) and Whale Eel Regiment (25 soldiers with Gukki as their first, this particular regiment is considered a baby boomer as after the war ended in 92 ASC the soldiers came home and started to celebrate with their wives. About 9 months later babies were born from the celebration and 9 years later the 25 killed a Whale Eel together. The put in a claim for regiment formation and were approved by the chief.) Each regiment has an age variety of 1 to 3 years with the youngest member in your regiment. Meaning in Sokka's regiment his youngest member is 13 years old, which is one of the canon fodder. Also, in 90 ASC when the SWT left the soldiers said good bye to their wives and when they arrived back there was an increase of Water Benders. Katara the same day as Yon Rha was killed had glowing eyes and water bent a glowing water at the three girls near by. The glowing water hit them and from the cold water came three water benders. Some say that with the death of the Water Bender Killer, Yon Rha, the spirit of Water Benders brought back the Water Benders. There is a group of Water Benders being taught by Katara: Tela, Koi and Kagura (Thank you Soulhope the wolf for making these characters). In 94 ASC, Northern Water Tribe water benders came to the SWT to help rebuild the tribe.</span></div></div>",

He stood with two people standing behind him.  The one standing behind him to his left was Katara and beside her was a different girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was very beautiful with neck long brown hair that was brushed straight.(This link is the hair style of the character <span class=\"clblue\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media2.onsugar.com/files/2011/11/44/4/1711/17118142/cc0ad557a790c238_Short_Hairstyle_pictures_-cute_hairstyle_with_side_bangs.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media2.onsugar.com/files/2011/11/...</a></span>)  She had a unique set of eyes being green and her skin being a light tan.  She was 14 years old with her bosom being hidden by her parka.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the entrance of the cavern were two soldiers in wolf armor.  They each had a stone made axe and shields.  They stood at attention ever vigilant.  They were older gentlemen with the body build of soldiers past their twenties.  They were the Tiger Seal brothers, different color eyes one having blue the other having gray.  One had long hair and the other had a wolf tail.  The most notable difference between the two was that there was a missing left ear to the one that wore his hair in a wolf tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara then said to her as Sokka grabbed up his club, \ufffdAlright, we'll begin to bring the crates with us out of the Meat Cavern.\ufffd  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka began to walk with his club at the ready for anything.  He exited the cavern with the pair of water benders behind him.  They walked with their arms twisting and turning as the crates slid behind them.  Five soldiers were waiting outside the cavern as they then surrounded Katara, Sokka and the girl.  The group advanced and walked with the three as Sokka protected the pair of water benders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 3 hours and 6 breaks the group got outside of the main settlement. The large two pillars of ice with a large wall of ice surrounding the settlement stood at 30 feet tall.  The convoy walked into the village as they came up to a 4 polar dog pulled sled.  Bato by it as he went over to hug the girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then pulled back as he said to her, \ufffdOh, Tela, how I missed you.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed as she was hugged in front of Sokka she backed up and said to him, \ufffdOh, father stop it.  I had Sokka with me, I would have been fine.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBato then said to her serious, \ufffdTela, I've told you before, you are a water bender.  You have more power than you think you do.  There is a reason we don't have water benders in the regiments and in the battalion.  Master Pakku has been teaching you along with your battalion.  Now, I know Master Pakku has not agreed with our methods of letting women water benders fight, but he has adapted to our customs as long as he is here.  So, don't ever think that you are worthless without a man.  You are just as powerful if not more.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara then asked in curiosity, \ufffdThen why did we need all of the Arctic Wolf Bat regiment with us?\ufffd <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBato then said to her with a reply, \ufffdSafety in numbers Katara.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crates were loaded up onto the sled as Bato then got on his sled.  He then said to the group, \ufffdAlright, I'll see you later.  Tela, your brother has went to morning practice with his regiment.  I'll be back at sun set.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBato took off as Sokka then turned around to the Arctic Wolf Bats.  He then pointed to three of them, \ufffdBatorick, Tel and Mukka go home for the day.  The rest of us will head to Princess Azula's hut for 4 hours to relieve Notai and Somar.  Then Somar and Notai will come back to relieve Mukki, Bokka and Hakoda.  Five hours after that I will be relieved with Notai by Batorick and Tel.  Somar will leave after two more hours to be relieved by Mukka.  They will be on guard duty for 5 hours and will be replaced again by Somar and Notai.  Then the process starts over again.  Alright?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group nodded as three of the canon fodder walked off to relieve themselves for some time.  Tela then said to Sokka, \ufffdHey, Sokka do you perhaps want someone to come with you guys?  To help you recharge your energy?\ufffd<br>\r\nSokka then thought it over as he then said to her, \ufffdSure, if you want to come with us for a couple of hours that would be nice.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTela gasped as she smiled widely when suddenly Katara feeling jealous said, \ufffdOh, Tela, I forgot today you'll be aiding Koi and Kugura in bending practice today.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTela then looked at Katara as she said confused, \ufffdOh, really, well when is it?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara then said with a bit of a grin, \ufffdIn 30 minutes, so you might want to go get Koi and Kugura soon.  I'll go with Sokka in your stead.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry but obedient Tela then said to her, \ufffdYes, Katara.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTela left with an angry step as she went to go do her duties.  Sokka then said to Katara, \ufffdAlright, shall we go?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Katara then hugged his arm as she said with a slight blush, \ufffdOf course, Sokka.\ufffd<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><i><span class=\"cred\"><br>\r\nFIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE </span></i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar was waiting with Notai in the main hall way.  He was polishing his scimitar as he took care of the blade.  He was sitting on a block of ice as he was rather bored.  Notai then saw Azula exit her room as she then said to Notai, \ufffdNotai, right?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai nodded as she said to the princess, \ufffdYes, Princess Azula, are you needing something?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to her, \ufffdJoin me in the hot spring, I would like a girl there to guard me.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai then said with a question, \ufffdWhy not your personal guards?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to her, \ufffdBelieve it or not, Ty Lee is more handsy when in situations such as bathing and Mai is busy arranging her weapons.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai nodded as she then said to her, \ufffdYes, princess I shall join you in guard duty.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai followed the princess as the two entered a large doorway at the end of the long hall way.  The pelt of a Clouded Leopard Lion was moved out of the way.  The pair walked inside as the Azula then asked Notai, \ufffdCould you get the latch on my armor?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai pulled up the latch as Azula began to pull off her armor.  Notai asked her a question, \ufffdWhy do you need help with the latch?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then replied to her, \ufffdPushing it down against a wall is no problem.  But, the latch serves the purpose of protection.  If I was ever attacked by an enemy in the back the latch would be covered by a armor plate sliding over it.  In the unlikely case that I was captured this would protect me from a rapist.  The latch keeps the chastity suspender in place.  I can't be too careful with my maidenhood.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding Notai said to her, \ufffdThat makes sense.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula began to taking off her cloths as she approached the pool of water.  As she bathed in the hot water she sighed feeling the heat on her body.  She then looked at Notai as she said to her, \ufffdGet in.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarmed Notai then said questioning, \ufffdUm, I'm not capable of guarding you in the water, besides I have nothing to wear.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then looked at her as if she was dumb, \ufffdYou are a girl in a bathroom for a visiting princess and you are the second of your regiment.  I wish to better know you for future trade agreements and relations between our two people.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai then said to her avoiding the subject, \ufffdWell, I'm not really the type of status of which you refer to.  I have no connections to trade or politics.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then said angrily, \ufffdI'll inform your first of being unwilling to obey an order and to suggest disciplinary actions.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai began to take off her clothes as she took off the wool under clothing and bindings.  She let out her double ds as she breathed a lot easier.  She got in the bath as she was ordered to.  Azula stared at the bosom of the other woman angrily as the water got hotter.  Notai then said curious, \ufffdDid the water just get hotter?\ufffd</span></div></div>",

Somar had his scimitar aiming as he said to Sokka, \u201cPresent name and rank of which regiment you are apart of?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said as he saluted, \u201cSokka the first of the Arctic Wolf Bats Regiment. I am here with Mukki, Bokka and Hakoda. You are relieved of duty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara then waved at Somar, \u201cHey, Somar, how are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar smiled as he said to her with a light blush, \u201cKatara, how are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara said with joy, \u201cJust being with Sokka, so where is Notai?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of how enjoyable (suggested by her grabbing his arm and staring at him dreamily) Somar lost his smile as he said grumpily, \u201cShe's with the Princess in the bath room. Sokka, permission to be dismissed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said as Somar left after being dismissed, \u201cSure, see you in a little while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to Katara, \u201cKatara come with me please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring and taken by his charm, \u201cOf course Sokka.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka walked down the long hall to the leopard lion pelt. He then said to her, \u201cCan you go in there and check on Notai's guarding post? I want to know if she needs to be relieved?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara looked at him suspiciously, \u201cAre you trying to peep at the princess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked at her and said as if it was obvious, \u201cIf I wanted to peep, I'd just pull the door open and look. Not send you in to make sure everything was decent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara then nodded as she walked in. Azula sunk lower immediately as she asked Katara, \u201cWho are you and what are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara then bowed as she said to her, \u201cI am Katara, I am here to let Notai know Sokka is here to relieve you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai nodded as she said to Katara, \u201cLet him know we'll be out just as soon as the princess is ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to Katara relaying that order, \u201cForget that, get him and his pecs in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara then looked at Azula jealously and said to her, \u201cAs the princess wishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara walked out as she said to Sokka, \u201cShe wants you in there, the princess bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka said to Katara, \u201cDon't worry Katara, yesterday she had me guard her while she slept naked.

Sokka looked back on how he got this mission in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\"><u><b>FLASHBACK FLASHBACK </b></u></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was standing with his back to Azula in her room.  She had brought with her off her ship a changing wall.  As she waited behind it in the nude she fire bended the fire inside the room.  The room was nice and warm with the fire going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA servant girl came in as she carried Azula's armor and clothes.  She assisted the princess with getting dressed.  Azula then said to the servant, \ufffdKeep my armor and belt, I do not wish to wear it today.  It will only get in my way of today's activities.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant nodded as she walked out.  Azula came out from behind the changing wall.  She wore a long sleeve red top with a pair of brick red pants.  Her blood red boots with gold lines stood out.  A knee long skirt of brick red was worn under her lighter shade of red top.  Around her waist she wore a dark gold belt with bright gold buckle in the shape of a flame.  Without her chest plate her perky b-cup bosom was more visible instead of hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then said to him, \ufffdAre you ready?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he then opened the door for her.  The pair then walked out as Ty Lee and Mai could be seen standing on the other side of the door.  Azula smiled at her friends as she then said to the pair, \ufffdI will not be needing your assistance today.  Thank you though, how about you two take the day off and do whatever your heart desires.  I will have my assigned Southern Water Tribe guardsmen with me today.\ufffd<br>\r\n<i><b><span class=\"cgrey\"><br>\r\nPRESENT PRESENT</span></b></i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka walked as people starred in his direction looking at the visiting Princess.  This was her fifth day here and she had not seen the town.  She had all her food brought to her from her ship and it was the food she brought with her from the homeland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula noticed how some people with their hands being held by one another.  Azula then made it a point that she would get the same behavior.  She grabbed Sokka's hand as he looked down at their joined hands as he asked her, \ufffdWhat's up?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to him as if he should know, \ufffdI need to be in close proximity to my guard.  So, I'm making a link of constant awareness of my presence.\ufffd  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded accepting the lie, \ufffdRight, alright makes sense.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then let out a growl as she looked down and blushed embarrassed.   Sokka then said after his stomach growled right after hers, \ufffdI think our bodies are telling us it's time to eat.  Come on, I know the perfect place.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair walked up to an igloo as they went inside.\ufffd There at the enterance counter was a pair of women.\ufffd They each wore typical swt parkas and long fur made skirts.\ufffd They both had a three hair loopies on the right side lead to the back.\ufffd Where they met and were weaved into a bun.\ufffd On the hair loopies were blue accent beads to bring further collective stares to their faces.  One woman had black hair while the other had light brown hair.  Both had blue eyes and wore light blue eye shadow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then grinned as he talked to the woman on the right that was clearly twice his age. He then raised his brows and lowered them as he asked her, \ufffdKaguma, it's been so long since I've had the rare opportunity to take in your beauty that is challenged by the snowy morning on Jagged Cove's very own Hill of Kya.  Incidentally could you get me and this lovely guest a table?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling she then said to her, \ufffdOf course, I will get Kagura for you.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguma then walked away as Sokka then flirted with the other older woman.  While Azula had to listen to this as she felt rather jealous that she wasn't paid attention to.  She was beautiful and perfect, her fire bending was grand and her skin tone desirable by everyone in her homeland.  And yet, Sokka did not pay her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon a young girl that was Sokka's age came out.  She was of light tanned skin with blue eyes.  She wore her hair the same way as her mother (Kuguma) and had small set of accent bead in her hair loopies.  She wore a thin blue robe of fur with white trimmings and white sash.  She wore a wool under one piece as could be told by the short sleeves and access to cleavage showing white instead of skin.  She had a nice pair of breasts, slightly bigger than Azula's.  Which peaked her interest, did every Southern Water Tribe girl have a big rack?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to the new girl, \ufffdKagura, how are you doing?  I was wondering if you could get us a table?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing and giggling with a turn of her head Kagura said to him, \ufffdOh, Sokka.\ufffd  She then straightened up as she said to him, \ufffdOf course, please follow me.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka walked with Azula and Kagura walking in front of him.  She shook her butt as she walked.  She put a lot of work in dragging Sokka's eyes to her ass.  It was rather jiggily, a little too jiggily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair arrived at a table made of entirely of bone as could be told by skulls and claws here and there.  It seemed slightly off putting to Azula, like you were eating with the grim reaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka pulled out a chair for Azula as he said to her as he sat down, \ufffdDid I do it right?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula looked at him questioningly as he clarified, \ufffdPulling out your chair, did I do it right?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula still confused said to him slowly, \ufffdYes, why do you ask?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka relieved said to her, \ufffdOh, well that's good, that was the first time I've ever done it.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then asked him, \ufffdWhat do you mean, is it not customary to pull the chair out for the lady in the Water Tribes?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her as he looked at the dried skin made menu, \ufffdNo, it may be that way in the North. But, not here in the South, you only do stuff like get the door or pull out a chair if one of your wives is in carriage.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to him in question, \ufffdOh, so you all do things differently here?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he then said to her, \ufffdBy the way, I know this place the best.  Shall I order for us?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling she then said to him with a nod, \ufffdYes, go ahead.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then ordered from Kagura, \ufffdI'd like to order the finest seaway you guys have.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagura wrote something down as she asked him, \ufffdWill that be the Gukkira's, Notari's or Kagurama's?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her with a grin, \ufffdWhy drink Notari's when I can just get that from the bar?  Sides, Kagurama's is a much more casual seaway.  Please, bring out the best bone you have for it.  And also, please bring me a skin of milk.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then asked Sokka as the waitress left, \ufffdYou all have pig cows?  I didn't think there were any here.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked at her slightly funny as he said to her with a shake of his head, \ufffdOh, no, no, no.  We have our milk produced by pregnant or recently delivered Polar Dogs.  Its very nutritious (Any mammal produced milk is capable of human consumption, so this is not weird.  As the information provided is that Polar Dogs a descendant of Polar Bear Dogs are domesticated.  And domesticated animals is where you get the milk from.) actually, you know other than a woman's milk I don't think I've had any other kind of milk.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula looked at him weird as she then said to him, \ufffdNo offense, but ew.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then looked at her perplexed, \ufffdWell, I got a question for you then.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula figured that she had asked several questions so he deserved one.  She then said to him in reply to his question, \ufffdYou may ask.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said as the waitress came back delivering a small bone bowl with icy water inside with a skin, \ufffdYou know what they say, when in ba sing sae do as they do.  So, why not come to our tribe with the same mentality?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at him as the waitress put down a pair of small saucers for drinking with a large bowl of near clear liquid.  Floating on the top was a piece of fish.  It was true that when you go to the Earth Kingdom before and after the war that you followed the customs of the natives.  And vice versa when you went to the homeland.  Plus, it seems all her advances on the boy were at a loss compared to these floozies.  Perhaps, if she were to be treated like a woman of this tribe by him he would like her.  Azula then said to anwser his question, \ufffdAlright, we'll do things your people's way.  For the entire day, I want to be treated as if I'm from this tribe.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her with a smile, \ufffdAlright, in that case I'll order for us.  Kagura could I get four boiled arctic hen eggs, a dozen shrimp crab, a tuna salmon steak for each of us, a large bowl of Five Flavor Soup to split between us, a pair of wolverine fox legs for each of us and finally a boiled tiger seal as the main course.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagura nodded as she went to go get the foods ready.  Azula was double checking the menu as she asked him, \ufffdUm, Sokka, I've looked over this menu twice and I see no vegetables or fruit.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then replied to her question, \ufffdOh, well that's because, we don't often get that.  Plus, cooks like this place don't often get enough honor to trade those kinds of things.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then asked him, \ufffdReally?  Well, why is that?\ufffd</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka then explained, \u201cWell, before the war there was plenty of trade with whale tail island, visiting air nomads and even Fire Nation merchants. But, the war has badly crippled the trade business. As a matter of fact, before I was assigned to train the next avatar. I was going to take volunteers with me to help reestablish trade agreements to get things like wood, stone and other materials that could be used here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food came out as did utensils that were brought out. Each of them was presented an icicle and bone made spoon. Sokka took his icicle as he stabbed the steak as he used his other hand to hold it down. He pulled on the icicle as he torn up the meat as Azula stared at the food. It was a lot for two people, looked more like a feast than a simple lunch. Two eggs were peeled as they were given to Azula on her bone made plate. Six skin peeled shrimp crab were presented to her and it was cooked. It was a small animal about the size of hand that had two claws and the body of a shrimp. Kinda like the Earth Kingdom crawdads, only more red instead of muck brown. There was a whole mid life slain tiger seal in the middle. Kagura used water bending to cut some meat off it and place it on a plate. The food was all evenly divided and the soup water bent into two bowls. Kagura then took the skin and poured mild into the two bowls on each side of the table. Then in the small saucers was water bent the clear liquid from the bowl with a fish fillet floating along it's top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka lifted his saucer into the air as he said to Azula, \u201cHere's to you living like a tribes woman today. And by the way your hair does look good when you have it down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then smiled as she blushed lightly as she lifted her saucer as well. She then took a sip of the liquid as she then coughed and said nearly spitting it out, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her as he gulped down his seaway, \u201cThe closest thing we got to Fire Water. It just takes some getting used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said as she took another sip, \u201cThis is nothing like Fire Water, it's just terrible alcohol.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then took his icicle as he stabbed the fish fillet and said about to eat, \u201cIf you feel that strongly about it, then you won't mind if I eat the tentra tentacle fish fillet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then looked at him as he bit into it and hummed. She then took a bite of her food while grabbing the icicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to admit, with the limited resources this land had. At least their meat was good. Even if that's all this entire food was. But, what really got her was the wolverine fox leg. It tasted spicy, why did it taste spicy? She then asked Sokka after he downed his leg, steak and two eggs, \u201cHow is the leg spicy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then gulped down from his milk bowl some milk. He then said as he sighed out, \u201cFrom spicy seaweed, its a rare kind of seaweed that grows near Hakoda Ice. It grows along with the tuna salmon and matures from them. From information of the Fire Nation, tuna salmon go to the Fire Nation. They eat some of the food that ends up in the water such as pepper and other spicy things found there. Then when they come back to lay eggs their bodies dye after taking a shit. Thus becoming fertilizer and the sea weed grows to be spicy. It's the cycle of life at work and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate her leg quietly as she listened to him. She then took a drink of milk as she gulped it down. She then asked him a question, \u201cSo, who pays for the meal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka just downed his fifth saucer of seaway as he said to her, \u201cWell, the girl does of course. The guy hunts for honor and give about 3/4s of it to the girl. As men with honor tend to spend it on useless junk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to him as if catching on, \u201cLike drinking too much. Alright, I can part with some 'honor' as you call it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the pair were done eating Sokka went up to the pair of ladies at the counter. He had left three bone made coins on the table. They were painted blue and white, in different shapes. Two of them were rings of blue with a white interior and very deep in design. The third was a diamond shape with a white diamond on the inside of a blue border. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula reached into her skirt pocket as she produced fire nation currency. She then asked the pair of ladies, \u201cWill this work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the coins and then looking at the girl. Kaguma then asked Azula, \u201cWhat is this? This is not honor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula looked at it and asked her, \u201cSilver will not do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then reached for his pocket. He pulled out a small animal skin bag. He opened it and poured out several water nation bone made rings, diamonds, coins and triangles. He then said to Kaguma, \u201cThis what we got my lovely Kaguma, how much is it again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguma then said to Sokka as she lightly blushed, \u201cIt was 4,000.35 honor, Sokka and by looking at your honor I see that you have more than enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka took some pieces as he then placed them by the lady's hand. He swept the rest of his money into his bag and put it away. Azula walked with Sokka outside as she asked him, \u201cWhat was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked at her, \u201cWhat was what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to him angrily, \u201cThat whole display, why didn't you tell me they don't take silver? And what was up with you giving her all those weird things that I assume is money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her still a tad bit drunk, \u201cListen, we don't have money like you people of the Fire Nation. We have what we call 'Honor Bones', and that means that the bones not used for weapons or medical purposes are crafted by Gukkiri the local honor maker. They are then used to trade for things or you can barter items and food for services rendered by cooks, bars, weapon smiths and other services.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then asked him, \u201cHow does one get these Honor Bones then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then pointed at the only entrance to the settlement as he said to her, \u201cYou hunt for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to him as she had a flame appear, \u201cWell charing an animal shouldn't be too hard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka pushed her hand down dispelling the flame as he shook his head. He reached for his boomerang as he held it up. He then said to her, \u201cYou hunt with this, you know the thing that the Avatar will be using in 10 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula was baffled as she then asked him, \u201cYou expect me a perfectly fine fire bender to kill an animal with a barbaric weapon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then nodded as he said to her, \u201cYup, if you cook the meat in the snow it will attract predators like Saber Tooth Lynx Badger, Arctic Wolf Bats, Jagged Cove Devils, Arctic Goat Civets, Coyote Wolves, Wolf Lions, Wolverine Foxes or the worst a lone Polar Bear Dog. Plus, there's no honor in bending against an animal. And Gukkiri can spot a bent animal with the best of them. So, it's kill them with this or something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to him, \u201cAlright, we're going to need a lot of honor I suppose. I'll send for Mai and we'll be set.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka shook his head as he said to her, \u201cNope, there is no honor in summoning a fellow who you have given the day off to go honor hunting. And as a hunter, I am obligated to speak the truth when presented it. You also have to tell the chief that you are honor hunting. So, he can send a note to Gukkiri to anticipate your arrival.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to him as she began heading to her current place of staying, \u201cIf I'm going hunting with a weapon, then I'm going with what I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sokka waited he saw that Azula finally exited as she had on a chest belt not. It was fire red with yellow flame designs on it. It had many shuriken knives in pouches on the front side. She then said as she walked with him, \u201cLet's go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he walked with her. As the pair prepared to exit the settlement, after they talked to Hakoda, Sokka looked as Azula pulled her hair into a simple pony tail. The pair then went out onto the snow as they began to go hunting for honor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sokka was holding an wolverine fox carcass as he pulled his bone boomerang out of it's neck. The boomerang had an stone edge as he held it and put it away after cleaning it. Azula was huffing and puffing, she had scratches on her legs and a long gash on her right arm that could be seen through a white fur bandage. She looked super pissed as she said to Sokka with a yell, \u201cWhy do you hunt such dangerous animals? It's like everything wants to kill you out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her, \u201cAzula, you have to realize something. The main land of the Southern Water Tribe is a giant barren ice berg. It has no soil, no wood, barely any stone and all ice. Plants don't grow here, they grow in the sea. And all the animals that live here survive on what lives in the sea and off the ice. Anything that moves be they people or another animal is all fair game for them. They'll attack to kill to get their meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization hit her as she asked him, \u201cSo, wait, this is what you have to deal with everyday? The possibility of dying and becoming a meal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he knocked the head of the freshly killed animal, \u201cYup, just like this guy.\u201d Sokka then stood up as he wrapped the animal in a pelt. The pelt had four animals inside it as he tied it up and tied the remaining strap to his belt. As he walked the meat sack was dragged with him as he had Azula follow him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe too had a pelt meant to carry meat as Sokka called it, but she hadn't struck the killing blow to anything yet. It was one thing to fight people, they had methodology and logic behind their attacks. Plus, most humans held back from killing each other less it was war or personal. But, these animals were rabid and reckless willing to risk their lives for food. But, she had to gain honor in Sokka eyes. Plus, if everything went well and he saw her as a beast of power maybe he would ravage her body with kisses and sweat. She shivered from the arousal as she walked with him. She was down to her last shuriken knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka pointed at the shore as he said to her, \u201cLet's go to the shore, there might be something a little easier for earning today's honor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula hated to admit it, but going for something easier right now would be preferable. It was her first hunt after all.<br>\r\nAs the pair got closer to the beach they found a couple of napping tiger seals. She was already told that a sleeping animal often meant a starving animal. Which would have bad meat and would be full of sickness. These two tiger seals had scars all over them and were barely resisting the leech flies that were attacking their body. In a few days they would be each a home to hundreds of the parasitic insects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair moved on until they found a Pangolin Fisher as it was eating on a fish. It was rather big and full of honor. In Azula's eyes this thing was just as honorable any animal. According to Sokka if it kills then it has collected honor and by killing we gained honor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula knew that this animal only attack people to protect its babies and catch. It was not big enough to hunt people, so the amount of honor it would bring her would be low. But, she was willing to get that honor none the less. If she wanted to be treated with respect she had to earn it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then threw the shuriken dagger with precision as it hit the neck of the animal. The animal immediately dropped and rolled into a ball as a defense. Azula cursed her luck as hit it, but barely. And now it was not going to unroll until the danger was gone. It wasn't attacking them, so obviously it had eaten earlier and was in no hurry to eat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then stopped as he listened for something. He then pulled out his boomerang as he untied his meat sack. Azula knew that the meat sack was untied for two reasons. Hunting and loading up meat, and they hadn't killed anything in the last hour. So, that meant that there was a hunt about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then grabbed his club with his other hand as he got in a wide stance. He then said to Azula, \u201cAzula, I want you to run, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula looked at him as if he was crazy, \u201cRun? Run from what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said as he pointed with his club, \u201cThat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the horizon was a white female wolf lion. It had the size of a wolf, but stalked like a lion and had the long tail of one with powerful legs. The ears were triangular and ever listening with the eyes ever vigilant. The maw of the best was long like a wolf snout. There was a second one that was coming up on their left. They had them partially surrounded, the pair of females knew that the water was cold. To cold for the humans, leaving them only one course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her as he took his stance at the ready, \u201cThis will bag me a lot of honor. Go and get to safety.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said as she was a little off put, \u201cAre you crazy? You have a club and boomerang, what are you going to do to them? Wave around like crazy and attack them with blunt weapons?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her in question, \u201cIf you have another idea, be my guest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said proudly as flames came from her mouth, \u201cFire bending, screw honor, this is survival of the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then looked at the situation as he then said to her, \u201cAlright, fine, but only on these girls. We'll register them as meat, but only melt the ice. If they get cooked then it will only attract more trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula nodded as she then ran up and threw her fist out. A blue flame went as it hit the hill of ice behind the lion to their left. The ice melted as water hit it and the animal shivered after getting wet. It growled as it went in for a charge. It knew that the wetness was going to be the death of it now. It might as well kill this meal and eat one last time before death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka threw his boomerang as he went into the battle with the wild cat. The other wolf lion ran away after seeing the prey make fire. It was not going to stick around for that. Sokka took the club to the wolf lion's jaw. The animal was thrown for a loop as it roared and attacked him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boomerang came back from it's miss and landed in Sokka's hand. He swung it at the animal just in time to hit it's skull down the middle. The animal got in a swipe at Sokka's leg as he groaned in pain. He pulled his leg up as Azula then screamed firing fire at the animal, \u201cSokka!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka knowing what would happen hit her arm up to avoid the animal. The animal hit the ground as it began to die. It tried to get up as the boomerang broke apart. Sokka glared at it as he remembered how his father gave him that weapon. He had given it to him as Sokka formed his own regiment upon his father's return from the war. The boomerang had served him well and it went out with one of the most deadlist of animals of all. It had perished in honor as Azula then picked up the club and smacked the beast up the neck. The animal's neck snapped as it laid on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then went over to the Pangolin Fisher as she smacked it around with the club. She was determined to bring honor to herself in Sokka's eyes. He just saved them from more possible trouble thanks to her over reacting. The animal died eventually after several blows to it's outer scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then grinned as she put the animal in her meat sack. She then wrapped the other animal the one that damaged her Sokka in the meat sack as well. She tied it around her waist as she had tied Sokka's meat sack to his belt. She had him lean on her as they walked back to the settlement.</span></div></div>",

She began to heal his leg as Tela went up to Azula. She began to heal the shallow gash on her right arm. Azula felt a little better as she then hit the snow with a rest. Ty Lee ran up as she talked and checked on her friend very worriedly.

There were other people getting checked on by the benders. But, the two had suffered enough of an injury that they got to rest for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee came to visit as she brought with her two blue dyed pelts. She smiled as she presented them to the pair. She smiled as she said to the pair, \u201cYour guys pay, by the way Azula why didn't you use your fire bending earlier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then reacted differently than expected as she said back to her, \u201cWhere's the honor in that? I mean, the pangolin fisher is rather harmless against a fire bender. It would be vastly unfair to kill it with fire. Plus, I only used fire bending on the ice for the wolf lion. It was not worth burning alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee then smiled as she said to her, \u201cAlright, still here's your bones. Hope you enjoy them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to Ty Lee, \u201cIf you could give my bones to Azula that would be nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then looked at him in confusion as she asked, \u201cWhere is the honor in giving me money a princess of a nation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka said to her in reply, \u201cThere isn't, and I'm not. I'm paying you services rendered for saving my life. It should be enough to pay a healer's bill, and I would not be paying Katara's if it wasn't for your determination to get me back. So, I'm paying my savior's bill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then grinned as she then said to him, \u201cAlright, I'll take half of your money and your free time tomorrow. I want you to still show me the customs personally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding Sokka then said to her, \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sokka breathed in the smoke as he grew loose minded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the world around him became like an ocean. He was sinking as calmly tried to not drown when Raava appeared. Sokka opened his eyes in the spirit medium with Raava. Raava then spoke to Sokka as he listened to her, \"Trainer of the Avatar, who have you decided should be the first weapon bender in the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then replied to her, \"I don't know many people in the world and feel as if I should travel the world. But, I do know that the first range weapon bender should be Mai of the Fire Nation.

It had been a couple days since Raava informed Sokka that she was sending a lion turtle, to give Mai her new bending, and it was do any moment. The greeters consist of Sokka, Azula, Ty Lee, Mai, Notai, Pinga, Yue, Katara, Hakoda, and Bato. The group soon saw it in the distance its shell pristine and clean, its strong legs pushing thousands of gallons of water with each movement. The turtle soon made it to the beach and crawled up to the villagers. Turns out the lion turtle was only about the size of the average sea turtle, being about four feet long and about a foot tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cgaaahahahhahahahahahha.\u201d Sokka ever the tactful diplomat falls over laughing at the tiny creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you laughing at?

I remember when he was nine and I took him on his first hunt. He chased an otter penguin that bit him on the nose into the ocean. We thought he drowned when we did not see a sigh of him half an hour, when the Sokka emerged from the sea holding the penguin over his head like it was a sea serpent. He was beat to hell and got his first scar but boy was I proud of him. But don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll step in before the two kill each other.\u201d Hakoda tells the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYue did you hear me?\u201d Hakoda asks worried when she did not reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe war veteran looks at the Princess worried. He sees Yue staring at something with her eyes clouded with lust and drooling coming out of her mouth. Hakoda looks at were Yue, Katara, Azula, Mai, and Ty lee, Notai, and Pinga were all looking. Turns out Gamera burned a hole in Sokka\u2019s pants showing his very large dong to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I feel small.\u201d Hakoda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe to. We should probably stop Sokka and Gamera before they kill each other. Then we run like hell after covering up Sokka. I feel the girls might try to kill us for hiding their eye candy.\u201d Bato tells his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood plan. My late wife made me this coat so we will cover Sokka up with yours and I\u2019ll buy you a new one later, deal.\u201d Hakoda tells Bato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal. On three.\u201d Bato tells Hakoda with a grim expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two count to three before rushing Sokka and Gamera. Bato removes his coat and covers Sokka as he pulls the boy off the lion turtle. Hakoda then picks up the surprisingly heavy turtle and places him in front of Mai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the girl Sokka chose to be the first long range weapon bender.\u201d Hakoda says before running like a little bitch with Bato away from the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men would proceed to gather there hunting gear for a last minute honor hunt.

Sokka, could you meet at my room in a few hours so we can discuss plans for my tour around town.\u201d Azula tells Sokka a seductive look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Azula and Yue leave for Azula\u2019s lodgings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I need to go get some new pants on so latter Notai, Pinga. See you around.\u201d Sokka said with a smile as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you still have the double ended boner you made the only time you got drunk?\u201d Pinga asks Notai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I do why?\u201d Notai asks curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t normally swing this way, but it seems it would be easier on us if we were comfortable with other woman along with a man. It seems to me, it would be easier to join the budding harem Sokka is unknowingly developing, then fight against it. That way we will be able to keep some of the other harlots Sokka will meet away from him. So how about we share the last bottle of the first batch of seaway I made and test out that boner together.\u201d Pinga says with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me, let\u2019s do this at my place since mom\u2019s well you know. And there is no way was doing that with your perverted little brother nearby.\u201d Notai says with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay is a bit of a wild woman and may be able to teach use a few tricks is what you mean right?\u201d Pinga asks still blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, so lets go get that seaway and go to my place.\u201d Notai says blushing bright red.</span></div></div>",

She dropped her weapons as she then breathed and shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai then decided to trust her instincts as she lifted up a hand and one of her shuriken floated up from the snow to her hand. She then snapped her arm and threw the shuriken with a fast velocity. The shuriken went as he mind desired, around the ice and struck the fracture in the ice where the melting made it weak. Shattering was the pillar made of ice as it fell apart and Mai grinned. She liked this new power of predicting on the weak points of objects. No, it wasn't that she predicted it, it was as if the weapon showed her it's tactical advantage.

Pinga pulled the cork off the skin as she grinned at the drinking of it's contents. The pair began to share it and Pinga 'accidentally' spilt some on Notai's shirt.

At age forty and having raised a kid she still had a nice, fit, trim body, and her long curly brown hair had no gray yet. Her large E-cup tits were still high, firm, and caped with large brown nipples. Her milk chocolate was flawless like her daughters. May had long toned legs and her large heart-shaped ass was a bit bigger than her daughters do to giving birth but smaller than Pinga\u2019s big round ass. Between her thighs was a nice diamond shaped bush. Clasped in May\u2019s left hand was a strap on boner about two inches smaller than Sokka\u2019s cock. May was a cultivator who tended a kelp field and sea cotton field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was proud of her daughter for becoming the first female hunter since the hundred year war. She also always ware dark blue lipstick opposed to her daughter red lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice club you got there Pinga and I\u2019ll take that skin.\u201d May say as she takes the water skin form Pinga, the club she was referring to was the shape of Pinga\u2019s bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay takes the water skin which was still about a third full and chugs the strong brew down easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was the last of your first batch right Pinga, I recognize the taste. Now get over here Notai.\u201d May says before she kisses Pinga on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the strap on boner mom?\u201d Notai asks her mother before taking one of her mother\u2019s nipples into her mouth. The alcohol taking away any inhibitions Notai may have had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm that\u2019s right suck momma\u2019s big tits, you two Pinga. Hmm that it, good girls. I brought the strap on because you two want to fuck Sokka. So I thought I teach you to suck a big, fat, juicy cock, take it down in one go and suck the tasty cum out of it quickly. I did see the show from where I was fishing earlier and Sokka is about two inches longer in my estimates and maybe an inch wider. And girls Sokka seem the type to like it when girls talk dirty when fucking. \u201d May says as she holds the two girls heads to her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay also enjoyed angling with a rod and reel in her spare time.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks momma. We know the one of the three princess are most likely going to get to Sokka virginity. So we need to be ready to out fuck them for the top spot.\u201d Notai says without taking her mouth form her mother\u2019s nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlay with my cunt girls. You aren\u2019t going to get any pleasure until you make my big fat MILF ass cum. Play with my clit as well. \u201d May moans out as the two girls fallow her instructions and each girl inserts a finger may\u2019s cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou still have a tight little cunt momma.\u201d Notai says with a smile as she kisses her mother slipping her lounge into mays mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinga feeling bold gets onto her knees and starts sucking on May\u2019s clit well Notai fingers the older woman. May brings her left hand down and pushes the girls face into her sopping wet cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck that\u2019s a bold girl. Oooowwww Tui, I\u2019m fucking cuming.\u201d May yells as she cums squirting all over Pinga\u2019s face after breaking her kiss with Notai.</span></div></div>",

So I propose a competition, when Sokka comes here we take him to this bed and fuck him until we pass out. The last princess to pass out or is fucking him when Sokka passes out will be declared his, I believe the term is alpha female. Besides I think it would be good for us to rebel against are daddies, by giving are virginity\u2019s to that fine specimen of a man that is Sokka.\u201d Azula tells Yue with a naughty smile on her blushing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two princess had spent a bit of time together during the few weeks they have been in the South Pole.

Her large b-cup tits are caped with large light pink areola and nipples. Azula\u2019s waist length black hair was out of her normal bun and offered a nice contrast to her pale creamy skin. Well Azula did not yet have much upstairs she did have a nice large-heart shaped ass and wide child bearing hips that tapered off into long toned legs. Sokka could see that Azula\u2019s bush was trimmed neatly into the fire nation symbol. Sokka also easily noticed the slight six pack on Azula\u2019s smooth toned tommy as any water tribe man would. All and all Azula was an athletic beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Azula was Yue wearing blue silk stockings and garter belt she picked up on a stop in Kyoshi Island during the trip to the South Pole. Her large borderline e cup breasts were caped with only mid-sized dark brown areola and nipples. Yue white waist length wavy hair was also out of its normal braids and offered as nice a contrast to her rich brown skin. Yue had a large peach shaped ass with thick thighs and legs. Under Yue\u2019s smooth tummy was a well-trimmed patch of white hair shaved in the water tribe symbol showing that her carpet matched her drapes. Yue possessed a more movie star like beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding together the two were like yin and yang. Sokka watched the two girls turn around and show there equal sized bare asses and moist pink pussies. Sokka could just make out there hard clits as well. The two start shaking there asses for his enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhm should I come back when you to are finished getting dressed?\u201d Sokka asks as he watches the jiggling flesh of the two girl\u2019s asses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think we would be shaking are asses for you if we wanted you to leave.\u201d Yue says looking over her shoulder, before she water bends the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point.\u201d Sokka says in pain do to the confinement of his large cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we should free Sokka of his clothes.

Yue and Azula were trying to untangle themselves as Azula finally just fire bent a hole into the fur as she torn through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka slammed with his biggest swing yet as the wall broke with a hole. Yue now free ice bent it to be repaired. Sokka turned around as he lost his victory grin and saw the pissed girls. They were horny and cock blocked by the biggest cock in the room. Azula then said with a hot breath, \"I'm only going to ask this once and pray that I'm wrong. If you say yes, then it's no big deal. It was just the way you were made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka replied knowing what she was going to ask, \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then shouted, \"THEN WHY THE AGNI DID YOU FUR TRAP US!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka breathed in as he readied himself and said with a whisper, \"It's cause I'm a virgin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to him, \"What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka threw his arms down as he said to her, \"I'm a virgin.

So, what is he talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue then explained, \"In the Water Tribe, during the boy's first time. The mother instructs him on how to have sex, often taking his sexual virginity. While the father takes the boy on his first hunt losing the hunting virginity. Sometimes, when the mother dies, another Water Tribe woman instruct the boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then said to them, \"Then everything is solved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka rose a brow as he asked her, \"How's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula pointed at Yue, \"She's water tribe right? I mean just looking at her bush says so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked at her bush and then averted his eyes blushing, \"Your point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula smiled like the cat owl who ate the canary gerbil, \"My point is, we'll solve this a little bit of role play. Yue will play your mother and I'll play as the girl that you are going to take the virginity of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue smiled at this as Sokka seemed as if this wasn't a good idea. To make sure he would succumb to this idea Yue shook her head and put on a motherly smile. She then said as she walked up behind him, \"Sokka, my son, would you mind stripping for mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka decided that he might as well lose his virginity some time. So he nodded as he began to unbutton his coat as Yue wrapped her arms around his waist from his back. She began to undo the knot to his pants flap. Sokka's cock flopped out as she pulled his sash off and let his pants fall. Sokka's coat was taken and then his shirt was lifted up above his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula was by this time lying in the furs as she looked shy. She then said to him, \"Oh, Sokka. Please be gentle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue then said to Azula, \"Don't worry my darling, I will show Sokka how to pleasure a woman. So says mommy.\"</span></div></div>",

Yue pulls herself forward more before taking Sokka\u2019s big cock between her girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour tits are so soft Yue.\u201d Sokka moans as he feels his dong enveloped by her massive mounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHay no fair.\u201d Yue says as Azula engulfs the head of Sokka\u2019s cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThoo sllowww.\u201d Azula says with a stretched grin since her mouth full with the head of Sokka\u2019s tasty meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you two are a naughty pair of princesses, especially you mommy.\u201d Sokka groans as he places his hands on the girl\u2019s heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lovingly rubs their heads as they work to get him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck I\u2019m cuming mommy.\u201d Sokka yells as he cums into Azula\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula is surprised when her mouth is quickly filled with Sokka\u2019s thick ball cream. So she pulls off and his next shot hits Yue\u2019s left cheek before she manages to clamp her mouth on the head of Sokka\u2019s cock, getting a big mouth full cum. Yue pulls of Sokka\u2019s cock and the last sprit of Sokka\u2019s cum lands on Azula\u2019s right cheek. Yue gives Azula a mischievous look before kissing her. She slips her tongue into Azula\u2019s mouth which was still full of Sokka\u2019s spunk. Azula getting the idea begins to cum swap with Yue. Sokka watches in amazement as the two girl\u2019s trade his cum between each other a bit of semen spilling from their lips. The two girls soon pull back and swallow the cum in their mouths before licking the others face clean. They then kiss again repeating the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka not wanting to wait anymore untangles himself form the girls and gets behind Azula well she and Yue are swapping his load. Sokka lines his big, cum and spit covered cock up with Azula\u2019s small cunt and gently starts pushing it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOOO Agni fucking shit your cock is huge. Don\u2019t worry I broke my hymen learning to do the splits a few years ago, so stop going slow and just ram your big fat cock all the way tight little cunt, wreak me for any other man. But give me a moment to adjust to it since it\u2019s fucking huge.\u201d Azula yells to Sokka, she then pouts when she realized Yue got all the remaining cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour wish is my command Azula.\u201d Sokka whispers into Azula\u2019s ear before shoving the remaining eight inches of his cock into Azula\u2019s tiny pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck I\u2019m cuming just form you ramming it all the way in.\u201d Azula screams out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you can\u2019t pull your big cock out of Azula until you fill her cunt up.\u201d Yue says with lustful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I think in a bit of a voyeur.\u2019 Yue thinks as she looks at Azula\u2019s stuffed cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard your mother, start fucking me.\u201d Azula says with a smile before kissing Sokka over her shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201cFuck that feels amazing fuck, fuck, fuck. Harder, fuck me harder, Sokka.\u201d Azula screams in pleasure as Sokka starts ramming into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looks at Azula\u2019s jiggling ass as it impacts against his pelvis. Getting an idea he spanks her right cheek hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck I cuming again from your big cock and you spanking me keep it up keep, paint my ass red.\u201d Azula moans as Sokka hits her ass again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYue who was fingering herself gets a kinky idea. She sits in front of Azula and spreads her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should pay tribute were Sokka came from, by eating his mommy tiny little cunt out.\u201d Yue says with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should, fuck, get use to eating pussy too.\u201d Azula says before she leans down to lick the other girl\u2019s cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck that\u2019s it Azula eat my fucking tight little cunt stretch it out so Sokka\u2019s cock can fit a bit better.\u201d Yue moans as she grasps Azula\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula gets an evil idea as she starts sucking on Yue\u2019s clit. She reaches her hand around and grabs a handful of Yue\u2019s big ass before slipping a finger into her anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck that feels good mommy\u2019s cuming.\u201d Yue screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck I\u2019m cuming, I hope you\u2019re ready because I\u2019m going to fill you up Azula.\u201d Sokka grunts into Azula\u2019s ear before unloading into her pussy, all three lovers cuming at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Sokka pulls out of Azula, his cock still harder then steel. Sokka then picks up Yue and slams her gently into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready to get fucked hard, mommy?\u201d Sokka asks Yue staying in character teasing her by rubbing the head of his cock against her soaked cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe genital I still have my maidenhood intact.\u201d Yue tells Sokka before he simply shoves himself all the way in. <br>\r\nHe was thinking it was like relocating a shoulder, it hurts less if you don\u2019t know its coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck that hurts please be still for a bit.\u201d Yue screams in pain, but it did not hurt as much as she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cgaaaa.\u201d Sokka says as Azula bites his right ass cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm seems you like a little pain Sokka. Tern your mom around when she is ready I want to try something kinky.\u201d Azula says before kissing Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes my Fire Princess.\u201d Sokka says breaking the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready so start fucking me now.\u201d Yue says before Sokka kisses her turning around so his back is resting against the wall well he starts pumping into Yue\u2019s now wrecked pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula smiles before she spreads Yue\u2019s lager ass cheeks looking at Yue\u2019s anus with an evil smile. Azula then shoves her tongue into Yue\u2019s pink anus wiggling it around as she rubs the other princesses\u2019 rock hard clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck keep eating my ass out Azula and oooohhhh, Sokka fuck me harder.\u201d Yue screams she cums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka and Azula double team Yue for another fifteen minutes before Sokka unloads in Yue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer it cums mommy, your son is going to cum in your pussy.\u201d Sokka says as he cums Yue doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments pass Sokka walks the panting but still awake Yue to the bed and sets her down before pulling out of her. Sokka grabs Azula and spins her around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you want to get fucked this time? Do you want it in your pussy again or do you want to get fucked up your big, fat, ass.\u201d Sokka whispers into Azula\u2019s ear as he hotdogs her big ass.</span></div></div>",
