She was likewise a very kind, caring and thoughtful soul who always put others before herself, supported her friends, and held an unconditional love for the people of the world, even showing compassion to enemies. Because she never got down to earth, Maria was interested in it and wished to see it. She was as well very encouraging as she could make others accept themselves and calm others when in stressful situations, including Shadow.<br>\r\nMaria was one who found it easier than most to forgive and forget, not to mention trust. Even after GUN violently raided the ARK and shot her, Maria did not hold any ill will or grudge towards the people on earth and only wished them to live happy lives. She was also was utterly selfless as she ultimately sacrificed herself for Shadow's sake, having faith he would carry out her dreams for her.<br>\r\nDespite her youth and frailness, Maria was brave, determined, and had a strong sense of righteousness.

She is a Zeti and a member of the Deadly Six. When Dr. Eggman came to the Lost Hex, Zeena and the other members of the Deadly Six were forced into serving the doctor due to the effects of the Cacophonic Conch. After Sonic the Hedgehog arrived and got rid of the conch, Zeena and the others rebelled against Eggman and took control of his forces. Afterwards, Zeena followed Zavok's plans to make her and the other Deadly Six stronger by using Eggman's Extractor, while destroying Earth, but was ultimately defeated by Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, that was broad. Could of put any Deadly Six member really. This is going to be a big description chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAPPEARANCE!<br>\r\nZeena is a green female Zeti, with a slender upper body that curves out into fairly wide hips. Zeena's upper body is lime green with two black stripes around her waist, while the lower half of her body is black. Zeena's small feet are tipped by small lime green claws, with a third smaller one on each heel. Zeena's tail is thin and curly, ending in a chameleon-like swirl (similar to Espio's tail). Her wrists have black stripes around them while her five-fingered hands are black, each digit tipped by a hot pink nail.<br>\r\nZeena has long green hair that parts to the right, extending down to her lower legs. On the left side of her head Zeena has a single curved horn with an alternating black and hot pink coloration. Her circular eyes are surrounded by black rings, while her eyes are blue with yellow sclera and yellow-orange eyelids. Zeena also has orange lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPERSONALITY!<br>\r\nZeena is a feisty, cold-hearted, and cruel person that lacks initiative. She is very selfish and thinks highly of herself, preferring to look after herself first and foremost by treating herself with time to do her own things regardless of the issues at hand, but she is not very likely to look after anyone else. Despite this, she can be persuaded when she receives compliments about her attributes, such as when she agreed to fight Sonic after Zavok complemented her speed, smarts and looks. Regardless of her lack of dedication though, when out on an assignment, Zeena is very serious and committed to the task at hand and will always complete it.<br>\r\nZeena is very vain, being very focused on her outward appearance. She frequently takes care of her looks and is very protective of it, especially her nail art, and does not like having it ruined. Her concerns about appearance also extends to others, as she will criticize others' fashion sense. She is also somewhat flirtatious, trying to allure Sonic, flipping her hair, and even moving her hips while walking. Despite showing a lady-like composure most of the time though, Zeena has a terrifying temper and is not shy about showing it.<br>\r\nLike the other members of the Deadly Six, Zeena is inherently malicious and violent. She takes enjoyment in inflicting pain, torturing and killing others, and she has no problem causing massive genocide or widespread destruction for her own gain. Also, when Sonic was horrified and angered by seeing Tails turned into a robotic slave, Zeena further mocked and taunted him for her own amusement. She is also rather vengeful, given that once Zeena was freed from Eggman's enslavement by Sonic, she launched an attack on the scientist with the others, and when Sonic insulted her, she wanted to severely punish him for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah. Another non-basic description, this time one that tells so much about this girl. And while she is the NEWEST girl from the main Sonic games and universe, there is now the newly American created (and not yet released as of November 2014) Sonic Boom universe and sub-franchise. That was overall a mistake.</span></div></div>",

She is an anthropomorphic jungle badger and a force of nature in every way. She has spent most of her life living alone and flourishing in the wilderness and is as such new to friends in general. After meeting Sonic and his friends, however, she forms a strong bond with the group, particularly with Amy Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticks is energetic and rather primal, like a wild animal. She has sharp animal instincts and is a fearsome combatant and tenacious hunter. Because of her isolated life, Sticks has become a little quirky, eccentric and thinks others are living in an alternate world. In spite of her background, she is intelligent, though her manner of speaking comes off as strange to other people as she speaks in a primitive dialect she taught herself.<br>\r\nSticks loves spending time in her burrow and returns to it for safety when a situation becomes too bizarre for her.<br>\r\nBecause of her wildness, Sticks' social skills need plenty of work. She is not the most trusting individual and is full of outrageous suspicions (which are always proven right) and senses danger everywhere at all times. While the concepts of sharing, compassion, and friendship are foreign to her, Sticks has a good heart and a genuine desire to get closer to Sonic and his friends, and is fiercely loyal to them. However, this also creates an internal struggle for her; on one hand she is not sure she can handle the life outside her burrow, but on the other hand she loves her friends and wants to hang out with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to see how she looks like since I didn't describe her appearance, remember, Google.</span></div></div>",

Just sigh.<br>\r\nAnd we are at our last female Sonic character.<br>\r\n\"Awww\" you say.<br>\r\nI would have to agree in some way, as Sega has stopped making new Sonic characters for the games for a while surprisingly. If there will be new female characters, I will be shocked a bit, but not too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo at this point I had to dig up a character that was never created, but rather planned to be in a cancelled Sonic game for the Sega Saturn. Yeah, we obscure now boys 'n girls! (also remember that I usually take these descriptions from other websites)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiara was developed to be a spunky female protagonist who could match Sonic the Hedgehog in attitude. Christian Senn later admitted that, should she have ever materialized completely, she would be a \"girl power\" character. She varied from the typical \"damsel in distress\" seen in the Sonic the Hedgehog video game series. Senn's first sketches were stick figures. From there, he created an initial design that deviated from a real Manx in the same way that Sonic deviated from a real hedgehog. He states that the similarities (both in appearance and personality) between Tiara and Princess Sally Acorn were unintentional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of four color designs were created for discussion purposes in 1995. Each retained the same basic facial and hair designs, but varied in terms of clothing. Proposed designs included a form-fitting red dress, a tank top with miniskirt, and a midriff-bearing version of the former. A design featuring no clothing changed her fur pattern. For the second to last design, Senn used the midriff-bearing design using a red and yellow color scheme. However, Michael Kosaka envisioned the character as having more attitude, so Senn changed her accordingly. Along with her stance and visual demeanor, her clothing style changed dramatically. She was given tight pants, a bikini top, and tennis shoes. Additionally, her hair was shortened. Chris Senn felt this design conveyed her attitude, but after the game was cancelled he admitted that her original, cuter design was his favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a tradition you two always did...but this year things were going to be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you walked up the porch and entered the house, you saw Toriel standing in the living-room, wearing her special dress: it had long sleeves, a skirt that fell just past her knees, and it was such a deep shade of blue that it was almost black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround her neck was pair of gleaming pearls, and thrown over her shoulder was the strap of a white handbag. The strong but sweet smell of roses came from her, and you knew she used her expensive perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyebrows raised slightly in surprise. You knew very well what this meant: Toriel was going Someplace special, and this also meant (which was rare) that you weren't going to be taken along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where and why was the most important questions here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel turned and noticed you. \"O, hello there, my child,\" she said in her typical kind voice, smiling, \"I'm glad your home so soon from the shops. O, is that your present? Go put it under the tree, my dear. Where am I going? Don't you remember, child? I'm going on a date with Asgore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like slapping your forehead. Of course! How could you have forgotten? She'd been talking about it for the past week now. Apparently Asgore had invited her to his house for dinner. It was his attempt of getting her back, but you knew that Toriel was uninterested, only doing it because she didn't want him to feel bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry that I can't take you along, but you know how dates are: there's only room for two and no more,\" she said walking towards the closed door, opening it just when there was a knock on the wood, revealing Alphys and Undyne on the other side, dressed in warm clothing. \"I really didn't want to leave you alone tonight, that's why I took the liberty to get you a babysitter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO, the irony! You braved the vast expanse of the Underground, fought off creatures that wished to harm you, escaped Boss Monsters that tried to capture you and harness your soul, and defeated not one but two nearly invincible entities, but still you needed someone to look after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guessed that overprotective caretakers were overprotective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup there, kid,\" greeted Undyne, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" said Alphys timidly, \"Are you ready to decorate that tree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted up a transparent, plastic bag, which clearly showed colorful lights bulbs, a golden star, and other Christmas decorations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and waved your hands in greeting before you nodded at Alphys in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo then turned to Toriel. \"I'm so glad you were able to look after Frisk tonight,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem,\" said Undyne<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Toriel said, \"I guess I'll be off. Goodbye, my child, behave yourself well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood on the porch and waved as Toriel drove away. After that, you went inside and spent the evening with Undyne and Alphys, decorating the tree and...well, that's it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel's absence had the ability to dull the mood. It wasn't that you found it boring to hang out with the two; in fact, you liked spending time with your old friends, but it just wasn't the same without Toriel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou retired early, not even staying for the Christmas special they had on TV. Jumping into your blue pajamas, which ironically had pictures of yellow flowers on them, you climbed in your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawned and fell asleep, thinking that you'll be woken up by Toriel the following morning or find a slice of pie next to your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't come home that night.</span></div></div>",

Looking through the window that stood just opposite of you, you saw the rolling snowy hills, its beauty intensified by the rising sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit there, rubbing the sleep from your eyes, a thought suddenly entered your mind: today was Christmas, and it filled you with Determination!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaunching yourself from from the bed, you dashed out of the room in your pajamas, not even bothering to put on normal clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first destination was Toriel's room. She would still be asleep this time of the day, and you always enjoyed giving her a rude awakening by jumping on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, like yesterday, things were different again; when you entered the room, you saw that Toriel's bed was empty and already made up, like no one even slept in it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit concerned and surprised, you shrugged it off, thinking that perhaps she got up earlier than you did, and she downstairs, waiting to surprise you with a camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you reached the ground floor you saw that she wasn't there either. Instead, sleeping on the couch was your two babysitters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snot bubble was inflated and deflating from Undyne's noise as she snored softly, and Alphys was snuggled on top of her, sleeping soundly, a grey blanket covering them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpread out over the table, you saw, was DVDs depicting colorful cartoon characters of numerous anime TV series and movies. You guessed they spent most of the night watching these before they fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were debating with yourself if you should wake them up, for you really wanted to open your presents and you didn't want to do it alone, but you also thought that it would be rude disturbed their slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your pondering was suddenly interrupted when you heard the sound of a car pulling into the house's driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise had an obvious effect on the sleeping couple, for they woke up, and Undyne asked: \"What's all the racus. I'm trying to sleep here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think Toriel's back home,\" said Alphys just when the sound of a car's door shutting came from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" exclaimed Undyne, \"She's been out all night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door, and you went and opened it, revealing, as expected, Toriel on the other side, but she did not look so fresh as she did last night: her fur looked ruffled, her dressed wrinkled, her pearls she wore last night were missing, and she looked tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were alarmed by the condition Toriel was in, but when you attempted to ask her what happened, Alphys, who got up from the couch to greet her friend, beat her to it, exclaiming: \"O, my! Toriel, what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" said Undyne, \"And where the hell were you last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" said Toriel, trying to calm everyone down, \"I'm perfectly fine. My car just broke down and I was forced to stay at Asgore's. I'm very sorry that you two had to wait the whole night for me, and, Frisk, I'm also sorry. You were probably worried sick about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and hugged, indicating that there was no hard feelings and you didn't mind it at all, but you could tell that there was something that Toriel was hiding from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" said Undyne, smiling, \"How was it staying with King Fluffybuns? I hope you survived the entire night with him begging you to get back together with him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, it wasn't bad staying with him for the night,\" said Toriel, attempting to smile friendly, but it looked more sheepishly, and you swore that you saw a faint blush come to her cheeks. \"He gave me a lot of space and even my own bedroom, so, it was rather okay night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me for asking this,\" Alphys suddenly said, \"But how did you get the car fixed so fast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel seemed to grow nervous when she heard that question. \"O-o...umm...Asgore is quite the technician. Can you believe it? H-he spent all night fixing it for me. How convenient, hey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait,\" said Undyne, \"Asgore is more of a gardener type of guy. Why would he want to get his ha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was suddenly cut off when Toriel zipped behind the couple and pushed them out the door quickly, saying, \"You all must be very tired. I bet you two really want to go home now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wai-\" Undyne tried again, but she gently shoved them out the door, closing it in their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun on her heels, saying to you, \"You probably want to open the presents now, don't you? But just excuse me for a few minutes while I wash up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that said, Toriel left, going straight to the bathroom. You were a little confused at what just transpired.

Seriously, you had to ask her to make clothing that displayed something else that did not remind you of Flowey. It almost felt like that accursed flower had to have the last giggle, making you see its shadow everywhere you went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, it was just a few days after the New Year that Toriel began to display odd behavior: on certain days she had the most bizarre taste for food (seriously, who eats Snail Pie with ketchup, mustard, and ice cream?\"), and on other days she had out if control mood-swings, such as her being so happy that she didn't care when you accidentally broke one of her antique plates, or her exploding in fury when Papyrus left a coffee stain on her kitchen table, threatening to incinerate him, or when she burst out in tears when Sans told her a joke with a sad plot but with a funny punchline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some morning, while going to the bathroom, you would find Toriel hanging over the toilet, throwing up. She would say she'd just caught a stomach bug, but she was feeling much better now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were growing very concerned. Pondering for many days, you tried to diagnose Toriel's odd behavior, but you just couldn't figure out what's going on.

It was late, and you were heading down to the kitchen for a glass of juice, but when you stumbled into the room, rubbing your left eye, you spotted Toriel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently she had been complaining about how it was too hot for her, ten spite the fact that it was still winter, and she traded her traditional clothing for a white, sleeveless dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why it wasn't odd when you saw that Toriel was dressed in nothing but her underwear. It was then that you noticed some big differences on her, differences you could never see because of the puffy clothing she wore: her breasts was swollen, her erect nipples pushing against the fabric of her bra, and her belly had a slight, but noticeable, curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was busy making her ketchup-pie monstrosity when she noticed you standing in the room. \"O, hello there, my child,\" she said, \"I did not expect you up this time of night. Did you want anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pointed towards her swollen belly, and Toriel looked at it with shock, as if noticing it for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-o, that?\" said Toriel, growing nervous, \"It seems that I'm gaining a little pudge.

We got caught up in the old days, the days before when we were still together, living happily with our children, and I got sad, allowing a comforting kiss to go way too far. I slept with him willingly that night, and now it would seem that I carry his offspring ones more. O, Frisk! I'm not sure if I'll be ready to have another child, especially after I lost one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear the worry, the sadness, the distress in her voice, so, you moved in to hug her tightly. It seemed to help her, for she calmed down and hugged you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, my child,\" she said, \"I must stay Determined. I can make it through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, snuggling into her soft belly, and for a brief moment you could have sworn hearing the beat of the fetus' small heart inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The months passed, and Toriel's belly got bigger and bigger as the fetus developed inside, pulling at her spine, causing her to jut out her belly as she walked, resulting in a cute waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her breasts swelled also as more milk filled it, and was still a prominent feature even when she went back to wearing her old dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nipples, alongside her bellybutton, which popped out somewhere during the fifth month, pushed against the fabric of her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a quiet day, during early July, Toriel would often go sit outside on the porch on her rocking chair, caressing her soccer ball-sized belly, watching the tree on her front lawn blooming and enjoying the feeling of the cool breeze brush against her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she did this, you would come outside, placing your hands and ear against her stomach, trying to hear the baby's heartbeat and feel its kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was so peaceful...until Asgore found out about it. Toriel didn't want him knowing anything about her condition, so, she made everyone promise not to tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone, you didn't know who (perhaps it was Papyrus; he had a big mouth and nasty habit of allowing secrets to slip during a conversation), told Asgore that his ex-wife was expecting, and that the child was his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, you had to admit that Toriel was only delaying the inevitable. Asgore would have found out about it sooner or later, for she ignored his phone calls and letters requesting for another date, and the fact that she took work leave from the school she worked at was suspicious enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he did next was to be expected:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on a rainy day, and you were keeping busy in the living room drawing pictures using crayons. Toriel was sitting on a sofa nearby, wearing her glasses and reading a book, her feet resting on a soft footstool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery now and then she would pause and give her swollen belly a tender rub, groaning softly, most likely feeling the baby's uncomfortable kicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a car stopping in the driveway disturbed the relaxed mood, and Toriel sat the book down on her lap, saying: \"Now who might that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later there was the sound of heavy footsteps on the wooden flooring of the porch, followed by a few knocks on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting Toriel to rise to her feet in her current state, you answered the door for her. On the other side was Asgore, his burly figure looming over you, his hair and clothing looking a little wet from the pouring rain outside, but he was luckily under the porch's tin roof now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, hello there, Frisk,\" he said in his typical deep voice, \"Is Toriel here? I need to speak to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and went to get her, but you saw her coming to the door anyway. You stepped aside, allowing her to confront him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, it's you,\" she said, her kind attitude dropping when she saw who it was, glaring at him, \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toriel!\" Asgore cried, a big, but sheepish, smile appearing on his face, \"You've gotten so...big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to pretend that was a compliment,\" she said, her eyes closed, frowning as she tried to conceal her frustration, stroking her belly. \"What do you want Asgore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"Alright, Toriel,\" he said, \"But before I say anything, may I come in? It's kinda cold out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Toriel, folding her arms, \"We'll talk in the kitchen. Do you want some tea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great, thanks,\" Asgore said, stepping inside, \"Next to pie baking, you always had a magnificent skill at making tea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't try to flatter me, Asgore,\" Toriel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally you were against eavesdropping , but this conversation you had to hear, so, you hid behind the corner leading to the kitchen, catching a peek into the room whenever you dared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kettle was steaming and Toriel took it off the stove, filling the cups of tea with boiling water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Asgore when he received his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel sat opposite to him at the table, blowing her cup cold first before speaking to him. \"So, what do you want to talk about?\" she asked, already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About all this,\" said Asgore, gesturing towards her pregnant belly, \"Why didn't you tell me that you were expecting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you care!\" Toriel snapped, \"It's your fault all this happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I care greatly, Toriel,\" said Asgore with a serious tone, looking offended, \"You know me better than that. We were ones married, and you know me as a compassionate father, a person that cares.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel looked away, a guilty look crossing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toriel,\" he said, stretching out his big hand and taking her smaller one in it, \"The child you are carrying is mine also, and face it: we need each other now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToriel then did something very unexpected, something you've never seen her do: she began to cry softly, salty tears spilling over her eyelids and soaking her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, Toriel,\" Asgore said, quickly rushing to her side and hugging her, her thin body practically disappearing in his thick arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't try to push away, but she buried her head in his muscular chest, still weeping softly, her sobs rocking her body. Asgore tried to calm her down, shushing her and saying kind things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while before she finally calmed down, and when she did she said in a a voice so low that you had to strain yourself to hear: \"I-I never wanted another child. I-I-It feels like I'm replacing Asriel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not, my dear,\" Asgore said, \"We're just...having another baby, that's all, another child to look after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never would have guessed that we would get back together this way, Fluffybuns,\" said Toriel, pulling away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't called me that in a while,\" Asgore said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked in each other's eyes for a few moments, and then they kissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that this was the start of a new beginning, and you smiled.</span></div></div>",

Mostly because you programmed me to say that every time you say you have a new plan,\" Orbot says, snarking at Eggman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A Few Moments Later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, I'm ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Doc, that was a quick, uhh, freshen up,\" Cubot says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's not that hard nor takes that long to get ready for the day,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>In Amy's House</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no I still need to fix my quills, and which outfit should I wear?

Oh nonononono, where is my boots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Back at Eggman's Base</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, while thinking of how I can defeat Sonic, I thought of one major flaw in my plans. My Egg Capsules,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Egg Capsules Doctor?\" Orbot asks, \"What is the problem with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, inside the Capsules are the animals I take to later turn into badniks. Problem is that Sonic always releases those animals before I get a chance to turn them into robots in the first place, and that makes me so angry, that for the longest time I stopped using badniks, only to use them again and still fail to take them before he releases them!\" Eggman screams to the heavens with eternal rage and madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, instead of having the animals inside a capsule to later be turned to robots, why not have robots inside the animals?\" as Cubot said that Eggman was ready to smack him upside his head again with Orbot, but while he had Orbot in the air he stops and thinks about what Cubot just says and lets go of Orbot, causing the poor robot to fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes Cubot of course, let the animals become carriers of the badnicks! Good job Cubot,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why shucks Eggman, I'm just happy to hel-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad I thought of it and happy to help, of course you are,\" Eggman interrupted as he walks away to his work bench and proceeds to work on the blue prints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I thought of...\" Cubot says, completely confused on what just happened,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry Cubot, you should feel lucky. Sometimes when the Doctor comes up with a plan that was not originally his own, he BLOWS up the one who did to make sure the original person who made the idea wouldn't dare claim it to be his, be it they survive. Plus he gets cranky when he hasn't had enough sleep,\" Orbot says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman looks at previous blueprints of previous robots he made, and scans through them quickly. He thinks to himself on what would be the perfect machine for the job of what is basically, forced robot breeding. \" I need something big, something hard to destroy so Sonic and his annoying friends won't have an easy time trying to defeat the thing. So nothing small,\" Eggman throws all the blueprints for small robots and continues to thinks to himself. \"Okay, now what needs to be in here is something to distinguish life forms, able to tell size and what's male and what's female. I'll probably have an Egg Pawn inside the thing to control it.\" Eggman then throws the blueprints to any giant sized robot without a way to enter it, and to access and control it. \"Now what can be good to use, I have three robots here, the Egg-Wyvern, Egg Viper, and Egg Dragoon. And if I need to use any of these, I need to do some serious remodeling.\" After countless minutes, Eggman decided \"Why not mix the three?! I'll get the sleekness of the Viper, the wings of the Wyvern, and the artillery and pod placements of the Dragoon, and mix them all together to see what I can come up with. Of course the artillery must be changed for, different purposes,\" Eggman grabs the three blueprints and starts to draw out a mix, and eventually comes up with this, \"I'll use the Viper as the base, but make the bottom half slimmer so it'll be closer to what the Dragoon had and add a pod on the lower half as well as the top of the dragon. Next we add the wings of the Wyvern onto the base, and make them more flexible and able to close them inward. Next we add legs, but they only come out when the Egg Dragon needs to land, so in the air the Egg Dragon can look like a Chinese style dragon with wings. Then, the weapons of the Dragoon will be changed to do things other than shot and kill. Of course it can still do that for self protection, but lets change what the left arm can do. When preparing for insemination, the Dragon detracts the attack drill, and retracts a phallic looking drill instead, for the purposes of what it was built for, forced breeding. The right arm and be changed to grab creatures easier and not kill them once grabbed. Ooooh, also adding a scary metal dragon head. It'll look cool and evil!\" Eggman finishes up his drawing of the beast, and lifts it up in the air once he's finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M FINISHED!\" Eggman cries out with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing Doctor, it's quite amazing what you can do when properly motivated. Hopefully this won't blunder up on your face like usual, eh?\" Orbot says with sass and properness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen you nincombots, you and the Egg Pawns will build thing right now!\" Eggman shows off the scematics to the 2 robot helpers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, is this really what you want to do Doctor?\" Orbot asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's kinda icky,\"Cubot says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's icky, but it may be my only way of succeeding in world domination. While everyone will be willing to open up an Egg Capsule and destroy a robot to release the animals inside them, no one is willing to kill a pregnant woman, even if the \"baby\" inside her is a robot bent on my command for world domination! BWAHAHAHAHAHA! BWAHAHAHAA-- *cough cough couuuugh*. Oh man I need to clean my throat before doing that,\" Eggman staggers a bit and hands over the prints. \"Now excuse me, I'm going to make everlasting robot semen,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman walks away to another room in the base, and Orbot and Cuebot proceed to look at each other in disgust and shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>One Hour Later and Outside Amy's House</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gets outside her front door, feeling the fresh sun on her face, and gets pumped up to have (in her mind) a perfect day. She brings the Chaos Emerald she stole, I mean borrowed and heads to the spot she and Sonic agreed to meet at for their date. The only thing that can ruin her day would be if Eggman decides to ruin everything by trying to take over the world, or Sonic making up dumb stories to explain why he's not where they agreed to meet up for the date. But just as Amy thought that, she hears a loud screech from afar and feels heavy winds from the direction of the screech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SCREECH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what was that?\" Amy says out loud. The winds get stronger and stronger, indicating that whatever was coming is coming closer and closer. Amy summons her Piko Piko hammer in preparation of what's to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, whatever you are, you are not, and I mean NOT going to ruin my date with Sonic!\" Amy screams out. Confidence builds up in her eyes, and she waits for whatever to come to appear within the next few seconds. And it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the air there was a giant metal beast that Amy had never seen before, in red and yellow paint with Eggman's face logo on it. \"Should of known it was Eggman. Hey Eggman, you come down here right now, I have a lesson for you!\" The Egg Dragon stops and hovers in the air before landing quickly down to find Amy, who rolls out of the way, not to get squished by the giant robot. Amy turns back to look at the thing, only to see an Egg Pawn in one pod and an Eggrobo in the other. Amy confused, stands still to wonder what's going on, but before she thought of any real answer, she runs towards the thing and tries to smash it with her hammer. Instead the Dragon hits back Amy, causing her to hit a tree and fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly knocked out, Amy does not notice the robot coming in closer. The Egg Dragon then changes the drill it had to the \"Egg Penis\", and the weapons arm then shoots out thing robot arms, all of which hold Amy down. The robot arms proceeds to rip off the clothes Amy had on, only leaving the top of her Go-Go outfit not ripped. After ripping the bottom part, the robot arms carefully take off the panties, revealing Amy's small vagina. The Egg Penis then prepares itself and quickly inserts itself into Amy's vagina, and rapes the poor girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy wakes up to see herself stuck with her body being penetrated by a giant robot dragon. Amy continues to break off, but no matter how hard she tires, she can't control anything in this situation. As the Egg Penis forcefully has its way, Amy can feel two things, pain and pleasure, with one feeling stronger than the other.</span></div></div>",

Living all alone in a field in a small house, once owned by her own parents, was once seen as a plus to Amy, seeing as there is less possibility for any danger to occur directly to herself. Sadly, it is now her downfall, as no one was close by to call for help, and yet still, the young pink hedgehog cried out to the heavens to hope that someone could rescue her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELP! PLEASE! OH GOD! SOMEONE! HELP! AAGGHHH!\u201d Amy shouted, crying and struggling as the Dragon penetrates her. The early parts of the penetration process have the \u201cEgg-Penis\u201d slowly trust itself in and out of the poor girl, getting a good feel, registering its limitations and its potential. It actually felt gentle, causing Amy to gain some ounce of pleasure from the experience, as she moans and groans, feeling powerful sexual emotions throughout her body. She even smiled slightly, though her eyes were still watery due to her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought to herself \u201cWhat\u2019s going on anymore? My date with Sonic, will I even make it? Wait, who cares about the date now!? How can I get out of this! I\u2019m a lady, I shouldn\u2019t be treated like this! No one should be treated like this! Oh God, what did I do to deserve this? I may be a little mean or abrasive at time, but-but-but\u2026 this is just terrible. But, do I want it to end? Yes! YES! I DO!\u201d Amy still had fire in her soul, she wasn\u2019t going to let this destroy her spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese early parts were the most \u201cpeaceful\u201d in comparison on what\u2019s to come later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Meanwhile at Eggman\u2019s Secret Base</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo Orbot and Cuebot, watch on a monitor projecting the breeding process in action, both feeling pure horror, one being more dumbstruck with terror than the other (and I think we know who that one is).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, this is most foul!\u201d Orbot said in disgust, \u201cI can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m watching, this is just-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIcky-icky-icky!\u201d Cuebot interrupted, trying to cover his eyes, holding his head down in shame for helping out an idea that Eggman came up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman himself was in an extremely large workshop, or rather, his \u201cEgg-Factory\u201d as he calls it. He was overseeing mass production of the Egg Dragons that his Egg Pawns were building. These new ones were varying in sizes, shapes, and even color pallet, mostly for a variety sake and to give each one some personality, mostly due to an odd obsession that Eggman\u2019s has when it comes to giving his death machines in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou nincombots, pick-up the pace!\u201d The Doctor shouted to his creations, \u201cI built you all with great abilities in construction, so that my machines can be built fast and built well, so if any of these break in less than 8 hits, then you\u2019re all going to the scrap-yard!\u201d As the Egg Pawns heard this, they started rushing to complete the massive amounts of Egg Dragons, with extra precision as well. Eggman continued back to his control room, and he spots his two helper bots watching the breeding process in shock-and-awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?\u201d Eggman said to himself in confusion, quickly changing the broadcast to something else more pleasant on screen, a cartoon he made in the past of which he bested Sonic by making an entire city hate him. He promised himself he will make a next part, but who knows when there would be a part 2 in all honesty. \u201cWhy are you two idiots watching that-that-that-\u201c He stuttered, trying to think of a word that best suited the live footage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHorror and amoralness only a madman can be okay with?\u201d Orbot interrupted, trying to liven himself up after the horrors he saw through his wit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShame and re-re-regretfulness?\u201d Cuebot added, his voice sounding shrill and tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmut!\u201d Eggman concluded, \u201cSeriously, you guys are gross,\u201d Eggman sat down on his chair and began watching his cartoon. The two robots looked at each other, both nudging the other to talk to their creator on the events unfolding as of this moment. Orbot sighed and floated towards the Doctor. He coughed a bit, trying to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Eggman, sir? May I have a word?\u201d The robot looked up to the round scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, what\u2019s up?\u201d The Doctor casually replied, pausing his toon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think we\u2019re going too far? Maybe just a bit?\u201d Orbot asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I think we\u2019re going too far?\u201d Eggman repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>At the Field Close to Amy\u2019s House</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slow pace of Amy\u2019s first sexual encounter caused her to feel some slight comfort, and pleasure in her mess-up situation. She started to accept her fate, and waited for the nightmare to end, of which she was no longer too afraid of. Amy\u2019s pussy was becoming slightly wet, and the Egg Penis was fucking her slowly, in and out, in and out, in and out. However, after some time, the Egg Dragon started to penetrate Amy at a faster pace, which was unnoticed to the pink hedgehog at first, but she becomes slightly more uncomfortable. The true shock didn\u2019t come in until the Egg Penis is reveled to be even longer and thicker than once was thought by Amy, as it exits her for a short while, and then grows. The robots even made the drill arm move away from Amy\u2019s small pussy to show off that it grows, as a means to taunt and prepare her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, it all hits Amy again, the short blissful period was over for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought to herself again, \u201cOh come on, right when I was feeling good about this! Oh no, that nasty drill thing, it got bigger\u2026 nice. Wait, what am I thinking! I got to out of this mess! In fact, I think I could, these robot arms are putting less pressure on me. In fact, if I react quick enough, I can get out, beat up this dumb robot controlled by two more dumb robots, get dressed up again, and get Sonic to help me find Eggman and make him feel sorry!\u201d Amy tried moving her body a bit, but she felt like she couldn\u2019t. There was a mental gap that didn\u2019t allow her to get up, she didn\u2019t fully understand why though, \u201cOh come on Amy, you idiot, get up! Get up! GET-\u201d Amy felt her pussy get wet as she looked at the Egg Penis, \u201cOr maybe I can stay a bit longer,\u201d she thought in a coy manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Back at Eggman\u2019s Base (Slightly before the Egg Dragon exits Amy)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I think we\u2019re going too far?\u201d And in less than a second, Eggman replied, \u201cHonestly, no I don\u2019t,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two robots were shocked when he spoke his mind on the subject matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! What do you mean what we\u2019re doing to Amy isn\u2019t too far?!\u201d Cuebot yelled angrily to the Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me explain,\u201d Eggman didn\u2019t turn to look at his machines, instead showing different footage, newspaper clips, news reports, and pictures of his past misdeeds, \u201cI have been trying to take over Earth for many, many years. I have taken innocent cute little animals, and made them power sources for robots. I have ripped away family members from each other many times. Then there\u2019s the many lands I have built over in the past, ruining ecosystems, causing a lot of life to die, be it plants and animals. I have tried to summon supernatural powerful creatures to do my bidding, one event caused a city to flood, another had me blowing up a moon and almost crashing a space-station into Earth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough that space-station one was a mistake, and you did try to fix your errors that time, one of the few times that you\u2019ve succeeded at if I\u2019m not mistaken,\u201d Orbot said, trying to debunk one point in Eggman\u2019s many points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I still was planning on killing a lot of lives with a giant laser! Then there\u2019s the time I blew up Earth with a giant laser, causing it to literally crack apart! Can you imagine the amount of lives lost? And the many planets I invaded, of which you two were there for! I have done terrible things in the past, caused a lot of lives to be lost! What makes you think that raping a few females with robots is the worst thing I\u2019ve done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two robots were silent. They disagreed with the Doctor, they believed that forcibly forcing yourself onto anybody, and then to force them to carry your child was most heinous, and yet they can understand his mindset. They were afraid to find out that Eggman has no limits on what he could do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Back to the Field (Again)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold shiver was felt all over Amy\u2019s body, the arms that held her down began to feel her out unexpectedly! They were grouping her young body, holding on to her sides, cupping her breasts, grouping her small ass. They rubbed her sensually, as means to make her feel safe, which only made Amy felt displeasure, at least at first. Amy started to feel \u201chot\u201d, energized, ready to breed essentially, she was an animal after all. The young pink hedgehog moaned even louder than she did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh, yeah, that feels so good!\u201d Amy was smacking her lips, and moving around her body slightly, feeling absolutely horny, her small pussy being even wetter than before, \u201cYes, oh God, yes! Come on you big mean red machine, I\u2019m ready\u201d Amy now felt she was in some control. What started as helplessness and an overall lack of control, has now become Amy\u2019s very messed up sexual awakening, something of which her mind was not developed enough to truly understand how terrible her situation is. She really doesn\u2019t have control; she just thinks he does. The robot arms made Amy feel loved and cared for, even though they bots controlling the machine only cared for the Doctor\u2019s commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Egg Dragon detected that Amy was indeed ready. In an instant, the Egg Penis was forcefully inserted into Amy, this time going at half of its full potential power. The quicker pace made Amy feel wonder and happiness, she wasn\u2019t moaning and groaning as much as before, rather she was feeling pain again. She started to cry out again, and yet, she was still feeling good. The Egg Penis was shoved in and out, harder and faster, really getting into her and riding her like a wild stallion. The arms then held Amy up in the air, allowing for the robot to go even harder without having to worry of hurting Amy too much while she was on the ground. Amy herself began to feel an even more confusing mix of pleasure and displeasure, as while she was enjoying the sexual encounter, she felt something inside her break and bleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy Rose has been deflowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Egg Dragon didn\u2019t stop, as this was just the start of Amy\u2019s journey into womanhood, in the sick perspective of Eggman\u2019s commands. The Egg Penis then went at its max capacity, but by now, Amy was now used to pain and pleasure being synonymous with one another. The thrusting of the Egg Penis as it went inside Amy, going in and out, making Amy practically jumping in the air, her moans of sexual pleasure being louder than her cries for help. At the same time, the robot arms were also feeling out Amy once more, trying to help Amy reach her climax as soon as possible. The pink hedgehog was having the time of her life, she did not know what to expect next, but what she felt now was something she wishes she can feel forever, as Amy climaxed and came on the Egg Penis, and she cried out to the sky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPLEASE NEVER END!\u201d Ironically, it was about to end soon, as once the Egg Penis detected that the precipitant came onto it, the machine prepared for insemination. The Egg Penis came into Amy with artificial semen, and they all journeyed into Amy, going as quickly as possible, reaching her egg as fast as they got in. The Egg Penis got out of Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Egg Dragon placed Amy on the ground, as the robot arms were reinserted into the machine. She was breathing heavily, panting, sweating up a storm after what just happened. She felt tired, she felt dirty, she felt penetrated, she felt like she was used. But she didn\u2019t feel crushed, she survived, and she was in bliss once more, at least, that\u2019s what her now warped psyche has her thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big red machine flew into to the air and head back to base, and it screeched once more as a call to strike fear into those who heard its roar. Amy slowly got up and walked back home. She needed rest, but she wasn\u2019t sure if she should either head to her meet up with Sonic later or just stay at home and relax.</span></div></div>",

As Amy walked to her home, she was looking down at the ground, observing the destruction the Egg Dragon caused to the plant life. Crushed flowers, messy, if not broken patches of grass, dirt absolutely everywhere. It was a mess, a mess that reminded Amy of her young childhood, when her parents were still around. She still can\u2019t recount if those days were better or worse for an amalgamation of reasons, and this day\u2019s terrible even only muddied that past even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in front of her house, Amy placed her hand on the door knob, and she grabbed it. She didn\u2019t turn it, she didn\u2019t let go, she didn\u2019t even try to hold the knob lighter or harder, she just held on to it. She was confused, scared, worried on what was the purpose of the machine. It wasn\u2019t until now she noticed that her vagina felt weird, it was not just her own \u201cjuices\u201d, but also the liquid that was inserted into her by that metal beast. She almost touched it, but chose not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last she entered her house, and it felt colder than usual to her. Amy turned on the heating, and went to a computer she had in her room. She sent a message to Tails, stating,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHello Tails, how are you doing? I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t come to the meet-up with Sonic soon, there has been a delay. If you allow me to, I will visit later, I do have to return that Chaos Emerald of course. I would send a message to Sonic, but he hasn\u2019t given me his information for that yet. In fact, I\u2019m not so sure if he even has one if I have to be honest. Anyway, have a good day, I hope you can allow me to meet up later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-From Amy Rose\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message was sent, and after that, Amy headed straight to her bathtub, removing any article of clothing she had left, and throwing out anything that was broken. She turned on the water, and made it very, very hot, an easy way she knows on relaxing herself. She lowly entered the bath water, covering her entire body in the liquid, leaving only her head from the nose up above the water. She dunked her head for a quick second to wet her curved spikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA message was delivered to Amy, but she wasn\u2019t aware of it. It read,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHey Amy, I\u2019m doing fine, but are you okay? Has anything happened to you? If you don\u2019t want to tell us, then you don\u2019t have to, it\u2019s just that your message sounded a bit\u2026 it\u2019s probably nothing, maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it. And yeah, you can meet up later. I haven\u2019t seen Sonic at all today, so he\u2019d would\u2019ve been late anyway. Heh heh, that\u2019s Sonic for you. I\u2019ll inform him once he visits me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-From Miles 'Tails\u2019 Prower<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. If there\u2019s anything that you need to talk about, you can talk to me, Cream, Knuckles, and even Sonic. We\u2019re your friends, never forget that. Sorry, this got a little sentimental.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy did hear the notification, as it was the only noise being made in the small house, but she stayed where she was in the tub. While in the rub, Amy started to shake one of her legs quickly, and as for a pink hedgehog that can run extremely fast as well, it was making a mess of her bathroom as water was being spilled outside the tub. Amy couldn\u2019t calm down, as she tried to close her eyes and think of blissful thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought of being with Sonic, but that didn\u2019t help as she only now thinks about the many rejections she\u2019s gotten, the pointlessness of hanging out with a person who is always on the run. She thought of hanging out with Cream, but even that didn\u2019t help as now she is reminded of the large age gap between her and her best friend, knowing that she will never be as innocent as the little adorable rabbit girl. She even tried to recount the feeling of going through a grand adventure with her friends, defeating whatever big bag creep was in their way, but she just can\u2019t remember that feeling, and only thinks that something else bad always happens. Amy was becoming something of a cynic, and she didn\u2019t like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing she recounts that does make her feel good is when the metal beast invaded her. She twisted and turned in the tub, spilling less water, getting tingly all over thinking about it. She held her thighs down as a way for her legs to stop shaking. Sadly, Amy couldn\u2019t help herself and still moved her body, and by doing so, she unknowingly that it caused a sensual feeling for her body as she was inadvertently rubbing her thighs. This caused Amy to only want to recount her first time even more, and while rubbing her thighs, her hands got closer to her womanhood, leading up to accidentally touching her own clitoris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce touched, Amy felt a familiar spark. She played with clitoris a bit, for the first time in her life, creating soundless moans as she does. She soon stopped, she discovered a way to create self-pleasure. Amy lifted up her hand, she looked at it, she thought for a bit, and without going too deep into her own thoughts, she plunged her two fingers into herself, and she felt the inside was warm, and maybe even a little wet from something that wasn\u2019t bath water. She motioned her fingers in a rhythm, along with her hips, creating an adequate sexual experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it felt good, she knows what it is to feel better. She took out her fingers and look around her bathroom. She saw her hairbrush that she uses to fix up her quills, grabbed it from the floor, and wondered what if she used this rather than her fingers, would it feel better? Amy pushed in the hairbrush handle end, and a soft moan came out of her lips, she used her free hand to hold on to the side of her tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the meanwhile, Amy had failed to notice a little aspect about herself that was growing bigger and bigger. As Amy was trying to recreate that tingly feeling again, another feeling was being overpowered by her lust. During the moments when Amy rubbed her thighs, Amy\u2019s belly began to swell outward, ever so slightly. Little by little, Amy was gaining new girth to her gut, or rather, her womb. With each moment of sexual pleasure, Amy\u2019s belly grew larger, wider, becoming firmer and rounder as well. With every moan and groan, several more inches were added to her waistline. There was something growing inside the young pink hedgehog, and she had no idea that it was even happening, as she was too distracted, for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy slid the handle in and out of her, she whispered \u201cOh you metal beast\u201d to herself. With each moment, Amy felt intensity grow, she breathed harder and faster, she screamed out in joy, she was feeling great. All the while, something in her belly wiggles and bumps around. In Amy\u2019s near-orgasmic state, all she did was to place her free hand on the swollen mound of his belly, rubbing it as well, which also caused Amy to feel sexual pleasure. While her belly was expanding, so were her breasts, though they don\u2019t grow as large or fast as her belly grew, they are now noticeably larger than they were before. She kept pumping her hairbrush inside of her over and over and over and over, while rubbing her belly over and over and over. This feeling she had something she was having a hard time handling, and throughout her body she felt something of an electric shock. A second orgasm, a happier one, and she held her breath in order to keep this feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Amy went back to quick and short breaths, her lungs getting burned out from holding it in. The breaths became calmer and slower. She closed her eyes, her body ached, she felt like she couldn\u2019t move. She was warm, she was happy, but in many senses, she still wasn\u2019t clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this little break, Amy tossed the hairbrush away, she slowly stood up, opened up the hole in the tub to get all the water out, and she took a cold shower. She felt shame for her actions. But during her shower, she will feel something greater, shock. Earlier while standing up, Amy noticed that she had a lack of balance, and she felt heavier than she did earlier. She didn\u2019t think nothing of it, guessing that what she did while in the tub made her feel lighter than usual. To her surprise, if not horror, while washing her body, she at last noticed that her belly and breasts had grown substantially once she grew the courage to look down after feeling that they were bigger sometime earlier, while shampooing herself. She cried out in fear, only to cry even louder when she felt something kick inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hurried through the shower, dried up as best as she could, and dressed up in clothes she\u2019s not worn too much in the past, a loose summer dress that\u2019s not so loose now, a white sun hat with a pink ribbon to cover the fact that her spikes weren\u2019t properly brushed, a pair of sandals, and her gloves of course, but minus the golden cuffs. She now sends a new message to Tails after reading the one he sent to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cTails\u2026 I have gone through a lot today, I\u2019m heading over to your lab now, I have an emergency I need to discuss with you.

She is a Zeti and a member of the Deadly Six. When Dr. Eggman came to the Lost Hex, Zeena and the other members of the Deadly Six were forced into serving the doctor due to the effects of the Cacophonic Conch. After Sonic the Hedgehog arrived and got rid of the conch, Zeena and the others rebelled against Eggman and took control of his forces. Afterwards, Zeena followed Zavok's plans to make her and the other Deadly Six stronger by using Eggman's Extractor, while destroying Earth, but was ultimately defeated by Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, that was broad. Could of put any Deadly Six member really. This is going to be a big description chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAPPEARANCE!<br>\r\nZeena is a green female Zeti, with a slender upper body that curves out into fairly wide hips. Zeena's upper body is lime green with two black stripes around her waist, while the lower half of her body is black. Zeena's small feet are tipped by small lime green claws, with a third smaller one on each heel. Zeena's tail is thin and curly, ending in a chameleon-like swirl (similar to Espio's tail).

Zeena also has orange lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPERSONALITY!<br>\r\nZeena is a feisty, cold-hearted, and cruel person that lacks initiative. She is very selfish and thinks highly of herself, preferring to look after herself first and foremost by treating herself with time to do her own things regardless of the issues at hand, but she is not very likely to look after anyone else. Despite this, she can be persuaded when she receives compliments about her attributes, such as when she agreed to fight Sonic after Zavok complemented her speed, smarts and looks. Regardless of her lack of dedication though, when out on an assignment, Zeena is very serious and committed to the task at hand and will always complete it.<br>\r\nZeena is very vain, being very focused on her outward appearance. She frequently takes care of her looks and is very protective of it, especially her nail art, and does not like having it ruined. Her concerns about appearance also extends to others, as she will criticize others' fashion sense. She is also somewhat flirtatious, trying to allure Sonic, flipping her hair, and even moving her hips while walking. Despite showing a lady-like composure most of the time though, Zeena has a terrifying temper and is not shy about showing it.<br>\r\nLike the other members of the Deadly Six, Zeena is inherently malicious and violent. She takes enjoyment in inflicting pain, torturing and killing others, and she has no problem causing massive genocide or widespread destruction for her own gain. Also, when Sonic was horrified and angered by seeing Tails turned into a robotic slave, Zeena further mocked and taunted him for her own amusement. She is also rather vengeful, given that once Zeena was freed from Eggman's enslavement by Sonic, she launched an attack on the scientist with the others, and when Sonic insulted her, she wanted to severely punish him for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah. Another non-basic description, this time one that tells so much about this girl. And while she is the NEWEST girl from the main Sonic games and universe, there is now the newly American created (and not yet released as of November 2014) Sonic Boom universe and sub-franchise!</span></div></div>",

She is a natural leader and organizer but can get bossy to everyone around her, though it is just because she knows what others want before they do. She is sweet and has ballerina-like gracefulness, but is also a capable and tough cookie. She is (most of the time) the sensible member of her group of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say look up how this Amy looks from her original!Amy, and make this story set in the Sonic Boom universe, unless you'll do some creative crossover thing. Either way, making a story for her will require a good amount of knowledge of the new Sonic Boom universe, even though nothing is out yet, there is still a lot of info that is released, so there is a base you can take and make with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreating a story where a furry chick gets raped by a dragon and is now pregnant with it's child is harder than I and/or you thought it be.</span></div></div>",

It's Sonic, they can't stop making new characters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now we just focus on Sticks. Sticks the Badger is one of the main characters that appears in the (upcoming or released) Sonic Boom series. She is an anthropomorphic jungle badger and a force of nature in every way. She has spent most of her life living alone and flourishing in the wilderness and is as such new to friends in general. After meeting Sonic and his friends, however, she forms a strong bond with the group, particularly with Amy Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticks is energetic and rather primal, like a wild animal. She has sharp animal instincts and is a fearsome combatant and tenacious hunter. Because of her isolated life, Sticks has become a little quirky, eccentric and thinks others are living in an alternate world. In spite of her background, she is intelligent, though her manner of speaking comes off as strange to other people as she speaks in a primitive dialect she taught herself.<br>\r\nSticks loves spending time in her burrow and returns to it for safety when a situation becomes too bizarre for her.<br>\r\nBecause of her wildness, Sticks' social skills need plenty of work. She is not the most trusting individual and is full of outrageous suspicions (which are always proven right) and senses danger everywhere at all times. While the concepts of sharing, compassion, and friendship are foreign to her, Sticks has a good heart and a genuine desire to get closer to Sonic and his friends, and is fiercely loyal to them. However, this also creates an internal struggle for her; on one hand she is not sure she can handle the life outside her burrow, but on the other hand she loves her friends and wants to hang out with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to see how she looks like since I didn't describe her appearance, remember, Google.</span></div></div>",

Also by comics I mean Archie Sonic comics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) There is a lot of male characters, and the original author never said he agaisnt male pregnancy. And while I'm not going to make that long list now, I will probably later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now for choices I will put 2 things for future reference.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't want to end it like this, ya know? I mean, you probably went to this story to see all the options there is after the high amount of updates it got and you expected a lot of story and porn. And I've been through situations like that where I see a story with more than 20+ chapters, and I expect a lot, and just get choices. Hell, I personally went to at least give the choices a lot of description, unlike other stories, and this interactive story itself before I got to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead of just leaving this here, I'm going to start working on Amy's story, and probably go for the authors 17 chapter minimum ending limit.

Also I didn't continue my story on Amy Rose being raped by a dragon... that is until today (as of this writing) I am continuing the story and now have released the 2nd chapter (that's been split into 2 parts) out of 17 planned chapters... this could take a while. Anyway, onto the character!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerci is a street-smart young lady bandicoot is tough as nails. Her job, which has been in her family for untold generations, is to protect Bygone Island from the likes of Lyric. She also appears in the Sonic Boom TV show. She also barely shows up in the Boom universe (what a success Boom has been overall, am I right? Cartoon is good though). She likes handiwork. She has a talent for machinery. There was this one episode where the male characters were infatuated by her. She's purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is sadly not much to write about here, and I'm regretting having all of these in the \"Rape by Dragon\" section, so I may copy/paste these posts onto other areas of pregnancy at least, in order to encourage more writers to make stories with less limitations.

Just sigh.<br>\r\nSo at this point I had to dig up a character that was <b>never</b> created, but rather planned to be in a <b>cancelled</b> Sonic game for the Sega Saturn. Yeah, we obscure now boys 'n girls! (also remember that I usually take these descriptions from other websites)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiara was developed to be a spunky female protagonist who could match Sonic the Hedgehog in attitude. Christian Senn later admitted that, should she have ever materialized completely, she would be a \"girl power\" character. She varied from the typical \"damsel in distress\" seen in the Sonic the Hedgehog video game series. Senn's first sketches were stick figures. From there, he created an initial design that deviated from a real Manx in the same way that Sonic deviated from a real hedgehog. He states that the similarities (both in appearance and personality) between Tiara and Princess Sally Acorn were unintentional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of four color designs were created for discussion purposes in 1995. Each retained the same basic facial and hair designs, but varied in terms of clothing. Proposed designs included a form-fitting red dress, a tank top with miniskirt, and a midriff-bearing version of the former. A design featuring no clothing changed her fur pattern. For the second to last design, Senn used the midriff-bearing design using a red and yellow color scheme. However, Michael Kosaka envisioned the character as having more attitude, so Senn changed her accordingly. Along with her stance and visual demeanor, her clothing style changed dramatically. She was given tight pants, a bikini top, and tennis shoes. Additionally, her hair was shortened. Chris Senn felt this design conveyed her attitude, but after the game was cancelled he admitted that her original, cuter design was his favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, do what you want with her, because there is LITERALLY no more female Sonic characters from the games that I have for you to jerk off/write stories for... however, I will make a thread for cartoon characters and will now try to copy-past these posts and put them in the other areas for <i>Pregnant</i> at the very least.
