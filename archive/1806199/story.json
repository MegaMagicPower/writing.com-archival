A straight shooter, John had always been known as \u201cThe Guy\u201d.  Not quite an alpha, but always dependible and reliable.  His wife, beauty at her peak in the late 30's.  She gave up corporate life after the birth of their only child, Crista 15 years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrista and her mother were very close.  John, the breadwinner spent many nights working late or even weeks on end on the road, traveling for business on the West Coast or points along the Pacific Rim.  Though he was gone for much of her younger life, she loved her Dad and her mother was always quick to help her understand why  daddy was gone some much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt weighed on him, the travel, but now, entering his mid 40's the rewards were paying off.  Their home was paid for and the extra dollars saved were conservatively secured in treasury bills and municilple bonds...John was looking forward to retirement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe last leg of the last trip\u201d.  Is how he thought about it.  The airport was almost empty except for the small group of arriving travelers.  The weather in Denver had delayed their flight, but thankfully not canceled it.  John was ready to be home.  The deal in Denver, closed with a handshake and a drink, it was a good week.  The new Denver contract will keep him busy for many years and he had been given the go ahead to cross train his eager and sharp assistant Shelly Menger to take over the existing accounts.  Two years out of college and the MBA to boot, she was on the fast track.  At first he felt a little threatened by this new blood, but over time he saw his role mostly as a mentor for the young lady and they soon became good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sent a quick text saying he was safe and on the ground and will be catching the train home.  A small handfull of people stood outside on the platform waiting. The air was cool, early fall so not quite cold. John stood reading a magazine when a small group of young people approached.  They were young, early teens maybe.  The boys were gangly and awkward, trying to look cool.  The girls, probably the same age the oldest maybe 16 but trying to guess teen girls true ages were pointless John had come to understand.  The shortest of the group was a girl, definitly younger than the others.  She reminded him of some of his daughters friends from Junior High, the ones who tried too hard to look older and wore bad makeup and  innapropriate clothes.  The eye liner and lipstip contrasted with their light, almost pale complexions made lighter by some kind of makeup.  The black lipstick is what John thought was over the top, but he did chuckle at the black Chuck Taylors they all wore.  He didn't even know they made them that small when he looked at the youngest girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn let out a sigh as the group moved closer to him.  He was tired and just wanted to get home.  Having to deal with these nimrods as he called them was just a waste of energy.  He turned his back slightly, and watched them out of the corner of his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, where did you get that purse?\u201d the tallest boy asked, trying his best to be a smart ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not a purse, it's a satchel\u201d John replied \u201cIndiana Jones has one\u201d he continued.  Maybe using a popular movie quote would easy the tention and they would get bored and move on.  He didn't dislike kids, infact he felt sorry for these young ones.  He liked to believe they were just out having fun and truthfully would be going home to a nice warm home tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis jerk thinks he's a comedian\u201d one of the older girls said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyeah, that movie was lame\u201d a young boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sighed, he had unintentionally drawn them in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got me\u201d he said.  \u201cI'm really a vampire hunter, I keep holy water and a wooden stake in the bag\u201d he continued and patted the leather cover slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa some vampire hunter, you don't even carry a cross\u201d the oldest boy said.  \u201cThis guy thinks he knows how to kill a vampire\u201d he continued laughing along with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thanks for the tip.  I need to go get some coffee\u201d  John said and turned to walk toward the other end of the platform where some other adults were sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took about two steps and the oldest boy asked him in a menacing tone \u201cWhat's in the bag mister?\u201d  The two other boys positioned them between John and open platform.  He had really messed up, the part of the platform he where he was waiting was very narrow and bordered on one side by a brick wall and the train track.  Without making a huge scene it was impossible for him to just walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally guys?  You are mugging me?\u201d John asked incredulously.  \u201cLook, how about I give you 20 bucks and you can go get a burger or something.  I'm tired, I'm getting mad and really I don't want you kids to get into trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids laughed.  \u201cNo deal man.  Give me the bag\u201d.  John tightend his grip, no way was he handing this over.  Nothing in there was irreplacable but the time he spent getting those documents in order was irreplacable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen\u201d he said \u201cI'm walking down there and if you kids are gone before I turn around, I won't call the cops\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group laughed again.  \u201cGo ahead, call them.  Call them now if you want.  They won't be here for another 20 minutes, we'll be long gone\u201d the oldest girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was relatively sure they didn't have any weapons, if they had they would have shown them by now.  They were just trying to intimidate him.  \u201cI've had enough\u201d he said and made a strong move to cut through the two boys blocking the platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened very quickly.  He remembers someone pulling on his bag, trying to lift it over his head while the youngest girl had grabbed onto his left wrist, trying to remove his watch.  \u201cIt's not even expensive\u201d he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scuffle was quick and only continued for a few seconds.  The oldest boy had broken the strap and was now trying to yank the bag from his hands.  John had a strong grip on the handle until the young girl bit him on the knuckle.  John cussed and pulled as hard as he could yanking the bag from the grip of the boy, and more importantly his hand from the young girl's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is nothing in there\u201d he shouted  \u201cit's just paperwork\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a blow to the back of the head stunned him.  He dropped the bag but before he could pick it up, he was pushed against the wall.  The younger boy grabbed it and ran off before he could do anything.  The others, seeing their companion had the prize ran after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn stood against the wall still stunned from the blow to the head.  He heard them laughing.  The oldest girl asked the youngest if she had bit him hard.  She said yes and giggled.  The older girl looked back and laughed harder.  \u201coh man\u201d she chuckled \u201cgood luck mister!\u201d she said giggled and disapeared in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn patted himself feeling for any other wounds.  He winced as he remembered his hand and looked down. The bite had drawn blood, it was already drying but it had ran down his ring finger, a few drops sat drying on the platform concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked his pockets, wallet and phone were still there...as was his watch. \u201cDumb kids\u201d he said and dialed 911 as two other adult passengers who had noticed to ruckus arived to offer any help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should get that cleaned up\u201d an older lady said and motioned to the restrooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u201d the gentleman said.  \u201cGet a picture of that before you clean it up\u201d and snapped a picture of the bite mark with his cell phone.  John gave him his phone number so it could be sent to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police came, a little quicker than the young thug had predicted.  They took statements and an EMT dressed the bite on his hand.  Fortunately they were able to take care of everthing before the last train.  At 12:01, a little after midnight a tired and frustrated John Clark kissed his sleeping wife and layed down in his own bed.  His hand throbbing from the bite of the young attacker, he worried about infection, HIV, Hepititis....you name it and it was on his mind. Finding the time to get the parties to re-sign the contracts wasn't going to be impossible but it would take time,and another trip to Denver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning he debriefed his wife on the events of the prior night.  She hugged him and said she was thankfull it was only some dumb kids.  She also offered to drive him to the doctor to look his hand.</span></div></div>",

She would drop him off and go shopping while she waited, which was fine with him.  She worked hard raising the girl while he was working, she deserved it in his mind and he was happy he could provide for her in that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wait was long in the doctor's office.  John spent the time pacing, thumbing through magazines and pamphlets.  When it was his time to go back, he sat and told his story again to the practicing nurse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are lucky\u201dShe told him. \u201cand you said the girl bit hard enough to draw blood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks and yes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me take a look\u201d and she began unwrapping the dressing.  \u201cHuman bites are not always serious but like anything, there is always the potential for infection or transmitted diseases.\u201d<br>\r\nThe wrappings lay on the table as the final piece of gauze was lifted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn stared at his hand and looked at the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI....There was a bite, blood and everything\u201d he stammerd  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him quizically.  \u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asked because she felt she needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked again, wiggled his fingers, clenched and unclenched his fist.  No pain, not a hint of a scar nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's a picture, see on my phone\u201d he reached into his pocket and grabbed his cell phone and opened the attachment sent from the witness last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quality wasn't the best but you could make out a bite mark on a hand and some blood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, we are very busy here and we don't have time for pranks.\u201d  The nurse said, clearly irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not a prank, I have a police report....I don't know what happened.  Do things like that just heal overnight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, um first NO, things like that don't just heal overnight, and second you are wasting my time.  Please pay the receptionist on your way out, and I also intend to bill you for the office visit.  Please have a good day.\u201d  and she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sat stunned and put on his coat.  The blood stained dressing from last night was laying on the counter.  He grabbed it and stuffed it in his pocket.  Walking out of the examination room, he quietly paid the receptionist walked out dialing his wife to come and get him.  He sat on a bench again looking at his hand in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis phone startled him, the caller id was for Number One.  \u201cHello Shelly\u201d he said when he answered. He filled her in on the mugging, intentionally not telling her about the incident with the bite.  He asked her to coordinate a meeting back in Denver around the end of the month so they could get the contracts updated and signed again if the police didn't turn anything up regarding his stolen bag.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow startled him and he looked up. \u201cHey baby, wanna lift?\u201d she asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood and kissed her cheek.  \u201cWanna hear about something really freaky?\u201d he asked and proceded to show her his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing this as well, Shelly shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know whether to laugh or cry at this point.\" Serious, she said. \"This is a weregirl curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A weregirl?!\" Startled, John asked. \"What on Earth does that do to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It turns you into a girl every night there is a full moon.\" Bemused, Shelly replied. \"What makes the curse dark is that the girl you become will be rather horny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn shrugged. \"How is that so bad?\" Lightly, he asked. \"It's not like I'm a virgin. That and I'm certain you know of an antidote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once the girl gets knocked up, the antidote will not work, genius!\" Irritated, Shelly snapped. \"Worse, the antidote can only be made under a full moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens if I, err, the girl gets pregnant?\" Worried, John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that happens, kiss your man card good bye.\" Serious, Shelly replied. \"The transformation will become permanent and you will be a single mother as I doubt the man you seduce will stick around to help you raise the child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I do to deserve this?!\" Moaning, John demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is another side to the curse.\" Wincing, Shelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Now frightened, John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is the off chance that you were targeted as a potential adoptee.\" Softly, Shelly explained. \"Dark pink blood can indicate that as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you tell the difference?\" Morbidly curious, John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you become younger rather than horny, we will know.\" Darkly, Shelly said. \"There are seven teeth marks so you would stop regressing at the age of seven after the same number of full moons pass.\" She paused, looking up at the moon. \"We will know more tomorrow night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She has the right to know what their child may inherit. The problem is that it may destroy their marriage. In part he feels some relief. It has been hard hiding this from her. The taking off for days at a time has worn on their marriage. You see, Mark is a were-woman. For the most part he has learned to control his transformation, he can become his female self whenever he wants, but one week a month it becomes near impossible to control it. Unlike a werewolf, that is ruled by the lunar cycle, were-woman are ruled by their menstrual cycle. Also, unlike werewolves, the curse doesn't transfer through bites, or anything like that. At least, Mark has never heard of it. For a few days a month he become a slut with an insatiable sex drive. It's how he and Carrie met. It was a sorority party and he, or rather she going by the name Mary was in full slut mode. She and Carrie had a make out session. After that they became girlfriends. Carrie was straight though and that drunken make out session was their first and last. They did hang out a lot and Mary enjoyed their time together. Mary wanted more out of the relationship, so she introduced Carrie to her friend Mark. The rest is as they say history. Mary continued to have girl's nights out with Carrie, because Mark/Mary also enjoyed those interactions, but they did have a lot of private conversations about Mark. Revealing the truth, Carrie may assume that he was spying on her. Mark sighs, he was able to come up with an excuse why he wasn't, as Mary able to be her maid of honor at their wedding.

Consummating their marriage in a sweating tangle of lust and affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer, or Jen' as he usually called her, arched her back against his thrusting body as he shifted position and managed to find that special spot hidden deep within her treasure, the shudder of her body a precursor to the moan that rocked her a moment later. He caught the moan as he locked lips with her and sought her darting tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of hands sought his ass and gave his hips a solid pull to force him deeper into her snatch. Another shudder and the grasping hands squeezed his tight cheeks, the manicured nails drawing thin little scratches on his backside. Ryan smiled to himself as he felt her tunnel tightening on his member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke the kiss and moved her questing mouth moved to the side of his neck, growling into his throat as he kept up the rhythm. He felt her near her peak, muscles tensing, her breath quickening. He too was at the limit of his endurance, as the light brush of lips and playful teeth danced to his shoulder a dam somewhere broke and both of their bodies were flooded with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his body released itself in a seemingly unending torrent of wonderful bliss he absently registered something clench and pierce his shoulder. A feminine moan telling him that she had bitten him in her own throes of coitus, not that he minded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting she released her jaw from his shoulder and looked into his eyes, the warm fires of love and carnal desire still lighting up her whole face. God he loved her, Lord she was marvelous, Jesus he felt dizzy. The last though came to him as the room rapidly began spinning, his equilibirum suddenly telling him he was on his side then upside down. As he rolled over then off the bed he got one last glimpse of Jen' staring at him with a mixture of worry and shock, and he was sure, a touch of guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that all disappeared as he hit something hard with a dull thud that seemed miles away, far away in the darkness into which he had falling, was falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                 *****************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ryan? Wake up. Are you still in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Jen' he knew that, she was somewhere nearby. Somewhere above him. He struggled to bring himself around, to open his heavy eyes against the bright sunlight. It had been one hell of a night, he could tell that much. His body ached with the tender pain of strenuous activity, though it felt different than before, he couldn't quite place it but as he finally managed to open his eyes he noticed several things a miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly he was on the ground, not sure how he got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond his now wife was towering over him, though given the view he could live with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird, he couldn't move much or at all, not just body asleep immobility but something else, like his body was made of something besides muscle and bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Ryan but I have something to tell you, I'm A.....</span></div></div>",

With a sigh she stepped up to him, looming high above him like some sort of giantess, though he knew it was him that was out of proportion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen crouched down on her haunches, giving him a view of her nether lips, warm red and still dripping with arousal. All carnal thoughts were wiped from his mind as she reached towards him and slid her fingers underneath him, his soft and flexible body conforming easily to the shape of her hand. He felt her warm firm fingertips through him, giving him depth and form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wife lifted him off the ground and placed him gently on top of the rumpled sheets. \"I was going to tell you soon, I promise. But I guess this is as good a time as any.\" She bagan moving around the room as she spoke, doing small make work tasks. Straightening things or putting them away, and bundling up the clothes they had left strewn around the room, though she herself remained naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a full blood Were-Cloth, so I have to transform into clothing at least once a month. I mostly have control of what and when it happens, which is why you've never seen it in progress, though you have sent me through the wash A few times, even worn me once.\" Ryan was shocked at that little revelation, he'd never noticed anything at all strange about his clothes and wondered what it felt like to be wrapped around another's form..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But since I bit you your only a half-blood and thus have almost no control, to begin with at least. Largely it'll be whatever your thinking of at the time,\" She stopped mid stride and looked down at him. \"And since we were making the dirty at the time you changed into a sexy little...\"</span></div></div>",
