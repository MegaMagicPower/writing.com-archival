            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStealth and cunning were not the first words to not the first words to come to mind when describing Usagi Tsukino. The young, bubbly teenager tended towards loud outbursts of emotion (whether ear splitting cries of joy or even louder fits of crying), rushing from one place to another, and often catastrophic examples of coordination and reflex. It was only under the most dire of circumstances or important of tasks that could cause her to grow more serious and apply her focus to the subtle art of staying hidden and silent ambush. But sporadic as those moments might be, when the Sailor Senshi applied herself to the task she became quite formidable. In those moments, her enemies stood no chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she had her target in sight. The enemy was inching into position, unsuspecting. A moment of hesitation or miscalculation and her advantage would be lost completely. Usagi held her breath. Just an inch closer....closer....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sadistically gleeful cry the pigtailed girl burst from her hiding place. The small pink-haired girl gasped in surprise and began to turn to face her. Too late! With quick precision, Usagi grabbed at the wet towel the younger girl had wrapped around herself just after her bath. At the same time, she pushed with all her might to force the shocked girl through the open back door. The motion was fluid so that by the time Chibiusa realized she was now out in public she was already bereft of her only garment and the door was already being closed and latched before she had time to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi's laughter was high pitched, almost enough to drown the pounding and screaming from her pre-teen sister (okay, okay, preteen time displaced daughter of her 1000 year old future self...but in case anyone asks, her sister). Usagi provided a little victory dance and mockingly waved the towel back and forth as the naked girl furiously glared at her through the transparent door. Nothing better than a good prank successfully executed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a stern scolding from her mother, a furious death glare from a beat red Chibiusa, and a delicious meal Usagi was still giggling to herself as she read a manga in her room. She was starting to get minor guilt pangs that her little joke had gone a little too far, but mostly she was still too delighted with the look on her bratty little counterpart's face to dwell on it. There was a genuine rapport between the two moon girls. But it was often a love-hate relationship, with the pair often arguing or engaging in antics of oneupmanship between the concern and adoration. A lack of enemies to fight and a long summer had bred a sense of boredom in the blonde haired superhero, and Chibiusa was the perfect way to relieve it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chibiusa entered the room and gave her another glare, Usagi couldn't help but titter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Usa-chan! There you are! I almost didn't recognize you with your clothes on!!\" Usagi said animatedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibiusa didn't respond and instead headed towards the closet containing her suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh. No come backs. So we're not talking then?\" Usagi asked towards Chibiusa's back. \"That's okay. I know it was a little mean. Still worth it, though. The look on your face! Especially when that neighborhood boy snapped the picture! Awwww. You had a crush on him, didn't you! That must be embarrassing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibiusa turned around slowly. She had something in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember this, Usagi?\" She asked in a stony voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\" Usagi paused, a hint of uncertainty in her voice. \"Sure. That Luna P, that future gizmo thingy that looks like a floating kitty head. It changes into different objects, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm-hmmmm. And do you remember this?\" Chibusa asked as Luna P vanished in a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeeaaaah. That's...that umbrella thing. That's how you convinced everyone you were my little sister visiting from out of town and conned your way to living here.\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know how I did that?\" Chibiusa asked, twirling the umbrella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Yeah....the...eep...the umbrella does some kind of hypnosis on whoever looks at the pattern when it moves.\" Usagi said, a little dismayed to find herself unable to look away from the pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. Did you know I can do more than alter memories? Like, for example...force them to do whatever I tell them to?\" Chibiusa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....no. I didn't know that.\" Usagi said in a small voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought. Stand up.\" Chibiusa said, still glaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi whimpered as she found herself obeying the command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm....Chibiusa-chan....\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can...can I please just apologize for earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can. Feel free. Apologize as much as you want. Beg for forgiveness. See if it helps.\" Chibiusa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi gulped as Chibiusa gave a wicked smile.</span></div></div>",

We wouldn't want them thinking something was wrong.\" Chibiusa commanded, the gears of vengeance turning in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi felt her lips curl into a cheerful smile as she obeyed. Her microphone was disabled, ensuring anybody contacted would be able to see Usagi, but not hear her, and more importantly not hear Chibiusa giving her commands from off screen. With her heart pounding away frantically in her chest, Usagi deliberately went through her list of contacts, opening up a video chat with each and every one. A chorus of greetings erupted from the computer's speakers as people began to answer, each new voice adding to the senshi's growing dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That everyone? All the other senshi, your other friends and acquaintances? Good, good.\" Chibiusa mused as she listened to the greetings begin to turn to confused questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's make things interesting. How about... oh!

Usagi's friends watched their monitors in confusion, as the Sensei turned her back to them, and bent over. She leaned on her chair with one hand, while the other lifted up her skirt, exposing her rear to everyone through the webcam, with mixed reactions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as Chibiusa had commanded, Usagi raised her right hand in the air and brought it down on her ass. It stung badly, and began to leave a red handprint on her cheek, while Usagi's audience watched the Senshi spank herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to smile! You're enjoying this, remember?\" Chibiusa told her. Usagi, still smiling, spanked herself a second time, her audience mixed with shock, concern and excitement. Despite her forced expression, Usagi's face glowed red with humiliation, despite that she was under Chibiusa's hypnosis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget the other cheek!\" Chibiusa reminded Usagi. Immediately, Usagi switched hands, now leaning on the chair with her right hand, while her left delivered the first spank to her left cheek. Usagi wanted to cry. The pain wasn't that bad, but it was enough to reduce her to tears, but the humiliation of spanking herself against her will was far worse. Unfortunately, Chibiusa had total control over her, so all she could do was smile, as she gave herself another dozen or so spanks per cheek, switching every two or three spanks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not take that skirt off to spank yourself easier?\" Chibiusa suggested. Usagi felt her hands pull her skirt around her ankles, and almost started spanking again until Chibiusa continued. \"And those panties. You want to feel the spanking, don't you?\" Usagi really didn't want to feel it, or remove her underwear. But she had no say in the matter, and soon found her skirt and panties around her ankles, while she was otherwise naked from the waist down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi had her back to the webcam, but she heard the audiences reactions as they got a good look at her bare ass and pussy as she bent over further. Many of the reactions were that of cheers and whistles, however a few of Usagi's friends seemed to either remain quiet or display signs of sympathy or concern. Nevertheless, none of them took their eyes off of the sailor scout as she spanked her bare ass in front of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Usagi's ass was a light Shade of red, with dozens of handprints mashed together. Her ass was so sore that even a small tap would cause her to cry in pain. Then again, she wasn't exactly known for having a high pain tolerance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop.\" Chibiusa finally told her. Usagi silently sighed, relieved, but still red with shame and almost in tears from pain. However, her hope was dashed, as Chibiusa commanded her next to... </span></div></div>",

You will also find anything embarrassing arousing example peeing yourself, getting pantsed, and ect.

Now as your next command take your belt and use that to spank yourself.\" Usagi's mind changed to Chibiusa's command's and that she is enjoying her self spanking.

Even better, this fact earned a chuckle out of Usagi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... that was pretty fun.\" Usagi admitted, unable to hide her smile. \"Still.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh my. Please stop. You are both too precious to fight like this. It breaks my heart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youma called Yoko (for lack of a better name, at least any easily pronounced in a human language) snapped its fingers. The two struggling senshi found themselves freed once more. This time the sudden separation did cause both girls to fall over themselves, as the monster had expected. A moment later, the pair found themselves bound once more, kneeling on the floor, their legs entwined and their most intimate of spaces between their legs pressed firmly together in the most humiliating manner possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! No! Get off me!\" Rei cried again, trying to disentangle herself from her blonde companion, her whole body blushing deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! No! Stop! Wait!\" Usagi squeeled in desperation. \"I-ACK! STOPITSTOPITSTOPITSTOP!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei gasped in shock as Usagi grabbed her companion by both shoulders and rolled them both around the stage so that the blonde haired girl was on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop.\" Usagi said, her words a command and a plea all at once. Her demeanor was intensely serious. \"Please. I can't take any more of that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color drained from Rei's face, only to surge back with a brighter shade of crimson than before. Her anger was now directed inward. What they needed was the cool, reasoned fighter Rei prided herself for being, and what they had got was Rei losing her temper at the worst possible moment. Like always. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that too!\" Usagi said, apparently reading something on Rei's face she had hoped to keep hidden. \"You-you have a right to be mad at me! Its my fault all this happened in the first place! So no beating yourself up either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei sighed and smiled through her immense blush. What the Youma didn't understand, and probably never would, was the reason Usagi could lead her team. It wasn't that she was the fastest, or toughest, or smartest of them all. It was that in spite of (or was it because of?) her seeming naivety, she knew her senshi better than anyone. Including themselves, often enough. They strengths and their weaknesses- Usagi could read these things like a book. For all their power and determination, the team would likely have given up long ago without Usagi there to keep their hopes alive. And here she was now coaching them both through the most humiliating ordeal of their lives!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Rei whispered. \"But...I'm sorry if I hurt you just now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Usagi's turn to blush. \"You...didn't. You...were trying to get free, and the Youma kept us glued together so....you were...rubbing up against me. A lot. And it felt...really good. And I needed you to stop before...ummm...burst...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei's eyes widened and her cheeks flushed anew. \"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair suddenly found it very desirable to look at anything other than one another. Of course, the extreme intimacy of their posture and the crowded audience that was watching the pair with baited breath and whirring video cameras helped not a wit. Fortunately, an object to focus their hatred on volunteered in the form of a loud snicker from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! This is way better than I expected! Who knew the Sailor Senshi were these huge balls of unresolved sexual tension just waiting to pop? Man, gimme some popcorn and a soda and this would be perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" The two senshi screamed in unison, their faces burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it just occurred to me...that guy with the stupid mask who throws the flowers? You and he are a thing, right blondie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi blushed. \"Yeah? What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he and you used to be a thing, right fire slut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell do you even know all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trade secret, hon. I'm just thinking, the guy has a habit of crashing our fun when we have you cornered like you are now. I wonder what his reaction will be to seeing his girlfriend and his ex naked and pressed so very tightly against each other? Is he the type to be jealous or embarrassed or turned on? Cause I'm hoping for the last two but you know em better than I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls cringed with that fresh nightmare scenario playing out in their heads. The thought of complete strangers seeing them naked was bad enough. People they knew, let alone had had a relationship with? Somehow far worse was the thought of being seen like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm make a deal with ya, though. I could just zipped your lips together to shut you up. But the first time two lovers kiss is a big deal. It'd suck if I had to steal it from ya. And it would be soooo much more satisfying knowing you two sailor sluts did it of your own volition. So...do it. Press those naked little bodies of yours together right now. Gets those tongues moving in and out of your cute little mouths. Squeeze those big titties up against each other. Get to know each other better than you ever wanted to! Oh, and if the mood strikes you, do feel free to screw each other silly in front of all these people! Impress me with how slutty you really are, and I miiiiight let you two go. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yes show how slutty the Sailor Senshi truly are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi and Rei were shocked on have this felt. They thought this was going to feel weird or disgusting but know this feel nice.

Yoko continue to grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi and Rei warp their arms around each over tightly. Their breasts squeeze against each other. They did not care any more of who was watching them.

Then Yoko snapped her figers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi fell on her back and Rei landed on her. Both girls continue to make out. Both girls bodies began to heat up. Rei could not take it any more. She dose not care any more about who was watching. She began to rub her womanhood against Usagi's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi eyes shot open in shock. She knew this was wrong but she was loving it.

Don't you two look adorable, with your cute little bottoms stuck together and your bouncy naked bodies on display!\" The youma giggled. \"Guess what girls! I have a surprise for youuuuuu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi and Rei found their movement suddenly haulted, as their feet became stuck to the floor. Then, to their mutual alarm, their legs began to push themselves apart like a pair of scissors. The pair were blushing profusely, especially Rei who still faced the audience. From above their tormentor extended her hands in either direction. Miniature sparks of black lightning danced in her palms, soon forming into a pair of egg shaped midnight black crystals, unnaturally smooth and glossy and filled with a sinister energy. She slowly descended to the ground, grinning a sadistic smile at her prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what the hell are those?\" Rei stammered, her anxiety at being stared at battling with the ominous way the monster was relishing the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? Oh these? Nothing much. Just concentrations of dark energy tailored to resonate with your emotions. Just think of them as batteries, and you two are the chargers. I do have a quota to fill, after all. These will serve as conduits to the dark kingdom, sucking up all your emotional shame and embarrassment and channeling it back to my queen. And please allow me to thank you both for your generous contribution to the Queen Beryll's righteous cause!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if! We'll get rid of those things the second you leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you will try. But you may find the task a of dislodging them a little difficult!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twin crystals rose up into the air, then floated toward the two girls. Dipping lower, the orbs continued their journey as the senshi's eyes widened in realization. Gasping in shock and indignation, Usagi and Rei blushed intensely as they felt more than saw small stones insert themselves between their legs. The two girls gasped and squeeled in dismay as the orbs gently but insistently pushed up into their vaginas, the smooth and cold crystals sending little shocks up their spines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whe-whe-when I get out of this, th-there won't even be moondust left of you!\" Usagi stammered, beyond humiliated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, girls. No one likes a swore loser.\" The youma smirked, snapping its fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair gasped as the stones began to vibrate deep within them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to get your emotions under control, ladies. Those stones are reacting directly to your emotions. The more shame and embarrassment you feel, the more energy you provide and the more the stones will resonate! Oh, and just a heads up, they will actively resist being removed. Physically pulling them out is pretty much impossible, and I crafted the little beauties such that direct applications of magic will just get absorbed along with your emotions! No attempt to dispel them is gonna work, and even throwing around your cute little attacks will get them 'resonating' like crazy! And there may be some...cosmetic changes to your costumes as well....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't...\" Usagi said in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally did! Your going to find that the excess energy that goes into materializing your fuku and skirt is gonna get sapped by your new wombmate there (snerk!). If either of you idiots dare show your faces in public again, you'll be doing it in shoes, gloves, chokers, tiaras...and nothing else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair blushed in outrage and anger, only to immediately give a dismay moan of pleasure as their emotions amplified the vibrations between their legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp! Just about time for me to call it a day! But don't worry. I've got one more surprise! Just need a change of venue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they knew what was happening Rei and Usagi found themselves on a moving platform. They were on a (blessedly empty) subway car moving through downtown Tokyo. Their bodies were still stuck together, their legs were still wide apart, but now their feet were stuck to the floor and their hands were rising high above their heads to grasp one of the dangling rings the subway provided as a handhold to its passengers. They were standing in the very center of the car, right in front of the main doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp! I've got to go ladies! Don't worry. My sticky little magic spell will disappear as soon as you starve it of energy. Basically, once you calm down and stop feeling embarrassed about being stuck butt naked in the middle of your city you two will be free to go. Free to walk back butt naked together with a vibrator stuck in your nethers and the knowledge that hundreds of strangers know what you two cuties look like naked! Oh yeah, just a heads up. We're not done yet. I'm just gonna give you a breather while I gather more strength. Be ready to be stripped and fucked with wherever and whenever I get the urge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE US LIKE THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax, blondie. I worked a little enchantment into the stones. For normal mortals, thoughts of violence and violation are gonna be sucked right out of their heads. Kinda like how it feeds off your emotions, but rather than bask in the 'background radiation' of your shame (and thus allowing you both to feel every inch of embarrassment) it directly draws out the most dangerous desires of those around you. Meaning any time some fuckass gets it in their heads to do anything to you two more harmful than a friendly grope...well, my jewels will get it right out of their heads!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but...we're still naked here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! And the business day is just coming to an end. Right now hordes of middle aged blue collars are milling about the subway stations, waiting to climb onboard and go home. You two will give em a nice surprise, I'm sure!! Oh, by the by, I picked this particular route because it passes through your neighborhoods. Your fathers both use this particular train, and odds are good the family of your fellow senshi take it from time to time as well. So there's a fair chance somebody you know and talk with every day is about to gawk at your nubile young naked bodies and commit every inch of you two to memory. Or a camera phone. Probably a camera phone, really! Enjoy the exposure and the inevitable groping! Oh, and do try to stay calm! I'd hate for either of you to get so distressed that your gems set you off and you end up cumming in front of everyone! Trust me, the way they are rigged, if either of you go off it will be big and loud and obvious to anyone who happens to see it. Anyway, here's the next stop! Good luck girls! See you in a few days! In the meantime, try not to fuck with any more youma! Cause what happened to night is NOTHING to what I'm capable of! Tah-tah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei and Usagi were left there, gasping and trembling and awaiting their inevitable humiliation as the train slowed to a stop. On either side of them the doors opened automatically to reveal....</span></div></div>",

Ami quickly transformed and race off to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes to find them. Ami sighed. They were arguing. Ami could not believe this. She jump down into the alley. She walked up to them. \" Moon and Mar what going on.\" She said. They were arguing so loud they do not her Mercury. Ami was furious with them. They were naked but were to busy arguing to care. \"Girls stop is!\" Stouted Mercury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi and Rei both stop arguing.

She was now wearing her school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave Yoko a wicked idea. \"Now strip naked.\" Ordered Yoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blush with embarrassment and anger.

This leaving her in her white cotton bra and panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko just sighed. \"Why couldn't you wear something more sexy.\" Said Yoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Ami blushed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the annals of the Sailor Scouts the man known as Mamoru Chiba is something of an aberration. As wit all the Senshi he was born as both the guardian and mythical embodiment of a planet or celestial body. And as it happened, his guardian world was the Earth itself. Under normal circumstances that would have made him one of the most powerful entities in the Sol System. But for reasons understood only to the nebulous forces of the universe the powers of a Sailor Senshi could only be fully unlocked by a female incarnation. Being the only male in a group of mystical warriors largely doomed Tuxedo Mask to fall behind his comrades. While he was easily the equal of any of the Inner Senshi when they had first awakened, the girls had the ability to awakened stronger forms (first their Super states, and later the Eternal transformation). Tuxedo Mask thus had to rely on his wits and the base abilities his status granted him- superhuman reflexes and agility, a cane capable of extending to incredible lengths, and of course his trademark ability to manifest roses with thorns sharp enough to penetrate virtually any defense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, none of this really mattered to the princess of the Senshi. Usagi cared far more about their shared history (a tragic romance between the kingdom of the moon and Earth that had been cut short due to the manipulations of Queen Beryl and the utter annihilation of the Sailor Senshi...or rather A annihilation of them). She still had unresolved feelings from a past life, which made for a vaguely understood but firm determination for a better outcome this time around. Also...he was hot. As seemed to be consistent with every example of the Senshi, he was a well built, athletic, and extremely good looking example of his sex (another apparent inexplicable rule of the universe- there were no ugly or even average Senshi- each was physically stunning and beautiful, some subtly alluring and others simply drop dead gorgeous- which perhaps was all too appropriate for men and women embodying the legends of planets and gods from times long past). Or, to put it more simply- all the Senshi looked good naked, and Mamoru was no exception. Or so Usagi had every reason to believe. Perhaps tonight was the night to find out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where exactly is Mamoru?</span></div></div>",

Just a word of warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very familiar laugh echoed down the alleyway. Minako faltered just as she was about to transform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ace?\" She said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFair to say that fate had always played a strange role in the life of the Sailor Senshi. Old truimphs and tragedies from their first lives as Princesses and Guardians of their respective worlds were often revisited in their modern lives. The obvious example was the romance between Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask. But for Minako there was the peculiar parallels that popped up between her and Usagi. Both carefree blondes with a love of fun and an abiding hatred for schoolwork, both tossed into the world of the senshi by a feline mentor...and both protected by a mysterious masked guardian. For Usagi that was her Mamoru. For Minako it had been Ace Kaitou, a celebrity by day and hero by night. Where Tuxedo Mask used razor sharp roses, Phantom Ace (as he was also known) used equally deadly playing cards as his signature attack. He had saved young Minako from death more times than she could count. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was supposed to be dead. She knew this because she was the one who killed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look more beautiful than ever, Venus.\" said the silver haired man as he strode into the alley, his carefully tailored uniform a match for his hair. Not for the first time Minako was struck by his resemblance to Helios in his human guise (minus the horn, of course)...if somewhat older and a bit colder in demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....HOW? How can you be here?\" Minako whispered, her head spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, you seem surprised. All the times you were able to cheat death with that silver imperium crystal, yet it surprises you that I had a way to do the same?\" Ace smiled humorlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its been so long since...I killed you.\" Minako said, her eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well...I wanted to be completely certain that you had exhausted your supply of enemies. I wanted your full attention, and I know how easy it is for the Lady Venus to be caught up in her duties.\" Ace said with a touch of bitterness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many millenia ago Ace had been called Adonis, a lonely soldier assigned to guard Venus and her castle. The poor fool had been instantly smitten with her beauty and dedication. Busy as she was with the protection of the Solar System, the young princess had never thought more of him than a dependable servant in her entourage. Still he loved her enough to take that in stride, knowing she would never have time for such trifles as romance, wishing that one day he might have the power to change their fates. And fate gave him that chance by reincarnating him into the modern world, even as it cruelly set him on a very different path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't leave me any choice. You know that! If I had let you survive you would have hurt so many people!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. I did TRY to fight my fate, Princess. I helped you as much as I could as the Phantom Ace. But I had another role to play. The Dark Kingdom found me before we had a chance to meet again. As Danburite I was required to be your enemy. And you destroyed me, as I knew you would. Then and now it was always duty before love.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DID love you.\" Venus whispered. \"Killing you hurt more than anything I ever did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which I suppose means I served both my masters when I made you love me.\" Ace chuckled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\",,,,What do you want? What path are you following anymore? Your Dark Kingdom is dead, and I'm not a princess anymore. So what is this all about? Revenge? A second chance? What path are you walking now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....maybe both. Maybe neither. I've had a chance to think over these past few years. And honestly...I've haven't had any fun at all. That's our problem, Venus. All work and no play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako smirked despite her unease. \"I know how to play just fine, Kaitou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you? You put on a carefree air, but is that the truth? I've seen below the mask a few times already, Miss Aino. Evenafter years of peace you still wrap yourself up in your duties. Oh, you've had many lovers, but I doubt you've ever really BEEN in love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I had a bad experience.\" Minako said, glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But that's the problem, isn;t it? You and I have always been servants. Adonis served you, and you served the moon princess. Now you STILL serve the moon princess, and Danburite served your enemies. No wonder I thought I couldn't change our fates. We've spent all our lives doing what others told us. I think from now on I choose my own path. No more bowing to anyone else's will. I want to see what its like to be in control. To dominate. And then too...I want to free you from the shackles you've bound yourself in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......I don't know what your talking about. But I'm happy where I am now! And its not like I can just start trusting you again, especially with an entrance like you just made!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very smart of you, Minako-chan. I'm no longer on the Dark Kingdom's side, but that doesn't mean I'm standing with the light again. In fact, I think its safe to say I'm on no one's side except my own. But you misunderstood. I don't expect you to trust me. I'm just here to have fun with you. Whether you like it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Tch. You may not have noticed, Ace, but we've been fighting evil for a long time now. I'm officially one of the strongest Senshi in the Galaxy! You won't stand a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Then show me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VENUS STAR POWER, MAKE UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce smiled thinly as Minako began her transformation. Her clothes dissolved as a warm orange glow suffused her body. A magical starburst came gushing from her wand, encircling her nude form in a lovely little light show. But in one fluid motion Phantom Ace let a single card fly in the midst of the transformation. Minako cried in surprise as the projectile struck the transformation wand, knocking it out of her hand. The wand clattered to the ground, the starburst continuing to swirl around it. A moment later the orange stars flew upward in a dramatic circle all around the wand. Jewels, gloves, shoes, and a white on orange fuku blinked into being in midair....and fell uselessly to the floor as the wand had inexplicably found itself out of range of the young girl it was expected to clothe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako was now quite naked save for the ribbon in her hair. Her eyes growing as wide as dinner plates, she let out a shrill scream and tried to cover herself. It wasn't terribly effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He later showed up right beside to all of Minako's stuff and proceed to lift them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you think you're doing?! Put down all of my stuff right now! OR ELSE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else what?\" Ace said in a amused way. \"You're gonna kill me again Venus dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You deserve a fate worse than death after humiliating me like this! VENUS LOVE ME CHAIN\" Minako tried to enhance her mytical chain, leaving her completely exposed, which made her blush furiously, but to her horror her chain wouldn't materialize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?!\" She was really concerned she couldn't execute her attack. \"VENUS CRECENT BEAM\" Another one of her signature attacks, but couldn't perform it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME ACE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I've done nothing at all, you're not under the effects of some curse casted by me or anything else, basically when I knocked out your wand I interrupted your transformation sequence before you could change into your Sailor outfit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't explain why I'm stark naked! I was supposed to change back into my civilian clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where you're wrong my dear Venus, tell me if it isn't truth that when you perform your transformation you are momentarily stripped from your civilian clothes, leaving you stark naked\" Minako cheeks burned as she realized Ace was damn right, thus timidly nodding. \"Well, that's because you're body is infused with the magic to become Sailor Venus, so does you're clothing, what I'm trying to say is... Your civilian clothes transform along with you, they become the outfit you usually wear, but currently you aren't\" Ace laughed for himself. \"So, unless you change into your fuku, skirt and other arrangements you won't be able to wear any clothes or change into your civilian form\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, WHAT?! What do you mean?!\" Minako's eyes and voiced were filled with horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you're consciously Minako Aino, you're a completely different person when you transform, you're Sailor Venus at that moment, not Minako Aino, and to attain your Sailor identity you must also get rid of you clothes as Minako Aino, but since you're transformation was interrupted, you won't be able to wear any clothes since they're not part of Sailor Venus wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really expect me to swallow that lie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna bet?\" Ace said as she snapped his finger to make a towel appear and tossed to Minako, who right away wrapped herself with it, <br>\r\nbut then her body began to glow orange again. Moments later the towel was gone! She stared in stunned silence before again covering herself. \"See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU BASTARD!!\" Minako shouted angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Calm down babe! A lady shouldn't say horrible words like that, here I'm trying to be nice with you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice with me?! You know what? SCREW YOU! GO TO HELL! I'M TAKING MY STUFF RIGHT NOW!\" Not caring to cover herself anymore, Minako rushed towars Ace to snatch all her stuff from his hands, but moved swiftly out of Minako's reach standing about 5 meters away form her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! That's not the proper way for a lady to behave herself, I guess a bad girl like you needs a punishment\" Ace proceed to snap his fingers again, only this time making Minako's stuff to fully vanish infront of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\" Minako's scream was Ace's greatest pleasure. \"Why are you doing this?! What do you want from me?!\" She said at the verge of crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to play a little game\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I just want to have some fun, like I said before, I'm not on evil's side anymore, but neither of good's side, I have no interest of world conquest or something like that. Back on topic, you want your stuff back? Then you'll have to take part in my little game, or you could be brave and stupid enough to try going back home, though it won't that easy with me watching on the line. So what do you say my dear Venus? Would you kindly play my little game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako's situation was critical, she was in all her glory completely at his first lover and worst enemy's mercy.

In the name of Venus, I'll punish you!!\" Minako screamed, grabbing the lid off the trashcan to shield her nudity while freeing her other hand. \"VENUS CRESCENT BEAM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed. Venus began to blush intensely as it sank in that the expected beam of energy was not manifesting, and indeed all that had happened was that a well endowed naked girl barely hidden behind a trashcan lid was rather forcefully pointing at her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem. Yeah. That little wand does more than get you dressed. It also infuses you with the magic you use to fight. Until it manages to complete the transformation, you won't be making any of those famous senshi attacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako blushed intensely, then took in a breath and closed her eyes in concentration.

Until the transformation completes itself, there won't be any turning back into a civilian either.\" Ace said smuggly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D...Don't just stand there!

That word seems a little inelegant. Perhaps you could dress it up a bit more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...You....PRETTY please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still having trouble hearing you. Maybe that trash can is blocking your voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako made several inarticulate noises in response, putting the trashcan down on the ground. \"And I'm guessing my hands might make it hard to hear too, right?\" She asked as she put her hands behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably would at that. So, what were you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty please help me get some clothes! Pretty Pretty please with cherries and whipped cream give me something to wear!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. All you had to do was ask.\" Ace said, producing a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako snatched up the thin shield of modesty and wrapped it tightly around herself. She was about to tell Ace what she thought of him when her body began to glow orange. Moments later the towel was gone! She stared in stunned silence before again covering herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....you....JERK!\" Minako cried and ran back into the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, next time you should ask. Obviously, the transformation is only half way done. Since the first thing the wand does when turning you into a soldier is make your civilian clothes vanish then obviously any new clothes you put on are going to continue vanishing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\" Minako said darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case...\" Ace began, then paused. There was a lot of noise at the other end of the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said she ducked in here! I don't-WHA! Minako, why are you naked??\" Came the bubbly voice of Usagi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is! And look at that guy! Bet its all his fault!\" Rei cried behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you! Are you the one zapping up chunks of the street and chasing Minako here?\" Makoto screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! Hellow, Sailor scouts. Yes, that was me. Is there a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody is asking for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys! Wait! Don't-\" Minako began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MARS STAR POWER, MAKE UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOON STAR POWER, MAKE UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MERCURY STAR POWER, MAKE UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUPITER STAR POWER, MAKE UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako gave Ace a pleading look, but was only answered by his sly smile. In his hand he held up four playing cards, and quick as lightning threw them into the tumult of lights and magic. Minako felt as if she was on the verge of tears as new pillars of light bloomed behind the senshi. After a moment of blinding colors, the lights fell away to reveal four naked adolescents standing in dramatic poses and a whole mess of fukus lying at the mouth of the alley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I think that's enough excitement for one day.\" Ace said, raising up his crystal. Arcs of black lightning shot out from the gem, flying over the heads of the stunned Senshi and impacting on their lost clothes. The garments and items lifted into the air and hurtled toward the gem. With a white fly the items seemed to shrink into nothing, apparently entering the gem itself. \"I'll hold onto these for safe keeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! You can't just leave us like this!\" Minako begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can! But I will leave you with this.\" Ace said, dropping a communicator to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What good will this do??\" Minako demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will let me contact you. After all, how are you going to get your clothes back if you can't hear the challenges I assign to all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ace, please....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be in touch.\" Ace said as began floating into the air.</span></div></div>",

Pulling the phone off the hook, Minako immediately began dialing the Michiru's number. Considering how dedicated Michiru was to her duty as Sailor Neptune, Minako was sure she'd help. Of course, it didn't hurt that Michiru had plenty of money, and would easily be able to pay for the dress in Minako's stead. Minako intended to pay her back, of course, but this would allow her to skip the step of procuring her own money right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Minako, there was a slight problem with her plan.</span></div></div>",

A yellow sphere surrounded by a golden nimbus had plunged into the ground tearing toward's Minako's location, leaving savage cracks in the ground as it passed. Minako's heart skipped a beat, as the missile seemed to be headed right for her. But just as it was going to connect, the orb \"jumped\" out of the ground and into the air some ten feet over Minako's head. It exploded in a burst of light and thunder, blinding and impressive but ultimately harmless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako stood there, stunned, on her knees, hands behind her back, naked and wide eyed. Sailor Uranus stood before her, posed dramatically and glaring at the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from her.\" Haruka bellowed. No fan fare, no poetic speeches about her planet, not even so much as a 'I will punish you'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, this woman is a deviant and needs to be taken in by the police.\" The large man said vehemently. He was a man of conviction, Minako had to give him that. Obviously not very bright, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUranus leapt several feet into the air and came down right next to Minako and her tormentor. She said nothing, but held up her hand. Another sphere of energy materialized in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first shot was a warning. I don't like to repeat myself.\" Uranus said. Minako shivered a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stared at her a moment, then took several steps back. Uranus let the energy dissolve. She looked down at Minako, gathered her up like a groom carrying an bride (albeit for a very unconventional wedding) and leapt back into the air. They cleared the crowd in record time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....You left me!\" Minako said after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't keep up. I had to hide the bike so no one would see us drive off.\" Uranus said matter-of-factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU LEFT ME!\" Minako repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came back as soon as I could!\" Uranus snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVERYONE WAS STARING AT ME AND THAT JERK HANDCUFFED ME AND I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA GET ARRESTED AND I SCARED TO DEATH!\" Minako screamed out all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALL RIGHT. I'M SORRY, OKAY? I THOUGHT YOU WERE BEHIND AND-\" Uranus was cut off by Minako's lips on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Minako said in a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUranus blinked, then smiled her knowing little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have one little problem now. Since you somehow managed to get yourself handcuffed (seriously, are you sure you aren't TRYING to humiliate yourself today?) you don't have a way to hold onto me. So unless we figure out an...unconventional arrangement, it won't be safe to ride. Maybe we should focus on getting those handcuffs off first....\"</span></div></div>",

I mean...my body is going to be right in your face the whole time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka smirked at her. \"Relax.

But seriously...of all the things to worry about. Have you seriously not figured this out by now, Mrs. Senshi-of-Love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figured what out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michiru and I. You know we have an open relationship, right?\" Haruka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\" Minako was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? Did you think all those times you saw me flirting with other girls while Michiru just watched with that bemused look of hers was for show? Or did you think Michi-chan was just a push over?\" Haruka asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? You were serious about every girl you've ever flirted with?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. I do love teasing them, after all. There is nothing cuter in this world than a girl when she blushes...except maybe when she does it naked.\" Haruka said, giving Minako a meaningful look. The Senshi of Venus glowered back at her benefactor. \"But no. I'll flirt with any girl once, but I'll only come back to flirt with girls I'm serious about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? You never pass up a chance to flirt with me or the others every time we see you!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny how that works out, isn't it?\" Haruka said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Minako said, blinking. \"oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka smiled broadly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but you know that...well...that we aren't...like you two. Don't you?\" Minako mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka looked at her for a moment, then snickered to herself and went to retrieve her bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's that for?\" Minako snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Sorry. I'm just...amused, is all. Yes, I will freely admit none of you are lesbians. I've seen you swoon over enough guys to get that.\" Haruka said, examining some of the damage to her cycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why the hell do you keep up the flirting? Don't you know a lost cause when you see one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka snickered again. \"Sure. But the thing is...I've also seen how you act around each other, and other girls. Pretty sure none of you are entirely straight either, Minako-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako stared, eyes wide. \"What? That's...that's ridiculous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't speak for all of them. Ami keeps to herself all the time and seems pretty asexual to me (then again, Michiru insists there's been something there ever since they went swimming together). And Pluto...ha. The only one who understands Pluto is Pluto, and maybe Chibiusa. But the rest of you...yep, I'm positive. Usagi, girl devoted to her Prince, has kissed me in and out of costume four times that I can remember, the majority of them entirely of her own volition (I MAY have stolen the first one). Rei avoids contact with most people in general, but of those she doesn't give the cold shoulder about 90% of them are girls...including a veritable harem of admirers at her catholic school that basically spend the entire day swooning over her. I don't think she minds the attention, despite that famous aloof demeanor she wants to wear. Makoto...eh. Makoto's a touchy subject. I got a lot of crap growing up about how I was 'embracing the masculine' and how I would never make anything of myself. She has a lot of 'masculine' traits of her own, least as far as this idiotic society is concerned. I know she's going through the same crap I had to deal with, and I know she's interested in me because I'm one of the girls who 'made it' in this world like she wants to. But come on. She blushes and stutters and gets shy around me every time we see each other. Its obvious her interest goes way beyond admiration, and its honestly getting awkward waiting for her to get over it or make a move. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako stared at her, watching her work on the bike. Her nudity was almost forgotten in the face of all these revelations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you still haven't said anything about me...\" Minako said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka smirked at her. \"You mean besides the way you threw yourself at me the first time we met?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I THOUGHT YOU WERE A GUY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were also pretty dogged in coming onto the Starlights when they were on this planet...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I THOUGHT THEY WERE GUYS TOO!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, making the same excuse over and over makes it harder to believe you...\" Haruka teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm being serious here!\" Minako said, stamping her foot for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. When we first met you struck me as...ummm....easy, to be blunt. Every week you seemed to be dating someone new, and your ability to flirt with people was impressive even to me. It took a little while to understand. You are the Senshi of Love, and love comes easy for you. It doesn't mean you aren't serious...it means you fall in love very easily, very passionately...and have your heart broken just as simply. I am fairly confident gender, if it enters into the equation at all, takes a back seat to whether or not your in love. You can add your physical attractions on to anyone you take a shine to. In a way, I envy you. In another way, I think it must be very lonely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako found herself without a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...I've been talking way too long. The cops are probably already looking for us. We need to go.\" </span></div></div>",

As Haruka shifted gears, a familiar vibration worked its way up through the engine and flowed into her naked body. An involuntary sound escaped her lips, a surprised gasp that transformed into a lusty moan. Her cheeks reddened and her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMinako, did you say something? Are you hurt?\u201d Haruka asked, briefly turning her attention from the road (and then forcefully dragging her stubborn pupils back to the highway and away from the mesmerizing vision of her friend\u2019s exposed body).<br>\r\n\u201cN-Nope! Everything\u2019s fine!\u201d Minako said, her voice almost cracking.<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.Are you sure? We can stop if your grip is slipping.\u201d Haruka said.<br>\r\n\u201cNOPE! I\u2019m fine!\u201d Minako said desperately. A few factors played into her lie. One was the sheer mortification of having to explain exactly what was happening. As humiliating as her day had been thus far (and Minako had gone through whole worlds of humiliation beyond what she thought was possible!) there was absolutely no way she was going to admit what Haruka\u2019s motorcycle was doing to her. Also, there was an impish little part of her that didn\u2019t want the pleasure to stop. The idea of doing something so obscene in secret right in front of her friend sent a naughty thrill through her. And of course, she had experienced this before. She could handle it. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas for Minako her assessment of this situation was lacking certain important details. First, of course, was the fact that she had previously had the thin protection of her dress between her private places and the humming engine. Second, her current position riding the bike in a way never intended by the manufacturer actually placed far more of her intimate areas in contact with the vibrating heart of the machine than before. Finally, there was the crash. Haruka was by passion and profession a racer and an athlete. Speed was her second love after Michiru. Her bike ranked as a close third. She prided herself on keeping her engine in tune and up to date, putting together nothing but the sturdiest and best parts the market could provide. Most pertinently, the engine inside the bike was the newest, largest, fastest, most turbo charged monstrosity of rubber and steel available. Before the wreck, the motorcycle was carefully designed to mitigate all of that power, to keep the rumbling engine at bay. Now there was a slight bend in the frame, too minute to affect the vehicle\u2019s performance. But that bend had created a slight permutation in the leather seat, a bump that connected whatever it came into contact with directly to a device that hummed with a thousand times more power than the vibrator Minako secretly kept stashed in her sock drawer at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, by whatever machinations and cruel gods had come to wage war on poor Minako\u2019s dignity, her naked pussy lips had managed to find and fully embrace this little bump. With her lovely legs and thighs forced to grip either side of the motorcycle lest she fall off Minako could do nothing but press herself against the machine as it teased her clit and inner folds. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Haruka figured Minako would appreciate keeping unwanted attention away, but she would have to make sure Minako could even hold on first.  \"Minako,\" she shook a little more firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" was the content response.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\"  Haruka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never better,\" Minako said with a smile.  The afterglow of her orgasm was still echoing through her body.  Reality was returning to her, but slowly.  \"Are we almost home yet?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, and we really need to move again,\" Haruka turned her hand, with her thumb pointing at a car approaching the stop light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako turned her head slowly and saw the car.  She had looked at for only a second, before her eyes widened in realization.  Then, she tightened her hold on Haruka as best she could, regaining all the balance she could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that as her signal to move, Haruka revved the motorcycle again and sped away as soon as the light turned green.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako's face was blushing furiously as she was realizing what had happened.  Haruka absolutely knew what she just experienced, she could only hope no one else saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can get to your place quicker if I keep going this way, but there'll be more traffic for sure.  Or we could take the long way through the neighborhood?\"  Haruka suggested as they sped down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako didn't spend a lot of time thinking about her choice, wanting to be out of view.

She had gotten this far, there was no reason not to see it through. She gave a self-assuring nod, and then continued down the steps. Her toes recoiled instinctively as they continued down the stone walkway, each step away from her apartment adding to her apprehension. She was absolutely sure she left the door unlocked, and no one had reason to mess with it, but she still couldn't help the nagging feeling that this was an exceedingly bad idea... the tingling feeling against her bare skin not helping in that regard at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was too late by that point. Ami had already descended half the stairway, and soon enough was at the ground floor of her apartment. From there, it was far more open to exploration. Of course, Ami would also be far more visible... but there wasn't cause for concern there. No one seemed to be around, not even on the sidewalk or street nearby. Which made matters even more perplexing. Who on earth had been at her door? The exterior of her building was absolutely silent, nothing out of place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi sighed in resignation. It had turned out to be pointless, after all. She decided it was time to just go back inside and maybe finish her bath, hopefully to put all thoughts of the incident behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towel-clad girl turned around and started to head back upstairs, when she heard it. A loud clattering sound from the other end of the apartment building. Ami nearly jumped, feeling a fear-induced shiver go through her as she quickly looked over. She had dreaded that someone had come outside and noticed her, but it wasn't that. At the far end of the nearest expanse of apartments, she saw a metal trash can rocking slightly. Someone must have disturbed it... probably a stray cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, once again, Ami's curiosity was piqued. Maybe it was whoever knocked on her door. Though why would they be trying to get her attention in such a way? It was warranting further investigation, but that meant going further away from the stairs... and her apartment. She was starting to take too many risks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill... her curiosity was beginning to feel insatiable, unless she indulged it.

She knew she was really pushing her luck, but she had a lead. A lead that begged to be investigated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi knew she couldn't resist further, and before she could debate the internal struggle any further, she realized her feet were carrying her down the hall. She was practically out in the open, then. A girl clearly wearing just a towel walking past several apartments and in view of the street should someone pass by. Even though no one was watching, this thought spurned Ami's feet into moving a little quicker. She had to get this over with. A brisk pace carried her to the end of the hall after a handful of seconds, and she leaned over it. Nothing out of the ordinary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi was starting to feel foolish. All that was there besides the container was a few others for recyclables, and a larger dumpster for bulk disposal. There was clearly nothing there, and it was high past time she got back home. The girl straightened and began to turn back, when she froze in her tracks. \"M'roowwww.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned halfway back, and stared in surprise at the culprit responsible for the noise. A small cat, clearly a stray.  Maybe a year or two old, it looked up at Ami with another innocent meow. Ami gave a look around, then smiled at the cat. \"Why are you out here all alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a vague response, it just meowed again. Ami was no closer to solving the riddle that had brought her there, but... maybe this was had happened for a reason. She could always take the cat back to her apartment and give it some food. It did look hungry. It was going to slow her down, though, and the morning was getting later.

The previously curious cat had begun to squirm, and then with a vicious hiss, began to struggle and pull itself out of Ami's hands. Ami had stumbled backward with a startled gasp as the stray gave a parting swipe of its paw. That was the last thing it did before leaping down from her hands and taking off around a nearby corner, vanishing from sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi cringed as she felt her rear land against the ground. Her backside was cushioned by the thin presence of her towel, but it hadn't absorbed much of the impact. She sighed as she watched the cat go. So much for-... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi felt something strange. A draft all along her skin. In the moment she felt a telltale shiver go all across her body, she stared down and saw that her towel was lying open beneath her, and she was sitting completely naked over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\" Ami clamored in a brief panic, getting to her feet as she pulled the towel up and around her briefly exposed flesh while she searched the area in growing panic. No one was around. If they had been, surely they'd have said something.  She sighed deeply, hurriedly tying the towel back together around her to conceal herself once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least... she had meant to. The swipe from the cat had left a ragged series of scratches across the front of the towel. Ami had narrowly evaded being injured herself, but the horizontal traces of the damage were right over where her breasts should have been covered. Her inner and outer cleavage could be plainly made out, and if she didn't take care, even her nipples threatened to peek out. She blushed furiously, and quickly turned the towel so that the damage was across her back instead. This meant she had to tie it behind her instead of in front of her, but it was a tiny hindrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi had to get back before things got any worse. She nodded to herself and began to hurriedly pass the nearby apartments to return to the stairway. Her feet touched across the stone as fast as she could, walking briskly without going into a full-on run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy had the cat attacked her? She was just being nice! It frustrated her to no end, but she was ready to put it out of her mind and head upstairs when she froze yet again. Out of the corner of her eye, at the other end of the building... she had seen a flash of motion. Someone or something disappearing from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad someone seen her!? Ami felt her blood go cold. No, maybe it was just someone passing by... or another animal. Ami's mind raced with the possibilities. If it had been a person, maybe she could explain herself so they wouldn't think less of her. Or if it wasn't, she could put her worries to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, her curiosity was tugging at her, no less desiring a solid answer than it had before the cat incident.

The toweled girl continued her brisk pace right past her stairs, with a twinge of reluctance at yet again passing a chance to go back to her apartment, before passing the next set of doors and approaching the corner. The morning was gradually getting warmer, and the daylight brighter. She had to get this over with before it got actually hot, or worse, people starting being out and about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned around the corner, expecting to see another flash of someone running from her. No, all she saw was the expanse of grass and landscaping beside the apartment, and a few cars parked nearby. Maybe she was really just imagining things. Ami sighed and turned around, beginning to head away from the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had almost forgotten that the back of her towel had been marked with several scratches until she felt the draft against her shoulders. Ami frowned, blushing and hesitating to pull the fabric tighter around her body. Was she imagining things, or did it seem to be sinking lower around her chest? She made a point to tug it up higher to conceal the hint of cleavage, and found the hem was inching up higher on her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course... the towel was still a little damp. The bunching up of the fabric was to be expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was fine, she would be home at her apartment in mere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreeek. Ami nearly leapt into the air as the nearest apartment door opened. She quickly backed out of sight as a woman in a formal business suit left, looked around, and began walking to her nearby car.

With her balance thrown off, she had tried turning away and tried escape whatever had her towards the grass again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft flop, she had slipped on the wet grass.  Ami was only quick enough to land on her hands and knees.  Thankfully, she  was unharmed, albeit in a bit of a more embarrassing position.  Being on her hands and knees lead to her tush being elevated, revealing that the red faced girl was moist in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi looked toward her ankles and saw that she had been ensnared in a garden hose.  It was kept in a bit of a tangled mess, and that is what had caused her to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thankful that it was simply a hose catching her, and not a person.  So, she reached towards the tangled mess to free herself.  But when she tried to do this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her hands were settled right in a cold, fresh layer of dark grey paint. The entire section of sidewalk in front of her apartment, no less. Which meant... she'd have to walk through wet paint to get there. Worse, her palms and fingers were covered in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter. She was almost there! Ami took in a deep breath, got up and fought back a shiver as she stepped through the paint, dreading the marks she was leaving. She'd explain it later, it was still better than being stuck outside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately it only took a few steps to reach her door. Ami took a deep breath, reached for her knob and turned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she expected, she felt no resistance of a lock. It was clearly unlocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn't expect was for her wet hands to have trouble gripping it. \"H, honestly...!\" Her fingers kept slipping, making it difficult to turn her door knob all the way. Her eyes widened as she looked around in growing panic, a chill slowly going through her. Not just from sheer alarm, but the fact that she was standing in wet paint. Ami had to do something before she was see-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creaking door beside her apartment quickly drew her attention. Ami's eyes widened, and she reacted without thinking.

She winced, feeling her exposed breasts swaying freely through the liquid beneath her. That was going to require a lot of washing off, but that could wait. Ami pressed down with her hands and feet, and... remained lying on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body refused to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W, what is going on...!?\" Ami's eyes went wide, and she tried to struggle, but found to her horror that her previously swaying breasts were soon slowing their movement and halting altogether... as if they were bound in place. \"Oh no, n... not like this...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatters soon got much worse.  She heard a set of footsteps approach behind her, and she took only a little solace in knowing whoever it was could only see her rear end and not everything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M, miss...uh... we had... to use some cement to get the paint to dry faster, so...um-... you might be stuck there until I can get some solution to undo it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W, what!?

I'll get something from the truck to help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait, don't le-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was gone, and Ami was stuck lying there for several agonizing minutes with her nakedness on evident display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she heard some footsteps approach, and a stark chill of cold liquid splashing over her. \"AH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... uh, should help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi winced, closing her eyes as she felt the sensation beneath her loosening. Then she finally was able to move her arms. She immediately moved her hands to cover what had to be covered before sitting up, hesitantly looking back to the man once her hand was between her legs and the other arm was across her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T, thank you, I... \" Ami froze, staring in growing horror at the painter... and a uniformed woman beside him. \"...w, who are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, you're under arrest for indecent exposure.\" Ami tried to explain, but she was detained within a minute. The officer had been nice enough to give Ami a blanket... before putting her in the back of a police car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had only taken an hour before Makoto, at Ami's desperate behest, had gotten her freed from custody, once everything was cleared up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi was still red-faced as she left the station, holding a blanket tight around her shoulders. \"H, how are we getting home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto blinked at Ami innocently as they stopped just before the door leading outside. \"Uh, I walked here... didn't you bring any c-...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto looked over the girl wearing nothing but a blanket, and realization dawned on her as she was soon blushing bright red. \"...you'll... just need to walk very carefully, okay?\" Makoto tried to give the barely-clad female a reassuring smile, but Ami instead felt her body shaking shortly before she blacked out into Makoto's arms.</span></div></div>",

She wiped off her wet hands on her thighs as best she could, took up the box, and then reached to open her door with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all it had taken.

Even if there had been some silly restriction on the foreign works, no one would object to her using them, as often as she was there. Her reputation did precede her, in a sense, and her taste in works was well regarded. If Ami ever needed a book, the staff would be certain it was for very good reason, and happily oblige her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, had she known her reputation was on the verge of being forever changed, she would have let this book go. Ami did no such thing, and instead let curiosity spurn her onward until she'd read the entire strange passage aloud. Her voice was barely above a whisper, but she felt compelled to test out her spoken enunciation of the Latin phrase rather than mentally voice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the lights in the library began to flicker. It was a momentary occurrence, almost subliminal, but the sort that was beyond ignoring once observed. She hadn't imagined it. Even though the lights immediately went back to normal, she couldn't get it out of her mind. The timing of that had been, well, creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi was getting the hint. It was time to put the book away and find something else, or maybe just go home altogether. Then just as she reached for the book, she felt an electric tingling sensation shoot through her. From her fingertips to her ears and straight down to her toes, it coursed through her like a rippling aftershock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W, what on earth...\" Then before her eyes, the Latin phrase began to change. As if someone, or some<i>thing</i>, had taken the ink on the page and molded it to make other characters like one would a batch of clay. Soon enough it was Japanese, and Ami understood it perfectly. As her eyes widened, she realized with growing horror that those had been the very words she'd just spoken... Latin or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ami spoke them aloud again, her voice was even softer, and far, far shakier. 'In p-....penance... all my... earthly possessions... must be f, forsaken...for the day...\" Penance? Earthly possessions? Was it some kind of chastising punishment for sinners? It made no sense to Ami... but when her hands began to move from the table and reach for her own collar, the meaning of them became far clearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers were soon undoing the collar of her blouse. They were as literal as could be. \"No, no... I, I can't stop myself...!\" Ami whispered in a somewhat louder tone as fear began to settle in. How was the book compelling her? How could she stop it?! Ami had no idea, but if she didn't do something, she was going to undress right then and there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still the book. Maybe she could undo this horrible effect by using another passage... or maybe that would make it worse. She could simply hide, and try to get a hold of herself,or even ask for help. Surely someone would understand Ami would never do that of her own accord!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Ami felt her top button coming apart, she made her choice. Ami decided to...</span></div></div>",

Another whisper left her lips, unbidden. \"For... for the day...\" She felt her feet running along one another, and soon Ami was taking off her shoes. Then her toes each tugged off her petite socks, leaving her barefoot. \"No, no, not here...! I... forsake all...NO!\" Ami bit into her lip to keep her panicked voice from getting louder. The barefoot girl's eyes widened as her fingers began to toy with her bra, unclasping it from behind her back. \"Oh no, no not here...!\" Snap. The bra came apart... and dropped. Ami's breasts fell into view, and then her hands were at her skirt, pulling it apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear as day that if Ami didn't do something, and FAST, she was going to wind up absolutely, irrevocably naked.

She felt the cool air of the library drifting along the curves of her own rear, and Ami knew it was as real as could be. Despite her frantic shaking, her hands had exerted no restraint. Ami's fingers had tugged the thin underwear down along her pelvic muscles, thighs, and then her legs even lifted one after the other...and her panties were off, lying discarded along the carpet of the library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she felt her shaking hands trace upward along her bare hips, a tangible reminder to the obviousness of her plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi was standing naked amidst her discarded clothing, with only her shaky hands concealing her full-blown nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W, why... why is this happening..!?\" The girl whispered to herself deliriously,  desperate to conceal herself as she backed up against a bookshelf, staring downward in disbelief at her clothing which she'd effortlessly taken off. Worse, she felt no compulsion to put them back on! Her mind pleaded at her to put something on, of course... but her hands would not move. As if she was <i>meant</i> to stay that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she going to do!? It was still early in the day. If Ami drew even the slightest attention to herself... The rumors about her that would spread...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi gulped, trying to slow her rapid breathing. Her breasts were rising and falling quickly, and she wrapped both arms around them to try and keep her composure. There had to be a way out of this... a way to convince herself she had to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still the book she'd foolishly left behind... did she dare go back out without a thing on to look for a way to undo her disastrous situation?

Worse, it belatedly occurred to Ami that she had left her clothes behind; lying in plain sight along the floor by the bookshelves. This was doubly bad. For one, the sight of abandoned female clothing was sure to raise questions. For two... she was far away from any real cover.

Ami's hands went to her sides... and she strode past the desks, eventually reaching the two with the students who, until then, had been clueless about the naked girl in their midst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer. Their heads looked up and their eyes widened at the pale skin of a female rear passing by them with two hands at the sides of similarly nude hips. Then their eyes craned up and saw Ami's naked breasts moving up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>N,no....!</i> She clenched her fingers, trying to stop herself, even as she walked ahead and gave the two a plain view of her exposed butt.

The only person who saw was, of course, the boy heading her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blinked, and in the most innocent tone she could manage, hesitantly addressed the student from across the room. \"C-...could you pick that up for me, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy blinked as well... and stared to the (seemingly) strapless-clad girl, and the book that had just been pushed across the desk. Something was weird. \"Um-... sure....\" He sighed, and knelt down to pick it up... and Ami's eyes widened in horror. The desk. He was looking...under... the desk. She nearly shrieked, and desperately folded a hand over her pelvic area, just in case. Judging from the lack of reaction from beneath the desk, nothing had been seen.

Ami took a long piece of tape, and stuck some tissues to the sticky side of it.  She added more and more until the sticky side was no longer exposed.

Ami closed the book, and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-where is...\"  she said in panic.  It wasn't on the bench.  It couldn't have gone far!  Worry was quickly returning to her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi knelt down, and saw the satchel had fallen underneath the bench.  The naked girl sighed with relief, as she picked up the satchel.  Having almost lost her satchel, the naked girl realized she had almost taken a chance.  The novel was good, almost too good.  At least... too good to enjoy in public.  Had Ami kept reading, she could have been on that bench until morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the book in one hand and the satchel in the other, Ami decided it was time to get inside.  After one more careful look around the street and sidewalk, Ami made her way to the apartment.  A small blessing of it being so late at night, was that none of her neighbors seemed to be out and about.  The naked girl quickly ran up the stairs, and to her door.  Her satchel contained a key.  Ami quickly glanced around, took her key and opened the door.  It easily opened.  After stepping in and slamming the door behind her, Ami was finally safe at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest heaved as she sighed with relief.  She slowly walked forward and set her satchel on a chair.  Ami thumbed through the pages of the novel, with a pleasing sensation still dancing through her body.  After a moment to think it over, Ami decided to address that feeling in the only place that actually felt appropriate, her bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, she held the novel in her hand, and walked towards her room to prepare a set of night clothes to change into.  Once in her bedroom, Ami set the novel on her bed and turned her attention to her dresser.  Suddenly she paused, and did a double take towards her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of it, was an all too familiar tome.  The one that cursed her to take her clothes off in the first place.  It was right there on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked girl looked at it, wondering how it got there, when she realized how.  That escape spell she had accidentally cast.  If she had just trusted the tome for that one moment, would it have taken her home?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a frustrating thing to think about, but Ami decided to brush the thought from her mind.  She was home now, and she had a novel to finish.  Ami was not going to let that tome bother her.  The naked girl picked up the tome and moved it to her desk, planning to return it to the library the next day.  Once at the desk, Ami couldn't help but notice a small red spot between the pages.  She shrugged and took a closer look to see that it was a bookmark.  Although Ami was a bit tired and wanted to relax, her curiosity was perked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi opened the tome to the page with the bookmark, glancing over it.  She mumbled a section to herself, reading \"to know the meaning of a text, absorb the power of this hex.\"  Her eyes widened, and Ami shut the tome and stepped away.  Did she just curse herself again?  How could she be so careless?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again... the line didn't say anything about speaking it.  And Ami didn't feel anything happen.  Maybe it was a fluke?  Or maybe the book was running low on magic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked girl shook her head.  Nothing happened, so she probably read the line wrong.  Not that she thought that was a bad thing, that tome lead to bad things.  There was a much more interesting book waiting on Ami's bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter setting some comfortable nightwear on her bed, Ami picked up the novel, planning to carry it to the bathroom.  But as soon as she laid her hand on it, something happened.  The novel began to glow, and then a similar glow began to grow around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\"  Ami said as she realized something was about to happen.  She tossed the novel back onto her bed, but it was too late.  It opened, and pages began to flip through it's pages rapidly.  Ami tried to get away, but felt the novel pulling her towards it!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no no no!\"  Ami quickly said, trying to scramble in a panicked way.  The pull was stronger than that of the escape spell, the naked girl couldn't get free!  Once she was pulled all the way to the novel, everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi slowly woke up from the darkness in a very confused way.  The first thing she realized was that she wasn't at home.  She was at school.  Or rather, a school, she didn't recognize this school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Ami noticed, was that she was still naked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The End</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd put the wet uniform over the window sill to dry, and get a coat from the nearby closet.

There was a momentary shiver, not just from the boldness of her actions, but from her wet skin. She needed to get dry. But first she'd make sure her clothing would, too. She carefully positioned them along her desk so that they had equal exposure to the sun from the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be much, but even a few minutes would help the clothing be somewhat wearable rather than drowned in water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen... there was just the matter of a change of clothes.

Ken~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Ami needed to hear. Her stomach sinking, Ami desperately thought of where to go. First things first, she had to get her hands free. Where could she manage that? Then it dawned on her, there was a place she would certainly be able to free herself- the art supply room! There were some sharp implements that she could use to carefully free herself.

Instead she felt a sharp pain at her ankle, and with a startled cry, she stumbled backward as her legs gave out, landing painfully on her rear end. Sure enough, her wrists had pulled free from the boy's light grasp, and the kiss had stopped... but it still left a naked, disheveled Ami sitting on the concrete sidewalk. Her hands were at her sides, her ankle was throbbing, she felt her rear turning red... and a disappointed boy was 'tsk tsk'ing down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, it wasn't that bad...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y, you said just a little kiss...!

You can go now!\" With that said, the boy grinned and watched, as if waiting for Ami to attempt and do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi certainly tried.

The other boy, to his credit, just stared as if transfixed, and committing each detail of the girl's figure of memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and what'll I get in return?\" Another snicker, and Ami began to struggle.

Maybe he'd just stop this cruel joke and let her go.

Her backside rose up and down lightly, and judging from the other boy's snicker, he saw that plain as day. \"...s, stoooop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy grinned, held Ami's wrists tight, and considered her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think what I'll do is...\"</span></div></div>",

It might have been best, as Ami didn't feel confident or even inclined to move much faster than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like each step she inched forward caused a visible reaction from her.

She couldn't walk like this... but what choice did Ami have!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she made it out of the pool area, though she had to walk the short length of a sidewalk which lead around it and back to her complex.

First she just had to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne step at a time, Ami slowly worked her way up the steps, struggling with the bindings around her legs that seemed to restrict her every movement.

Not to mention that she felt a twinge of hunger coming on. Even if she stayed there, Ami had to do something! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bound girl pulled at her arms lightly, but it did no good.

The restrained hand was not going to do her any good in way of maintaining some decency or getting into her home, but the soft presence of her fingers against the incline beneath them was relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had been through the most hellish series of events imaginable.

At some point she felt like the bandages were looser. That couldn't be possible... could it? Ami was too lost in her building emotions to notice. She kept on rubbing, unaware that her breasts slowly but surely came free of the bandages, and soon she was as naked as before, propped up against her own doorway. \"...ahh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA certain deviant boy had been very inventive.

Her breasts freely rose and fell before the sight of the gathered students, her nipples rising into plain sight. Worse, she felt them hardening from the cool air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students just stared, as if not knowing how to react to the naked girl sitting between the desks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi stammered, frantic to explain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I...

She was still dressed. Thank heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a nightmare. There was no way she'd ever do something like that, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi decided to get some fresh air. She went to leave the classroom, then as she opened it, a smiling boy produced a photo that made Ami's blood run cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt depicted a naked girl, sitting in a classroom, wearing nothing but her own underwear tied around her wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen smiled, waving the photo in front of a pale Ami's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, my dear, let's talk the details of this arrangement...\"</span></div></div>",

These shower stalls didn't even have doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi carefully peered around the corner, and saw the female swimming class doing warmup stretches.

Her first thought was to the girl's locker room , she didn't like the idea of stealing someone else's clothes. The other problem , was there was a lot of people going in and out of the locker room. So the chances of being caught where highly likely , but it had one advantage it was close. The other idea was the school's auditorium , it was on the other side of the school.<br>\r\nIt's advantages where , it was only use for school business other why's it was empty and the drama club had a storage area  for their plays. So their costumes would be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich place does Ami decides to go ?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On one hand it meant she was less likely to stand out, on the other... there were more chances someone would take notice of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi was nearly past the last group of tables, when someone finally did. \"Looks like someone forgot her shoes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice snickered, then another one added. \"...and her socks...\"  Ami bit her lip, and tried to keep walking, when she froze in her tracks at the last comment. \"I don't think that's all she forgot...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a breeze rustle at her legs, and then of all times, her skirt was flicked upward by a passing hand. \"A, ah...!\" Ami stared down in horror as the flimsy skirt glided past her hips and over her thighs, Her arms were still firmly at her side, but that did nothing to stop the thin material from passing up and over her naked rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, oh no...!\"  Ami quickly moved her hands backward to cover her nakedness, shoving the skirt back down as fast as she could, but the damage was done.. Her face burning red, she stared backward hoping no one saw, but instead saw that very same group snickering at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, talk about bold...\"<br>\r\n\"Is that a new fashion?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I'm not doing this because I-...\" Ami turned to face them, and a rush of laughter made her eyes widen. She moved her other hand to cover the fronts of her thighs instead. She'd almost shown them something far worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blushing girl looked around, noticing faces looking her way to find out what the fuss was. She had to do something, and fast!

She was standing out in the open in the parking lot where anyone could see her! Ami quickly shook her head, blushing as she cast her stare downward. It was all the more reason to hurry.  She stopped at the end of the trash can, carefully standing so that it covered the front of her lower body. If nothing else, no one would see her most intimate areas. Except what came next still required a bold step. Ami took one last look around, and dropped her guard to take up the garbage bag, a shiver going through her as her breasts gently shifted downward against her ribs,  their bared peaks jutting out in plain sight.  She had to hurry! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi quickly made to pull the garbage bag free, and as a result...</span></div></div>",

And if her door made any movement, they'd know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was okay.  They were her best friends and fellow Shenshi.  They could always count on each other when there was trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least that's what Ami told herself as she slowly approached.  She hadn't been spotted by them yet.  She wasn't mentally prepared for it.  There was no telling how they'd react to seeing her naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo... has anyone seen Ami?\"  Usagi asked the rest of the group.  \"I haven't heard from her all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did anyone tell her we were running late for the cafe?\"  Minako asked.  Her question went unanswered.  \"I hope she isn't mad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami would have waited for us if we were running late though, something doesn't add up...\"  Makoto said, tapping her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked girl took a deep breath.  It was time for Ami to face them.  She held her breasts, and kept one hand between her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello,\" Ami meekly said walking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group turned, and all at once their eyes bulged upon seeing Ami standing there.  Ami closed her eyes, and felt her knees get weak.  She fell to her knees, still covering herself as best she could as her face glowed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ami's friends got over the initial shock, they quickly huddled around her out of concern and wonder.  All eyes were on Ami, which she didn't like, despite the small comfort that they obscured the view of her from anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami!?  Are you alright?  What happened?  Where's your clothes?\"  Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a long time for Ami to get the words out, still in a shock from being seen naked.  \"B-Berthier took them at the Cafe.  I finally got away from her at the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Berthier did this to you?\"  Rei said suddenly.  \"Where is she?\"  Rei said, balling one of her hands into a fist.  \"Nobody embarrasses one of our friends and gets away with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know,...\"  Ami admitted.  She really didn't have a clue, she hadn't seen Berthier since the mall, which could have been hours ago.  By this point, she was focused on a different goal.  \"I-I'd really like to get inside now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ami tried to keep from shaking as she cradled her breasts with one arm and reached out her other. She could do this. She had to make sure her queen was safe from further attack.

A chilling draft swept past Ami's hips, and she felt her thighs constrict. No, it couldn't be...<br>\r\nShe shakily cast her stare down, and saw the frightening truth. Her naked rear was nestled into the chair, her legs were exposed, and her hips barely concealed her intimates from view.<br>\r\nHer panties were gone, and she was absolutely naked.<br>\r\n\"Noooo!\"<br>\r\n\"You can always give up, dear. You have nothing more to lose, and this will all be over. But if you don't...\"<br>\r\nWhat did that mean?

Fine, she'd let her rook move and-<br>\r\n\"Check.\"<br>\r\n\"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, another piece of Ami's had been taken.... and her king was in the line of fire.<br>\r\nTo some relief, nothing else happened. Ami was already naked, after all. It hardly made her feel better, but still. She swallowed a gulp, then shakily moved her rook over to get her king out of harm's way.<br>\r\n\"Check.\" No. Her rook! Ami tried to ignore the sensation of sweat forming on her forehead. She could still do this!<br>\r\nAmi moved her king out of the way. Once the queen moved into range, she'd use her knight and-<br>\r\n\"Mate.\"<br>\r\nNo. Berthier's bishop had crossed the field in a blur. With one simple capture of a pawn, the line to her king was blocked.<br>\r\nAnd she had nowhere else to go. The game was well and truly over.<br>\r\nAmi tried to keep from losing color to her complexion as she stared across the table at Berthier, clenching her fists against her lap. \"W, well-... what... what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you lost, my sweet, so-... you gambled your clothes, only fair that you don't get them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blinked at the woman. \"Y, you don't really mean for me to-...to go home na-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm afraid so... further more...\" There was a pause, and Ami felt a heart-stopping chill go through her as Berthier snapped her fingers.<br>\r\n\"...that will be the last time you wear any.\"<br>\r\n\"W...what on earth are you talking about!?\"<br>\r\nAmi's initial reaction, was of course, sheer disbelief. \"You can't...  you can't mean a thing like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerthier blinked at the girl, and gave a faux pout. \"Oh, can't I?\"<br>\r\nShe giggled sweetly, snapped her fingers again, and just like she'd never been naked at all, Ami's original outfit formed into place over her previously exposed body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was yours, and now-\"<br>\r\nAmi stared down, blinking. The formerly complete outfit slowly settled over her skin, and then she felt her eyes widen as the fastenings of the bra and her underwear felt loose.. and then come apart. <br>\r\n\"W, what did you do?!\" <br>\r\nShe could only exclaim in growing alarm as she felt the underclothing fade away... and then her skirt and blouse did too, as if her skin was repellent to the very notion of clothing. Within seconds she had gone from fully clothed to absolutely naked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's quite simple, my sweet... any thing you try to put on will simply fade away. I believe you'll have, oh, a few seconds of cover before you go back to your birthday finest. Do get used to it, you have a cute figure after all...\" Berthier giggled, and Ami was blushing furiously, recoiling as she hugged her naked breasts. This couldn't be happening!

She only really knew her own locker number off hand.  So she began to move down the hallway.  Another one of her friend's locker's was further down the hall, close to a water fountain.  The naked girl made her way down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the hallways were still clear.  It did little to comfort Ami as she did a quiet run down the hallway.  If anyone stepped outside of the classrooms, there would be nowhere to turn, a thought that made her face red, and her pulse quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi stopped near a classroom door, nearly at a locker she thought belonged to one of her friends.  She had to get to it, but the classroom door was open, and there was a class inside.  After a few deep breaths, Ami mentally prepared herself for a big risk.  At a breakneck speed, she ran past the classroom doorway to get towards lockers.  The sound of her adrenaline rush was roaring in her ear from that small moment.  She leaned back against the lockers as much as she could, shivering as she felt the cold metal against her skin.  The naked girl waited to see if anyone had noticed... but nobody came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, and looked at the lockers trying to remember which one was her friends.  Ami wasn't sure, so she made a few more vague notes and slid them into the vents.  The fact that she had to hope one of the lockers was the right one really bothered her.  What if she didn't put any in the right one at all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi tried to think if she could remember exactly where any of her friend's lockers were.  That's when it hit her, Makoto's locker.  It was close to her own, just three lockers away.  She could probably make a more specific note to get Makoto's help, but there was a problem with that.  Both lockers were on the second floor.  Did Ami even have time to reach it?  Was it worth the risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi decided that...</span></div></div>",

No matter how much trouble Ami was in, she couldn't just give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-apologize for what?\"  Ami feigned as much conviction as she could.  \"I-'m not apologizing for anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerthier had a small grin, and put her fingers to her lips to muffle a giggle.  \"Oh, are you sure about that?  All you'd have to say is 'I'm sorry for defying you,' and I can take you away from all of this.  It'll all be like a bad dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offer was tempting, however, Ami still couldn't bring herself to apologize to Bertheir.  Not for any reason.  \"N-no way!\"  Ami said, quietly moving an arm to cover her breasts.  As embarrassed as she was, Ami tried to maintain an aggressive face with her adversary.  The intimidation factor, however, was greatly dulled by how much her face was glowing.  Ami still looked very vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerthier fought another giggle.  \"You are cute when you're angry, you know that?  Well, if that's the case, I wish you the best of luck explaining things to them!\"  She waved her hand towards the students.  She pinched her fingers together and gave Ami a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerthier vanished, and color quickly returned to the world around Ami.  The faces of the students were coming back to life, as what little strength Ami had in expression was gently wiped away, replaced with a look of shock and embarrassment.  She backed up against against the locker again, doing the best she could to cover herself, but it was still clear that she was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not even wearing panties!\"<br>\r\n\"Did someone dare her to do it?\"<br>\r\n\"I think that's the computer girl!\"<br>\r\n\"No way, she's so shy!\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, what's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last voice had more authority to it.  And unfortunately for Ami, it sounded familiar.  It was the teacher she ran from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students immediately near went silent as the teacher approached the naked girl.  She looked very irritated with the site of a naked girl before her.  \"I've finally found you!  You're in big trouble young lady!  You are going straight to the principles office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith most of the school seeing her naked right now, Ami thought there was nothing left to lose.

The halls were fairly populated as well, and every time Ami thought she was safe, another gasp rang out or an array of eyes turned her way. This was horrible...! But it didn't matter. Run.

There was no doubt in Ami's mind that the teacher was chasing her, and getting away from her was important.

Her arm was no longer adequately covering her breasts, instead it merely kept them from bouncing out of control.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her heart racing the further she moved.  If it wasn't because she was scared, it was because of all her running.  A thin layer of sweat began to coat her back as she pushed herself to athletic limits.  Ami wanted to stop, but she never saw a point anywhere in the hallway where she was free from curious eyes.

Somehow she need to get away from them, and get to Makoto.

Her feet soon left the ground.  This time, Ami's stomach laid on Makoto's, still damp, right shoulder, and her friends right arm wrapped around her waist.  Ami's limp legs dangled a little, and Ami had no means to cover her backside.  She was barely able to place her arms over her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to find a towel, no dice, sorry!\"  Makoto said, before taking off with Ami in tow.  \"We'll get to your place in no time!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi was thankful to have Makoto helping her move again.  However, this particular hold left her with no way of covering her lower half, which was on clear display to anyone on the streets of Makoto.  To make matters worse, Ami was only seeing behind Makoto, so she had no clue if anyone even was noticing her.  However, Ami was soon able to see the shocked and confused faces of other pedestrians that Ami passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after all the struggles, they had reached Ami's apartment.  Makoto ran all the way up the stairs and finally slowed her pace, approaching Ami's door, letting the blue haired girl stand on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, alright, we made it.\"  Makoto smiled, with a blush that was much, much smaller than Ami's.  She awkwardly ran a hand through her hair while trying not to look at Ami's uncovered form, \"sorry about earlier... I didn't realize that you could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi's blush turned a little brighter.  \"D-don't mention it.  Please,\" she said, turning her attention towards her apartment door.  She placed a hand on the doorknob, and was met with resistance.  Her door was locked.  Ami then reached for non-existent pockets, before turning to Makoto.  \"Um... do you have a spare key?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto reached into her own pockets, and eventually her hand came up with a set of keys.  She looked through the ones she had.  \"I could have sworn I had one to your place...\"  Then her face fell with a sign of worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-makoto... please tell me you have a key?\"  Ami said with growing worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I do... to my place.\"  Makoto gave a nervous laugh, that clearly wasn't making Ami feel any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother awkward run laid ahead of Ami.   Ami was very embarrassed to have to deal with more time naked outdoors.  This time Makoto took more care to make sure her routes were secluded, and that careful planning managed to keep Ami from getting noticed by more people.  Something Ami was very thankful for.  Eventually, they did reach Makoto's home, and Ami finally had a chance to fully explain the curse that kept her from dressing.

A hand nestled between her legs out of compulsion to cover, and she detected a little bit of moisture, sustaining her blush.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please just be sweat...' Ami thought, doing her best to not think about how Makoto carried her earlier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Makoto returned with a full change of clothes.  For Makoto, lending clothes wasn't that big of a deal, though there was the moment of awkwardness of deciding whether or not to lend panties.  As odd as it may feel, she decided that she was going to do everything she could to help Ami.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here are some clothes that you can borrow.  Just after laundry day,\" Makoto said with a bashful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi looked at the full set of clothes and was thankful for Makoto's help, but then she remembered something.  \"Thank you, Makoto, but... actually... there's a little problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"  Makoto looked confused.  \"What's wrong?  They might not be your exact size, but clothes are clothes at this point, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, it's not that it's um...\"  Ami blushed, keeping one arm over her chest, another between her legs, and her eyes at the pile of clothes before her.

The lingering arousal clouded her thoughts, making it difficult to focus, but she could still see two things she could do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first idea began with the pair of socks that sat atop the clothes Makoto was loaning.  Ami could explain the curse, and if Makoto didn't believe it, she could use those socks to prove her story.  They were small and inexpensive, and she would be able to remain seated while putting them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, she noticed Makoto's bathroom down a short hallway.  If she asked to use Makoto's shower, she could at least get herself a private moment to deal with the warmth between her legs.  Whether she tried to calm herself down with cool water or address the feelings \"directly,\" there would at least be one more layer of privacy between her and anybodies eyes while she cleared her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi thought this over for a short moment, and then...</span></div></div>",

For a moment, she could clear her head, and try to put the recent events in the past.  All that was on her mind, was calming down.

Ami had frozen in place, the only sign of her reaction was her eyes shooting open.  She had been so lost in the pleasantness of the shower... had someone entered without her even noticing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's awful quiet... is she okay?\"  said one familiar voice.  It was Minako's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she's just a bit embarrassed over what happened.\"  Makoto's voice added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi froze up.  Her friends were there.  Sure, she had wanted their help, and sure, they had already seen her naked.  But they had picked some pretty awful timing.  The water from the shower nozzle was blasting away between her legs, further making it difficult for her to think.  She wasn't sure what to say or do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami, are you alright?\"  Asked Usagi.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an approaching silhouette of Usagi on the shower curtain.  Ami's hands finally began to take action and moved off of the wall towards the shower head.  Still, she didn't say anything.  She was too panicked to simply say \"yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami's not saying anything,\" Usagi said, with more concern in her voice.  \"You didn't slip, did you?\"  She said, suddenly pulling back the shower curtain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls did not believe what they saw.  There stood Ami, completely nude and thoroughly wet in the shower.  Her best friends shower, and she was holding the shower nozzle hear her hips.  Her face was glowing a bright shade of red.  There was no soapy residue to argue the idea that she was thoroughly cleaning herself.  All that concealed her modest was an all too transparent cloud of steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi let go of the shower nozzle, letting it dangle away, and in her panic, she then...</span></div></div>",

There she saw Usagi, Makoto, and Minako, all standing there, glancing around the room awkwardly.  Usagi seemed to be fending off a giggle, only barely.  All of them had a slight blush, but none of them were anywhere near as embarrassed as Ami was.  Out of instinct, Ami pulled the curtain back, still trying to protect her modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Ami,\" Makoto said, feeling like she was a little at fault for what had just happened.  \"We were all a little worried about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm okay, thank you.\"  Ami managed to find her voice.  \"Could I have a towel please?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course!  Let me get one for you, I think they're in the drier\" Makoto said, walking out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi now had to wait for a moment, with nothing but a shower curtain blocking the view of her.

You're at least okay, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn instinct, Ami wrapped her arms around herself a little tighter, still feeling the radiant warmth between her legs.  She could be considered bothered by more than one definition of the word.  But with the presence of her friends, she had no choice but to try and ignore that warmth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, I'm fine, thank you,\" Ami said in her flustered state, ignoring Usagi's first question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what happened?  How did you end up naked at school?\"  Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi had a long story to explain.  Would her friends believe it?  She would at least be able to prove how she was cursed to them, as they all had dealt with Berthier before.

Berthier said she'd get rid of it if I...\"  Ami hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto and Usagi glanced at Ami, then at each other in a confused wait.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you what?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-could I just borrow something to wear?\"  Ami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, let me grab something...\"  Makoto went to retrieve some clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Makoto returned with a simple t-shirt.  The color was a bit faded, and the material looked a little tired.  Makoto has chosen this shirt, not based on fashion sense, but instead based on the idea that it could phase from reality if the curse was still in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Ami said.  Makoto and Usagi allowed her privacy, knowing that handling both the t-shirt and the towel was going to be awkward.  Ami lowered the towel, attempting to keep it covering her waist as she slid the shirt on over her head.  It was almost weird to have a shirt on after spending the rest of the day naked, but it was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi braced herself, waiting for the shirt to get thin and disappear.  But instead that didn't happen.  It remained in place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over?\"  Ami smiled.  \"It's finally over!  The curse is gone!\"  She could wear clothes again!  The nightmare was over!  Ami was so happy that she couldn't help but jump, and she had done just that, oblivious to towel fluttering to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto and Usagi turned around to see Ami dressed again, but then their eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Ami?\"  Usagi had a sly grin, pointing her finger downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"  Ami looked down, and her face turned bright red.  \"Ah!\"  Although the shirt stayed, the towel had fallen off of her, leaving her lower half completely exposed.  Her hands quickly moved between her legs to protect her modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go find a skirt,\" Makoto said, fighting off a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\"  Ami said a sheepish voice and a bright blush on her face.</span></div></div>",

The short version then. In happened, according to myth, that the great gods and kami of Japan were in dire straights. Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun, was in dispute with her brother and had hidden herself away in a cave. Naturally, without the sun the world had grown dark and life was dying. The gods needed her to return. So Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto, a beautiful kami of song and drink, took to a stage outside Amaterasu's cave and began a wild and naughty dance, taking her clothes off with abandon. This created such a cheer amongst the other assembled immortals that Amaterasu had to see what was happening. When she saw the naked goddess it is said she was filled with such joy and life that she immediately returned to the sky. That dance was preserved in ritual form, and is called the Kagura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh.\" The children said in unison. Mythology was usually a boring subject, but ritualized stripteases and borderline lesbian sun goddesses do have a way of making the subject more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course the modern Kagura is so formal and sedate it bores me to tears. But the original dance, the one performed in the nude, was far more passionate and wild. If anyone has preserved a true copy of the ritual dance, it will be the fire worshiping Hino clan of the Hikawa Shrine! Amaterasu is one of their most sacred deities!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei shuddered inwardly. Her family did indeed know the original Kagura ritual...she suspected more because her grandfather was a dirty old man than anything else. It was a lewd, gyrating affair more akin to a modern day strip club than some sacred ritual. She couldn't possibly do such a thing in front of her little shrine! If any of her neighbors saw her how could she ever show her face in public again? And yet, how could she get out of it?</span></div></div>",

You parade around half-dressed, then have the nerve to speak to your elder in that tone?!\" the teacher hissed, her voice not a shout, but loud enough to get her anger across. \"I give you the opportunity to make up for your deviant behavior, and you toss it back in my face?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yeah!\" Rei stammered back, scared but unwilling to back down. \"You need to get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I need to do...\" the teacher said. \"Is teach you some respect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the teacher produced a foreboding wooden paddle from her bag, stepping towards Rei with fire in her eyes. Even for the Soldier of Fire, this woman's intensity frightened Rei. Well, the intensity and the paddle. It didn't take a genius to figure out what the teacher had in mind for the young shrine maiden, and Rei wasn't about to let that happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei quickly turned on her heel, desperate to get away. As she turned, she saw the teacher break into a run after her! It was a question of speed at this point, and the faster of the two was-</span></div></div>",

Of course, this only helped so much; the shrine wasn't exactly bursting with clothing, indeed most rooms had specific uses that had nothing Rei could use to help herself. Running a quick mental map through her head, Rei approximated her location and the location of the nearest room that was a safe bet. It was about halfway across the shrine, and Rei knew she'd have to be careful, especially now that someone was looking for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Rei readied herself, turned a corner, and-</span></div></div>",

There was a man standing in the hallway, his back turned towards her, tall and muscular with long wild hair curling down his back. Fortunately for Rei, if the impact was unexpected for her it was ten times more so for the one she ran into. He made a rather comical exclamation and attempted to keep his balance. But despite his best efforts, he fell over his own feet and crashed to the ground. In the process, the bucket he was using to mop the hallways tipped over and drenched the poor boy in soapy water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuuichirou!\" Rei exclaimed in surprise, instinctively covering herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Rei-sama! Sorry! Sorry! I was doing the morning chores!\" Yuuichirou, the young man Rei's grandfather picked up literally off their doorstep and virtually abducted into becoming his apprentice priest, grappled around on the floor looking for his mop. His long hair was soaking wet and plastered to his face, obscuring his vision for the moment (much to Rei's relief!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Idiot! Watch what your doing! Someone might have been hurt!\" Rei snapped, fully aware of the utter hypocrisy of her words and choosing not to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I'll clean it up in just a-\" Yuuichirou yelped in surprise as Rei grabbed his bucket and shoved it over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot!\" She said again. \"S-See that you do! And put a sign up or something! Someone might slip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei was already starting to feel guilty over her behavior. But despite his burly size and shady looking character, Yuuichirou was pretty gentle around her. Plus he found her temper completely terrifying and was usually cowed by it. Between that and the time it would take to get the bucket off his head and soap out of his eyes, Rei just might get out of here without the boy seeing her naked. Although he had never said it, Yuuichirou had a pretty obvious crush on Rei. Her own feelings about the boy weren't that strong, but he was cute and brave (if a little thick headed) enough to earn some affection from her. She had decided a long time ago not to make a move in a romantic direction, but if he ever had the gumption to ask her out she probably wouldn't say no. In any case, the boy was living under the same roof with her! The last thing she wanted was for him to catch a glimpse of her completely bare roaming the halls! She'd never be able to face him again if he saw her like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a sigh of relief, she pushed the sliding wooden door to the cloak room open and moved inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed in supreme relief. This nightmare was almost over. This room only hand outer clothes for a shrine maiden to wear, but the long white shirts and billowy red pants she typically wore as a miko would serve her main concerns just fine right now! Quickly selecting something in her size, Rei donned the billowing white robe which she wrapped tightly around her upper torso. Normally, the robe should be tied in place with strings attached to the underside of the garment. However, with the teacher and Yuuichirou and perhaps her grandfather wandering around Rei had no desire to be caught bottomless in the midst of changing. Thus she relied on keeping her modesty safe by pulling on her red flowing pants and tying everything in place with a red belt around her waist. If the belt were to come undone her shirt would open wide and her pants would be around her ankles, but what were the odds of her bad luck continuing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, a total relief to have clothes. They were a little big for her, and a little stuffy, but Rei was hardly in a mood to be picky! They also itched like mad, but then they weren't meant to be worn without underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that she had saved her modesty, Rei silently stepped out into the hallway again. She wanted to apologize to Yuuichirou, then expel that bitch of a teacher, and then get to her room and get some underwear and real clothes on! As she walked down the hallway, though, she heard voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Master Hino! I apologize for the mess! I had an accident...\" Yuuichirou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh. I heard. My granddaughter is causing trouble for you once again.\" Her grandfather's voice said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no! No trouble.\" Yuuichirou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make excuses for her, my boy. You let her get away with too much with you as it is. She has her grandmother's passion, but that temper will get her into no end of trouble one day if someone doesn't teach her to curb it. But that's neither here nor there. I need to speak with you on another matter.\" Grandpa Hino said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You no doubt have noticed an odd bush growing near the front of the shrine.\" Hino continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes. It seems to be blooming right now.\" Yuuichirou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it is, my boy. Which is why we need to be careful in taking care of it and making certain our visitors avoid it.\" Hino said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei froze in place, her attention suddenly keen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I will tell you this. Keep this information between you and myself. Rei would not approve. She thinks I am enough of a dirty old man as is. I have no interest in being chased around my own temple while swats me with a broom. Again.\" Hino said in a deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei was feeling a bump of trouble. And the itch in her clothes wouldn't go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, don't be alarmed. The effects of the enzymes in the plant won't take ahold just with brief skin to skin contact. Honestly, I'm probably being paranoid telling you, but I'll be out of town for a few days and I need you to take care of things here while I'm gone. But again, don't worry. Unless someone decides to shed all their clothes and rub the leaves over themselves for several minutes the most severe effects of the plant won't take hold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei felt her hands tremble slightly. No. Come on. Fate isn't that cruel. And WHY DID HER BODY ITCH SO MUCH?? She began scratching herself through her clothes, her long nails providing some relief to irritating sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, the first main symptom of the plant makes it excellent for pranks. The oils are similar to poison ivy, but don't effect the skin in quite the same way. Instead, it causes a reaction when the skin is in contact with most types of fabric or hide. In short, my boy, anyway effected will experience a violent allergic reaction to wearing clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei blushed intensely, pressed herself against the wall, and stifled a scream. She opened her shirt a little wider and began running her nails desperately over her stomach and chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't leave a rash or anything. But the skin will grow unbearably itchy until the effect cannot be tolerated a moment longer. In short, it is a guaranteed way to keep the victim of your prank entirely naked for about a day. This is of course if you crush up the leaves and apply the past to something that will make skin contact with the body...body wash and shampoo are ideal. Of course, the effects of the paste are much reduced. I shudder to think how long the effects last if you make direct contact with the plant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Rei's hands was now viciously attacking her skin underneath her shirt, the other was shoved down her pants to deal with a savage itch on her thighs and butt. Outwardly, it would be easy to assume she was playing with herself. Aggressively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the only remedy is to stay naked?\" Yuuichirou asked, the discomfort evident in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and no. There are ways to get rid of the oils. A very hot bath and several hours of scrubbing suffice for the paste...who knows how long it would take with direct contact with the plant. But simply removing the clothes has problems of its own. You see, this isn't the only effect of the plant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei, who was just about to yank her upper robe off her shoulders and become completely topless, stopped dead and continued to listen, her whole body trembling. Now what???<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once the body has reacted to the clothes placed upon it, the removal of those garments causes that reaction to cease. Instead, a new reaction takes place...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, as fast as she was going....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again, Mrs. Hino!\" Came a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei felt more than saw the teacher from before reach out and grab her silk belt. The effect was instantaneous. Rei's momentum carried her away from the woman, while the belt stayed in place. Almost instantly her pants fell off her slender hips and her white robe burst open (although it remained on her shoulders). Rei screamed at her exposure, and at the way her pants made her trip over herself. She landed, dazed, on her hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei's vision was instantly clouded by flashes of light. Those brats in her class were all lined up, camera's at the ready, taking in her shame! Rei tried to rise, only to yelp as a sharp pain burst from her butt. The teacher brandished her paddle with expert efficiency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, my wanton hussy! You will atone for your deviancy here and now!\" The teacher announced with another swat of Rei's ass. The cameras flashed in time with the spanking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Leave me alone!\" Rei squeeled, crawling away, trying to wrestle her pants off, her breasts bouncing in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a third time the paddle was brought down hard on her exposed ass. For a third time her humiliation was recorded forever on digital film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei kicked at the baggy pants, finally dislodging her leg. The teacher got in one more good spanking, but this time Rei used the momentum to rise up and run like hell. Her robes were yawning open, her naked body easily scene beneath them. The itchy sensation still there, but now it competed with the pain on her burning red ass for her attention. Her mind was in a frenzy. All she wanted was to get away. So she fled...right down the stone steps that went from her shrine to the street level!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway there Rei realized what she was doing. It was evening, right around the time everyone was returning home from a long day of work. The street in front of her little shrine was PACKED with vehicles, many of them belong to her own neighbors. Rei's eagle eyes spotted one more problem...there was a bus in front of her little shrine. To her dismay, she realized she recognized the trio of girls getting off the bus by their uniform. They belonged to her school, a little cadre of underclassmen who admired her and occasionally visited the shrine to get fortunes and say hello. They friends, exactly, but she did like them. She was a little uncomfortable with their attention...she suspected at least two of the three might have more than a casual interest in girls in general and her in particular. She had no objection to that per se, but the level of their 'devotion' made her a little uneasy. Also, much like Yuuichirou, they were the last people she wanted to be seen by in this state!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught between the agony of her situation and a sense of modesty, Rei pulled her upper robes as tightly over her body as she could, at the same time pulling down on them to try and hide her naked exposed lower half. It was ineffectual, one could easily see the underside of her shaven sex if they had the right vantage, and her butt cheeks peeked out below her robes. One hand held the robe together with the other scratched at her left cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No escape, Hino!\" The teacher screamed, again catching her off guard and grabbing the back of the robe. Rei screamed, somehow remembering to hold her robe closed. But this left her ass exposed, and an easy target for the paddle in her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Stop! Let go! OWW! STOP! Please!! It'll come open! OWW! No! Don't let them see me like this!!!\" Rei pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your penance doesn't start until you are naked and on your hands and knees before my class! You may apologize to those you expose yourself to here as well! In the meantime...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei cried out in pain as the paddle met the bouncy flesh of her butt again and again. Her screams and the display were drawing a lot of attention from below. To her horror Rei saw a little crowd forming below them, including her wide eyed schoolmates. Her predicament was getting worse by the moment, and the shame was almost as intense as the painful smacks of the paddle and the constant itching over her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to apologize yet, Hino? I can keep this up all day. I don't if that poor little bottom of yours can do the same!\" The teacher said, emphasizing her point with another vicious smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei needed to do SOMETHING fast. The itching was so bad she knew she would HAVE to scratch it soon and expose herself to everyone. In desperation she...</span></div></div>",

Plus, her underclassmen were liable to get back on board, and that was a conversation she did not want to have...ever. And of course, the bus wouldn't remain parked there forever (although it was a spot the drivers typically used as a rest area, so it would remain there for a good fifteen to thirty minutes depending on the driver). Was Rei really prepared to be driven away from her home completely naked and possibly intensely horny just for the momentary relief of a place to hide? No, the park was the better choice- lots of places to hide, close to her home, not many people around this time of day. Perfect, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept that the park was on the opposite side of the street from her shrine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei resolved not to think, just run with all her might. She rushed around the side of the bus, speeding across the street, ignoring the surprised horns of oncoming traffic (some who honked because there was a pedestrian dangerously close to being hit, and some who honked because it was the best facisimile to a jeering cat call they could make on such short notice). She reached the median strip, a tiny grassy island between the two lanes of traffic, less the ten feet wide and perhaps three across. A street sign hung in the middle of the median, supported on a thin round metal pole. A collision a few weeks ago had left the sign bent at a low angle roughly at the height of Rei's knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was ready to complete the journey. She made it as far as the first lane. She would have made it the whole way if an oncoming truck had not sped up at the wrong moment. Acting on instinct, Rei leapt back onto the median strip. Now cars were flying by in all directions, cutting off her escape into the park AND her path back to her shrine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei wanted to curse, but all too suddenly she had other things to worry about. Her head became woozy. Her blush, already a deep red, grew deeper still and felt far hotter. Her skin tingled all over, her body ached. Her breasts felt heavy and large and aware of the cool evening air caressing them...especially the sensitive nipples that hardened and grew erect. She felt a tell-tale dampness settle between her legs, her clit beginning to poke through her folds, waiting and eager. Her hips swayed slightly on instinct, her legs feeling weak and rubbery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Grandpa had most definitely not been bluffing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...okay...this is awkward!\" Rei said to herself. \"But...I can handle this! This...isn't any worse...than that time I say Mamoru in the bath! I can get through this, get out of sight, and...I can do this! Just wait for the traffic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her entire body arched in an obviously sexual manner. She felt her inner folds spasm impatiently, her thighs clenching together and her whole body quaking. Her vision swam before her eyes. She stumbled, almost falling into the street. Reaching out, she caught herself on the street sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was worse than Mamoru's bath! This was worse than 50 Mamorus! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cool wind coming off the sea and the relative shade of the neighborhood had left the metal of the street sign pleasantly cold to the touch. As Rei tried to steady herself and clear her mind, her sex made contact with the smooth metal. In seconds she was completely straddling the bent pole, pushing her hungry sex tightly up and down along the metal. She lifted one of her legs up to waist height and wrapped it completely around. With one hand grasping the pole, the other played with her breasts and then moved down between her legs, to play with herself even as she humped the steel pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not here! Not here! Everyone's looking! Stop! Oh, so good! Please no! OH!\" Rei said, pushing her body back so that her breasts jutted and bounced in time with her movements, looking like a perverted witch on a broomstick. Her senses were an incoherent jumble of sights and sounds and FEELINGS, all building up around her and inside her. She knew dimly that cars were honking and people were gasping and lights were flashing from cell phones and cameras. She was completely exposed, performing the most debased and private act she could imagine in the middle of a public street in her own neighborhood!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a herculean effort, Rei pushed herself off the pole, covering herself and shaking like a leaf. She had to get out of there now!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In one respect, Rei Hino was extremely lucky. Her Grandfather, in his prime, was a king among perverts. A pervert, and a sage of spiritual power and herbalistic secrets. All three qualities had gone into breeding and cultivating the mysterious plant that was currently heaping more humiliations on Rei's already embarrassing ordeal. The plant was unnaturally potent in the effects on the female body, inducing a state of arousal that would drive the weak willed into a helpless frenzy of lust. Even her fellow Senshi, all strong willed women would have found the effects on their bodies immensely intoxicating and insidiously hard to resist. But Rei Hino was not any ordinary woman. She had honed her discipline to a razor edge during her time as a miko. She had won whole battles by that mental focus, setting side fatigue and pain to defeat enemies. She would not be defeated by a few lusty urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei hugged her body tightly, fleeing into the park. Every nerve in her body was alive, thrumming with need. But her body was a vessel for her mind, nothing more. Instincts could be overcome. Her needs were as fleeting as a breeze, and her heart was as solid as a mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei repeated her mediation mantras as she reached a bend in the path before looking back. The traffic was still roaring down her street from both sides. Her crowd of gawkers still stood on the far side of the street, dozens of them having moved around the bus (Rei blushed, realizing at least a few of them must have done so during her wanton display just moments ago). In their midst, she could the school uniform of her classmates. And at the front of the crowd, staring at her with contempt was that hag of a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here Rei made perhaps her worst mistake since pressing too close to the flames earlier that day. She gave in to the outrage and the frustration that had been building all that morning. While not entirely satisfied with the punishment the teacher had exacted on the deviant priestess, the hag would have been content to let the matter go after the public spanking. That is until Rei turned around and stared at her. Hunching her shoulders and adjusting the \"7\" her arms made across her body Rei squeezed her huge breasts together in a way that allowed her to hide her nipples while freeing her left hand to make an obscene gesture. For good measure, Rei made a face and stuck out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher's eyes narrowed. She took the edge of the paddle and practically smashed it against a nearby street light....a light meant to activate a crosswalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!!\" Rei said. \"That thing NEVER works for me. So I nearly get killed jay walking and this crazy bitch gets a nice safe crosswalk?? What did I do to deserve this??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large group of spectators walked across the street, the teacher in the lead brandishing the paddle before her. Rei took a step back, then another, getting ready to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a sense, Rei was lucky. Her meditations and her composure allowed to weather her situation better than others might. And yet, in another sense Rei was the worst person to be in this position. She was the Sailor of Passion, after all. Underneath that usually calm demeanor she had a pride and a temper as volatile as her element. For Rei the years of focus and training were a necessity, because passion never came slowly to her. Chip away at her walls long enough, and the calm young lady could become as bratty and biting as the least mature of her teammates. And alas for poor Rei, the same could easily be said for other passions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHence, if Rei's pride and composure were a mountain encasing her heart then her stresses, worries, and lusts were a sea of magma boiling just beneath it. So far her morning had involved being stripped (TWICE!) of her clothes and dignity, being subjected to a series of bare bottom spankings before an audience, and of course providing the most wanton and porngraphic display of her body she could have imagined to half her neighborhood! Her pride and composure were practically nonexistent today. By contrast, her always deep reserves of passion were exploding through her mind and body as never before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was the burst of terror she felt at the sight of the teacher. Perhaps it was burst of adrenaline her muscles were giving her in anticipation of her need to flee. Or maybe it was just the close proximity of her right hand to her most secret of places, making it so easy for one little finger to brush against a place yearning for a touch. Whatever match ignited the blaze, Rei felt her body give another quaking spasm. She fell onto one knee, thankfully more prepared to deal with the convulsions than before. But her fingers clenched on instinct, a few digits dipping into that world calling out to her. That was all it took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Oh OH!\" Rei gasped and moaned, once more providing a frenzied display of debased lust to her onlookers. Rei continued to kneel before the oncoming mob, her eyelids flitting closed as pleasure drowned her mind. Her fingers thrust in and out of her with reckless abandon, while her other hand instinctively groped and played with her large breasts. Her behavior was so sudden the mob stopped short in pure shock for a moment. But that lull did not last long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh! Oh! NO! STOP IT!\" Rei cried, wrenching herself back to reality. The teacher was only a few dozen yards away now. With a little shriek Rei got back on her wobbly feet and began running, fleeing down a little hiking trail through the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with me??\" Rei cried. She had done it again! Where was her self control? Twice in less than four minutes she had shamed herself utterly in front of leering strangers! Her blush was intense, her humiliation was overwhelming, and her body was throbbing with impatience as the promise of orgasm was once more offered and denied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaying no heed to where she was going, Rei burst from the foliage and froze. This area had been set aside as a baseball dugout. It appeared that some sort of tournament was in progress, with two teams of players maybe a year younger than Rei herself. There was a startled cry from the bleachers on Rei's left, perhaps 20 yards away from her. The game stopped dead as every player turned to gawk at her, and soon legions of spectators migrated to the edge of the bleachers to stare. Rei could see hundreds of camcorders and expensive looking cameras with telescopic lenses all aiming in her direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop looking at me!\" Rei screamed, crossing her arms over her chest and hugging herself tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" She squeeked. The motion had been just as deadly as before. The brush with her sensitive nipples caused a surge of lust, and all too suddenly Rei was pinching, fondling, and massaging the erect nubs with desperate abandon. With two fingers firmly clamping down onboth nipples, Rei began to wantonly play with her breasts, pressing them together then pulling them apart, stretching them into little points before letting them bounce back into their lovely round shapes. Pulling hard on the nipples and twirling them in little circles was painful, yet intensely erotic. Unable to contain herself, Rei again slipped a hand below her waist and allowed hundreds of strangers to watch her play with herself as she moaned loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the sound of footsteps that broke her spell. Two security guards were moving across the field, headed directly towards her. With a whimper she fled back down the path she had just taken, aware that her bouncing butt was being captured by a hundred cameras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the path was a big bush growing out of a tall tree. Between the bush itself and low hanging branches, it provided near complete cover while offering a nice shady space with enough room to move about. Rei dove into the little sanctuary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its too much!\" Rei said in misery. \"If I focus really hard, I can stay in control. But...but the second I brush up against my tits or my pussy everything goes out the window! I'm right at the edge, and any little thing can send me right over it! I'm...I'm completely horny!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei was trembling, wanting to make an exclamation...not sure if it should be a scream, a sob, or hysterical laughter. This was so unfair! She couldn't even cover herself without suffering the ultimate humiliation! Grandpa was worried about her chasing him with a broom over that plant? Oh no. When she found him, she was going to use a hatchet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Shut up! Think!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands were out. Any little brush against a sensitive area and she would lose all control. Rei clasped her hands together behind her head, entwining the fingers. While it wasn't pushing her over the edge, her thighs rubbing together was making it hard to slip into a deeper meditation. As such, Rei opened her legs as wide as the could go while remaining standing. Okay. With this she should be able to close her eyes and focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if someone finds me, they'll find my breasts totally exposed and pushed out and my privates completely on display and dripping wet!!\" She said to herself. \"But...but its so hard to stay focused! I need to to it! All I have to do is wait a few hours and sneak back to the shrine. Just...a few hours...naked, totally exposed, and completely horny...for a few hours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei allowed herself one last whimper of misery before slipping completely into a meditative state.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Rei crawled along the ground in order to exit her hiding place, a soft breeze began to blow and the bush began to shake and rustle. The leaves on the plant were not dry or coarse, but long feathery affairs with fuzzy little skin like felt. Try as she might, Rei could not shield herself from being batted a bit by the branches, and a few of the leaves drifted across her body in ticklish waves. Her reaction was jerk a little in dismay and surprise, which allowed her breasts to bounce up and outward to experience the leafy caress for themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo.\" Rei moaned, for the brief contact instantly caused her nipples to grow erect and lust to pound in her ears once more. A new spasm struck her body. Fortunately, Rei's previous experiences had taught her what NOT to do in this situation. She kept her hands firmly locked on the ground, and pushed her knees a little further apart so that her folds did not rub together. As bad as her rampant lust was, she could stay in control if she could just resist the urge to rub her throbbing sex (and of course, avoid putting it in contact with anything else that could provide consistent stimulation...like the pole). Covering herself was still completely out of the question, but by just stopping and focusing for about a minute she had learned that the desperate need would ease off (although she was conscious of a low level of persistent arousal regardless). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1...2...3...4....\" Rei said in her head, frozen in place on all fours. She knew what kind of sight this pose would make if anyone found her like this. She just had to hope no one was around. \"21...22...23...24...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother errant breeze suddenly wafted through the area, this time coming from behind. The leaves this time tickled her butt, still sensitive from the spankings earlier that evening. But a couple feathers managed to curl up under crotch as well, caressing right along her in folds. Rei gave a cry of dismay and arched her back. Her butt and knees clenched together and spots appeared before her eyes. The convulsions were now much more insistent, her folds clenching hungrily. Rei moaned softly to herself, feeling her whole body shake with need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......1....2...3....4....\" Rei began again, her face flushed with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several agonizing minutes to dislodge herself from the bush. The leaves tickled and teased her sensitive areas, and Rei was helpless to do more than freeze and hope to ignore the stimulation. The temptation to simply answer the call of her hormones and masturbate there in the dark was very high, especially since no one appeared to be around. But thinking back, Rei had come to realize that indulging herself earlier that day had made the urges all the stronger, which in turn made it easier for her to lose control again and again. There was simply no telling whether climaxing would relieve her hunger or cause it to redouble itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed faced, Rei assessed her situation. She might be able to make it back to her home, although she dreaded having to cross that busy street and leave herself completely illuminated by the street lights. The real problem, though, was that she was still suffering from the effects of the plant. Grandpa had said that at best the effects lasted 24 hours, but that was the \"watered down\" version. There was no way to tell when...or IF!...the plant would stop working on her. Grandpa had also implied it would be very difficult to wash off the oils of the plant...but maybe she Chlorine would have better results than soap? She could indulge in a little skinny dipping at the park side pool before going home. Then again, wasn't that pushing her already terrible luck?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rei knew it was pushing her luck, but there were potential benefits to stopping by the pool that were too tempting to pass up. For starters, there was the hypothetical chance that the chlorine in the water would wash off the plant's chemicals better than just soap. Even better, potentially, was that spending time in the water would mean she'd get to the road later, and that could hopefully mean less people out and about. The last hope relied on the first benefit working; if the chlorine did work, then she might be able to hunt down something to cover up with, making the trip back home much less embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Rei finally made her way out of the bush, shakily rising to her feet. It took every ounce of her willpower to keep herself from covering up, reminding herself that doing so would only make things so much worse. Instead, Rei ran with her arms at her sides, breasts and rear bouncing freely with every step she took. The raven-haired girl was acutely aware of how explicit this display was, and could do little more than quietly pray that nobody happened to be nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei just had to make it to the pool, jump in the water, and see if that helped. Of course, the closer she got to the pool, the worse her idea seemed. What if there was security? She could get arrested! She'd never be able to explain this, and even if she did she'd have to hope her story sounded even remotely plausible. If it hadn't happened to Rei herself, she'd have never believed such a series of events could possibly happen, so what were the odds an authority figure would believe it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs these worrying thoughts swam through Rei's head, she quickly found herself facing another unplanned obstacle.</span></div></div>",

Come on!\" Usagi cried, pulling at her boyfriend's arm with her usual excessive enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, Usako.\" Mamoru gave a mild grumble in protest, but allowed himself to be dragged along with a half-smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased on how they were dressed- Mamoru in a fancy black suit (not quite as elegant as his alter ego's trademark Tuxedo, but the boy did clean up nicely no matter what!) and Usagi in a pretty golden dress (a little daring for the supposedly naive girl, a strapless number that exposed a vast amount of cleavage and pushed her large breasts up and out...not to mention how it hugged her curves tightly and just managed to walk the thin line between showing off as much of her legs and hips as possible without being totally indecent) it was easy enough to guess that the couple was on a date. From the slight flush on Mamoru's face and the wobbly way Usagi was walking it seemed to be the end of a successful dinner engagement with a liberal helping of wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why are they here?\" Rei asked herself. She began to tiptoe through the gate, only to feel the bounce of her unencumbered breasts swaying in the breeze, and blushed profusely. Caught up in the chance meeting, she had entirely forgotten her own circumstances. Could she really saunter up to them like this and ask for help? Despite the obvious state of mild inebriation, the pair looked elegant and sophisticated, very much the picture of the prince and princess they had once been and were destined to become again someday. And here she was, a stupid naked girl slinking after them like a beggar hoping to be extricated from the humiliating situation she had been hapless enough to fall into! A part of her felt silly having such reservations...her evening had already consisted of humiliations far more personal and in front of far more people than the simple act of appearing naked in front of her two close friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet the very idea of facing her teammates like this, unable even to hide her nudity or her arousal, was absolutely unbearable. Rei could picture the event clearly. Between Usagi's drunken delight in her nudity and embarrassment and Mamoru's silent scorn Rei knew she would surely die of shame right there on the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why was she still following them, running from shadow to shadow, hiding behind cover as it presented itself, sometimes crouching and sometimes padding along on all fours like a cat? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Usagi exclaimed, removing her high heels and dipping her feet into the water's edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usako...did we really come all this way just so you could soak your feet?\" Mamoru said in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've been getting pinched and cramped all night, Mamo-chan!\" Usagi whined a little, sitting on the edge of the pool and splashing her legs in the water. \"Rei and Minako make it look so easy, but wearing heels huuuuuurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMamoru smirked. \"Walking around with a noose around my neck isn't exactly comfortable either, Usako.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you look so handsome in a black tie.\" Usagi said, with a gleam in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you look amazing in heels.\" Mamoru said, as both a counterpoint and a compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm.\" Usagi said, smiling to herself. \"Well, Mamo-chan, we both dressed up for each other tonight, and we both liked what we saw. I think we can relax a little now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, the princess of the moon reached out to her lover and with a few deft motions unwound the tie and plucked it away from his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so.\" Mamoru said, a little mystified by his fiancee's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei was also puzzled. She was used to the loud, childish girl who acted out during senshi meetings. This soft, playful creature was something new in her experience. And that gave her a little stab of guilt. This was obviously an intimate time, a time when the pair could freely act in a way they couldn't around everyone else. Having very recently performed some very private actions in a very public manner, Rei was feeling rather raw and ashamed about intruding upon someone else's private moment. She should go...solve her own problems, leave the pair to their night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Mamo-chan..do you want to go for a swim?\" Usagi asked with a little smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...We have no swimsuits, Usako.\" Mamoru noted, his voice saying he knew exactly what she was getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would we need them?\" She asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn second thought, she didn't HAVE to leave right away. In fact, this was probably a much safer place to be than wandering around the park proper with security and who knows what else out there. Plus she hadn't been able to get into the pool yet, so really the whole trip would be pointless if she left now. That was assuredly the reason she was pressing herself all the more tightly behind her hiding spot and gazing intently at the two lovers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usako, your drunk.\" Mamoru said gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Usagi said, unzipping the back of her dress. \"Maybe I want to be a little daring tonight, and the wine just helps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usako, someone might see you.\" Mamoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feh. Who's going to see me, aside from you?\" Usagi asked, slowly drawing the zipper lower. \"Besides, Mamo-chan, there wouldn't be any thrill without any risk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usako, what's gotten into you?\" Mamoru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh! Are you that shy, Mamo-chan?\" Usagi asked, walking up to him. \"The great Tuxedo Mask will throw himself into battle without a second thought, but can't let a girl have a little peek?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMamoru actually did turn red at that comment. Bad move, Usagi, Rei thought. The dark haired boy was indeed incredibly shy about his frankly gorgeous body, and calling him out on it had always been an excellent way to drive him away back when Rei had been going out with him. There was simply no way to salvage the situation after....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi unzipped her dress, and peeled the fabric off her body. Her lovely breasts and slender figure were now only obstructed by a slender pair of gold panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay. Maybe there was one way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lovers embraced, sharing a soft kiss by the light of the moon. Rei caught herself in the middle of a swoon, and then felt a stab of panic settle over her. Her body was not blind to her thoughts or feelings. She could feel the moisture gather between her legs, and her fingers flex with a desire to satiate that hunger. She fought against the urge, called to mind every mantra and meditation trick she knew, pushed a legs apart to avoid any unnecessary stimulation, counted to 30. It took every ounce of her strength not to explore her inner folds once more. This was bad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of their audience of one, or of her current distress, the lovers disengaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mamo-chan, what am I going to do? Its so cold out, and the water is so much colder! How will I keep warm?\" Usagi said in mock dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMamoru sighed, and began to strip off his clothes. Soon his toned muscles and finely formed abs came into view. Rei stifled a shriek of dismay, wrestled with her hands and actually SAT on them to resist the instincts thrumming inside her. She began to shake in horror and need as Mamoru went to work on his pants, fearing even that wasn't going to be enough. Smiling broadly, Usagi divested herself of the small panties she wore as Mamoru's bare butt came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One warning, Usako. If someone DOES find us, I won't be happy.\" Mamoru said as the pair gingerly entered the cold water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worry too much.\" Usagi whispered. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a moment Rei entertained the wild notion of making a break for it. The desire to shamelessly pleasure herself with wild abandon was now more intense and insistent than at any point during her journey. It was only the certainty that any attempt to dislodge her hands from where they were pinned beneath her voluptuous behind that persuaded her to stay where she was. Sadly, the same carnal passions that kept her paralyzed also kept her gaze transfixed on the sight of her two naked comrades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two soft splashes Usagi and Mamoru jumped into the pool. This obscured much of their nudity, to Rei's simultaneous relief and sorrow. (Un)fortunately for her, it also inspired a frenzied little dance from Usagi, causing her large beautiful beasts to bounce in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Cold! Cold! Cold!\" She cried in alarm, visibly shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh.\" Mamoru said softly, enfolding the girl in his large arms. \"Odanga-head, you knew that was going to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Usagi said, pressing herself up against him and basking in the warmth of his body. The pair shared another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me the truth, Usako. What brought all this on?\" Mamoru said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Can't a girl feel a little adventurous every now and then?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. But there's more to it than that, right?\" Mamoru persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. Fine. I...uh...did you see the news earlier today?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something about indecent exposure in the area?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei winced to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! There was some complete pervert running around! The police were calling her a nymphomaniac exhibitionist or something!\" Usagi said with excitement. \"She was running all over the part exposing herself and getting off on it like crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei hung her head in absolute shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm. Sounds like a sad girl with some deep sexual issues.\" Mamoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You leave nympho-san alone!\" Usagi snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei blanched and Mamoru raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...heh. Okay. So...I might have done some looking around after hearing the reports. Turns out there's some videos of the event...okay, like...hundreds of them! Of course, they're all done by amateurs and some of them were really far away and NONE of them were particularly interested in her face, so it looks like she's safe for the time being.\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I hope she gets the help she needs before she gets in trouble.\" Mamoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! You don't think its even a little hot, a girl running around without anything on and getting excited by it?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that. But without knowing who she is or why this was happening, I feel a little strange about fantasizing about it. Fortunately...\" Mamoru cupped on of Usagi's breasts and tweaked her erect nipples. \"There's a girl right here who's excitement I can enjoy without any hesitation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei and Usagi blushed, though for slightly different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I take it you enjoyed what you saw, Usako?\" Mamoru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi's blush only grew bigger. \"There was one video in a crowded street. She was in the middle of all these cars, and she was blushing all up and down, and she was molesting this traffic pole for all she was worth! It was so wrong! But...she was so hot! She had the most amazing body I've ever seen! Like a model. And...and she seemed so embarrassed by what she was doing, but she was enjoying playing with her body so much more! She was having so much fun exploring it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMamoru pressed the smaller up against and ran a hand down her backside to squeeze her shapely butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh. Yes, yes. I'm WELL AWARE of certain people who have fun with OTHER people's bodies that way!\" Usagi said, giving him a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Usako...on the news...some witnesses were saying that girl was from the Hikawa Shrine. And she did have black hair...\" Mamoru said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mamo-chan, don't be a pervert! Those were just made up stories by people who don't like Rei. You know she can be kind of cold and rude towards some people! Some of her neighbors are just awful people who make up rumors to hurt her.\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei smiled a broken smile. Count on Usagi to stick up for her even when she was completely wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, I said the body on this girl was amazing! Super model quality! Not the frumpy little thing Rei hides under those robes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei scowled. Never mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I never knew you had such a low opinion of her.\" Mamoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't give me that. She's cute, of course, but she's like me. Plain and ordinary.\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usako, it amazes me how you can admire another girl's body to such an extent and be totally blind to your own. Your body is magnificent. You could be a model yourself, without question. You and all the senshi are incredibly beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mamo-channnnnn.\" Usagi said, in a her 'I'm-trying-to-sound-stern-but-am-actually-being-adorable' tone. \"If you want to compliment a girl's looks, don't follow it up by saying how pretty her friends are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good advice, Usako. I'd probably follow it, if I didn't know you agreed with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi blushed and sputtered an incoherent response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, Usako. While you were watching this video, you were imagining yourself in place of the pole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mamoru!\" Usagi squeeked, in a tone that hinted this was not their first time on this topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay, Usako. I don't mind if you have these little fantasies.\" Mamoru purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's because your a pervert who likes picturing me with other girls!\" Usagi snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not half as much as you like picturing it yourself, Usako.\" Mamoru said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi made a face and grumbled, but didn't deny the statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it wouldn't matter to me if-\" Mamoru began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop right there!\" Usagi whispered. \"Y-you know it isn't that simple! What if you got jealous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get jealous around other guys, Usako. If the same was true of women, I think Haruka and I would have had a...long talk about how she acts around you.\" Mamoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but what if you realize that isn't true? Or what if I fell in love? Or...or the other girl falls in love and wants me to herself?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lot of 'ifs' Usako. This is what I know for sure. I know you love me as much as I love you. I've seen the proof of it in the future and in our little girl, and I see it even more in your eyes. That will never change for me, and I believe with all my heart it won't for you either. And you know how to read a person's heart more than anyone. So I trust you to feel out the situation, and not to go too far unless you are sure the other girl can accept that you can't be hers alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I can't do it. I...you and I love each other. Usako loves Mamo-chan, Mamo-chan loves Usako. But there's also Serenity and Endymion! There's things about me only you could ever understand, Mamo-chan. I've loved you twice in a row, in two different lives. How could I meet anyone else that can compare with that? And if I can't, no matter how I might feel about them, I'll never feel as close to them as I do to you because they came along thousands of years too late! I can't put anyone through that.\" Usagi whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usako...\" Mamoru began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's...just drop it. Okay? I want tonight to be fun...\" Usagi begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Mamoru relented. \"I'll just stick with picking it in my head then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert!\" Usagi declared, but the comment did the job of making her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was right, though. You were thinking about that girl and you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi abruptly stopped laughing and began blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mamo-chan! I...It would have been so embarrassing! All those people going by! I would have died! And she was so intent on...what she was doing. I would have gone over the edge in no time at all, and all those people would see it!\" Usagi sputtered. \"Don't make me say this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Keep on thinking about it, Usako.\" Mamoru said in a husky voice. \"I'm getting a good idea of what it would be like....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei was shaking with arousal again. To her amazement, Usag turned around moved to the shallow end of the pool, mere feet from Rei's hiding place. Rei's breath caught in her throat as Usagi rose up out of the water (which now only came up to her knees) providing a picture of full frontal nudity. The blonde girl closed her eyes, and bent forward at the waist, placing her hands on the side of the pull and presenting her rear to her fiancee (and unintentionally showing off her magnificent breasts to her best friend). Her eyes were firmly closed. Mamoru moved in behind her, his hand fondling her butt and sliding a finger across her eager clit and soaking wet sex. To Rei's astonishment, he all at once pressed in large manhood firmly into her folds, taking her from behind in one quick motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo, Nympho-sama! Not here! Everyone's looking!\" Usagi moaned in fake distress, thrusting to meet her boyfriend stroke for stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop looking stop looking, this is bad bad bad I can't stop watching oh god Usagi saw what I did this is so humiliating but she saw me and she liked what she saw oh god she got off on it oh god she's thinking of me while she has sex oh god they're BOTH thinking of me and doing it this is amazing NO stop watching no no no!\" Rei screamed in an incoherent jumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too much. Seeing her two friends giving such an intense display of wild lovemaking, and realizing with a jolt of excitement that her naked body was the cause of their mutual excitement, Rei couldn't hold back any more. Her hands wretched themselves free, she dropped her knees, and began to play even more desperately than before. She had to do something fast or they would see her!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rei crouched down low behind the poolside tree, pulling her legs together at the knees then forming a wide 'V' as she sat there, exposing her pussy lips. Her hands were already working on her body before she even realized what was happening. Two fingers pushed deep inside her, circling around her inner folds in a motion her hips could not help but echo in a sensual dance. Her other hand was grasping her left breast, pulling it up and playing with the nipple before snaking in between the orbs to provide stimulation to both. In mere moments she was throwing her head back in ecstasy, arching her back and moving up and down in tiny rhythmic motions. Growing more desperate still, Rei abandoned her breasts in order to allow one hand to pumping in and out while the other began to stroke her clit in small circles, moving faster and faster as her need for release grew. Her face was a hot mix of dismay, delight, and utter shame- her eyes closed and her mouth opening and closing as she stifled her grasps and moans. Her fingers were working on her inner folds so much she actually felt herself instinctively pushing up against the tree, her hips and legs pushing her up a few inches as the rest of her body responded to her fervent play. She again grabbed her tits, this time a little more desperately and harshly, pulling and grinding on the nipples. Hugging her right leg close to her, the shrine maiden let out a sudden moan of need and pleasure as right hand dipped over the outside of the leg and plunged even deeper into herself than before, while the left did not cease to answer the call of her aching clit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh fuck! Did she say that out loud? Rei crawled, as best she was able while continuing to thrust her fingers inside herself, turning over on her side and peeking behind the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one was there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei was both alarmed and relieved. They must have finished and left! Breathing a sigh of relief, she began to relax and continued to masturbate, loving the sensation and the memory of her two naked friends. She was so very close now. Just a moment more and...she cracked half an eye open, her head turning to the side. And there on the other side of the tree, crouched over her and staring, were the large blue eyes, blonde hair, and wet naked body of Usagi Tsukino!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei didn't bother to stifle her scream this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long moment where she could do nothing but press herself up against the tree, the naked blonde staring intently at her on one side and the dark haired boy coming around the other side to glare at her. She was paralyzed....except for her poor hands. The surprise had slowed their progress significantly, but even as her discoverers watched she continued to run her fingers along her pussy lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-noooo.\" She finally managed to moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it is you.\" Mamoru said, his face unreadable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry! I-I-I\" Rei stuttered, convulsing with pleasure and shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mars. You....You really are nepho-sama!\" Usagi said, her cheeks flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T CALL ME THAT!\" Rei cried. \"N-NOT MY FAULT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Why don't you...stop that...and explain yourself!\" Mamoru said in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei whimpered and did her best. But her willpower was sapped, and her hands had their own agenda now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi began to giggle. \"I don't think she can help it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-SHUT UP, USAGI! STOP LOOKING AT MEEEEEEEEEE!\" Rei moaned loudly, at long last reaching a climax, her limbs shuddering and splaying open widely as a series of orgasms rocked her body, each completely and shamefully obvious to her audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the aftermath, Rei hung her head and and trembled. She could feel them both watching her, and couldn't even look them in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were watching us.\" Mamoru said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" Rei said, blushing intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your the girl from this morning.\" Usagi said, more gently but with a giggling tone that was just as unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm not...I didn't....THIS IS GRANDPA'S FAULT!\" Rei squeeled out, her face as red as an apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the story fell out of her lips, told in bursts and stretches, as the humiliated girl relived every awful happening of that afternoon. Mamoru lost his outraged edge after a time, but he still sounded cold and distant. Usagi showed her characteristic sympathy, but also could not help but burst into fits of laughter that caused the whole telling to get derailed as Rei hid her face and wallowed in her embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you, Usagi. I hope you know that.\" Rei said sullenly after a particularly long fit of hysterics from her leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei...\" Usagi said, trying hard to stop her giggles and present a sympathetic face. \"I'm sorry! It must have been awful! But it is a little funny, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...I never would have believed it if I didn't see it for myself! Rei-chan...super cool, super smart, level-headed, mysterious Rei-chan, who's always scolding me and being mean because she has everything so much more together than I do! Super cool Rei-chan who was completely stripped, spanked, and wanked in front of all her neighbors!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi snickered and Rei trembled with embarrassment and frustration. \"D-Don't you laugh at me, Odanga-backa!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Nepho-chan.\" Usagi said, sticking her tongue out at her teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mamoru-san, I'm sorry. I have to kill your girlfriend now.\" Rei muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMamoru snickered. \"Try and your next public spanking will come from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei looked up at him in horror, then gave a soft laugh. \"Your enjoying this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry.\" Usagi said. \"I don't mean to be cruel. But it IS funny, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little.\" Rei relented. \"By the way, I'm not mean. I just give useful advice in a frank manner. It isn't my fault if some ultra sensitive Odanga crybabies take it the wrong way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew she was in there somewhere.\" Mamoru smirked as Usagi made a face. \"And to be fair, Usagi does go out of her way to make you angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\" Rei said, looking pointedly at Usagi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi looked guilty for a moment, then stuck out her tongue again. \"Well, of course! Its the only way I have to know what your really thinking sometimes! And how else am I supposed to compete with ultra cool Rei except doing the one thing I know gets a reaction, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's....the dumbest thing I've ever heard! I'm a creepy shrine maiden with strange powers. Everybody was always scared of me or thought I was weird. The only reason I have any friends is because of you! I'm not...\"super cool\" or collected or whatever! I just..hated talking to people. They act like I'm a monster. Your the one that isn't afraid of acting open and honest! I...hate being naked.\" Rei looked down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi scoffed. \"You were the one that got me through early years, dummie. You had all that mystical training and instincts and everything! I never would have made it without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know what your taking about. I think I knew what I was doing? I was scared out of my mind! We all were! At least you had the courage to admit it!\" Rei snapped. \"It...was easier to act 'cool' after I realized you felt the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei....\" Usagi said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause ensued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Usagi said, a hint of mischief back in her eyes. \"Did you like what you saw?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT??\" Rei practically screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, clearly she did.\" Mamoru said with his quiet smirk. \"You saw her reaction yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true. That was very naughty of you, Rei-chan. Spying on your prince and princess...that's practically treason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait just a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want our help getting home, Rei-chan?\" Usagi asked pointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do!\" Rei snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then answer the question. Did. You. Like. It.\" Usagi asked, inching closer to the black haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei struggled for...something. An answer. An insult. But nothing came out. Until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" She blushed intensely. \"Is that what you want to hear? Yes! You...you are both...beautiful. And...and you were both...beautiful together. A...a perfect fit. Like I knew you would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hung her head a moment. Usagi gently cupped Rei's chin in her hand and raised her to her eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't fair, is it Rei? Everything that's happened, all the battles and pain, and I'm the only one who gets a happy ending. The Dark Kingdom stole away our lovers and made them into Beryl's generals. And only Mamo-chan was saved. You've been trying so hard...to protect me, to teach me...and your reward is to stay alone while my dreams all come true.\" Usagi asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...just the way it is.\" Rei whispered back. \"That's what destiny decided thousands of years ago. You two are meant to be. Chibusa and Crystal Tokyo are coming. That's what we've been fighting for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Heh. All this time I've relied on you to be my mystic support, and you say something that stupid.\" Usagi laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't you call me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei! Crystal Tokyo exists because we CHOOSE for it to exist! Mamo-chan and I love each other, and so that's the future we are moving towards. If...that changed, our future and Chibiusa would disappear tomorrow! None of us want that to happen, but it doesn't make destiny some stupid chain around our necks! Crystal Tokyo will rise the way we want it to, the way we CHOOSE. And...and it isn't my place to force my senshi to find their own happiness. Whether you find a boyfriend of your own is up to you. But...if there was something...ANYTHING I could do to provide that kind of happiness....do you think anything as lame as 'destiny' is going to stop me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....\" Rei began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now destiny demands something very specific.\" Mamoru interrupted.</span></div></div>",

Oh, and lest we forget, who's idea was it go skinny dipping and thus get caught in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you-EEEK!\" Usagi said as she was shoved into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei was shivering like a leaf. The water was colder than she expected. But then a pair of warm arms encircled her from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi...d-don't.

Mamoru was all muscle, like a greek statute come to life. And of course, she could not fail to notice one part in particular...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...thought they shrank in cold water.\" Rei whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi let out a loud giggle. \"He cheats, actually. He...heh...calls up some of his Earth magic, the same stuff that turns him into Tuxedo Mask?...and...channels it. Basically, he can keep it up as long as he wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei looked turned to Usagi in astonishment. The blonde snickered. \"Don't look so amazed. He's smug enough about it as it is. I mean...its awesome, but I really hate the fact that no matter how many times I try I'm the one that ends up exhausted and falling asleep at the end of the night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....oh yeah. Sounds horrible.\" Rei said, dripping with sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could use a little help, you know.\" Usagi whispered in her ear. \"Two against one are good odds, magic or no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi....please.\" Rei said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be honest, Rei-chan. When you were watching  and touching yourself. Were you thinking of him? Or me? Or both?\" Usagi asked, suddenly deadly serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....That's...not important.\" Rei said. \"I-It was a fantasy! I don't...I don't need....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei...I don't know if you heard me earlier, but I figured some things out about myself. You may not remember, but you had me mesmerized the first time I met you. Almost literally. I saw you on a bus heading back to your shrine, and I just sort of...followed you. I know, that sounds a little creepy. But its true. I had never seen anyone so tall and gracefully. You looked like an angel or a kami descended to Earth. Someone too pretty and imposing to be from the real world. But you also seemed a little sad, like you didn't quite know how to fit into this dirty real world. And I got a funny feeling in my stomach when we talked. I didn't know what to think back then. Haruka and Michiru-san helped me understand. They knew before I did, probably saw me staring at other girls the way I would look at Mamo-chan. I love him, and I love looking at his body. I can't believe I didn't realize I was looking at you the same way.\" Usagi whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi...\" Rei whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...Mamo-chan didn't break up with you because he didn't like you. It took a long time for him to admit this, but it was really hard leaving you. He lost his family and memory when he was a little kid, you know. You were...one of the first people he allowed back into his life, you know. You were funny, confident, snarky but loving (a lot like he was, actually) and don't tell him I said this but he adored your body too.\" Usagi whispered. \"If he wasn't afraid of hurting me, he would have-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...s-stop....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Rei-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm....your senshi! I protect the princess! I preserve our future! I can't...I can't ever...be with anyone. Its too important. You are too important!\" Rei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi's eyes narrowed. And then her hands became claws, and Rei found herself screeching in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mamo-chan! I think Rei is ticklish!\" Usagi said with a malicious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMamoru rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Usagi! No! S-heh-heh-Stopit! Get-AHHHH!-nonon-hahahaha! Odanga! Bitchaaaaaaaaaa! No! St-t-haaaaaaa-PP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You deserve to be happy, Rei-chan! Say it! Say you deserve to be happy! Say it or I'll never stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Dummie! Hahahahahaha! Gah! Eeeek! heheheheheh! FINE! I DESERVE IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you deserve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I deserve to be happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say you want to be happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No-ahahahahahahaha-GODDAMIT!

What do you deserve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DESERVE TO BE HAPPY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......to be happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louder! What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei screamed the last word, breathing heavily, blushing, naked, and glaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...errr....that's good too.\" Usagi said softly, blushing back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei looked away. She spied a grinning Mamoru, and opted to look straight down instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mars. My beautiful Senshi of Passion. You've protected me ever since I was a child. But I'm not a little girl anymore. I'm strong enough to protect myself. I'm strong enough to fight with you now. So I don't need any more proud and lonely Senshi to guard their posts in silence anymore. What I want...what I need is my senshi to be happy. And loved. I want them to stop suffering for the sake of their princess. I want them to live their lives beyond just being Senshi! And...and I want more for one in particular. I want to...to take her to breakfast, and go see a movie, and I want to talk to her and get to know her all over again. And...and all the things you do on a date. Her, and me, and Mamo-chan! I want to try that, because it would make me happier than anything if we can make it work. And I want her in my bed tonight. Please, Rei-chan. Please, Mars. My guardian. My mentor. My warrior goddess. Please be more than my protector tonight. Your Prince and Princess want you with them. Will you come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi's voice had changed subtly as she spoke. Rei was holding her breath. She did not need to open her eyes to know that a pale silver glow was suffusing the pool, a glow coming from the icon of the moon manifesting on Usagi's forehead. Right now Sailor Moon was speaking with two voices- a single soul spaced across two lifetimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes. I'll come.\" Rei said softly. What else could she say? \"Thank you, Usagi....Serenity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeee.\" Usagi whispered, the glow dying as her thoughts returned wholly to the modern world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei found herself turning around in the water, warm lips on her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Usagi!\" She moaned. \"W-Wait! Don't touch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like this?\" Usagi whispered as she pressed her soft breasts up against Rei's own orbs. Rei gave a soft cry as her body reacted. Instinctively her legs opened, and immediately found themselves embrace and entwined with Usagi's own. There was an awkward moment as Rei began to grind against the other girl, almost dunking them both in the water. But Usagi navigated the pair into a corner of the pool. Braced by a sturdy wall, Rei found herself pinned against stone and soft flesh. The pair began kissing and scissoring together, Rei neither wanting nor able to control the desperate need inside her. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh! Rei-chan! Oh! Feels so good! Oh! Love you! Yes! Almost! YES!!!\" Usagi moaned loudly as her body arched in a glorious release. The fierce bout of love making was such a contrast from Mamoru. Not that Usagi had any complaints about the slow, methodical way her fiancee tended to explore her body until she could take no more and took control. But now Usagi saw the appeal of being the bottom for an enthusiastic...dare she say desperate?...lover! Was it all the work of that sex plant? Or would this red hot, desperate animal be waiting to come out of that quiet and aloof shrine maiden every time she came to Usagi's bed? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi paused. This was just the calm before the storm. Rei would need a moment to come down from her own explosive orgasm, then they would be on to another round of love making. THen her eyes widened. She saw her boyfriend, fully clothed in the garb of his alter ego Tuxedo Mask. And he was scooping up all their clothes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Mamo-chan! What's the big-ack!\" Usagi suddenly found herself once more embraced by her black haired paramour. \"Rei! Wait! No! Stop! I have to-oh god! I have to-to-not there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't!\" Rei moaned. \"Don't you dare! I need you! I warned you not to! I need you now! Don't go! Don't go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use your fingers!\" Usagi pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOO! No fingers! Your better! Your warm! Wanna feel your tongue! Gotta feel your tits on mine! G-gotta feel my clit grinding inside your pussy! So warm! So goooooood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's stealing my-meh! No! We-oh-oh-oh!\" Usagi shuddered. \"J-Just-USE THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation Usagi turned Rei around and practically manhandled her lower portions onto one of the jets pumping water into the pool. The black haired girl continued to protest and beg, but the way her breasts began to bounce up and down in the water said she was enjoying the distraction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back in a sec!\" Usagi said, before scrambling out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAMO-CHAN!\" She bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handsome figure turned around and smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....you get out of those things right now and joins us!\" Usagi demanded, a little indignant and a little desperate. To feel him inside her while Rei kissed and foddled her body...the very idea made her melt! Plus she was anticipating the look on Rei's face the first time Mamoru took her, like this was some marvelous secret she could finally confess to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Usako.\" Mamoru said in that calming voice he had. \"You saw how much she hesitated before. Let's not push her into this all at once. If she wants to be with both of us, I want her to be the one to say it. Preferably after that plant has been washed off of her and she's had a chance to consider all a bit more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi pouted, then nodded. \"Okay. But...what are you doing with those clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were getting wrinkled.\" Mamoru said with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Mamo-chan...I don't like that look on your face...\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do remember I said I would be upset if anyone caught us, right?\" Mamoru said with a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But...it was just Rei-chan! And things turned out really well!\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm. You have a point. But I'm afraid you still need to be disciplined for being so reckless.\" Mamoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mamo-chan...your not going to....\" Usagi gaped in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at it as a chance to experience what it was like for Rei-chan earlier. You were curious, remember?\" Mamoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't want that to become true! You can't!\" Usagi squeeked. \"What if something happens to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. Who do you think your talking to? I've spent my life saving you even before I realized I was Tuxedo Mask! It may seem like my powers have remained static while the rest of you gained stronger magic and attacks, but the reality is my powers have just advanced in subtler directions. I always had a sixth sense when you were in danger. These days that sense will warn me well before any actual attacks. In fact, all I need to do is close my eyes and I can see what's happening to you or the senshi at any given time! I can also jump higher, move faster, and strike harder than I used to. In other words, if anyone dares to attack you or hurt you or attack you....\" Tuxedo Mask produced a rose from his inner pocket and flung it at a nearby tree, ripping a hole straight through the trunk! \"I'll be there, ready to stop me at the perfect moment. Just like always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi breathed a sigh of relief. \"So you won't let anyone see us naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? Of course I will. I mean real danger here. You two getting embarrassed and humiliated doesn't qualify.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi glowered at him. Mamoru could be very sweet, but he had a bit of a vindictive edge to him. These days it only surfaced when Usagi acted particularly childish or made a poor grade. But when they first met he never failed to tease and chide her without mercy. He seemed to love making her squirm. Old habits die hard, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mamo-channnnnnn! This is going too far! Please! Just...spank me or something?\" Usagi begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm saving that for later.\" Mamoru smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi ground her teeth. This was bad! How could she....ugh. It was really cold being wet and naked and out in the open. She hugged herself. And in doing so, she brushed against her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" Usagi screamed, as she found herself suddenly filled with an intoxicating need to play with her breasts! Her erect nipple was suddenly and liberally foddled, pinched, pulled and pressed in a mortifying display of lust. To her dismay, she found the call to masturbate equally unstoppable. Soon she was on her knees, face down and but high in the air, filling herself with desperate abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Well, while the chlorine did nothing for Rei-chan, I see all that rubbing and grinding did scrape some of that plant enzyme off on someone else.\" Mamoru said smuggly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mamo-chan! You better-Oooooooh-better not-not GOOOOOOOOO.\" Usagi wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you back at the apartment, Usako. Good luck.\" Mamoru said. And left her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Damit!\" Usagi moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned you!\" Rei muttered, appearing out of the pool next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair shifted around on th soft grass by the pool. Crossing their legs around one anothers bodies, the pair once more began to grind against each other, helpless in the throes of their mutual lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Rei! T-This iiis your fault!\" Usagi gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Ah! We would have AH! AH! b-been fine if you'd j-j-just helped me get hoooooooome!\" Rei muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odanga-brain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faster!\"</span></div></div>",

The second major problem was that she was in a decidedly urban environment. Stores stretched down the street in either direction, and not just small outlet stores, but major retailers and restaurants. Even worse, interspersed among these facilities were office buildings, the lights suggesting a great deal of people working within! Any bored office worker that chose to look out a window had a chance of seeing the naked, soaked girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto knew she had to change this situation, and fast. Standing out in the open was just asking for someone to see her. Quickly looking around, Makoto desperately tried to figure out what options looked best. In this situation, 'best' was a very relative term, as Makoto would have never considered either option in other circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few buildings down the street from where she stood, an alleyway opened up to the street. Makoto could run forward and duck in there. There was no telling who might be back there, where the alleys might lead, and how pleasant such a hiding place would be, but it would give her a way to get away from the open street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's second option was behind her. While it was still on the street, it would theoretically keep her completely hidden. The front of one store had some decorative bushes out front; thick plant life three feet tall. The only problem was that she'd be stuck there until an opportunity presented itself, and it wouldn't be the most comfortable place to hide. Aside from being forced to stay on her hands and knees, Makoto would be surrounded by jagged branches and whatever else might be lingering in those bushes. Another thing to consider was the fact that one side of the bushes faced the windows of said store. If she didn't hide in the exact center of the bushes, she ran a risk of being seen on either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth options had their pros and cons, and Makoto was running out of time in her head.

In their place was a growing feeling of anger. These people had malfunctioning equipment. It had merely (MERELY!) stripped her naked, but what if the filter had caught onto her hair or otherwise caused serious harm. And the first response of these people when sighting a naked girl was to throw her out into the street? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, it was the anger that broke through to her power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neptune Star Power, MAKE UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instructor and a security guard burst into the room. What awaited them, aside  from the few remaining (and even more stunned than before) students changing was the imposing figure of a sailor scout dressed in white and green and poised on the edge of a wooden bent, her hands crossed and her face retaining Michiru's menacing glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guarded by Neptune, planet of the deep blue sea, I'm the soldier of affinity, Sailor Neptune. In the name of Neptune and the Moon, I will punish you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instructor stared in stunned silence. \"A sailor scout? I...are you here about that pervert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You leave that poor girl alone!\" Neptune snapped, putting her hands on her hips. \"Do you even know what the situation is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a woman skinny dipping in the pool!\" The instructor exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WRONG! There was a swimmer using the pool in the early morning hours, as she has many times previously! Her name is Michiru Takeuchi. She has patronized your school for several years now! Her only crime was to swim a little past the normal hours alotted to non-students. Afterward she fell victim to one of your malfunctioning filter systems, which I suggest you have repaired before they seriously hurt anyone! Her bathing suit was torn to pieces, a fact easily proven if you care to empty your filters and find the remains of the fabric! She attempted to inform you of this, only to be bombarded with accusations and suppositions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know all of this?\" The instructor demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a pretty soldier of love and justice! We make it our business to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's still running through our campus naked-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AFTER YOU THREATENED TO EXPEL HER ONTO THE STREET WITHOUT CLOTHING! What is the matter with you? You discover a naked woman in public, and rather than find something to cover her with and listen to an explanation, you want to humiliate her? What if instead of an accident she had been robbed, or Neptune forbid assaulted?\" Neptune said in contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...All right. You've made your point. She still needs to be found-\" The instructor began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*I* will find the girl. YOU will send a letter of apology to Michiru Takeuchi and your school principal. And you will personally see to it that your fiters are shut off and repaired before they hurt anyone else. And if I EVER hear even a whisper of you treating anyone as you treated that girl today, I promise I will return here and personally Deep Submerge straight into the floor! ARE WE CLEAR ON THIS?\" Neptune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yes. Yes, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. NOW GET OUT OF HERE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instructor fled, the guards trailing behind him. Michiru allowed herself half a moment of feeling smug, then glanced around the locker room.Everyone was staring at her, some nodding in approval, others looking at her with contempt, but most just staring in stunned disbelief, looks they no doubt had worn since she had appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay. May have overdid that one a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem. Excuse me.\" Neptune said, rushing out the nearest exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...now what? I could go back for my clothes, but I can't see being able to do that without attracting attention. Or I can go home like this.\" She looked down at her sailor fuku. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Scouts did have a level of agility and superhuman grace that allowed them to traverse great distances with little effort. But even with all that making it to the other side of the city was a daunting task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly felt herself sway a little. Ugh. Her Sailor Power came in part from the celestial magics inherent in the stars and planets, and partly from her own life force. When those two forces were out of balance, the magic was difficult to maintain. Neptune kicked herself- 'oh, one more moonlight swim! It'll be great! I'm sure it won't leave you physically exhausted or anything.'. Maintaining her power was taking an awful lot of concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeptune turned and blinked in surprise. Of all people to bump into her alter ego, here was her autograph seeker! Neptune blushed in spite of herself. All things considered, the light physical contact he had made with her was not such a big deal. Certainly if Haruka heard about it all it would provoke was a laugh and perhaps a little teasing at her expense. Yet, perhaps because of the boy's seeming forthrightness and politeness, combined with his obvious adoration of her, the touch somehow felt a lot more intimate to her. He seemed so nice, and the combination of proximity and the brief glimpse of her naked body would probably be on the poor boy's mind until the end of time. And Neptune really had no idea how to feel about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right...Uh...Neptune-san?\" The boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Of course. Umm...is there something you needed?\" Neptune stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to thank you for intervening back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...weren't exactly being quiet.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeptune blushed again, in spite of herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, thank you for sticking up for her. That instructor has been a pain since the semester began.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-certainly. I...I was happy to help. P-please excuse me!\" Neptune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, Neptune-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeptune glanced back.</span></div></div>",

Brandishing her wand, she moved in a quick circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neptune Star Power, Make-up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was engulfed by a light blue energy field, feeling herself gently caressed as if diving deep into the ocean. With relief, she felt the energy slap against her body like a wave on the short, rematerilizing her shoes and hopefully skirt. Who knows how long it would last, though. It was a temporary reprieve at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...can I ask your name?\" Michiru said to the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh, sure. My name is Shun.\" The boy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Shun. This is a little awkward. I seem to be losing hold of my transformation.\" Michiru said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Will you be able to search for Michiru-san after all, then?\" Shun asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...not actually an issue. Listen, Shun, I need to tell you something. I'm..going to trust you to be discreet here. I'm actually- AHHH!\" Michiru said, jerking back in agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea she was this exhausted. The only times she had felt actual pain when maintaining her power had been in the worst of battles, the sort in which reverting to human would be deadly. Forcing the transformation to be maintained apparently used up the last of her reserves. How did this happen? Had she really used that much energy this morning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her eyes her costume began to dissolve into threads of pure energy. Soon she was nothing more than a naked silhouette bathed in a blue neon light. Only her eyes were clearly visible. As the light was fading, it occurred to her too late that she was about to reveal herself to him in more ways than once. She stood before him completely naked, her body still glistening from her morning swim, her green hair plastered to her sides, her body hunched over with her hands attempting to cover her large breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michiru-san?\" Shun asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe full weight of the situation finally registered with Michiru. This boy knew a lot about her. If he was a typical fan, he probably knew more about her life than she remembered herself. And he had just learned who she really was. Michiru's cheeks became flushed, and her body began to shiver. She tried to say something, but the only thing that came out was a tiny noise at the back of her throat that might have been an 'eep'. Her body seemed to move in slow motion now, her limbs feeling heavy. She timidly turned and ran on tip toe a short distance to hide behind a bush growing along the side of the building. Before, she had been oggled by dozens of students and humiliated beyond belief. But now she had no magic, no clothes, and her most important secrets were out in the open. She was as helpless as she could be, and she knew it. Seeing his shocked expression and feeling his eyes on her body was so much worse than anything she had suffered before. For all she had been through, in that moment she felt more naked than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michiru-san!\" Shun repeated, walking toward the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru managed to raise one trembling hand out from the leaves and offer a little wave in acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU are a senshi?\" Shun asked, as if doubting the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't tell.\" She said, peeking out one bashful eye. Her self-assurance had completely vanished along with her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Shun agreed. \"I...I don't know what to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....could you...find me some clothes?\" Michiru said, trying unsuccessfully to shake out of the timid spell she had come under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be a problem, Michiru-san. People are looking for you everywhere. At this point security guards and paparazzi are likely clustering around any source of free clothes they can find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Paparazzi?\" Michiru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You are very popular in certain circles. Certain tabloids love you, and would love even more to humiliate you. If someone gets a good picture of you like this, I am certain it will be on the front page tomorrow.\" Shun said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. I didn't think of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They also know I helped you before. If they see me collecting clothes somewhere, they are almost certain to realize what I am doing.\" Shun said. \"I'm sorry, Michiru-san. But I do know a place you can hide. I can take you there. It isn't very far at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her first instinct was that it was Shun returning, but she quickly remembered that he said he'd knock. This was someone else! Michiru had to find a place to hide! Scanning the room, Michiru quickly found a suitable hiding spot: a cart filled with soccer balls. It wouldn't be comfortable, but it would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, whoever was trying to open the door seemed to be having some trouble with the lock. This gave Michiru enough time to climb into the cart, displacing a number of balls as she tried to force herself into the pile. It would probably look suspicious for so many balls to have fallen out of the cart, but that wouldn't lead anybody to assume it meant a naked girl was hiding in the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more than a few seconds after Michiru had buried herself in the cart and covered herself up did the door open. From her hiding place, Michiru could overhear several voices in conversation as they stepped into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no joke. Some chick was caught skinny dipping in the school pool.\" said one boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea who it was?\" another boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. She wasn't a student here. But whoever it was, she knew Sailor Neptune. She showed up and chewed out the coach for not trying to help the girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, really? Do you think... maybe that was Neptune's secret identity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, man. There's no way a Senshi would parade around naked. They're all way too good to do something perverted like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru burned in shame as she listened to the boys discuss her recent debacle. If only that boy knew how right his assumption was... Thankfully, it would just remain a rumor, and nobody would find out that it was Sailor Neptune all those people had seen naked. Well, nobody except Shun, at least...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Michiru felt the cart begin to move! The boys had come for the cart she was hiding in! But... she was supposed to wait here for Shun! If they carted her away, what would he think when he came back to an empty shed? Worse than that, where were they taking her?! Being careful not to make her presence known, Michiru pushed a ball away from the side of the cart, pressing an eye close to the metal wire frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru's breath caught in her throat as she saw where she was being carted. This wasn't good. This wasn't good at all.</span></div></div>",

Soon enough she felt the world around her being jostled as one soccer ball after another was claimed. Bit by bit her naked body was being uncovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru tried not to think about the situation. Here she was, Michiru Kaiou, the high class girl who's refined talents with the violin and paint had earned her semi-celebrity status. She liked to think of herself as the model of grace and elegance, the perfect example of an upper class girl with just the proper air of mystery and grace. While she was hardly a snob, she did relish disarming the people around her just a little bit. In her own way, Michiru was as much a hopeless flirt as Haruka. But where her lover liked to target girls, Michiru had a knack for flustering and embarrassing the boys. The two made a game out of it most evenings, seeing who could reduce the most subjects of the preferred sex to babbling, blushing fools over the course of a night. As for Haruka, it was a matter of pride that not even she was immune to Michiru's flirtations, and conversely that Michiru was the one girl Haruka could not get to blush no matter how hard she tried. And that was the way it should be- the men around her awe-struck, servile, and meek while she remained aloof, patient, and the picture of grace while wearing her patent Mona Lisa smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....The elegant, high class Michiru was hiding butt naked in a ball pin with dozens and dozens of boys all around her half her age. If only her Haruka could see her now, blushing like mad and cowering, utterly helpless! She would never hear the end of it! Her body, an instrument she had sculpted and refined just as much as her violin or works of art, the body she prided herself on making tasteful yet alluring and used to hint and tease her admirers with while never showing it to anyone except her precious Haruka...soon it would once again be seen by hundreds of total strangers! Michiru had to clench her teeth together to stifle a scream at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it happened. As other teammates continued to claim their balls, one boy went rooting a little deeper. To Michiru's lasting horror, his probing hand was all too suddenly gripping her full breast, still buried beneath the other balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heck?\" He said, his hand squeezing her full round breast more carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Michiru had been red before, now she was in danger of exploding. Until recently, Haruka had been the only one to touch her in any semi-intimate fashion. Even Shun, as embarrassing as that contact had been, had touched her body as little as possible and only few a moment or two. Now she was being foddled by a teenager, and not terribly gently!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Isuru! Do we have anything besides soccer balls in this bin?\" The boy called, still touching her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, no? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check this out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru silently begged whoever Isuru was not to listen, but all too soon she felt another hand on her other breast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, your right. What is that? Some kind of softball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno. What's this little nubby thing on the end, anyway?\" The first boy asked, pinching and pulling her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno. Whatever it is, its stuck in there good!\" Isuru announced, painfully yanking on her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can dig it out?\" The first boy suggested.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Sailor Senshi have many secrets. Somewhere on the Moon, overlooking the Sea of Serenity, lies the ruins of a vast city and a magnificent castle. Whether by luck or some bit of magical protection lingering from the days of the Silver Millenium, none of innumerable probes, telescopes, or visitors making one small step on the moon's surface have discovered this particular ruin. This was the grand court of the Senshi in a forgotten age. And as one might expect, such an edifice contains secrets within secrets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of those secrets is a doorway deep within the inner keep of the castle. Behind that door, in a physical sense, there is only the white stone that makes up the walls of the castle. That's because the door doesn't connect to a place so much as a WHEN. It connects to the dangerous pathways of Time. Walk those paths long enough you could end up centuries in the past or in a time yet to come. And should you so desire, you could alter the present or the future by manipulating events in one of these other times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat of course is exactly why this door and the passages beyond have their own guardian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna Meiou, otherwise known as Sailor Pluto (Pluu to her friends) is by far the greatest enigma amongst the Senshi. Supposedly she had stood as a lonely sentinel of Time for the whole span of human history. That was probably true, technically speaking. The problem with a door that literally exists both outside of and yet concurrent with every point in human history is that it makes measuring the exact length of Pluto's tenure here almost impossible. If the Senshi are not in effect immortal and eternally young, then at the very least they age at an absurdly slow rate beyond a certain age (witness how the Senshi one thousand years from the present appear, at most, to be in their twenties!). Guessing Pluto's true age is therefore impossible, especially considering that her mastery of Time allows her to leave her post to (for example) help Michiru and Haruka raise a baby Sailor Saturn for however long that requires then pop back half a second after she left and take up her guardianship yet again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat little is known about her is that, while on watch, she appears inexpressibly lonely. The only friend to speak of is the occasional visit from Chibiusa, the daughter of Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask born roughly a thousand years from now. She seems much happier in the present, living with her fellow outer senshi and their adopted (potentially world destroying!) daughter. Per the manga, Setsuna works as a nurse in the school that Hotaru (Sailor Saturn) currently attends, and taking care of sick children is one of the few times she appears unabashedly happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat relationships Pluto has had are obviously few and far between. Some sources say she had an unrequited love for Tuxedo Mask that she never followed through on. Less tragically, living together with a lesbian couple and helping them raise a child certainly suggests that Setsuna could have a more than casual relationship with Michiru and Haruka. That being said, her years (centuries? Millenia?) alone keeping watch over Time has left her rather quiet and reserved. In some ways she is kindest member of the Outer Senshi, usually showing sympathy where Neptune and Uranus show aggression. Yet she is also the most fatalistic, for who knows better what is to come than the Senshi of Time? More generally, being cut off from human contact has made her reclusive by nature. The Senshi aside, her only meaningful contact with anyone tended intruders trying to get through the Time Door. For that reason, she prefers to avoid strangers as much as possible and limit her contact to her friends. Of all the Senshi, she is perhaps the least comfortable with dealing with awkward situations, strong emotions, or intimate relationships due to the simple fact that such things have been few and far between for her. For someone so closed off and constantly on guard, let alone a woman who may have gone hundreds of years without another human being seeing or touching her, the mortifying situation Pluto is about to find herself in is no doubt going to be especially hard for her to deal with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, where was Pluto when her unfortunate circumstances began?</span></div></div>",

Yes, the youma decided, this was perfect - for years, the senshi had brought humiliation on their kind, now it was time to return the favor. And they themselves had provided the opportunity for it, which was almost as sweet as the act itself would. But how to start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, after some thought, the first step seemed obvious. So, the youma went to the changing rooms where the senshi had left their clothes and belongings, and with a snap of its fingers, made them all disappear into thin air. Now the youma really were left with nothing but their towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the hard decision. Should the youma wait for the senshi to emerge from the hot springs so it could watch their panic at finding their clothes gone, or should it do something else to further add to their humiliation immediately? And if so, what could it do? After all, there were so many options available to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the youma made its decision and...</span></div></div>",

So many ways that being naked in a semi-public place could go wrong in a horribly embarrassing way. So, the question remained, what was the youma going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more minutes of thought, the youma laughed evilly as it decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Switch around the hot springs' signs, marking the one the senshi are in as the men's room, and waiting for someone to stumble on the bathing senshi.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">A story created on request for a Sailor Moon ENF, based mainly around the anime. The general guidelines are the same as found in all my other stories. A brief overview:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuide the selected character through a series of events that leave her stark naked, far from cover, and completely embarrassed. While the character may find something to cover herself up with, it generally shouldn't last for too long (think a couple chapters at most).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this particular story, please keep in mind the setting. Unless a character is travelling, they should be in Tokyo, Japan, where the series takes place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral restrictions-<br>\r\nNo scat, gore, vore, shrinking, growing, rape (other forms of sex allowed, subject to removal at my discretion), transformation, and the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, for a basic rundown of the characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon (Usagi Tsukino)- <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Moon_\" target=\"_blank\">http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Moon_</a>(anime)<br>\r\nLeader of the Sailor Senshi, yet arguably one of the least mature. While she has grown into her role as a hero, she is still known to have her \"crybaby moments\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Venus (Minako Aino)- <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Venus_\" target=\"_blank\">http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Venus_</a>(anime)<br>\r\nSoldier of Love and Beauty, Venus is a dreamer. Hoping to be a famous performer one day, the perky youth attends auditions whenever the opportunity arises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Mercury (Ami Mizuno)- <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Mercury_\" target=\"_blank\">http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Mercury_</a>(anime)<br>\r\nSoldier of Water and Wisdom. The quiet bookworm of the group. Rumored to have an IQ of 300, she is easily the smartest of the bunch. While she puts forth a shy exterior, this hides her love for pop culture and romance novels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Mars (Rei Hino)- <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Mars_\" target=\"_blank\">http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Mars_</a>(anime)<br>\r\nSoldier of Fire and Passion. Elegant and serious, though a tad boy crazy and short-tempered. As a shrine maiden, Rei is gifted with limited precognition, allowing her to occasionally glimpse bits of the future. Unlike the rest of the Senshi, Sailor Mars attends a private Catholic school, separate from her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Jupiter (Makoto Kino)- <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Jupiter_\" target=\"_blank\">http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Jupiter_</a>(anime)<br>\r\nSoldier of Thunder and Strength. A bit of a tomboy, and easily the strongest of the Senshi in terms of physical prowess, Makoto is certainly unlike the average Japanese girl. As an orphan, Makoto lives alone and takes care of herself, having developed skills in housekeeping, cooking, and gardening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Uranus (Haruka Tenou)- <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Uranus\" target=\"_blank\">http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Uranus</a><br>\r\nSoldier of Sky and Fury. A year older than most of the other Senshi. An excellent driver with dreams of becoming a racer, Uranus is more of a tomboy than even Jupiter, preferring to dress and even speak like a man in most situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Neptune (Michiru Kaiou)- <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Neptune\" target=\"_blank\">http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Neptune</a><br>\r\nSoldier of the Ocean and Embrace. An elegant and wealthy girl, as well as a talented violinist and painter. Neptune has given up her own dreams, instead devoting herself fully to her duties as a Senshi, willing to make any sacrifice for the sake of her duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Pluto (Setsuna Meiou)- <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Pluto\" target=\"_blank\">http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Sailor_Pluto</a><br>\r\nSoldier of Time and Space. A bit of a mystery to the rest of the Senshi, having come to earth from outer space. While her personality is distant and her demeanor stern, she is capable of being quite friendly, and aids the other Senshi when she can. Her time in space has left her with a feeling of great loneliness.</td>",
