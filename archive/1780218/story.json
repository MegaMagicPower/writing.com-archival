The town refused, so now he's attacking with his army of monsters! He'll tear the entire place down unless someone stops him! That's where I come in. I've trained long and hard for the time that an adventurer would be necessary, and it's finally here! Well, I'm gonna head out now. Feel free to follow me. Oh! Right! Which gate should I go through? The northern gate is the one that is heavily guarded by enemies, but closer to the warlock's lair. The southern gate is farther away, but there are many less monsters.

She reached his lair, and was greeted by many, many stone sculptures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK? That's a bit odd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she heard a loud hissing noise from behind her.

Three demons, five dragons and a medusa. A medusa's gaze can turn a mortal to stone. Jessica knew this, and avoided the medusa's gaze at any cost. Of course, she wasn't looking where she was going directly, and ran right into a dragon. The dragon seemed hungry at the time. It decided to eat lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarrington got his money from the village, then burned it to the ground for its insolence. His dragon died of lead poisoning, from eating too much metal in one sitting. The prince, however, had a spell cast on him. One that turned him into a mosquito, and he was then released.

She heard a loud *thud* from behind her, and assumed that the maze was supposed to close off this route once she entered it. The only way for her to travel was forward. She started wading through the pond, and when she reached waistline height, she fell face first into it. She stood up and started walking out of the pond, since there was no exit beyond the pond. However, as she started wading out, her armor began melting. Well, not melting, turning into water. Her skin turned a light blue color, as did her hair. Her sword and shield simply melted into water as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">You chose poorly!

You don't need to worry about updating this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, this story is the true adventure of a lifetime. You pick a character from the start, both intending to become the best adventurer of all time. To do this, they must complete the following tasks, in no necessary order:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Defeat the evil warlock who is attacking their town with his army of monsters.<br>\r\n2. Avoid curses and find ways to, you know, remain active.<br>\r\n3. Rescue the princess/prince from the warlock, who has kidnapped them for a ransom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimple enough, right? However, along the way, the two have many things that could happen to them. For a couple of examples, they could swap genders, and then be forced into a different position. They could turn into an immobile item of some sort. They could be killed in battle. Many options, many problems. You decide what they do, and they suffer the consequences, no matter what they may be. Sounds fun, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what are you waiting for?!?
