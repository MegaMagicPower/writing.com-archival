            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It happened a long time ago in Northern Germany. A small village sat in the clearing of a vast forest. And just beyond the edge of the village, sitting in the shadow of the trees stood a small cottage. It was the home of two innocent and naive children; Hansel a young and blonde haired boy, and Gretel, his curly haired sister. The two of them were the best of friends and in their naivete, they could not imagine that life could be better; despite their poverty and hunger, the two couldn't be happier. They had never tasted luxury in their lives, so they were completely ignorant of how little they had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the two of them were in the care of those who were fully aware of their poverty and longed for the taste and comfort of luxury. The two were the children of most despicable parents. Their father was a hen-pecked woodsman who had long since surrendered his honor. Their mother was a deplorable woman compelled by greed and want. Their father tried in vain to chop wood to sell to their fellow villagers. But this was a time of famine; every business in the village was suffering and the people grew poor. The luxury of freshly-chopped wood was soon replaced by any man willing to pick up an axe or a woman willing to gather sticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel and Gretel's family were the ones hit worst by the depression and the family was soon going to go hungry. If something was not done and soon, then they would all surely starve. Their mother - fiendish and uncaring - suggested something awful. She ordered her husband to take the children into the woods as far away as he could. And when he was certain they were far enough away, to abandon the children there. The man was shocked that his wife would suggest such a thing. She reasoned that the children were too much a burden on them; with their mouths to feed, she and her husband barely got anything. But if they were gone, then they would have more than enough to last the famine. Hopelessly defeated, the man agreed to do the deed and abandon his children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Hansel and Gretel had overheard their parents' plotting. While Gretel was distraught that their parents would do this, Hansel came up with a plan. That night, he snuck out of the house and gathered pocket-fulls of pebbles. The next morning, their mother gave them a crust of bread and warned them to make it last, as it would be the only food they would be getting today. She sent them off with their father as he led them into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two children followed their father deeper into the dark of the woods, Hansel would reach into his pocket and drop a stone to mark the path they were taking. They walked for several hours until the Father had taken them into the deepest part of the woods. He told them to wait here for him while he scouted the area ahead and when it was safe, he'd come back for them. So the children obeyed. The man took the opportunity to sneak away, leaving his own children to die...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the two of them knew of this treachery. They waited a few hours until they were certain their father had gone. Hansel then pointed out to the pebbled trail that he had formed on the way here. Just as soon as night had fallen, the two found their way out of the woods and were back home.<br>\r\nThe two of them entered the cottage to find their parents who were quite shocked to see them. But only for a moment as the two put on the charade of having been worried about them. The mother scolded them for \"getting lost in the woods after leaving their father,\" and slapped them both upside the head. She sent them to bed without dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever from their room they overheard their sinister mother plotting again; telling their father to this time take them even deeper into the woods and abandon them again. And this time, she made sure they wouldn't come back. Hansel was worried as to what this might mean. He got his answer when he tried to sneak out into the garden to gather more pebbles. He found that the door was locked. He couldn't get outside. His mother was onto their scheme. Without those pebbles, what could they possibly use to get back home?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning started out the same as the last. The mother gave them a crust of bread and sent them off. The two winced at how she hadn't even kissed them goodbye this time. Hansel glared at her, determined that this would not be the last time they saw her, even if only for spite.<br>\r\nIt wasn't too long into the walk that Gretel felt her hunger and asked for the crust. Hansel told her of his desperate plan; because he could not gather pebbles to mark the trail, this time they had to use what they had with them; the crust of bread. Hansel would occasionally crumple a piece of crust and drop it behind him, leaving a trail of breadcrumbs behind. It was desperate and they were hungry, but it was their only choice now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their father abandoned them again, they were in a deeper and darker part of the forest and Gretel was frightened and hungry. But Hansel tried to reassure her that everything would be alright. They had a trail they could follow back home. He looked down and saw the breadcrumbs. The two of them followed the trail back, but no sooner had they gone a few hundred feet or so did they spot a large black crow sitting on the ground, pecking into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them were disheartened by it as they watched it peck up all of the breadcrumbs that Hansel left for the trail. And beyond the bird, there was no sign of where the trail continued. It - among others - must've pecked the trail clean. Hansel and Getel were very frightened now. The two of them had just been abandoned in the forest by their uncaring father and they  had no trail to follow back home. The woods had a treacherous reputation; men lived in fear of what could be living in these woods. Who knows what danger they could be in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two children wandered around for hours. Gretel complained from her hunger and berated Hansel for wasting their only food. But there was nothing that could be done about this. They were tired and they were lost. He was kicking himself for throwing the bread crumbs away. He was certain he'd doomed himself and his sister to an earlier starvation than even their cruel mother intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever suddenly a pleasant scent caught their noses. They could smell something sweet and warm; baked goods and candy-syrup. They were so hungry that they weren't at all cautious or suspicious of the smell and instinctively followed it until it lead them to a clearing in the woods. What they found there was beyond incredible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small cottage - larger than their home, mind you - but what was remarkable about it was that the walls and roof were made of gingerbread. The windows were lined with what looked like frosting, the shutters were peanut-brittle, the building was decorated with large pieces of candy stuck to the walls, with frosting serving as mortar, the front-porch pavilion was held-up with enormous candy-canes and the huge round-door was made from an enormous rainbow lollipop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children were certain that they were already dead and that this was Heaven. Dead or not, it didn't matter; they were far too hungry to hesitate any longer. They rushed toward the house, headed for the nearest window. They broke off whatever pieces that they could; window shutters, licorice gutters, and gingerbread walls. They were absolutely starving and they did not hesitate to wolf-down the mouthfuls that they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did they know...they were being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a witch who lives here...how does the witch react to this? How does she behave? What does she do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Hansel and Gretel finished their first mouthfuls, they moved to grab more from the house. Hansel moved to grab the candy-cane handle railing near the door, when he suddenly took notice that someone was there, standing in the doorway. He jumped back when he saw her and Gretel took notice of her too, grabbing her brother's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person standing there was a middle-aged woman, wearing a somewhat tattered dress. Her eyes were sunken in with baggy eyes, like she hadn't had a good night's rest in quite some time. Her red hair was tangled and somewhat faded. he looked rather frazzled like they'd disturbed her from a nap. She was merely leaning against her door-frame, watching them for they couldn't tell how long, and quietly running her fingers along the railing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" she began to say in a rather youthful and elegant voice. \"Maybe it's because I live alone in the middle of the woods but...I was under the impression that going up to someone's home and just helping themselves to their front-porch was a very poor-show of manners.\" Her voice betrayed a sarcastic cynicism, like she was slightly amused at catching the nervous children in the act; like a smug satisfaction came over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel immediately dropped whatever portion he had left and patted himself down. \"We're terribly sorry, Ma'am,\" he said trying desperately to make himself look presentable to the lady. \"It's just that...we had no idea that anyone would be living here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I suppose you think that Candy-Houses just 'pop-up' in the middle of nowhere at complete random, do you?\" she asked now cupping her chin in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are so sorry for damaging your home, Miss,\" Gretel spoke up. \"We just...haven't had anything to eat for quite some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" the lady said now standing up and revealing a broom-stick in her hands. She began to sweep some dust and dirt that had collected on the front-porch of the house. \"When I saw you from the kitchen for a moment I mistook you both for broom-sticks...or scarecrows. You look awful, dears. Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um; sorry for my rudeness Ma'am,\" Hansel said. \"My name is Hansel. And this is my sister, Gretel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Hansel and Gretel...what are you doing so far out in the woods, and so late in the day?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...That's just it Miss,\" Gretel said. She tried to explain but then suddenly tears came to her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...was it something I said?\" the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel had retreated into Hansel's arms. He comforted her and looked over at the woman. \"Oh no, Ma'am...It's just...we were lost in the woods and couldn't find out way home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're from the village,\" the woman assumed. \"We've still got some daylight; I can take you back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would be most appreciative of that Ma'am,\" Hansel said lighting up. \"You hear that, Gretel? We're going home. This nice lady is going to take us home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what good will it do? You saw what she did last night; why should tomorrow be any different? He'll just bring us back out here and leave us again?\" Gretel was now crying into Hansel's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman hearing this had taken a step forward and raised a rather concerned eyebrow. \"What does she mean, Hans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that...we weren't lost on purpose Ma'am,\" he told her. \"Our parents abandoned us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They abandoned you?!\" the woman said now sounding rather alarmed and almost a bit angry. She took a step toward the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...at home we...don't have much,\" Hansel said. \"Our mother thought it would be better if we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother,\" the woman said calmly after Hansel had trailed off. She pursed her lip and took a deep breath. She looked off toward the woods when she heard a sound; probably some animal close by trying not to be seen. She returned her eyes to the two children; the crying girl and her brother attempting to be stoic. She surveyed the small hole they'd made in her house. She sighed again before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know...gingerbread and candy might be good, but it really isn't all that nourishing,\" she said leaning on her knees toward them. \"Especially for those who look like they haven't had much for some time. Why don't you come inside and sit-down? I've put-on a nice and plump goose; far too much for me by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel and Gretel perked up and looked at her smiling. \"Really?\" Gretel asked brightly. \"Oh thank you, Miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman turned and led them into the gingerbread house. The two children followed her inside after the promise of a good meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to them?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The woman led them into her home. Hansel and Gretel were astounded; the house was just as beautiful inside as it was on the outside. It seemed larger than their own home; not much larger though. There was a kitchen with an incredibly large baking oven. There den had a small couch against the wall, a wool rug, and a rocking chair just in front of the fire place. And in the fire place was a plump and golden-brown roasted goose skewered through a spit, just above the rolling flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen had many cooking tools strewn about. The place was disorganized but it was so cozy. The woman took off her coat and hung it up. \"Make yourselves comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really appreciate this, Miss...um,\" Gretel said realizing they hadn't heard her name yet. The woman smiled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helma...my name is Helma,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you very much, Lady Helma,\" Hansel said. The two of them took a seat on the couch. The two of them noticed the hole they'd made in the walls of her house. The two began to feel guilty about that. \"We are very sorry about your walls. We were just so hungry. I hope you'll forgive us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Helma told them. \"It's easily repaired.\" Helma returned to the living room and went to the spit. \"Should be just another few minutes.\" She began turning the crank. \"I was turning it just like this when I saw you both come up. I hope that I can still keep it even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, we hope that we haven't ruined anything,\" Hansel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Helma, would you mind if I asked,\" Gretel began. \"Well I just noticed that you had such a large oven in the kitchen. Why wouldn't you use that for the goose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my baking oven,\" Helma told them. \"I'm sure you've noticed that I'm a baker by trade. I use the oven for baking cookies and pastries. I can cook up to three dozen pies all at once in there. Besides, rotisserie style is the only way to properly roast a goose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It smells so delicious,\" Hansel said, his stomach giving an audible growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does, doesn't it?\" Helma asked as she went back to the kitchen. She returned with a pot of some sweet-smelling sauce. \"I've been experimenting with new recipes. This here is a caramel honey glaze to enhance the flavor; mixture of my own design.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It smells heavenly,\" Gretel said watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you sweet,\" Helma said. \"But it's rather difficult to apply the glaze alone. I need to add a second coat now that the goose is roasting and the best way to apply it is to lightly drizzle it over the rotating goose.\" Helma turned and looked at the two kids. \"You look like a strong young man, Hansel. Want to help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Hansel said standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy,\" Helma said. \"You remember how I did it yes? Just put your hands here and here, and apply just the slightest bit of force. And don't fight against the circular motion; roll with the momentum. First push until the arch can go no further and then pull until you need to push again. Give me three good turns, lad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ma'am,\" Hansel said. He grunted as he pushed the spit until it turned all the way around. Soon he had the goose rotating. Helma lifted the ladle out of the pot and began to lightly drizzle the glaze onto the roasting goose, creating a second coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, and we've got it,\" Helma said. \"Wonderful, dear boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure, Ma'am,\" Hansel said satisfied that he'd helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelma returned to the kitchen and began grabbing some plates and silverware to line the table in the small dining area with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Miss Helma...would you mind if I asked how exactly you came to live in uh...\" Gretel trailed off again, nervous how to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Gingerbread house?\" Helma finished for her. She had taken the spit from the fireplace and brought the goose into the kitchen. \"I built it myself. Like I said, I'm a baker by trade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes but...it must've taken you quite some time to actually bake the necessary parts,\" Hansel said. \"And the candy decorations outside. They're...enormous. How did you make them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I've been wondering how I would bring that up,\" Helma said. She transferred the goose to a silver platter and was now bringing it toward the table along with a small tray with a fresh loaf of bread. The two children immediately come to the table and sit down. \"Would you like some milk?\" Helma asked presenting a jug to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please; thank you,\" Gretel said. Helma poured them both a glass before carving up the goose. She distributed them a sizeable portion before tending to herself. The children could no longer contain their hunger and immediately dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible,\" Hansel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the first real meal we've had in so long,\" Gretel said. \"Thank you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No trouble at all,\" Helma said as she took a bite herself. She watched the children go at it. They were so small and looked starved to near-death. She felt so bad for them. She then remembered what they told her; that their parents abandoned them. That made her blood boil. But now that she'd filled them with goose and bread, she figured now was the best time to tell them. \"Well, you asked me how I made this house of sweets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Hansel said. \"You must be an excellent cook. I'd believe it based on this goose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you believe me if I told you that I was...a witch?\" Helma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Hansel and Gretel stopped eating and slowly looked at her. Helma was hoping to avoid this. But after a moment, Gretel gave a softer expression.<br>\r\n\"You can't be a witch,\" she said. \"Witches are old and...ugly...and they're mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a witch wouldn't be so nice to us,\" Hansel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll say you're right,\" Helma told them. \"Most witches are old but...very few of them are ugly. In fact, a witch will often use her powers to appear just like anyone else...But I will tell you that most witches are definitely mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can't be a witch,\" Hansel said. \"You're a nice lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelma smiled and simply stood up from her table. She looked over to the hole they'd made in her wall. She waved her hand toward it. Hansel and Gretel heard a whooshing sound and felt a breeze roll through the house toward the gap. They turned and saw that the gingerbread that made up the wall was growing over the hole, repairing itself.<br>\r\nSeeing that, the two children stopped eating again and looked back at her in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some more milk?\" she asked calmly. The two children didn't answer, but she refilled their glasses anyway. \"I'm sure you must have a lot of questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if you're a witch then...why do you live out here making sweets?\" Gretel asked, a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a Candy-Witch,\" Helma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Candy-Witch?\" Hansel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...how do I put this? It's basically the only talent that I've had since I was a young child. While most witches deal in curses or potions, I deal in sweets. I use my magic to experiment with new candy-making recipes and try to make the best tasting candy in the world. Then I go into town, trying to sell my goods to people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...there are witches who make candy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Helma said. \"It's a bit of a rare gift, but occasionally there are people who will use Candy-Magic to try and make the world a sweeter place. And if there's one thing these people love, it's making children happy.\" Helma motioned to a collection of framed photographs sitting on the mantle near-by. There were several pictures of people handing out candy to children. One of them wore a large red coat and had a long white beard. Another wore a pumpkin on their heads with a black cloak, handing out candy to other costumed children. And the final one was a strange but kind-looking man wearing a purple suit and a top-hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you decided to help us?\" Hansel asked. \"You like making children happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sort of,\" Helma said. \"Mostly because I knew you two were in need. That...and the woods can be a rather dangerous place after dark. But really because I sympathized with you children so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Gretel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you told me that your parents abandoned you,\" Helma said. \"I was taken aback by that. The idea that your parents would sacrifice you so that they wouldn't go hungry. For years I've known that if I had children of my own, I'd sooner starve than let them go hungry. Then I saw the two of you, abandoned in the big wide world all on your own. No one to take care of you. You wouldn't know where to begin. I couldn't just leave you out there to die; especially when I have plenty enough for me by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I wouldn't know what we'd do if we hadn't come across this place,\" Hansel said. \"It's like you and your home were a god-send. An angel meant to rescue us. And if you are a witch...then you are certainly a good witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelma smiled. The two children didn't notice it, but a small bit of color returned to her entangled and faded red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel however was a bit more pensive. She kept thinking about all the stories she'd been told about witches. She felt too nervous to continue eating. If witches were capable of making candy then...that could make them even more dangerous than she'd been told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Gretel said. \"I don't mean to be rude but...I can't shake the stories that I've heard about witches. Can you tell me...what do witches do? And...don't they tend to normally eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Helma answer? Will Hansel and Gretel like what she has to say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(third time writing this chapter after my computer crashed twice.)</span></div></div>",

They use their magic to get what they want, or to get back at people who wrong them.\" Helma took a notice of how nervous the two looked. \"And to answer your second question...yes it is customary that witches tend to eat children. Which explains why I'm here eating goose,\" Helma said rather sardonically before taking another bite. \"You two don't have to be so nervous around me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why is that?\" Hansel said. \"You told us what witches do to children just moments after you told us you were a witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Candy Witch,\" Helma said. \"We are...different...Back when I first discovered my talents for making Candy...well, let's just say my family wasn't too pleased about it. But because it was the only thing I was good at, I began to research what Candy Witches do...Like I told you, people with Candy Magic love making children happy. Someone like me...we literally feed off of making children happy. Causing smiles...gives us life. Helps us flourish...And that's why I left my coven and came here. I thought I could scrape together a descent living and sustain my health by selling candy to the children of your village...Then this blasted famine came. And...well...that's why I appear to be a bit...disheveled at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you only use your magic to make children happy?\" Gretel asked. \"But...other witches...I mean...why don't you eat children while the others do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matter of taste, I suppose,\" Helma said. \"I mean, have you ever tasted human children before? It's not all that pleasant. Not all that much meat on the little bones to begin with. You can fatten-them-up, as my mother would say, but I don't care for that either. When you fatten up a chicken, pig or a cow, much more of the weight is devoted to gaining muscle, giving far more cook for the meal. But fattened children? All of it is fat; it's far too unhealthy and rather disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelma finally stopped talking and looked back up at the two. She realized that she'd just described in rather graphic detail what eating children was like. Regardless of her vocalized disdain for it, it probably wasn't the best idea to put the children at ease. She began to blush rather nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think that's enough of that,\" Helma said. \"If it'll make you feel better, I promise that no harm will come to either one of you while you are under this roof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel was a bit more apprehensive but Hansel was so hungry that he immediately smiled and asked for a second helping of Goose. Helma was more than happy to provide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, Lad,\" she said. \"Tuck-in; plenty to go around.\" She looked out the window and saw that the sun had gone down. \"Well, I guess that's it on getting you back to town tonight. The woods can be rather dangerous in the dark; big bad wolves and all that sort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel had looked out the window with concern when Helma mentioned that they wouldn't be going back to town yet. She didn't know what to make of Helma or if she could trust her; and it was made worse considering that Hansel had seemed to have been completely won-over by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you'll have to spend the night,\" Helma said. \"I should have plenty of space here; a warm bed for the two of yous. And then tomorrow, I'll take you back to the village when I go to sell my wares. How's that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wunderbar,\" Hansel said excited. \"You hear that Gretel? A nice hot meal and a place to sleep. Could we have asked for anything better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I don't suppose we could have,\" Gretel said, still nervous. Though Gretel was still suspicious of Helma being a witch and all, Hansel was taking a moment to think about tomorrow and what they would do when they got into the village. They couldn't go back home. And they had serious doubts that anyone in town would help them after what their parents did. What were they to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few more minutes before the three had finished eating. Hansel sat content in his chair.<br>\r\n\"It was so delicious, Lady Helma,\" he said. \"I don't think I could eat another bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it,\" Helma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you,\" Gretel said. \"It was quite good. Best that we've had since I can't remember when.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything I can do to help a pair of children in need,\" Helma said. Soon after she said that, she heard a bell chime from the kitchen. She walked toward the large oven and opened the door. She put on a pair of oven mitts to pull out a large tray of small pies. \"Ah, these came out perfectly,\" Helma said. She looked over at the two and raised an eyebrow. \"Do you think either of you could stomach a bit of dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretel was initially going to refuse but she couldn't deny that she was intoxicated by the pleasant aroma of the fresh pies from the oven. She and Hansel almost unanimously agreed to desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a new recipe I've been working on,\" Helma said. \"Apple preserves with the cinnamon rolled right into the dough.\" She took two of the pies and lightly dropped one onto the children's plates. \"Tuck-in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel and Gretel immediately took enormous bites from them. A moment of chewing and their faces lit up.<br>\r\n\"This is the most wonderful pie I've ever tasted,\" Hansel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't had many in the past, but this is absolutely divine,\" Gretel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it?\" Helma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so good; I love it,\" Hansel said. Gretel could only nod as she took another mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them didn't notice, but as their faces lit up with bright smiles as they ate, the rings under Helma's eyes began to recede. She smiled rather hopefully seeing them so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were finished with the pies and were so comfortable being full. The two of them were very tired. Gretel's suspicions against Helma were drowned out by her content feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well c'mon then,\" Helma said standing up. \"You two have had quite a day. Best get you two into bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelma walked to the second room in the cottage. The children were surprised to find it rather sparse with effectively nothing it it other than a few spare sheep's wool and blankets. Helma quietly thought to herself as she surveyed the room. She waved her hand at the wool and they flew off of the walls. The wool expanded until it became a rather plump and sizable mattress that was supported on a make-shift wooden frame. The blankets flew onto the new bed and laid there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelma stepped out of the room for a moment and looked back toward the kitchen. She took note of the bin she'd discarded the plucked feathers from their goose dinner that night. She waved her hand at them and the feathers flew into the air and deposited themselves into two smooth sacks. Once filled, the sacks sealed, becoming two goose-down feather pillows. They plopped onto the head of the bed. The two children were astounded to see that a bed had been made before their very eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it,\" Helma said. The two of them slowly looked at her in amazement, almost worship. \"Well Candy might be my specialty, but I do have other talents. Now in you go,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHansel and Gretel rushed to the enormous bed, finding it a perfect fit for the both of them, they curled up beside each other.<br>\r\n\"We cannot thank you enough for your kindness, Ma'am,\" Hansel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we can certainly try,\" Gretel said, her suspicions beginning to wane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think that'll do for one night,\" Helma said. \"Well...g'night dearies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Hansel said. \"Do you think you can tell us a story? It might help us sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelma turned back with an odd grin. \"Alright,\" she said. \"Least to help you go out.\" Helma snapped her fingers and her rocking chair from the den appeared at the bedside. \"Once...there was a young witch. She grew up in a coven with mean and nasty witches...They wanted her to be just like them...but she wasn't. She was a kind witch, who didn't want to hurt or trick anyone. So she ran away from her coven and started out on her own. She wanted to live life making other people happy, and spreading joy where she could find it. So she learned how to make candy, and gave all she could to the children of the village. And she was loved by all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelma didn't get too far into her story before she realized that Hansel and Gretel were asleep. She quietly left the room, blowing out the candle, leaving them for the night. She stood by the fireplace in the den, snapping her fingers to make her chair reappear just beneath her. She sat down and looked at the fire. She looked rather sad, and on the verge of tears. She actually caught a gasp that choked back a sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once...there was a kind young witch...A kind...candy-making Witch...who learned that her true calling in life, what she lived for, was to make children happy. And soon the witch began to realize that, the greatest gift the world had ever known, was the love of a child,\" she said to herself. \"It was the one thing she wanted most in life...But unfortunately...she soon found out that she could never have children of her own. And she was sad. But then, two darling angels swept into her home and brought color and joy back into her life. And she cared deeply for them. But unfortunately, the witch knew that she'd have to say goodbye to her two angels...because the witch can barely take care of herself...much less two heaven-sends like them.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The guard had just started work on the castle gates. His name was John, and he had once been a peasant. He sympathised with Robin Hood, and his accomplice Snow White, but after seeing what they were about to do, as a guard, he couldn't allow it to happen. He followed them to the vault as they went inside, coming out with two sacks full of gold coins each. He was curious about what they did with the gold, though, so he stealthily followed them when they left. It puzzled him more when they went to the bakery, and several other eating establishments, buying food before leaving town. Once on a hill overlooking the town, they shot arrows with the food on them at each of the peasant houses in the town, including John's own house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" said John \"You could simply thrown the food.\" <br>\r\nRobin immediately turned pulling out his sword to point at John. Snow shot one more arrow at the last peasant house, then turned to John<br>\r\n\"We could,\" she said \"But what would be the fun in that?\" <br>\r\nShe turned, pulling out the twin swords given to her by her dad last year, and turned to face the man. He was a bear of a man, much bigger than Robin, wearing a guards uniform and carrying a long sword. <br>\r\n\"Have you come to arrest us, sir?\" asked Snow, making her eyes go wide like an innocent child would \"May we at least know your name before you do that?\" <br>\r\n\"John,\" said the guard \"John Little.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Little John,\" said Snow \"I can tell you aren't usually a guard, the coal dust under your fingernails suggest work in the mines, or maybe a blacksmith, which would also explain how you have such a fine weapon. Your own handiwork, I would guess? As a peasant, you would no doubt sympathise with us, more than the guards, if you came here hoping to take us in, your going to have a hell of a fight on your hands.\" <br>\r\n\"What are you suggesting?\" asked John \"That I join you as a thief?\" <br>\r\n\"We are not thieves,\" said Robin Hood \"Your Lord Reyton is a thief, raising taxes so he can make improvements to his castle, and not giving any of that wealth made by the people to the people, we make sure that the people of any town we come to have the provisions needed to survive.\" <br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" said Little John \"But I still have to take you in.\" <br>\r\n\"Wait,\" said Snow \"How about we strike a deal? If I beat you in a duel, you leave us alone, you beat me, you can take both me and my dad in.\" <br>\r\n\"Robin is your dad?\" asked Little John, a little shocked \"I thought your father was the king.\" <br>\r\n\"My father tried to have me killed,\" said Snow, icily \"He's no father of mine, Robin is the only family I have.\"<br>\r\n\"I agree to your terms,\" said Little John \"I may be a guard, but I am a man of honour, if you beat me, I won't chase you anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

John started moving to the right, trying to find a way past Snow's guard. Snow mimicked him, not allowing him to see an opening in her defence. John was big, bigger than anyone she'd fought before, it would mean that if he hit her, even once, she wouldn't be getting up again. But in his size, also lay his weakness. Little John lunged, Snow spun and parried, before striking at Little John's other side. She nicked his arm. <br>\r\n\"Looks like I underestimated your skill,\" said Little John \"You still won't win.\" <br>\r\nHe lunged again, this time, Snow waited till the last minute, then dodged, guiding Little John's sword with her own two, causing him to stumble.

She landed hard on her left arm. Struggling to get up, she felt strong hands help her up. She looked round, thinking it was her dad, but saw Little John helping her up. <br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\" he asked, his voice concerned. <br>\r\n\"I'll be fine,\" she said, trying to raise the arm that she had landed on, but winced in pain \"We're square, Little John, we've still got to fight one more round.\" <br>\r\nShe readied her sword in the uninjured hand, abandoning the other. <br>\r\n\"I don't want to fight anymore,\" said Little John \"I concede the combat.\" <br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Snow \"Then you'll leave us alone now?\" <br>\r\n\"No,\" said Little John. He then grabbed the insignia that had signalled him as Lord Reyton's guard. He pulled hard, and it came off \"I'd like to join you, your cause is one worth fighting for.\" </span></div></div>",

It was while she was talking with the villagers, that she heard about the trolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrolls were gigantic creatures, tall as a church and extremely strong, they carried clubs of tough wood.

I would rather die with hunger than allow myself to be conned by you. You are a merciless, vicious...CAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself then\", said Felix. \"I'm a very busy cat, I have other business somewhere else. I'll go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'll give you what you wanted but you have to first remove these rats from my sight then give me edible food to eat good for humans, okay? I will kiss you then. I asked first so give it to me now or I won't kiss you ever. Do you hear me, nevvver!\" was Cinderella's proposition before the cat could leave. \"By the way, why do you need me to fall in love with you? There are many female cats in the neighborhood you can choose from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have been in your household even before you were born and I loved you since you became an orphan. I saw everything that happened to you, how you missed your mom and dad and that you feel alone and miserable in that house. I can see how those stepmother and stepsisters of yours are cruelly treating you. One day they will get what they deserve, mark my word, they will. I am here. I will take good care of you and love you forever. If only I turn into human as you are. I wished to be human because I want to love you as a man.

Cinderella was quite hesitant to close her eyes but what other choice does she have, so she just did. \"Open your eyes now sweetheart!\", said Felix and when she did, finally there is an array of sumptuous food on a grand table before her and all the rats were gone. \"Great, this feels like I'm having dinner with a king! Thank you so much for this Felix! Thank you!\" exclaimed Cinderella, and to her delight, she rushed towards the cat and unconsciously kissed him full on the mouth! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the wind blew heavily on the horizon and roars of thunder came. And lightning cut out the clear evening skies. \"Oh no, what have I done?\" cried Cinderella but it was too late for her to run and hide.

In front of Cinderella was the chicken coop, and beyond that was horizon-spanning, brown-green wall of the forest. The sky was blue. <i>With weather like this</i>, she thought, <i>I could probably make it to town without being in too much pain</i>. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe began walking again, but she slowed her steps as she got closer to the coop. When her pace had reached a dawdle, she stopped again. <i>Do I really have the right to those eggs?</i> she thought. Cinderella's face twisted in confusion due to her own thought. She had thought it was crazy to stand up to her \"stepmother,\" but she never imagined that she would be crazy enough to be considerate of her \"stepmother\" and \"stepsisters,\" given how they had treated her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her confusion, she continued the thought: <i>They have plenty food, but I have no way of knowing what will happen when I leave. What if those eggs are the difference between starvation and survival for them? Am I capable of potentially killing them?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this pondering was underscored by Cinderella's growling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" she exclaimed out loud, startling several of the chickens. Cinderella walked past the chicken coop and into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good riddance. I don't want to depend on them anymore anyway</i>. Her stomach rumbled, indicating that it wanted to depend on \"stepmother\" anymore anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she did not forget it, Cinderella was distracted from her hunger about twenty minutes into her journey, because she had never been this far from the house before. Sure, she had gone into the woods to collect firewood, but she had always been able to see the chicken coop or hear her \"stepmother\" screaming for her to go faster in the distance. Now, she was completely surrounded by trees and heard nothing but the buzzing of insects. The canopy was thick, so everything was cast in an odd green light, and the soil was soft and loamy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, Cinderella thought she could hear voices chanting in rhythm.</span></div></div>",

The chanters had sounded so far off because their vocal cords were so small; it was a group of dwarves, walking in a straight line. Cinderella could clearly make out their chanting:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Hi-ho, hi-ho.<br>\r\nIt's off to work we go.<br>\r\nDoo-dee blah blah blah,<br>\r\nDoo-dee mumble-blah,<br>\r\nHi-ho, hi-ho.</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were seven in the group, and each of them carried a pickax over his shoulder. It seemed odd to Cinderella that the dwarves would only start going to work at noon, but it seemed even odder still that a cult of mining dwarves lived in the woods very close to her former home. Not wanting to get involved in something to that would most definitely make her situation more convoluted than it already was, Cinderella attempted to turn back and avoid detection from the singing dwarves, but they had already spotted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" said one. \"Are you a human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to sound as friendly as possible, Cinderella turned around and said, \"Yes. And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're the Seven Dwarves!\" they attempted to answer in unison but said at slightly different times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked the same: dirty black beards; copper, dirt-stained skin; muscular, hairy forearms; crudely-sewn leather hides and moccasins; and dark black eyes. They each wore a different-colored hat. Cinderella hoped they would have told her something she couldn't have guessed herself, so she tried being more specific. \"Erm... What are you names?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Grumpy,\" said the one with a brown hat grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Happy,\" said the one with a orange hat happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Sleepy,\" said the one with the teal hat sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Bashful,\" said the one with the blue hat bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Sneezy,\" said the one with the chocolate hat sneezily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Dopey,\" said the one with the purple hat dopily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Doc,\" said the one with the orange-brown hat (the one who had asked if Cinderella was a human) docily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderella was losing patience fast. \"<i>Names</i> please, not emotions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are our names,\" said Doc. \"You see, we all look very similar, so we donned these hats so folks can tell us apart. However, colors don't mean squat unless you can associate them with something, so we decided to boil are personalities down into one trait so that everyone can tell us apart, associating our distinct personalities with our colors. To make the remembering even easier, we changed our names to the traits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what personality is 'Doc' supposed to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny you should mention personality,\" continued Doc. \"You seem to have a lot of it. Tell me: have you ever been in love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderella blushed. She had never left the house before, so she had never really got to socialize. Actually, her only knowledge of males came from a book Cinderella \"borrowed\" from \"stepmother's\" room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic!\" said Doc. \"We might have a mate for you. Follow us.\" He must have noticed Cinderella's doubtful expression, as he added, \"We have food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinderella followed after the dwarves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarves must have had a very minimal grasp on human physiology, as Cinderella's black-haired, white-skinned potential mate was very cold, very female, and very much dead. Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Dopey, and Doc chanted \"Kiss the girl, kiss the girl.\" Sneezy attempted to chant as well, but he kept sneezing. Cinderella stared at the corpse in horror; she was not going to put her lips on <i>that</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the dwarves had just given her a very nice supper, and her stomach had been satisfied until Cinderella had to think of putting her lips on a cadaver.  Maybe she could fake the kiss to please the dwarves.</span></div></div>",

And she threatened you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Jill wiped sweat from her forehead. \u201cBut she was harmless.

We volunteered to work for a pittance of what they\u2019d pay a real surveyor and construction crew.\u201d Jack hefted the chorobates into position next to the well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m glad we did, Jack. My back is sore, and I\u2019ve already got blisters on my hands, but I\u2019d volunteer again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too. So let\u2019s get busy and get as much done as we can before the heat of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Jack \u2026 Just no.\u201d Jill shook her head. \u201cListen to me. This is important. My point is, we can\u2019t go around congratulating each other for doing a good deed when we deliberately hurt anybody who annoys us.\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack glared at Jill. He might have been about to argue with her, but apparently came to his senses. \u201cAll right \u2026 All right. I shouldn\u2019t have flicked her.\u201d He let out a heavy sigh. \u201cI dunno, Jill. I guess when I saw her I thought `insect.\u2019 I reacted \u2026 Well, I swatted at her without thinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill seemed mollified, at least somewhat. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna tell her friends what horrible people we are. When we\u2019re finished here, let\u2019s make it up to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow??\u201d asked Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill shrugged. \u201cSend her a fruit basket, maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack couldn\u2019t help chuckling. \u201cA fruit basket?? One banana would last her a lifetime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a deafening roar came from the far side of the hill. A helicopter appeared from nowhere and landed on a level spot near the well. As Jack and Jill watched in amazement, a man jump out and walked toward them. He was nattily dressed in an obviously expensive blue suit, a green-and-pink stripped tie, and oxblood shoes polished to a high glaze. \u201cAre you Jack and Jill??\u201d He had to yell to be heard over the beating of the rotors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill nodded dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed her a large Manila envelope. She took it by instinct, the way a person reacts when someone offers something. In a flash, he was back in the chopper and airborne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Jill looked at each other, neither quite sure of what had just happened. Jill opened the envelope and pulled out what looked like an entire ream of paper. \u201cOH SNAP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack reached for the papers. Jill handed them over wordlessly. \u201cMiss Muffet is suing us,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe joke\u2019s on her, then.\u201d Jack scanned through the documents without really reading them. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any money. You can\u2019t get blood from a stone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack, she\u2019s named the Aqueduct Edification Foundation as co-defendant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?? She can\u2019t take that money. It\u2019s to pay for materials and construction. People donated it \u2013 Pennies, a dollar here and there. Whatever they could afford.\u201d He waved the papers around, his voice rising. \u201cWe\u2019ll fight her, Jill. We\u2019ll fight her in court. We\u2019ll show her up for the greedy little imp she is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill nodded, but wasn\u2019t convinced. This\u2019ll ruin us, she thought. We\u2019ll spend the rest of our lives just paying the lawyer\u2019s fee.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
