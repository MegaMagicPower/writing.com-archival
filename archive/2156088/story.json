            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Friday 8 PM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was beautiful summers day. The sun had set itself low in the sky by this time. The clouds were still contrasting their light grey/blue against the orange of the sky behind them. The wind was so soft it may not have been there but was fervid enough that you could feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was warm. Not hot. Warm. The feeling remnent of a bed cover on a cold winter's night. As you walked home enveolped in this quilt like atmosphere, you couldn't help but feel fulfilled in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no religious bone inside your body. Thought you were into the occult and the supernatural an all powerful body seemed a tad to far, even so you didn't believe in the magic of anything you just were interested. And what was there not to be interested about the power to do Any thing! You could sign you up straight away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically you believed in the universe. Almost like a God but by another name which is still contradictory in itself. For example if you had seen it as a self balancing mechanism. A good deed leads to a good result for you and vice versa for evil deeds then you would be valid in your belief. But that was not the case you believed it to be a force that governs the universe rather than balance it. In truth you were a God fearing person, but you feared another entity that wasn't what the world considered as God. An unnamed Deity that no one had discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet that was just as irrational as any God anyway so you usually kept that theory to yourself. You still talked to it, in a prayer like ritual but you obviously couldn't call it a prayer for that would be religion which as we established you were a fervent atheist. It was nice to talk to something. Whether it was an all powerful, all balancing messiah or just to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had been barely productive but that's what you needed that day. The heat had made the day slow as if the air had slowed the hands on the clock. There had been nothing exciting to happen. No notable deaths. No babies born. No games released. Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that that affected your outlook. There's something peaceful about monotony which you found to a degree blissful. The hours after school had raced past strangely<br>\r\n You had left school at 3:00 and had wandered into the forest to smoke weed. You parents... well parent, your dad was away in Malasia or Shanghai you forgot what he had said. You had told you had a group project to do at your friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoking pot in a forest on your own wasn't your usual go to on a Friday, but you had felt down. School, relationships, friends and a multitude of other things had fucked with your head. Greg, your friend, had a family BBQ and your other friend Lexi had work so if even if you wanted company you were out of luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually when you smoked you were inherently paranoid but this time you weren't. Not that that was a problem batter chill then being scared of breathing. Maybe it was the strand or maybe it was something else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had gained yiur senses back and sprayed enough deodorant to mask the scent of 10 skunks you walked back to your home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked in to your house. Your mother was already in bed, you never understood how your mother could go to bed so early. There was still day light left, your sister was in her room but she was on her tablet her door slightly perched open. This is when you knew she wasn't bothered about being disturbed. A closed door was a no go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou popped your head in. \"Hey Sis\" you greeting startled Jane <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddup?\" She reciprocated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good yeah, mom in her room?\" You inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As per... why you got a girl with you\" Jane teased <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish\" you joked back, rolling your eyes as you did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah just me sadly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe one day big brother\" she beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was down thing in the air tonight. Either that or you'll be missing a bag of weed and you know who's got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went in the kitchen and peered in the desolate fridge. Nothing. Not that you were that hungry. You were bored. After that disappointment you wandered back to your room passing your mother's and sisters room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked slowly appreciating the wall paper which your hand was running across as you moved. You eventually got to your room which felt way longer than what it probabky was and you pushed your door open. You saw dust particles dance in the air as a result of the suns light revealing them all around your room. You fell onto your bed. No intent on sleeping then you would just as bad as your mother. You took your phone out of your trouser pocket. Nothing. No notifications. Not that you expected any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned onto your side. Seeing a peculiar object on your shelf. It was a book. But not one you had seen before. You agent read in years, even then they weren't exactly high brow, the likes if 'The Hunger Games' and 'Harry Potter's littered the rows of novels. Yet this one looked more rustic, ancient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spine was devoid of writing. So it was nameless as far as you could see from staring at it from the side. It was not a rare occasion that you would focus on something that you did not need to focus on. This time was different. There was something surreal about this book. You stirred lifting your head up and sat up, still frozen. You then contorted yourself and got up, shuffling towards your desired destination. You found yourself in front of the case, you reached out. Apprehensive. As if the book would attack or bite. Reaching you grabbed it and moved backwards until the back of your legs hit the bed, they then folded so that, again, you were perched on your quilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book was also nameless on the front. Maybe it was just an old census book that had just appeared, something deathly important but massively boring. You opened it the writing lit up. There was no subtlety to it's abnormality. They were in a different language, not one your recognised. Not that you recognised many languages. (French and Gemrna were your limit). But this was something satanic. Even if you did doubt that the writing was supernatural. Writing DOES NOT light up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the book closed itself with the force if 1 thousand winds. You tried to open it again. You were curious now. This time the chapters did not light up. Alternatively it was in Engksih. There was no author's notes, or a preface. It was just straight into the action. A word just lay at the top of page <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPossesson<br>\r\nThe writing underneath still seemed like Gibberish but this was English Gibberish. Usually you would dismiss this book as some merchandise for a wizarding book series or film but there was something inherently Legitimate about the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then thought <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Lex, shit man I got something\" you text, you knew she'd be interested. This was her dream. She was into all the supernatural stuff. It all started in 2010 when she convinced herself that there was a ghost in her house, she would talk to her. Now you saw this spell you may have  doubts, she could have been telling the truth who knows? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis carried on into her teens, when she was exploring her sexuality, it could have been found in her search history videos of ghosts and demons, some of an erotic nature, some that weren't, but from what she had alluded to in the past is that they both got the proverbial juices flowing. not that you ever looked into it this was redundant, You didn't want to make it weird, you'd turned off most feelings of any nature due to your long standing friendship that you had<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bedroom reflected the rest of her morbid curiosity in the forms of bands like, 'blood on the walls' and 'Satan's doorstep'. She probably didn't even like the music rather the aesthetic but you'd also never heard her listen to anything else. Maybe it was all a facade, a character, but she'd spent so much time on this personality there was probably no turning back.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd met around 2004 at the first year of school obviously before this satanic transformation. The ironic thing was that she was into flowers and other girly stuff when you first got to know her. Wearing nothing but dresses and had one of the brightest smiles you knew. You'd got to know each other as you grew older your parents also becoming quick friends, soon she had to move from her old neighborhood, your parents knew of a house for sale near yours so just like it was meant to be they moved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to go over quite often, she was the closest friend to you which made this marginally easier than going across town for another friend. So in this way she was the perfect person to tell it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHe phone buzzed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What dude?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue box on your home screen displayed, you, with no pause, swiped the box which brought up a small window with 'Lex', previous conversation preceded the current messsages that had just been delivered. You brought the message window up typing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nah Can't message it, I need to come over'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your phone down briefly, took a quick look at the spell and the perculiar writing. then again BUZZ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ight, my parents are just finishing up with the BBQ, my mom would usually go bat shit, ya know because its like 11:30 but shes pissed so as long as your out before 9 tomorrow its chill.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect, her parents with be passed out all night, we can do what we want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left your house, locking the door behind, you didn't bother speaking to your sister or mother both either asleep or busy. It was pitch black outside you only visual aid being the street lights, that were blaring into your eyes as they adjusted to your new light. Spying Lex's house you rushed towards in a flurry of excitement and nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the door you didn't bother knocking, you just walked straight in, you saw Lex's mom in the kitchen but she seemed like she could barely walk so you just skipped past, there was no plan if she did see you so you were just happy you were lucky. Her door was slightly open, so you slowly opened it, Lex was led on her bead, her phone raised above her chest, you saw discarded bras on the floor, usually her room as clean this made you realise that Lex's boobs were bigger than you originally thought, this didn't settle right in your groin area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo sorry about my room\" throwing her phone to one side and sitting up, he was wearing a Blood on the Walls shirt which had some food stain from the BBQ they'd just had, you could tell if nt drunk she definitely wasn't sober.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so... bro, what did you want\" her slurred speech was somewhat comforting due to the nature of what you were about to lay down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, how you like ghosts and possession and shit\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe face at this became perplexed at this in some warped curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yep... I found a spell\" your words felt thick in your throat as you regretted even bringing the spell over just in fear that it wouldn't work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh.\" she responded simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the first words felt harsh as they came flying out your mouth, much like a second shot of vodka your other words came flying out, probably due to the apprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, basically, I found this spell and it may or may not possess people, and I didn't know what to do with that information, like do I tell my family, but then what would I do, what if they wanted to try it. What if it was dangerous, or didn't work. I honestly don't know, like it sounds too good to be true, but then it could be true, like I wouldn't usually believe it but the writing looks like something I've never seen before, and I swear it lit up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus man, you been drinking?\" she questioned her eyebrow arched and a small smile formed on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had been I reckon that would have come out much, much more different\" you calmed her grin disarmed you enough to take a second to breath at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, put the scroll on this table I'll clear some space\" she directed you to a wooden desk, papers crowded the work top, she took her black nail polished fingers and wiped most of the papers onto the already messy floor. They only seemed to be bits of notes from class, doodles and the occasional failed novella. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the weathered parchment out your back pocket and stretched it across the newly available space upon the table. The words though queer had not changed, black and curved some cult-like calligraphy, beautiful in nature, meaningless otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth yours and Lexi's attention lay firmly on the spell, neither of you uttered a word, you just stared as if you expected the words to just jump out of the page and perform a little dance or something after sometime lexi spoke up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" she was obviously impatient, and you would do something if you honestly had any idea what you could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, what would you do, like if you found it?\" Passing the responsibility onto her. An exercise in empathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want my honest answer\" Your anxieties it seemed had transferred to Lexi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't take anything else\" you laughed to create a friendlier environment for the you and Lexi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd wanna be possessed, like not to be weird,... Hell this entire thing is weird, but its a massive turn on.\" This shocked you, any scenario that you had analysed in your head ended with the opposite wanting to use the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if I possessed you?\" that thickness now returned but was not in the throat but was now palpable in the air. It's not like she hadn't just proposed the exact thing you just asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight moment of nothingness. Of silence. Your eyes moved and became fixed on the floor, your pupils glimpsing the bras scattered along the carpet, which made you even more uncomfortable,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that would be cool\" her voice hit your ears but you made no instant decision to follow the sound, but the nerves that you already had became a different type, you couldn't describe either one but you felt like the latter was marginally better than the first set of feelings. Her voice itself wasn't entirely comforting but the answer was more palatable thank you originally thought the answer would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" you managed to say after a small interval of planning how the rest of the conversation should carry on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have any rules\" she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up to you\" the fog of awkwardness was yet to subside. \"Your body\" you reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah\" you couldn't be certain but you could assume that she was feeling the same painful awkwardness that you were experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle would be nice again, to be used as it was earlier to make the situation a bit more digestible, but there was no suitable interval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how long shall we say?\" you broke the silence, smiling a little in an attempt to cut the tension, but nor you or a knife could do that at this moment in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A day or two\" Lexi suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why so long?\" Every thing Lexi seemed to say, took you aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why any less\" the words exchanged lubricated the atmosphere making speaking less difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I guess but, isn't it your life\" your eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can be yours for a weekend, like think about it, you can see what it's like to be another gender, like you'll not have to deal with any of your problems...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"but I can deal with yours\" you interrupted there was an unintended sharpness to your tone, it was just a very odd thing for her to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant\" her tone was hurt, you didn't mean to upset her. Just non of this was by the books, there was no directional booklet for any of this and therefore conversational land mines were rife within your discourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean that either\" you had taken a tonal step back, in a botched attempt to wipe the record of what you had just said and how you said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I know I can't read your mind, I just think we both don't know what's going on, you clearly brought the spell to me for a reason, and that reason is obvious you just don't want to say. You've been staring at my bras since the moment you came in here. Don't get me wrong, that's not why I offered, I legit adore the idea of someone being in my place, but why should I have to convince you. Is this not the answer you wanted\" She was almost annoyed by this, by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, that I just didn't predict any of this, you being nice, me not being ready. It's a lot\" you were exacerbated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need time to think because I'm ready now.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm ready too\". you blurted out,much like Lex had said 'why should she convince you'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scroll was now sat, open on the desk, this was probably dangerous, but there were only her drunk parents in her house. But that could have been pretty funny albeit worrying if her drunk father had read the spell, or her mother. you floated over to the wooden table your fingers gracing the rough page. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Better start reading' you thought to yourself. grasping the paper between your forefinger and thumb. You eyes flitting over the strange language. It started to brighten and changing color to match the background of the sheet, as if it was almost disappearing. Your mouth started unwillingly moving, you weren't sure at what volume or whether you were speaking at all. You tried in earnest to avert your eyes, to look at Lexi, to see her reaction. Yet this spell had encapsulated all your attention. A smile formed on your previously neutral expression, again the words somehow forced this facial changed, your eyes stayed attached to the spot. you yearned to move your neck even if it was just a minute, insignificant movement, but alas this freedom was not afforded to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached the end of the line another line began dissolving into the hemp sheet, this carried on for another 5 lines. Until the parchment slammed down onto the space, dispersing any remaining piles that happened to be on the elevated top. There was a moment of complete silence, unnatural silence, as in there was nothing to be heard. As if the dust itself had been abruptly shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen out of nowhere a whirlwind of dark colours, that formed, only to your eyes, formed a goat-headed demon, long nails on her hair invested hands. A furry torso with scratches and marks, that looked like they could have been made by human means but you had you theories that they weren't. Towards the bottom of this creature were to deer legs, but contorted in a way that the entity was able to stand upright, like a man but it obviously was not. Where feet should have been, to mirror the creatures distorted hands, there were hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeld in the horned human hybrid's right claw was a book, that looked familiar, it looked just like the book that you had, but was another in some sort of collection or series of novels with different spells, but if it wasn't another spell it could have been an extension to this one, a prelude or an epilogue to this mumbled mess of an inscription.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn it's left it had a stick, it looked like it was made out of wood and taken directly out of the bark of a tree but there was a quality to it, as if it was made this way, your suspicions were answered when indents appeared on the wand-like piece of equipment, they were similar to the symbols that were in your book but they were slightly altered, reminiscent of an accent in a foreign alphabet, but if there was more to this language than you knew maybe there was more to the spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being stood there, you couldn't hear any breath or see his chest moving but you could feel a collective heaving as you did, as if there was some connection between you and this beast. You felt scared but comforted at the same time, this oxymoronic    combination of feelings. You looked around now seeing Lexi, frozen her face in a confused expression. sat on her bed. In the same clothes as she had worn, you began to speak but nothing came out. Turning in haste back to the entity you spoke but not any human way, in this horrible tuneless droll, a language you could not recognize but you were fluent, you knew what you were thinking but not what you were saying, maybe you were saying what was on you mind, but you doubted it on account what you were imagining was you wondering how you were speaking over and over again. Your face also did not match the confusion that was in the forefront of your psyche was not present on the forefront of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seemed by your own denomination to be having a conversation with the goat/ chimera but it remained cold and silent through it all. You hoped that you were asking about the book, your book and his. But you had no way of properly knowing so you needn't think too much of it. It didn't take long for you to stop talking regardless of whether you ended mid sentence or at a reasonable full stop. Your mouth came to close and the monster seemed to take that as an excuse to leave and just as abruptly as it came it disappeared. The tornado of blood and tar whisking it away within an instant. It then flowed into you. Your spine arching in an inhuman bend. Your lips snapping open and your pupils and iris being flung into the back of your skull. The lights did not stop flashing, but occasionally the face of the one you saw appeared in the same emotionless goat that you had seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were thrown back upright, your back no longer ajar. your eyes now back in their original position. Your lips slamming shut. Oxygen filled your lungs almost like it had never had air in them before. You were back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi looked at you her face unchanged from how it was when you looked at her during the fire typhoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you see?\" your eyes met hers, wary, if she had seen the display that had just taken place what must she think of your tongue twisters of satanic linguistics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" her voice suggested she was innocent, that she had not witnessed anything, but surely, she must have. The experiences you had just undergone were too intense for nothing to have transcended to the point that your friend could not have seen anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I read the spell, did you SEE anything.\" your voice was erratic and louder than you intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw your eyes roll back, that is all\" she was surprised by, what looked like to her to be an instantaneous burst of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" You respired, the world falling back into place as it was before. The demon you saw, was it true that she saw nothing, no swirl, no lights. Not even your spasm which caused your back to move and mouth to snap open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why was I supposed to see something, I mean, what did you see?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" your answer quick and spat out like a vat of venom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" she reacted in a perfectly rational way, but she knew not to press on with the cross-examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you going to do it then?\" Her attitude was now back to her usual discourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout answering, you looked at your hands, they were just as you had seen them always but different some how as if there were some invisible marks on them. It was explicit to you, there were not black marks on your skin, nor was there marks beneath creating bumps upon your flesh, you just had an inkling that there may be an image or some writing that was hidden from your mortal sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi's eyes were on you, but she did not look like she wanted an answer to her question, she looked as if she was waiting for you to do it. At this point, you had very little query that the spell worked you just didn't understand why it did. Previous to what you had just seen you wouldn't question how the spell worked, much like bees and flying regardless of logic you would have just taken the win, but this was different, this added a layer of horror that you had never pictured not in your wildest nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new sensation brewed inside you, as you blinked you caught a quick glimpse of the demon. The emotion that accompanied it though was not the same as the one you had earlier this was a safe feeling. If you were able to be worried at this you probably should have been but inside you a cog turned, a switch clicked. And this was different, maybe this was the kick you needed but a kick towards what, was this the chain reaction that leads to your eternal doom, or is this the water slide that lubricates your life into a level that no normal person could ever achieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour focus landed on Lexi. It felt like time was passing but you knew it wasn't, it was almost like every time you had a thought about the Goat Demon time stopped, to give you time to contemplate your choice. You knew your time was running out, that soon time would properly resume and you'd be forced to make a choice. To cement your decision by possessing your first victim, but you had come to far to quit now, you also had no idea the consequences if you did refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's now or never\" a voice said, it did not belong to you but only you heard it. Suddenly a noise sounding like footsteps came up the stairs, you could not tell who it was, what you did know is that they were coming towards Lexi's room. If they found you, they would go insane. At that time which was versioning on midnight, they would assume the worse and would ban you from seeing Lexi with the exception of visitation hours throughout the week. If that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour destination was clear, you heard whispers around you could not discern between Lexi's frantic pleas and the darkness within you starting to take hold. It was now or never. Actually it wasn't never. It couldn't be never. It had to be now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at your palms once more you felt the power. Your power. Rise within you. Your pupils dilated and intent, a smile grew on your face. Lexi whose face was still racked with fear, concern and worry was miming at you to do something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as you ask\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou dove into her locking her backwards into a lying position, flooding her frame was a burst of energy, in the form of your soul hijacking her body. Her eyes rolled back creating just two white balls. Her mouth wide just as yours had and her back arched but on the bed. Then. Snap. Blackness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the door opening, as if it had happened twice. You heard a women's voice \"Alexandria, I thought I heard voices are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking your mouth opened and with no hesitation you said \"I'm fine mom, I was sleeping\". Your new voice was high. It was new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your new mother left the room, you aid to yourself your eyes still closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is going to be fun.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell fast asleep,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Throughout the night you saw vivid depiction of the being, in all its messed up glory. A frozen forest appeared to you, the trees so tall that you could barely see the top. Their branches reaching to the heavens. The sky was grey, but this was so light it looked white. The ground was a  reflection, snow covered the floor, it was thick but also felt weightless. Though your senses would have you believe it be cold, you felt no temperature. On that note, you didn't feel anything. You were blind to your body as if it didn't exist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving, you adventured around this forest, all the surroundings looked the same, the bark looking no different between each towered structure. You theorized there was no destination that this was just a purgatory, maybe you were trapped. In this repeating environment, you cannot remember sleeping. You cannot remember anything past finding the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw brief appearances of the demon, but only in your peripheral vision in the corner of your eye. You felt like carbon in the air, there was nothing to you. The forest just kept expanding as you passed through it, the trees didn't change the soil didn't discolour, the sky remained a pure white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen abruptly you fell, down a hole, a straight shaft, leading down into hell it seemed. The same red and black color scheme met your vision as the gravity pulled you southbound. Then a sudden stop, but no pain met your bottom half, that is if you had a bottom half. The scenery had not changed fully, but rather a winter forest, it looked more like a forest fire, yet the birch was not burning, rather standing defiant as the flames ravaged unnecessarily. The ground now was ink black, scorched, the soot just as dense at the snow once was. The atmosphere above was a spatter of hell-fire and brimstone. This sky had character, flares and ribbons shot from one end of the cosmos to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet the horned man was no where to be seen. Not even in the very corners of your sight. As if he was a traveler that had his place in the upper world, and its purpose was to drag people to the beneath plain. The place differed even more, as you walked, things changed, the trees that had once been invulnerable to the inferno were now crumbling and turning to ash in front of you. The foliage under you began to separate, reveling red indents. You rushed faster, speeding across the landscape, the once great oaks beginning to disappear behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you were in a barren world, nothing but the dark, dark flooring. Then you saw a figure, not the same as the Satanic puppet that had been following up to this point. A boy, about 5\"10, rugged, black on his face, soot in his pajamas. Bare foot. His brown hair was messy, curls sticking out of place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knife formed, left on the ground you knelt down and picked it up. You now had hands, a claw, distorted in nature. Perusing the rest of your new form, your torso had become hairy and soft to the touch. In your other claw you held a book, the exact same as the one you had in your possession. Two deer legs sprouted on your bottom half, standing upright on your hooves. The boy walked closer, meeting you in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gap lessened between you, you saw more distinct features, a small scar on his cheek. A shapely birthmark on his arm. A scratch on his ankle. Memories flooded into your mind. The scar, the scratch, the mark. All unique attributes that only pointed to one person, you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scar was from a fall when you were 10, the birth mark you had always had and the scratch you received from your cat, the day before you found the spell. You were staring at you, the day you found the spell. The knife became hot in your hand, it yearned for blood. Your blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made a choice before, this was your last chance to take it back. Your old souls sacrifice for this power. You had become the creature, that you feared, that you didn't understand. The claws, the torso, the deer limbs. You knew you had 2 choices, kill your mortal body, or be stuck in this place forever. Becoming this creature until the next unlucky soul picked up the book, but maybe they made the choice you were about to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blade you know clutched in your fists, heated up, now to a near unbearable degree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow or never. Now or never. Now. Or. Never,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're demonic arm lifted, the blade tilting to a horizontal position you thrust it towards the throat of your soon to be victim, his eyes were devoid of any emotion, yet a single tear drifted down the black soot in his face. The knife was sharp, sharp enough to slice through iron without trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt touched the flesh upon his neck, a drop of blood escaping under the weapon's pressure. In the corner of your eye you spied a full moon its shine was bright but white much like the winter plain you existed on briefly before. You heard a loud 'Dong' and the knife slipped across your old throat, a waterfall of blood befell his neck. and spluttering and coughing followed. The body fell to its knees and collapsed like a rag doll on the floor. The red liquid did not fall realistically is flowed into a symbol,a shape, a pentagon. Flames danced upon the Star.The floor fell again. Then sunshine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes opened but st a struggle, blinking heavily to get your sight ready for this world especially after your ordeal in the hell-scape . You looked down seeing that, as would be expected, you were in the same clothes as Lexi was in when you fell asleep. You only remember small aspects of the previous night, knowing that your entry was forced, and that she was into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had two mounds, that met your gaze, this perspective was new. Only ever seeing breasts from the outside. You raised your fatigued arms so that they fell into your vision, long shapely fingers graced with black nail polish, slightly weathered, but looked like they had only been painted in the last week or couple of days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands glided down your body and split when they got to your plump tits, circling and kneading them. You could feel her bra beneath her t-shirt. After a moment of curiosity, you felt the need to proceed, placing both palms on your flat stomach, poking your finger inside your new belly button, which was formally an 'outie'. Your hands massaged your flat groin, noticing the lack of feeling in your pants and little need to re-position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved off your bed, taking yourself to sit, the weight on your chest creating a fresh orientation that you knew you would have to get used to. You looked in front of you, to the person-length mirror in your room. A womanly face greeted you, Make-up though smudged still was pretty on your face, even though you looked worn from a full nights sleep. Your attention was then taken to your body the perspective you had now was more of what you were used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, a bright smile, one that brought back memories of a time before her transformation. The grin forced your mouth slightly open revealing a set of white teeth. Her lips were full, no lipstick defining them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open your mother walking in with purpose, you remembered how drunk she'd been last night and were impressed at how she cleaned herself up the morning after. She wore a yellow sundress and was bare footed her nails were bright red and full unlike her daughter's. She smiled a similar bright crimson smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning dear.\" She stopped noticing your attire \"Did you not change last night?\" she asked almost offended by the fact you hadn't gotten out of your day-old T-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Sorry. I got super tired and just passed out.\" You told that half truth, confidently enough for your new mother to believe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Well get ready we're leaving soon.\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaving where?\" Maybe Lexi did know where they were going, but being a rebellious teenager you would prbably be a piece of work for the sake of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To go shopping, you need clothes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this one of Lexi's problems she wanted to get away from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded halfheartedly, you didn't want to go but you really had no choice, you also had nothing else to do that day, so maybe this was a good thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother exited with haste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought now was a good time to start getting ready. Back in front of your mirror you pulled down your pants, revealing a pair of blue and white striped panties. You thought these were out of character for her, but then you realized that it was probably laundry day or near to it. You rotated taking a good look at your ass and giving it a firm smack for good measure. You then lifted your punk-rock T-shirt revealing a matching bra, Encasing two large orbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh my god, I am so hot.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands went to them performing again the same action as you did over your T-shirt earlier. This felt amazing to you. You were not well-versed in putting on or taking off girls underwear so you just pulled it over your head in the same way you would a Shirt. The tits that were once trapped now fell loose drooping facing opposite ways. For the final time your palms massaged the bare breasts, your nipples hardening and pleasure flowing through your new vessel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Amazing'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started towards your bathroom, dropping your underwear as soon as you reached the door. You slid it open and felt the warm water in your body. Curiosity took you and you used to the shower head on your new vagina creating a intense feeling. When you were done you stepped out finding your way to your wardrobe. Picking a fresh white bra out of one of the compartments, you attached the latch to the other half creating the same shirt like method that you had just taken off. You did the same lifting it over your head and adjusted it around your breasts. You then picked some white panties and pulled them up. you found a white dress, it didn't look fancy it just looked... nice. Initially with difficulty you attempted to put it on but soon, it slipped up quite perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at yourself in the Mirror once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Beautiful'.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Winking at yourself in the mirror you walked to exit your room, finding your mum sitting at the breakfast bar. She was reading a tabloid, its cover stating '10 ways to look younger!' with an accompanying picture of a cream with a blank label, you never understood the hype with all these mystery creams but you guessed neither did most kids your age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother's face looked like it was in a deep concentration, as if taking a mental note of each of the 10 steps memorizing them like bible verses at a Sunday school. She was in the same apparel as she was earlier with the exception of some shoes that she must have put on before waiting in the kitchen. You suspect that she hadn't been waiting there long as she wasn't too far in the magazine. This reassured you as you didn't want to allude to something being different or wrong, Not that Lexi's mother would have any rational explanation for a change in behavior, but you at least needed to act remotely like a girl, like Lexi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're early\" her mother greeted you, she looked surprised, had you given up the game before it had even started? \"I'm guessing you want to get this trip over and done with as soon as possible\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, you loved it when adults answered their own questions, it was probably true, that Lex would want to get back as soon as possible but she still wouldn't have gotten ready as quick as you did. You scanned your mother's facial expression. Thinking of how to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" you pushed out a fake laugh, every time you heard Lexi's voice in space of your own it made you feel strange, if not strange slightly turned on. But you had to hide any sexual feelings you had, getting turned on by your own body, wasn't particularly normal, so you thought to put your mind onto an alternate thought before the lustful feelings got to intense. You did have this body 24/7 so you could miss out blushing in the middle of Wal-Mart. But on this occasion you allowed a small lip bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the white?\" Your mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sent a shiver down your borrowed spine, a vision of the forest flashed before you, the snow and the white trees, you snapped yourself out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought I'd try something new\" you smirked comforting your mother. She smirked back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice, lets go\" she beckoned,  getting up from the breakfast bar, she walked in front of you. Waving her ass as she went. You took a glance as she went being sure not be caught, but regardless of any sexual feeling, she did have an impressive behind, not too much bigger than yours, you thought as you gave yours a quick rub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked you felt the sway in your hips, it came naturally to you, more so then when you were a man. You were enjoying it, being able to strut your stuff, to have the confidence to do so. Your mother Susan opened the front door, getting her keys out and fitted them into the lock turning it swiftly and pressing the door, following behind you overtook her as you exited the home, you turned to see her locking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car was straight in front of you, you placed your slender hands onto the handle and pulled it up. Locked. Again your head snapped towards your mother who at that moment was rapidly clicking the automatic unlock button, half a minute later came 2 consecutive flashes. The car door opened, and you pulled it with a force, you didn't realize how weak your new arms were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother swiftly followed, moving around the car and pulling he door open at the other side, she, much like you, took her seat in the vehicle placing her hands on the steering wheel as you id your lap. She pushed the key into the slot and turned it. The car spluttered and coughed as it turned on, the inside itself vibrated quite intensely. The car needed to be scrapped as far as you were concerned, but Lexi's family had fallen on hard time. Far from the economic stability they were when they panic-bought the House near yours. Her father had lost his Job and for a while their family had frequented your house for meals, due to harsh conditions. Their father  had then gotten a Job at a competing firm less handsome rate than at his other job., but it was better than calling in favors, from what you'd heard the patriarch of the family was hoping to ascend the ranks and be promoted to the position he held before yet it seemed this was  a slow process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car after an interval, started. It exited the drive away, reversing so the car ended t a side-profile to the home. Proceeding to the traffic lights, the red shone and therefore the car came to a rebellious stop. Your eyes that were fixed on the road were now on your lap, looking at your bare legs under the dress you'd picked out that morning, Your lips shut. There was nothing to say, you barely knew anything about their relationship she was silent about it the majority of the time. Maybe this was just Lexi but at this point her glued-mouth helped you none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quietness was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what with this transformation\" your mother questioned, mother's had a strange habit of jumping into interrogation without small talk. It was an approach you admired, but one that if unprepared opened a can of worms with no net to collect them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdeas then formed in your head, they swished around, should you remain silent, not say anything confirm this moody teen facade that you knew she played upon most days. In the vain of this habit you knew that she wouldn't stop, be it obvious conversational landmines or passive comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option was to give short sharp one word answers, yes' and no's just to appease her informational appetite long enough for her to forget the original question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour last choice was to think of a bullshit story, to weave a tale so long again she doesn't remember her opening query. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumber 3. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, basically I read this story in punk-rocker weekly that its like a statement, to oppose the values that the genre is based on. It's like a post-modern movement started by Angela Garceu in the 1950s around the time of the first rock movement, but it died as you can imagine because of the grass-root values, but it's making a comeback. Ya know white, bright colours but not in the way that you may think. I know what's going through your head. 'isn't that just normal' but you'd be wrong it's just pure irony, also I think we should head to Pennsylvania they have a gallery on this exactly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" your mother breathed, your plan had worked perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car remained on the road passing the same structures you saw on the daily, until you reached the large concrete cuboid that was the mall, lights shining form the electric sign posts in the front of the shops. 'Lush, Donnie's Donuts, McDonald's' were just a few of the corporate money vacuums on display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed like a dog, dodging the mob of frantic shoppers, not particularly knowing where you wanted to go, you hated clothes shopping, it was bearable when you were with your friends there was at least people to talk about. You never went shopping with Lexi because of your mutual hate for the pass time. She always did her shopping online and her mother would try with no success to buy you dresses, like the one you were wearing. Susan had brought a couple of items home which from what Lex had told you she'd disregarded the second she had laid her eyes on them. This was part of the freedom, she'd given you the reigns willfully she had given you basically no rules, so if you wanted to show off your new figure there was no statute stopping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom lead first dragging you into one of the first clothes shop. She wandered over to some shoes, you strayed over to the T-shire section, honestly you had no intention to buy anything but browsing did better to suit you than standing aimlessly staring at nothing.  There were little printed shirts most were colored plain Ts, the occasional crop top and Man shirt. Sue was in her element grabbing a basket-ful of most every type of item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis repeated with a multitude of other shops, the most you did was pick up an item that looked remotely alright then waft it softly then replace it back to its hung place.It seemed that your mother was losing what patience she had with you, but what could you do, you knew nothing that would be worth buying, it was only a short holiday in this vessel you didn't want to instate an overhaul of the exterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came towards you, not appearing angry but had an .\" atmosphere of waning effort, as soon as she reached you she immediately said \"I have a choice, you buy one thing, I won't see this as a complete failure. This ultimatum pricking your interest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"any one thing?\" your voice had a certain sleazy tone to it, you knew exactly how to make this deal fall on your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any one thing\" your mother repeated desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"follow me.\" You ordered ushering you mother towards a lingerie shop. Scantily clad women decorated the front windows. You could see yourself in the underwear that these women were wearing. If you were going to make this trip bearable a little eye candy for you wouldn't go a miss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could recognize your matriarch was getting slightly nervous, but you had a sixth sense, an almost X-ray ability that you hadn't had before, to see the inside of someones soul, a different dimension to their soul, so though her mother looked uncomfortable you knew she wanted some herself. You spied an offer, 2 for 1, it was clear you were meant to be here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom, these are on offer, I won't need two sets you want some\" you asked knowing what you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't possibly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Mom.\" You stopped her. \"Get some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently you picked out a red set, your mother, black and you went to the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for a show.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Car journey home was very similar to the one to the mall but in reverse, your mother remained silent and but unlike your mother earlier you'd rather not press her on her choices, but you did enjoy seeing her squirm at the thought of what she had just bought. She wanted it and you knew that, it's not like you hadn't gained from the experience, you clutched the plastic bag that held the goods.You squeezed the fabric through the bag still feeling soft if not queer due to the combination of plastic and fabric. You couldn't wait to try it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis trip, though boring had not been a waste not by a long shot, you had found a new ability as well as gotten you and your mother some sexy clothing, you knew that Lex would never buy this type, but after seeing her body yesterday, you thought that it wouldn't be a waste of money in partaking in such a purchase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Car pulled up, it was 3PM, the little clothing adventure didn't take that long, which was either a blessing or a curse dependent on how long you can find entertainment within yourself. You could always hop out, you didn't owe her anything nor did she you, you had a right to jump out anytime you just thought you'd try it out for a while but your infatuation was dwindling, you had just purchased a new accessory for your barbie doll would be a shame if you missed that opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour room was calling you, and with the same idea, your mother went to hers. Neither of you saying anything as you escaped to your sanctuaries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got into your room you closed your door, and hung a sock on it,because of what your mother knew, she could explain to your father that you weren't having sex rather just enjoying yourself a bit. Walking over to your bed, you caught yourself in the mirror. You smiled realizing how pretty you were. Whilst checking yourself out you pulled down the dress from your shoulder and slipped it down until you reached your chest, with some difficulty to you yanked the dress from over your bra. Recognizing the bra you'd chosen that morning, you looked for a minute before carrying on until your white dress was in a pile at your feet. Taking your shoes off you tossed them to the side and whilst bent over you did the same to your dress. You were now still, only in your underwear. Your hands groping your tits, massaging them sensually, a feeling you were glad your were revisiting. Soon the sensation was too much and you struggled but you managed to get the bra off, again seeing your bare tits hanging beautifully, lifting them and dropping them you had a this power fantasy feeling. That you could do whatever you want to with anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping your panties your attention flew towards your gift bag. You went over discarding the bag, revealing the ruby red, clothing of desire.You felt in, rubbing it between the fingers, getting excited at the very thought of you in it. You opened it out, placing the cups on reverse and on your back, you then connected the latch completing the lingerie circuit., you preceded to rotate the underwear 180 degrees and putting the cups upon your bare breasts, the loops were then lifted and you pushed one arm through you then used that arm to help your another limb through the second loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as this was complete you appreciated yourself in your mirror smiling and feeling around your tits in your new bra. The panties were marginally easier just slipping them up our legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then jumped out of her body,finding yourself stood adjacent to your half naked friend. She stood still for a moment, then suddenly composed herself \"when are you going to possess me\" the volume was in a small whisper, as if she had just resumed from where she'd been stopped a day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then felt what she knew was a chill, you assumed that because her thoughts resumed from the moment you possessed her that the feelings and sensations had been unpaused in the same way. She rushed to place her hands over her exposed breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck happened?\" she breathed hot anger and embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did your shopping\" you answered you knew this was a cheeky answer but you tried it on anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS, THIS WAS YOUR 'SHOPPING\" her air quotes did enough to explain her disdain at your actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You offered\" again you took a innocent tone, you did nothing out of bounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a series of disapproving grumbles, a vain attempt to argue without a platform to really do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you enjoy it?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" you perspired, trying to hide some of your happiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you wanna jump back in?\" she bartered, removing her hands letting her bra-clad tits hang gracefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah\" you dismissed, I've had my fun, you then walked over and placed your hands on her assets and squeezed them softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what gives you the right...\" she started, so shaken by your full frontal assault. Ignoring her obvious anger you leaned towards her ear, palms still on her. \"Because I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the nipples beneath your hands go rock hard, she enjoyed being controlled, she enjoyed being used as a puppet, it was why she was so eager and was still so eager for you to jump into the driver's seat. Though your actions were wrong, and a tiny part of you, the little morally right aspect of you whispered that what you were doing was manipulative and emotional abuse, but currently you had your fingers caressing to plump orbs and no one was stopping you, so why let measly right and wrong perturb you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow your morals had been, thrown to the back of your mind now, the demon was now on your shoulder, the confidence, the ecstasy was too much for you. It outweighed, every first thought, every initial reaction. You wanted more, not in size or shape of your vessels just more, more daring, different, new. It would still be nice to have Lex around, she could be your cohort, your right hand women, but she was obsessive, if you made her remember anything that you did in her body, she would get addicts to it, the feeling of having no power, no consequence she needs you, having a disguise wouldn't be too bad, using her when required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway I need to go\" your uncaring behavior whilst out of character, just made her wane more for you, but you didn't have time to be wasting it on her, you had bigger fish to fry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come stay, for me.\" she sauntered towards you, soon looking into your eyes, she then took her hand and placed it down your pants, then into your boxers. Your cock became hard as she stroked it softly with her hand moving it up and down getting more intense each lap. She grabbed you hand and pushed it upon her tit. You could feel your arousal building, this was not at her but the power fantasy that played like a porno in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen you said seemingly out of nowhere. \"you make me cum in these pants, I'll fucking leave\" Unlike your soft jokey demeanor earlier this was harsh like a winter wind. In truth you didn't care, you could just change your trousers, but you had her on a string and you were testing her loyalty. She froze not expecting such a reaction from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't take her hand off your appendage but pulled it out of your pants and carried on more vigorously than before, after 10 minutes of silence, you felt that you were about blow, you snatched your own dick from her and finished on her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I need to go\" you stroked her face and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not that it had taken much doing, What could you do, your empathy was slowly draining from you like a leaky pipe of morality, broken by a creature that you could never imagine, it's hand guiding you, a blind fold on your face in a frozen desert. The only sense of direction coming from what seemed to be Satan incarnate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was in full capacity, it was very difficult to balance, the Natural and Supernatural elements of your life, the was now bound together like some creepy collage of Ghosts and humans, placed on the inner walls of your mind, playing repeatedly over and over. Much like a tape that had been recorded over, a video that was previously a comedy, switching at it's interval to a slasher movie. That was the organisation of your thoughts, moments of <br>\r\nclarity brought to a blunt stop whent he truth of reality came flooding into your mind, turning any positive-lined ideas into dark fantasies that you knew you could never ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you wanted to do was be a friend, to Lexi. That's what you used to be, friends. This was not going to happen, these were just dreams nothing could be as it was, this should be torture knowing what you were doing to your best friend, the demon inside you resented the good side of you and wanted it destroyed, it was pointless to fight, he didn't turn your morals upside down it took hold of your pre-existing darkness and spread it across devouring your inner light until you are a vessel of passion, desire, Of evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you decided against it, if you decided against the Maleficent being that resided inside you, what would become of your powers, would they disappear or would you become the same goat-like creature that you now feared, was there a reason to be good, was there meaning to it, looking at the risk and benefit of it all was it worth changing your mind now, you were pretty certain when murdering your self just for a deal.  This was the path that you had concreted, the one you now travel down, if you attempt to bring up the road you paved all that would remain would be gravel and dirt intertwined, a road that could neither be walked upon or worked on again. Even then was the start any better from where you were now. Going from a borderline worshiped God to a virgin who had only seen romance in movies and sex in porn. It was obvious that as your life progressed the same others, there was chance that all this could happen, yet if given a pile of cash immorally, without consequences, it seems like an easy choice to choose as opposed to actually having to work for the same cash.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou still had the predicament of what to do with Lexi, she was pining for you, the same way that a Crackhead would yearn for their, but what were your boundaries, she seemed pretty malleable in terms of what you did in her body, but she was hurt when you bought underwear as her. After that she then went into a withdrawal and all the bad stuff you did dissipated. Did that mean free-reign to do as you wish, as if any wrong-doing may be wiped by her constant need for you to be in her life. Was this the Devil within manipulating her, either whilst you inhabited her body or outside, almost like a sight-less odor entering her without either of you knowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have time to entertain such an idea. All you could understand at this moment was what was in front was was a scantily-clad girl and the edge of obsession with you, an obsession you needed to deal with. Not understand. If you left what would happen, would she hurt herself, or worse? An answer you needed to know, as you couldn't exactly spend all of your days with her, or alternatively live her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe essence of this power was that you could live everyone's lives, why should you be shackled to this one. How useful was she really? She was as socially isolated as you, if not more, she had assets you could use, but to what extent could this be used. For example money extortion would be easier by possessing a rich aristocrats girl-toy. Using Lex may just end up pimping out her body, which at the best is time-wasting and at the worst pimping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe was an aspect of pure convenience  for you, that for a bit of fun, you could hop in and enjoy without any loose ends, the longer you waited, the more that Lex would drift away and move on, which she should, but it also meant that this promise was temporary and when you've got the choice of 7 billion why hold on to such a short bargain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to talk to your other friend, Matthew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew was smart, above you in all your classes, he was an information sponge, knew the capital of Angola to the being able to code a small flash game in under an hour. He didn't have time for any relationships, or was unlucky when looking for one. It was one of two reasons he didn't have time for all the learning, or he learns to fill the time. The latter was marginally more depressing, so you hoped it was option one. If anyone had the advice you needed it was him. Unlike your other friend Benjamin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin was on a different level, his energy was boundless, he wasn't an bad person, but morals didn't dictate many of his decisions. He had a masturbation issue, not debilitating but you heard of his escapades more than you wanted... and more. He was the worst to tell about it. He had a talent for jokes, his funny bone being the second bone in his body he used once to often. That was the main reason you kept him around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brought out your phone, the first time in the past minutes that you averted your eyes away from hers. Sliding your finger across your phone went to text Matthew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, no.\" Stopping you met her eyes again, she looked perplexed, awaiting your next order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me your phone.\" you demanded, pointing towards her bed, your line of sight never breaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why?\" Lex asked not moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared, hand and arm still extended towards the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi scrambled towards where you had indicated picked up her phone and handed it to you saying '3840'. Her code. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou typed it in, revealing a picture of you two as her home screen, you tapped the screen in the order of home button, and the messaging app. Bringing up Matthew Taylor's number which was saved under the pseudonym 'Brain-box' and began to compose a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, I need to talk to you. It's important.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I have no money, or proof, that I have powers, so let's kill dos birds with uno stone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna possess a rich kid that's so... Wait.\" She stopped mid sentence, catching onto what you were suggesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used my phone. You're gonna use me?\" She pieced together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sherlock Holmes\" You winked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No. No, no, no\" She refused, looking visibly more uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You were offering earlier\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Offering for you to haev your own little session, in my body. That's fine, that's A-okay with me. This, though, pimping me out to have sex with your virgin friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Hold your horses mystic Meg, I ain't pimping out anyone, I need some advice, and who else would I go to him with? A random girl, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Maybe Benny?\" She offered as a suggestion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what? Try and convince him its not one of his weord jokes, I can't exactly jump out of him mid cafe can I now? I am so bored of this\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thrust yourself forward, and into the blackness, opening your eyes, to see the opposite to what you had just seen. You looked down, your bra-clad breasts peering back at you. You went to your closet and found a small t-shirt slightly too small for you, it was an initial struggle to pull it over especially over you chest. Once that was doen you slid your hand across the rack and took some jeans from the hanger and you pulled them up your legs. You sauntered over to your mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strolled to your mothers room, who just look you was trying on her new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you are looking hot\" You complimented, her mother turning giving you a full view of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w..why, thanks\" she looked embarrassed, but there was something behind her eyes, some inner confidence that was waiting to burst out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have a twenty, I'm going out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, there's some in this bra, your father and I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did a stripper roleplay\" You finished, using Lexi's signature dry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom went to grab the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt. I'll get it\" You meandered over taken your hand and plunged it into her bra and grabbed it, winking as you left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had the time\" you muttered to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"now then...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Which mean that there was uni students and accommodation around you, what an opportunity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked towards the university direction, passing building after building, seeing the indents in the bricks and hearing the hard knock as you skipped along the concrete. Your mind was clear, for now. Lexi and the entire experience was in the forefront of your mind, and the demonic visions you would occasionally get, couldn't be ignored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the strangest sense it felt weird to be yourself again, there was a small fear that sat in the back of the mind if there was something like a 'bleeding effect' that affects you, picking up traits from host, and almost being changed dependent on how long you possess someone. Maybe the empathy that you felt was that effect in action, but who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power complex was immense, you could walk around the street with an erection clearly on display and if even one person even looked at you funny you could hop in control of theirs before any air could escape there lungs, that feeling was fantastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding the boner idea was a tad absurd you looked towards the destination you had in mind, the university. There were a couple of named buildings pertaining to different subject areas, Donald Foreman was Humanities and the Arts, Joseph Butane for the Sciences and so on with different famous faces who spearheaded the subjects they now represent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond these were accodation buildings with a similar naming convention with the famous names substituted instead for place names of the streets they are situated on, more simple than the former.

Once you approached her eyes lit up, in a faux customer service way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding her the items, she briefly looked you up and down, her look suggesting that maybe you shouldn't be buying such provocative gear. You shot her a disingenuous sarcastic smile, the girl averted her eyes before the salty display could be conveyed to her. In a small way you wanted to spite the poor cashier by jumper her and giving you the items for free or even picked out a set for her and use her as an example of who should wear what clothing, but it would mean that Lex's mom would be left with a disillusioned daughter whilst you skipped off in another vessel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be $10 please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough reluctant Lex's mother ponied up the money, and watched rosy-cheeked as the cashier placed the lingerie into a plastic bag. Susan then quickly thanked the girl and headed out the store obscuring the bags label with her hand as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of walking you both passed another clothing store, 'Golden Years'. You had passed it a lot but had never needed to venture in due to the demographic being over 50s, the unique selling point of this store was that the toilets were always accessible and were the best in town, for seemingly explicit reasons. On the occasion your own mother had stepped in their to powder her nose. And on this occasion Susan needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perfect' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought to yourself, this would give you the perfect opportunity to exit. You followed Susan in, pretending to browse because of the social expectation to not just use a store for their bathrooms, even then you didn't look sincere feeling what could only be described as granny bras, the fabric did feel more comfortable than what you would expect, and it was the antithesis of what you had just bought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan had almost disappeared into the bathroom by the time you'd snapped out of your day dream. This was the best time to swap over, you took position in a conveniently concealed corner, due to the queer architecture of the shop, no one could see you, the shop was empty and the cashier seemed to be dozing off by the second.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing your moment you phased out of Lex, watching her head droop softly as you stood in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...\" Lex whispered dazed and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" you smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you leave my body?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed hanging out with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLex's mouth arched into a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Golden Years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLex's eyebrow arched in a curious manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want to see me in my Grandma's underwear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but the material is cosy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right?\" Lex seemed surprisingly into old lady's lingerie. \"So did you come alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, with your mom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. This was one of her shopping trips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer demeanour changed after that moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we having a tricycle trip me, you and my mom\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly.\" You said mischievously, passing through the women's restrooms doors. You didn't have chance to gage your friend's reaction before diving towards her unsuspecting parent, you expected to find her looking in the bmirror but instead she was still occupied in the cubicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the prime position, but I'll do what I have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flew through the locked door and entered Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usual Darkness ensued until your opened your new eyes and felt a new body beneath you, whilst lifting your head, you caught a glimpse of some new extensions to your chest, taking note as you faced forward. Noticing you'd finished your task you stood up, slightly wobbling with your new distribution. pulling first your underwear and exiting the toilet you were faced with your refreshed reflection, an aged but amiable face and heavily made up. You didn't dwell on your face too long as your eyes were drawn to your healthy torso, placing your wo weathered hands on your top half you sighed lustfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slipped out the bathroom, your daughter stood nervously waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" she questioned, fearful of the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly\" You winked stepping towards Lex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you said, you wanted to hang around with me, I didn't think you meant as my mom.\" Lex sulked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, Honey it's still me, just in a different shape.\" You flirted, intending to disarm, yet from her mother's lips it was a more difficult to convey an atmosphere of calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't really contemplate my best friend having tits. My Mom's tits.\"  She chuckled slightly at the absurdity of what she had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's any consolation, yours are far better.\" The compliment made her blush involuntarily. It was obvious that this was awkward but you could see that she was starting to adapt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we bounce from this ancient Gucci shop?\" Lexi jested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd never say.\" You hoped she didn't mean bounce literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exited the store, the logo on the bag no longer covered by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what's in that bag.\" Lex grabbed the bag from you, investigating it's contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get these for me... Huh... there's two different sizes in here... no... You bought some for my mom.\" She accused, sounding like she had a small amount of vomit in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, YOU suggested as I remember.\" There was a small part of you that felt guilty, the playfulness overpowered your sense of commonality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is gross, I'm just surprised you persuaded my mom to buy something like this. You got me the red! You know me so well!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when I was you, and was getting ready I just sensed red was your color... And black mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere shall we go next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A book of no known origin, appearing almost out of no where was not a usual occurance. Not in your household anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind spiralled in a tornado of information, arguments and other variables, that due to the immediacy of the circumstances, had not been processed. Unlike most situations a brain may catalogue and order useful data. In this case there was no useful data not that your brain could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthics were a major concern. Were there any moral dilemmas if this spell worked. Were there any existing laws against the theft of 'bodies'. Or was the idea so inconceivable no law men had procured the idea to phrase it as a law and as such there was no legal objections to you practising this magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs was the question with most legal and moral qualms, aspects of society need not be laws for one to know something may be wrong. An imaginary Lucifer, who had now placed himself comfortably on your shoulder, his miniature ruby reds caressing your collar bone, stated <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The power that you now possess is bound by no moral obligation, compared to any of societies practises, it is almost unthinkable that such a power exists. It is easy to attribute moral opinion to a collective understanding of  an inherent subject and additionally a firm stance on it, this power is neither understood and therefore a strong opinion has not been formed as a result. Do as you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that closing remark bore the same end affect as Dorothys shoes the ruby demon disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrary to popular culture, the devil in this case may have not been a liar. Consequently the fact that such feelings had manifested itself in a form as specific as that one, made you reevaluate your process. It was difficult in the way that your primal instincts were telling you to try it. As if the home-erectus version of yourself had used it's new ability of standing up straight to get up in your face and forced you to submit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to disagree both with the devil himself and pre-historic Jake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA singular question rose into the air like a recently escaped Phoenix, caged for embodying your darkest desires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA question that could most certainly be answered with moral logic, and quite easily at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn accordance with his own Prince of darkness, you refused to answer the question he, himself had posed, rather using the question as a rhetorical justification for anything he would proceed to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile grew on his face, one that did not emit kindness, as most grins shoulder, but more to illustrate a inherent blackness that your soul had caged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked in the mirror that was placed in the north easterly corner of the room. Regardless of whether the spell worked he used this opportunity to take a final look at yourself . The smile still printed on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple moments passed as you moved quickly over to his window, a white polymer frame defined the square glass. Black beams dignified the window in a symmetrical diamond shape. Leaving an equal pattern of reflective triangles to see the outside world through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared, intently, his interest was seldom nourished by any of the menial subjects regurgitated by his teachers, and you  so often lost concentration, that you theorized that any focus beyond basic eye contact you somehow un-learned. Though this was obviously untrue you did debate this privately to yourself. Evidently this was false. The manner in which you perused the car-laden streets was comparable to Albert Einstein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you had acquired a suitable target. It was a girl, her chestnut hair flowed effortlessly down below her shoulder. Her eyes were large, at least next to those girls you knew. The bridge of her nose was thin leading down to a pointed end, where 2 small holes lay. Pink filled her full lips, it was not immediately clear whether this had been a result of good genes or personal enhancement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jacket encased her torso. One of demon variety and a simple black T shirt lay underneath.Though enveloped by the jacket cleavage could still be seen as her top had been pulled, and tucked purposefully inside a denim skirt that she sported on her lower half. Her legs bare, smooth, shiny. Snow white socks hugged her ankles but were eclipsed by black soul shoes, the shocks only making sparse appearances in the slaves where her footwear did not exist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the only details you could make out from the distance that you were currently. After a brief consultation with what was left of your conscience you had decided on your victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first glance you had not recognised the girl, You had assumed she was just a passed by, but then as you got up to check that she was still walking, she had turned into your neighbours front garden. A thought entered forcefully into your mind, as if an important event was occurring and you had not heard prompting someone to burst into your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Johnson's were on holiday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir house was not too dissimilar to yours, with the obvious exception of the interior, what was dissimilar was their paranoia which must come from having such a nice interior. They were house proud, you were often acquainted with the sight of them carting numerous antiquities into their inappropriately sized door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsequently they had a house sitter. A point if humour came from the fact that the girl they had hired was clearly not a fighter, no would she ever succeed in defending the house. But if an intruder did subterfuge their way into the home it was house one more person than would have been present if the Johnson's hadn't hired anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir were more rumours about the Johnson's then was truths you imagined. They were recluses, loners and rarely made the effort to escape their museum of an abode, never mind go out if their way to appease the neighbours at any point with the exchange of polite words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dangerous combination is lock-ins and little information. All of the more active residents filled in what blanks they thought needed to be filled and as such created stories, one bring that Mrs Johnson had a Sex Dungeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the streets alumni had seen Mrs Johnson exhibited an 'Ann Summers' neglecting to acknowledge the fact that Mrs Johnson would reuse old bags. The question still stood. Where did she get the bag originally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother rumour was that Mr Johnson had died, and Mrs Johnson 'weekend at Bernie'd' him but that was more of a joke around the block. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA predicament then arose in your head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How to they pick their house sitter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been made abundantly clear that they wanted no one to frequent their place, which would suggest that may be they did have something to hide, in which case picking a person for a such a position sought to be a tricky task. Were their auditions, were they picked my Mr Johnson's ghost? Either way it must come with rather more scrutiny then an average progression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to analyse. You had never seen this girl before, maybe she was from out of town. This was likely but also it was ignorant to think that you knew everyone in your town. A family friend? This was also a definite possibility, yet this had been partially discredit based on the fact that the Johnson's didn't seem to have a family. Or friends! No one can recall any other human entering the Johnson's house effort the Johnson's. Unless all the social etiquette had been performed in the short visits away from their well furnished mansion, a family friend would almost be impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories were dug up from your ingrained cabinet inside your head, bringing forth pictures of other house keepers, most of them had been unremarkable average Jies, most you'd even written out of your storage. It was futile to attempt to draw lines of comparisons between these illusive characters, there wasn't even a consistent gender between the suspects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of possession was already scaring you slightly. Not that you wanted to be scared, you killed to be excited, but what if this girl is something else. She did not appear to be something else. But how could you possibly know, she had been chosen by the nymphomaniac, necrophiliac Johnson's and was entrusted with guarding their fortress of ancient relics. For a final time the question flashed like a camera lense taking a perfect sadistic portrait of your inner compass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not\"</span></div></div>",

Your pupils flitting back and forth as to imitate some depleted work equipment, not far from a sewing machine from the late industrial boom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was automatic, your entire face, robotic in it's repeated movements and inability to freeze, pause or stop. It was not long, maybe 1 or 2 minutes, but your brain had slowed down your perception of time passing, to somewhat accommodate for the terrifyingly inconceivable course of events that were currently beseeching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in an instant, a flurry of astonishing blues and red escaped the paper as an expulsion of a firework like celebration bombarded it's way into your indented chest. Filling a space that previous to this you didn't know you had. Your irises rapidly changing colour in a LSD fuelled rainbow show. From your perspective not much happened, it was true that you felt fulfilled it was true you had seen a burst of spectral lights emanate form a yellow sheet. But you were oblivious to any other outwards effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an overall incomprehensible and arguably indescribable set of circumstances. All you knew for certain was that you could possess people and that you now had a rose and turquoise gas cloud inhabiting your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPost this traumatic experience you recalled why you had read the scroll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sped across your reasonably large room back towards your polygon patterned window and saw the girl luckily still clumsily searching for her key for the door, she had in her graceful hand a small metal ring with keys surrounding, some little with big circles, some long with small ovals, some archaic, some short and insignificant, some large and overbearing. Yet in the same way that you were not able to distinguish each key from the other it seemed very much that she couldn't either. You had spent enough time debating this philosophy that any minutes that passes from here on was a waste of precious daylight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating you were able to convert your malebidy into a transparent copy, feeling more weightless than you had ever felt before, even lifting partially of the rough carpet, you leaned forward, your legs arching on a 45 degree angle, your head mimicking the same leaving you looking like a positive correlation on a graph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flew forward, apprehensively closing the gap between you and your window, them as if the glass had not been there you passed through it effortlessly.  Opening your eyes, which you had closed tight in preparation for an immediate collision, you surveyed your surroundings, they were familiar, the houses still painted in their non descript Brown's, their brick work unchanged in decades, the pavement still had the grey aesthetic that it had enjoyed since the same of time, the distinct cracks still visible from your window and consequently fromwhere you had stationed yourself mid-air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had changed though was the position that you were viewing this all at, you had almost become like the fictional Peter Pan, your shadow alternatively was still intact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind was present but did not appear harsh, rather a soft breeze, there were scattered puffy marshmallow clouds gliding purposefully in the expense of blue sky that sat nicely behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was still in a muddle about her choice in her door opening apparatus. Her fingers had wrapped around one key after another, her index and thumb tightening on a perspective key and thrusting it into the complicated lock mechanism that the entrance had ingrained in it's designed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of tumultuous minutes precededher eventual correct choice, this key was neither archaic, small, or was accompanied by a small oval, it was a boisterous large key, with an engraving of a dove on the square base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe key fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like that's my cue\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that had pushed you into action, in the same process in which you exited your bedroom, you started towards the girl, who was blissfully unaware that a stranger would be momentarily taking her place at the door. Her optics were firmly fixed on the golden lock, her slender fingers, turning in earnest the bronze piece that was required to let her into the building. Her legs planted on  the ground, her feet situated equally apart. Her back slightly hunched over as to provide her with the correct stance to accomplish such a task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mahogany oblong opened, not without a loud creak. At the same exact moment you passed through the girls curved spine gaining access to her frail form. Causing her and now you to drop toward the mat that had been left at the door. Its primary purpose to wipe feet, not necessarily to break the fall of an average sized girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes, woke to attention. Using your new narrow limbs to support your rise to a standing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour balance wavered slightly. The room around you seemed to be twisting, vibrating and spinning. A well-placed hand on a near by wall reduced the nauseating whirlwind of a room. Eyesight was not much more of a help, you were blurred in this area, in such a way that you thought the house was censoring itself from You, yet this was arguably idiotic but having said that the idea that a possession spell would exist before today was also arguably idiotic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling, your feet banging against the flimsy planks beneath you, your footsteps no longing practising the 'one foot in front of the other' way of walking. Now trying somewhat to reflect an Irish Jig. The only noise that was welcomed by your ears what that of the audios walkway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 step, 2 step, 3 step. Bump! 4 step, 5 step, 6 step. Crash!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt intoxicated as you drunkenly slam your way through a house you were supposed to be looking after. Well not 'you' but the poor soul who's vessel you had borrowed from. Intending to give it back to her you at least wanted to keep the damage to cause to her and her surroundings to a minimal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing a walk that saw you relearning to walk as a 2 year old would, a blind toddler at that, and a toddler that packed weight where a normal toddler would not have. You ultimately discovered a small living space equipped with a window letting in some beams of light dimmed by some fabric hanging from a metal bar installed above holding the curtain. A single bed, it's quilt tucked nicely into the sides of the wooden frame. The quilt being a calming white, it's cushions copying the plain and simple colour scheme. The floor was covered by a deep brown carpet, it felt soft, but that feeling was mitigated by the shoes that you wore. A mirror stood silently in the corner, a trifle dusty. It was found next to a chest of drawers, wipes and a cloth led unused atop the drawers. The walls were bare, woth the blatant exception if a cream switch that must cause the lights to brighten, the source being a snowy lamp shade masking a lightbulb,resulting in a white room wjen the bulb was activated, the wall paper, much like the rest of the room, was undecorated and indistinct in nature. You imagined this to be a spare room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouses in your neighbourhood were clones almost of themselves, they had been built as part of a 'initiative housing project back in 2006, they were built with speed and had no time for unique architecture, not that any of the residents stopped to consider this before purchasing any of them, it made their sale easy also, as a result of their likeness to the rest, you only had to see one for you to know the rest. The only choice you had was which section of the road you wanted to see. And which back street was more dark and dingy. (On both sides the back street was both dark and dingy the only visible difference was what colour skip you had, which when the choice is between a bright yellow and a slightly less-bright yellow even that decision didn't take much toleration between buyers). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a short time you were perplexed, you could not place the room that you were in in relation to your house, if all houses were exact copies of each other you should easily be able to place this room. Was it your kitchen, or bedroom, or bathroom? It may have been due to severe disorientation due to your current arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was it so barren?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis second question also played on your brain. If these folks were as extravagant as their transient appearance would imply, Why would they have such a empty room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogically you had not explored the house, nor had you been able to put a picture together as you staggered your way through the entrance. Therefore it would be ignorant to make such an assumption without checking out the rest of the house? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the house. You were in the Johnson's. The famed sex obssessed, corpse fornicatin, Johnson's. An opportunity of a life time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye you noticed a pile of clothes woth a note on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What to do, what to do?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your turned peering at the clothes pile that sat calmly beside You, it consisted of a plain black tank top, a pair of shirts, two black socks, a plain black bra, one that looked a similar cup size to your hosts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDye to this fact you contemplated whether this pile belonged to You, but you couldn't help pondering why they would belong to You. Surely a note would have existed to dictate your action from here on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe a note had existed, perhaps you missed it. This was a trifle difficult to know being that you just hopped into this poor souls body in the middle of an activity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stated intently at the Pile. In your peripherals you spotted a Nah, no smaller than a purse but no bigger than a rucksack. Your objective may have to been to get changed and full the bag with the attire that was attachedto your frame. But again there was no certainty in this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basic information. The ONLY information you had was a brief estimated with the bra. But even at that you could not be completely sure of It, as if it was a work uniform then miss estimates are bound to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been made acutely aware of your new female body. You glided towards the mirror with every step, exoeeoemcing new weights, that lay on your chest and new your lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccessfully arriving in front of the full length mirror you fully realised the differences that you never had as a make. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair, that you usually stopped at the bottom of your neck, flowed elegantly passed even the middle of your back. Your eyes wider and distinct the colour blue prevailing beautifully in your new Iris'. Your nose rather than it's former thick bridge and unruly nosyroks was now replaced by a skinny bridge leading to somewhat of a button nose. All new. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensations were catching up to You, you could now feel the steaks of her underwear against her soft skin. The cups pressing usefully against her precious bossom. A free space that had once held your make genitalia but now housed an empty space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupple fingers, full nails paraded on her hands. Sitting at the end of long enchayd arms that felt both light and strong simultaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA torso that was as appealing as it was useful. An outline of a bra defined the font if her t shirt. Large perky breads were hidden beneath. A mountain like shape was a result as you peaked down your new top-half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow were curvaceous legs and a prominent rear that had altered your movement as your strolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but enjoy it a little bit. Wasn't that the point in it all? That you could experience having all these gender specific traits, consensual or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes were taken again to the mirror you were attractive and could also fall in love with this girl, but this was not the time to be addressing dormant feelings for girls you had just met. Well met being a very strong word. Took over may have been slightly more appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough moral judgment at this point was not yiur string suit, you felt the need to exercise it in some way by asking questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor instance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you allowed to touch yourself. In logical terms this should not be a problem, It is yiur body ergo have the prerogative to explore your god given form. Yet god didn't give it to you. He gave it to the person you are inhabiting someone, mind You, you didn't know the name of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of most competent disagreements any reasonable arguments could be qauled on the basis that a power like this scientifically shouldn't exist and therefore any humane justification should be disregarded on that factor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn such complicated circumstances, it seemed far more efficient to just assume the right of the vessel you are currently presiding over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was indeed true that you did need to change clothes then it was likely you would touch a part that in any other situation you would not go near. So as a  result should you go against what was meant for your persons purely based on that. Most certainly not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief time of deliberating over the philosophy questioning laundry you had now began towards the light switch you flicked it with a small amount of force and the bulb that hung dangerously from the ceiling tried in earnest to produce light. Which it did but at a depleted level. Accomplishing this menial task you made your way to the pile of clothes, separating them carefully into categories relevant to parts of your body. First placing the top half consisting of bra and tank top then the bottom half the shorts and socks. You had picked up the bra and went back towards the mirror dropping it carelessly on the floor as you used both hands to remove yiur t shirt. You placed them at the base of your hips, gripping the fabric beneath your weak fingers and pulled up in a forceful manner, you had gotten 2 thirds of the way up when you came to your potent breasts and had to reassess your movement which meant that you tanked the shirt outwards and over your mountain of mounds that stood defiantly on your new chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admired your underwear-clad breasts, though only a basic piece, it could even be considered conservative in regards to most others you had researched online, it still gave your breasts a stunning aesthetic. They were coerced into bring pushed up against each other creating some forced cleavage. You eyedup the decrepit bra that now lay your feet, you bent over, taking a sly look at your reflection when contorted in this position. Showing more cleavage. You placed your hand on the bra and contracted your fist not doing much to help the crumpled appearance of the lingerie. You held it against your own bra, it seemed bigger, too big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you doubt that these clothes were you for You, but in a way it could be explained by an over estimation. As a result of this being a job, this perhaps was her uniform and some measurements were miscommunicated or constrewed. You did not key much further, this could've been due to the fact that you couldn't wait to get this one off so you could gaze at her natural mammaries untouched and unchanged by provocative clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you attempted the awkward process of removing a bra, something that you had seen done effortlessly by women but with marginally less success amongst the male population. You placed your palm against one breast followed by your other hand repeating the same movement on the other. It was soft and comforting, supporting also. The way that your tits had filled this piece was almost perfect. A pang if guilt ran through your heart. You adhered to the logic that you could what the owner would be able to do in the body but you were not acting as the owner would, making you feel like a thief. Yet as you carried on feeling yiur longer tips sending sensations previously unknown to you to your brain it overpowered the feeling if guilt.  to rotate your palms pushing them even further together. You couldn't stop yourself. It became robotic to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot before long you became aware of the time you were spending and abruptly concluded with a squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not done your hands spun around to your back. Clasping onto the mechanism that attached the bra parts of the underwear together you pinched on end with one hand and then pinched the ither. You pushed against each other, wanting the clip to end it's union with its counterparts then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThwack <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sides separated, the front came loose, the cups no longer keeping yiur breasts enraptured you pushed one arm forward using your other to move the strap from down yiur arm and passed your hand. Then as the bra hung from yiur other arm you oggled at your reflection. The breast that had been held up were now dropping not much lower than they had been. Perking up at the end. The bright pink aereolas a perfect medium, and a small nipple placed I the centre of each. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You read the words initally nothing happened, but then a sudden warm feeling came over you as if the heating had just come on in your house but instead the house was your body, this in no way inferred that you had any power but the peculiarity of the feeling coupled with the queer situation caused you to be pretty sure that something had changed within you, possession or otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were you to do now, where could you test such a hypothesis, you thought you would avoid your family, as that would be a trifle weird, not that you would discount them completely, but maybe later. like you'd established earlier your friends were all busy doing other things. Maybe you could wait until the following day, but the nerves and excitement would keep you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way you decided a walk may clear you're head, it was late, but your mother hadn't even heard you come in, it was unlikely she would bother with you going out for a night time stroll. Looking out your window, The sky had darkened by now, the Mandarin nature of the sky had turned swiftly into an ink collage of black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strolled down your hallway, peering into your mother's bedroom, if she was awake you would make the effort to tell her where you were going, but she was fast asleep, you'd be back before it got too late anyway, you would skip out sleeping rough that night you joked to yourself. passing Jane's room, you noticed the light still shone in the crack of the door you opening it slightly, enough for Jane to hear but not loud by any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" she asked looking up from the book that she had in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you reading?\" You don't know why you'd asked, it's not even that you needed to speak to her, yet you'd said it anyway, it must have been an automatic conversation starter. Perhaps it was the nerves about testing this spell, you weren't using Jane as your test subject anyway, having the power or having the prospect of such an ability was enough to make you stumble over your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifty Shades.\" She replied bluntly, that was her humor. Sarcastic. If you were honest you wouldn't be surprised had she been reading Fifty Shades of Gray, you doubted she would read it with her door unlocked though. \"I kid, I kid, I'm reading '1984', which ironically is how many times I've considered killing myself whilst reading this shit\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bad, huh?\" You empathized with poor Jane, you hadn't done English since High school, but you remembered the pain of the reading assignments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, I'm getting flushed, am I red? You might have to give me a moment, I'm getting hot and bothered.\" She crossed her legs in a sexually frustrated manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done?\" you inquired impatiently, you hated giving her credit for her jokes, but you saw a lot of yourself in her, you'd never let her know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to get naked, do you mind?\" Her tone was cartoonishly offended. She would carry on a joke until the Jew's converted if she was that committed. All her jokes were sexually driven, that's what she was best at, she had been given multiple detentions and saturday school for matching the immaturity levels of most of the boys in her classes. \"New speak more like 'nude speak' ay ay ay\" she began to take her top off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And on that note I'm going out\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got 5 layers under this ya know? I'm a human Matryoska doll\" she beamed a smile towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, I'd rather skip the other 4 layers, I only came in here to tell you I was going for a walk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At 10:30? Surely the hooker you're courting can be phone called by now, its 2018\" she quipped obviously proud of her self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's rich, I've seen what you wear to parties\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think I afford all my bling\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you're not supposed to agree\" you sulked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now get away with you\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
