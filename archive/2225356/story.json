There you are.\u201d You said as you found the book you were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you grabbed the book, another hand comes to take it too. You were about to tell this person that you found it first until you stopped to when you see something that made you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, it was someone. For who you see is a girl with long red hair and emerald green eyes. She looks so beautiful to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. I\u2019m sorry. I just needed that book for my test next week.\u201d She apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny. I have that same test next week too.\u201d You said still blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is funny. Oh yeah. Don\u2019t want to be rude. I\u2019m Samantha Simpson. But you can call me Sam.\u201d Sam introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMike. Mike Herring.\u201d You introduced yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe student president? No way. This is a surprise.\u201d Sam said giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so. Say, uh, since we have the same test, how about we, you know, study together?\u201d You asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. I\u2019d love to, Mike.\u201d Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, you two read the book together and you sometimes get distracted by seeing Sam and all of her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right there that you are in love.</span></div></div>",
