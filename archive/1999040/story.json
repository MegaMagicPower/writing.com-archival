Piles and piles of more food than any of them had ever seen in their lives. And when the mouth-watering scent of that<br>\r\nfood hit their nostrils, the campers raced to the tables faster than anything and dug in. Cries of joy immediately rose from<br>\r\nthe children. This was the best, most delicious food any of them had ever eaten! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriven by the desire to experience as much of this exquisite deliciousness as possible, the children began eating faster. So<br>\r\nconsumed were they by the heavenly taste, none of them even noticed that their bodies were gradually expanding with fat from<br>\r\nthe specially-prepared food. Plump bellies emerged from underneath shirts, hips bulged over waistbands, chins multiplied like<br>\r\nrabbits with Viagra for blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the children ate and grew, the camp staff took special notice of Bart, who was packing away more than any other camper<br>\r\npresent. He was eating so much so quickly, one could actually see him bloating larger and larger. His belly had already<br>\r\novertaken his entire lap, despite the best efforts of his fattening legs to make said lap as wide as possible. His shirt had<br>\r\nrode up so far against his belly and fat back that the crack of his massive butt could be seen just above the waistband of<br>\r\nhis overstressed shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, a bell was rung, signaling the end of the first of the day's nine meals. The children laid back in their seats,<br>\r\nso overwhelmed by how unbelievably delicious the food had been that they didn't even care about their increased girth. A few<br>\r\nof them clearly enjoyed the added poundage, perhaps considering it a badge of honor. All the campers had gained between 30<br>\r\nand 50 pounds, but Bart had surpassed them all. Even though the portions of food only added a little amount of weight each,<br>\r\nit had added up due to sheer size of Bart's repast. Bart had gained 93 pounds in a single meal! His clothes, strained by both<br>\r\nthe boy's size and the rapidity of the gain, now barely fit him. Aided by a staff member, he heaved his new bulk out of his<br>\r\nseat and rejoined his classmates. Milhouse had gained 41 pounds, Martin 33 pounds, and Nelson had added 45 pounds to his<br>\r\nalready chunky frame. They expressed their congratulations to Bart over his gain, and together they waddled off to their<br>\r\ncabin to relax and await their next meal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Apparently he earned it by saving the town from something that wouldn't have happened if he was just at his work. From the get go Homer was a little disappointed by this. Losing all the weight Bart helped him put on meant he had to go back to work every day and couldn't get and disability bonuses. Bart was also pissed that his dad was back to his normal, only overweight yet not obese, self. Still, Marge and Lisa seemed happy about it so Homer decided to be positive about it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, since losing that weight Homer felt as if something was missing in his life. He'd rest his hand on his stomach and expect a cushy mound but it just wouldn't be there. At night he'd lie awake, unused to the lack of softness his flabby body used to comfort him with. And all of a sudden now that he weighed less people expected him to move! Why did he have to get up and walk around? As the days passed Homer started to hate this limbo of being too skinny to experience the comforts of obesity, yet too fat to be fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were bound to change when Marge and Lisa left town for a week to attend a saxophone convention, leaving Bart and Homer alone. Homer, still in his pajamas, sulked downstairs and plopped down next to Bart on the couch and proceeded to drown himself in violent cartoons.

And stuff he did, Homer devoured huge meals on top of huge meals since going to Dr.Nicks and the results were showing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer and Bart sat in a booth in Krusty Burger, the table covered in wrappers and empty drinks. 'Here dad, this is the last one' Bart said handing his dad the burger and watching in quiet awe 'Thanks boy, down the hatch!' Homer said taking a huge bite out of it, then another and another until it was all gone. Homer swallowed it all down and sat back, 'woo, that was great!' Homer said, 'yeah dad your appetite is really increasing, as well as the size of your belly!' Bart said, 'hehe thanks boy, it takes a lot to get a belly this big' Homer said, 'but you're nowhere near done are you?' Bart asked, 'heck no Bart! I'm in this for the long haul!' Homer said with a huge smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart and Homer left the booth and Homer stood up, revealing that his white polo shirt didn't cover his belly any more. A good few inches of new soft belly fat had grown around his middle, showing off his belly button area perfectly. Homer smiled and rubbed the bare skin and the two headed to the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn their way home, Bart spotted a new Donut place, 'Hey look Dad! A new donut shop has opened' Bart said, 'wow...mmmm donuts' Homer said, 'but I'm really full...maybe next time' Homer said, 'But dad Dr.Nick said you're to stuff yourself until no more can go in!' Bart said and reached over and poked Homer's belly, 'and there is some give there, so you can clearly fit more!' Bart said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer thought for a second and decided </span></div></div>",

He also missed the soft feel and how Homer's clothes fit him when he got hugely fat, he didn't like the muumuu as it covered up Homer's belly but even that couldn't hide how fat Homer had become...now that was all gone and Bart hated it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge had taken Lisa and Maggie with Patty and Selma on a girls only cruise, so they would be gone for months. This was the perfect time for Bart to hatch his master fat plan and get Homer back to his truly happy self of being hugely obese....maybe even passed that, Homer wasn't the most observant of people so he may not even realise he'd gained weight until it was too late to turn back. Part of Bart felt guilty for doing this, but this was only a small feeling, the rest of him was telling him to go for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Bart crept out of the house with Homer's wallet, he did it slowly and quietly as to awaken the slumbering fatty upstairs. He went down to Krusty Burger and picked up 5 Krusty burger meals with 5 extra fattening shakes and somehow managed to carry it all home. He went into the bedroom and spoke softly to Homer \"Homer...its dinner time\" Bart said and wafted the burgers under his nose, \"mmm....dinner\" the sleepy Homer said, Bart was scared he would wake up but he didn't. He placed the first burger near Homer's mouth and Homer took a bite and swallowed, Homer must have been dreaming about eating because he kept asking for more after each bite of the burgers and each handful of fries. Bart couldn't believe this was happening, he didn't expect Homer to not wake up...this was going to be easier than he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good hour, Homer had managed all 5 of the krusty burger meals. Bart slowly and carefully peeled back the quilt from his dad and gentle rubbed his belly, he couldn't help but notice how full it felt and how much bigger it already looked with so much food inside it. Bart undid some of the buttons of his dads pajama shirt and began to rub the bare and soft belly that was beneath. Homer seemed to enjoy this as he was smiling throughout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Homer shifted and rolled onto his back, his belly looking even bigger as it rose high above him. This was the perfect opportunity for Bart to pour the milkshakes down his mouth and into his belly. Bart placed the first cup near his mouth and said \"Time for a drink Homer\", the sleepy homer obeyed and just opened his mouth. Allowing Bart to pour fattening milkshake after fattening milkshake into Homer's belly. The 5 quickly went down, Bart looked back at Homer's belly which now looked super full. The pajama top had fallen to the sides revealing it all in its stuffed glory, Bart hoped this was a good start to his dad's obese future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart cleared up the rubbish and hid it in his room, he then quietly crept back in and tried to do up all the buttons he had undone...but the button at the pinnacle of Homer's belly would not reach at all. No matter how hard to tugged, it just wouldn't connect. Bart had to abandon this, threw the quilt back over Homer and ran back to his room to sleep. Bart kept thinking about what he'd down, how fat Homer was going to get and how quick if he kept this up, before he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Bart awoke and could hear his dad whistling downstairs in the kitchen. He ran downstairs and saw Homer and.....</span></div></div>",

The state's new initiave of manditory minimum levels of fittness had him concerned. All law enforcement officers without a work-related disability would have to be able to run a mile within ten minutes and a BMI below 45.0, any current officers were expected to complete a test of it within the month. Knowing the officers on his force were well motivated to never run after their initial physical he expected almost no one would be able to meet this. With, at least in his mind, heroic grace he realized the solution this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking the \"EDIT\" button on the premade brief sent to him by the state capitol, he changed the requirements to a mile in 100:00 minutes and having no more than a BMI of 450.0. Chuckling he saved the changes and sent out the memo to his officers per the instructions given. Chuckling with the brilliance of his plan he put his feet up and went back to the kind of police work he loved... putting the bag up to his mouth and mindlessly eating his way though the  14 serving party size bag which made up his third snack that afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggum loved his life, as police commissioner he had only the mayor as a boss who was just as corrupt and lazy as he was, well maybe not AS lazy which gave him free reign to spend his days eating the complementary kickback snacks local businesses and markets would send him to ensure better policing of their stores. Was he supposed to take bribes? No, but Wiggum never thought that a two dozen box of donuts, or a weekly sheet cake from the baker was really a bribe to begin with, more like incentive to stop by more often in his off hours for more to eat. If there was one thing Wiggum loved more than his job, it was food and it showed; at 360 pounds on his stout 5'9\" stature he was practically spherical squeezing into his 56\" stretch-waist police pants which had started getting tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached the end of his bag of chips, slightly out of breath and with a light squeal of his old asthma sounded just like the pig he was coming out of his airway he rubbed his soft middle. Recently Wiggum was finding he enjoyed not only eating, but the effect it had on his physique, he would occasionally glance at new strechmarks or notice a fold looking softer when getting out of the shower and found them oddly exciting. Breaking out of his trance saw someone standing at his office door who began to knock. Getting back to a more professional posture and wiping the crumbs of his gluttony off his uniform he uttered in his nasily tone, \"Come in\" and the person entered.</span></div></div>",

Despite being a well-kept 180 lbs when he moved to Springfield six years ago, the stress of running his newly inherited \"legitimate businesses\" had clearly taken a toll on Tony to the point where he now had to shift sideways through the doorway, his immense gut encased in a tremendous tracksuit which would never be used for exercise again, the jacket unzipped Tony's thick body hair could be seen through the thin tank top he wore underneath and especially in the two inches of gut which were left uncovered by it. Wiggum was surprised by just how much the gangster had put on since they last met for his biannual bribe/ dinner with an important small businessman in the community which kept Wiggum out of his hair unless his hand was forced. Tony approached Wiggum carrying a large box of donuts in one hand, munching on one from the box with the other, each lumbering step sending a ripple across his gelatinous form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commissioner... I hope that my unscheduled appearance does not interrupt your busy schedule.\" Tony said smoothly after finishing cramming the second half of the donut into his mouth. \"I recently opened a new business I thought might be to your interest, a doughnut shop a block away from the station.\" Tony said, setting the box of doughnuts on Wiggum's desk and showing him the logo on the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting into business with my favorite food? What's your angle here Tony?\" Commissioner Wiggum replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No angle, I'm a bit too curvy for those these days\" Tony replied, patting his gut for effect \"I started it because I figured with as many donuts as I've been eating recently I might as well get a discount beyond a stamp for each dozen I got.\" He continued to explain while opening the box to Wiggum's excited face. \"I opened it so close by so my friends with the Springfield Police could get a snack any time day or night, we're proudly offering a 25% off discount to all law enforcement and military servicemen. That said because we're such good friends I'll tell my staff for you it's buy one get one free\" Tony said as Wiggum managed to finish shoving his first donut in at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commissioner was stunned by how good the doughnut was, soft and chewy while the glaze gave a light crunch. It was his heaven! He grabbed one with each hand and began stuffing himself. Tony laughed and bid him a good afternoon. Waddling out Tony muttered something to himself that Wiggum couldn't make out, not that he cared. He had 20 more donuts to eat!</span></div></div>",

Polishing off the entire box in less than 10 minutes he found himself momentarily contented while he rubbed his belly and happily moaned. The donuts were great and if this was Tony's way of keeping him off his back, it sat fine with Wiggum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commissioner finished off the rest of his afternoons work after that. Not much to do as he delegated every possible task he could to his subordinates but some things did require his signature still. Finishing almost an hour ahead of schedule, he looked at the empty box he had stacked on top of his already full wastebasket and thought about how great those donuts had been. His belly grumbled in agreement and as a reminder he hadn't eaten in two hours. Calling it an early day Wiggum dislodged himself from his desk chair and made his way to the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony had not been kidding when he said it was down the street, only a block over from the station and even located on the way between work and home! The business, Fat Tony's Donuts hid nothing about the owner, probably a marketing trick Wiggum thought, if the owner's a big guy a consumer could think they know what they're doing or something like that he concluded. Wiggum pulled in and followed the signage they had for their drive through window. He ordered a dozen donuts from the teenage employee who seemed to work everywhere else too, the skinny youth recognized the Commissioner and let him know they'd be giving him a free second dozen like Tony had mentioned, and generously the advertised 25% serviceman discount too. Paying $7.50 for two baker's dozen had Wiggum short of breath with excitement, donuts were his favorite food and this was better AND cheaper than the other stores in town. He drove home absent mindedly eating out of the first dozen he was done by the time he got home. He carried the second box in, not noticing the way his 5XL shirt strained between the buttons.</span></div></div>",

Satisfied with the punishment he rolled off the thin lanky teen and after a moment to stand up placed one of his tree-trunk thick legs on his chest pinning him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will give you a warning for your wasting of my time, so I wanted to this opportunity as your boss to give you specific instructions on how to settle any dispute here.\u201d Tony said reaching for a recently made, still warm glazed doughnut. \u201cAt previous jobs you\u2019ve mentioned a desire to ask the manager\u2026\u201d *munch munch munch* *gulp* \u201c...never ask me regarding any problems.\u201d Tony said reaching for another but keeping a crushing weight on the teen\u2019s chest. \u201cJust feed these cattle we have for customers more donuts to keep them satisfied, if there\u2019s a problem, fix it by giving them enough food that they start eating and shut up.\u201d Tony crammed the entire doughnut into his bloated face in one mouthful and swallowing just as quick, \u201cKeep the customers happy, I\u2019ll be happy, and we\u2019ll never have to have a conversation like this again.\" Tony paused and signaled to Louie to pass him a carton of milk from the nearby refrigerator which he gulped down rapidly. \"Take the rest of the day off - I\u2019ll still pay for the rest of your hours today, come back and never question your orders again\u201d. Tony took his foot off and the teen took his first full breath of air since Tony had sat on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLouie stay here the rest of the evening as my eyes, and make sure the other employees get the message about how to deal with any problems around here, and keep an eye on our 'quality control' you know how important it is to me to follow our recipes to the letter.\u201d Fat Tony made his way to the front of the store again with no one else any the wiser to what had taken place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving the other employee box him up a dozen Tony left the place satisfied with the day\u2019s events. Being bigger certainly was having its advantages.</span></div></div>",

He got up while his wife slept peacefully. She wouldn't need to get up for several hours and he didn't find it necessary to wake her. He spent the usual 20 minutes on the can before getting in the shower, his gut seemed to reach the wall a little sooner than he had remembered recently. Drying off he went to get dressed and found even \"sucking in\" as much as he could his pants wouldn't buckle. Figuring that he didn't want to go in with any embarrassing compromises to his uniform it was as good of an excuse as any other to take the day off while finding new pants . He had months of time off saved up, why bother when he could nap the day away in the office he'd always figured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a pair of elastic shorts which could go past his 56\" pants admiring the effect of the tight cotton fabric on his spherical form. He got in his car and started heading to the mall. Halfway there he realized the store he wanted to go to probably wouldn't be open until a bit later in the morning. Needing something to do and given his rumbling stomach, something to eat! Wiggum made his way back to Fat Tony's Donuts for an extended breakfast. Since he had a few hours to kill Wiggum made his way inside to sit down and relax. Sitting at the counter inside on a wide, sturdy stool, Wiggum had the clerk drop off a dozen of whatever looked good to the kid and a pile of milk cartons getting the extra dozen made Wiggum smile, 26 donuts would take him some time. He sat and watched as a good number of Springfield's residents came in to try the new store during their morning commute. Saying hi to anyone who noticed the porcine cop Wiggum he enjoyed spending a few hours with a newspaper and munching on donuts. Finally at around 9:30 Wiggum finished his last maple round and made his way to the door. He arrived at the mall and given the weekday morning crowd found easy parking. He made it to the plus size store The Vast Wasteband and meet the man at the counter. The experienced clerk knew of Wiggum's position having supplied his special order uniforms for several years and had pants which would meet his needs. To be sure he brought out his soft cloth tape and held it around Wiggum's waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes there we are, 58\" for the waist and 24\" for the legs. You're moving up huh?\" The tailor said to Wiggum teasingly. He brought out 4 pairs of size 58\" and then also brought out two pairs of 60\", \"Sadly none of these are in your length and will need to be hemmed which won't be a problem but will take a little time. I can have a few of these ready by the end of the day. That said to prevent this happening in the future would you be interested in a pair in a larger size. I have these 60\" pairs and can order bigger still, if I put it in they can tailor it more specifically to you for little extra, they'd fit that much more comfortably though over the standard pattern. Wiggum thought that sounded pretty good, considering how much he was liking those donuts and the feeling of his full figure, he decided to give it a shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad idea there, lets get me 4 pairs of the 58 now, and instead of those 60's get me a custom order for...\"</span></div></div>",

He left the shop unsure of what to do with the rest of the day off, he took them so rarely as he found getting paid to do nothing was rewarding enough. Thankfully his belly answered that, for having just consumed several pounds of fried dough and sugar it felt oddly empty so he decided to do something about it. He waddled his way through the food court, his ill-fitting 6XL Springfield PD shirt wrapped tight on his spherical belly made a nice enough reminder so that every place he stopped by felt compelled to give him something to try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggum sat down with two trays full of food and dug in, living large was going to agree with him!</span></div></div>",

Wiggum couldn't believe how hungry he would get eating those perfect glazed fried circles, seemed like they left a bigger hole than they filled sitting in his belly by the dozen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the month he had a bi-annual physical planned with Dr. Hibbert, he decided to take the day off and spent his morning spread across two stools with 40 donuts packed into two boxes at Fat Tony's Donut shop. He waved to Tony who also stopped by for their morning meal. As fat as Wiggum was getting he was amazed by Tony, his tracksuit looked like it could work as a tent for the entire Springfield Junior Campers troop and he still could see some of his hairy belly peeking out. Tony was in and out without a word, they had a stack of boxes ready to go for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Dr. Hibbert's office the Commissioner found ample seating, the waiting room had several wide bench seats, he and Tony apparently weren't the only super sized Springfield resident these days.

For her Springfield Elementary is the bane of her existance, every day she smokes and drinks because of how much she hates that place, and yet, once upon a time she was a bright eyed teacher who was eager to make a difference in her student's lives...<br>\r\nAnd then she met BART SIMPSON.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crushed her spirit, he ruined her dream job, and now as she finally flees the building eager to escape it's clutches, it is he who she is most glad to be free from. If only there was a way to stay employed and not have to ever go back there again. To never have to teach, to never have to suffer...<br>\r\nBut such fancies are just dreams, and as she drives home she sighs, best to put it out of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer day passes much as it always does, taking care of a few chores, hunting the local bars for vigourous young men to have her way with, when she notices something strange. She sees a man at the bar, a huge man, who must weigh 500 pounds or more, yet she thinks she knows him. She keeps her eye on him for much of the night, trying to put her finger on how she knows him, when finally at the bar he notices her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edna, is that you?\" he says<br>\r\nEdna turns to face him and looks surprised \"ohhhhh, hi there...it's been too long\" she says awkwardly, still not knowing who this huge man is.<br>\r\nHe laughs however \"Haha you don't know who I am do you? It's me, Clint. We dated a few years back\"<br>\r\nEdna's eyes go wide as she remembers. Clint was an extremely hunky fireman she dated, he was in the peak of physical health and really sexy, but like with all her partners it didn't last. She takes in now just how much he has changed \"wow, I didn't recognise you at all!\"<br>\r\nClint laughs again \"yep I have changed quite a bit, it's all this\" he says and jiggles his enormous belly \"I got injured at work and took a year to heal, couldn't work out or anything and well, the weight just started piling on. By the time i was ready to go back to work they told me I was legally disabled because I was 'hyper obese', so now i get to stay at home and don't have to work, but still get paid as if i were. It's the best!\"<br>\r\nEdna frowns \"that doesn't sound right, is that really a thing?\"<br>\r\nClint smiles \"it sure it, here let me find you the page\" he says and takes out his phone and goes onto a website listing various laws both federal and state until he finds it, he hands it to her and for a few minutes she reads it.<br>\r\n\"No way...!\" she says in shock and awe \"Full pay and never having to work again!\"<br>\r\n\"I know right!\" Clint says \"it's the best thing to ever happen to me\"<br>\r\n\"I'm tempted to do it myself\" Edna chuckles \"freedom from those brats at the school, to be free from the soul crushing shackles of that wretched school. It is all I dream about anymore\"<br>\r\n\"then do it\" Clint says \"gain the weight and free yourself\"<br>\r\nEdna looks surprised at him and then thinks about it, she looks conflicted \"I don't know. I mean, I'm still looking for a good man who I can settle down with and if i gain nearly 400 pounds that'll never happen. Plus, no offence, i'll be a freak, a laughing stock of town\"<br>\r\nClint just smirks \"Edna, what town do we live in?\"<br>\r\n\"Springfield...why?\" she frowns<br>\r\n\"What is the fattest town in the fattest country in the world?\" Clint asks<br>\r\n\"...Springfield...\" she answers <br>\r\n\"So if there were one place in the entire world where being 450 pounds was not only socially acceptable but quite frankly, 'normal', where would that be?\" Clint says more dramatically now<br>\r\n\"Springfield!\" Edna says getting more excited thanks to Clint's pushing<br>\r\n\"Thats right! So how about it?\" he asks<br>\r\n\"yeah, alright. Lets do this!\" Edna grins<br>\r\n\"Atta girl\" he grins back and climbs off of his multiple bar stools \"then lets go to Krusty Burger, you've got a long way to go and Spring term starts in just a few months\"<br>\r\nEdna nods and gets up going with him, caught up in the hype he generated, eager and excited to reach 450 lbs and free herself from Springfield Elementary once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where to next?</span></div></div>",

Ms. Krabappel\u201d, Martin Prince announced proudly, hand raised in the air, \u201cI had reunited with my uncle after his 3 year service in the war.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother kid spoke up, \u201cMy parents were able to open up a business in making cheap officially licensed products.

See?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilhouse holds up a slip of paper that read, \u201cLeave a big tip or I\u2019ll grind you-a face into a fine cannoli.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMamamia!\u201d Bart gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll never taste the same again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCut to the Treehouse in the Simpson\u2019s backyard. Bart and Milhouse pace back and forth racking their heads together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to do something about Ms. Krabappel. If she keeps this up she\u2019ll hold the whole class back a grade. I was too close to that once and I\u2019m not letting anyone experience that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilhouse spins around wide-eyed, \u201cWait, Bart! Does this mean we\u2019re going to be the good guys this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands folded behind his back Bart stares out the window and onto the Springfield horizon, \u201cThis time my friend, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! Now I can earn a gold star at home. My mom will love me again and I\u2019ll finally get my puppy googoo back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, back to the plan. We need something to keep Ms. Krabappel permanently in a good mood so that everyone can get A\u2019s. Even nimrods like Nelson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilhouse rubbed his chin, \u201cHmm that sounds like a toughie. We could use the silly juice my dad drinks to keep him happy\u2026but it also makes him very loud and pukey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart peers out of the Treehouse door to see Homer grumbling angrily while holding a plate of uncooked lard slathered pork chops. Unfortunately he trips on a rock and smacks his face on the hot grill, \u201cYYAAAAAAAAAAAH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomer, face scalding, runs amuck until he again trips and lands on a pork chop mouth first taking a hearty bite, \u201cMmm, That soothes the burning.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! That\u2019s it! All Krabappel will need is just some delicious, fatty food to keep her happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, Bart. But, where would we find a constant supply of food like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave grunt that up to me gasp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving up to the Treehouse is Lindsey Naegle. Business woman. Realtor. Entrepreneur. Millionaire. She\u2019s looking a lot more plump than she normally does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re that lady that\u2019s in my mom\u2019s stupid book club. What happened to you? You look as bloated as my Gunter after child friendly Ocktoberfest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart\u2019s words were true, Lindsay formerly fit and the ideal female image was now\u2026obese. She sported a belly larger than Homer\u2019s with big moldable love handles sitting on top of her widened hips. Her breasts, expanded to D cups, rested on her rotund belly and strained her ever shrinking bra. Lindsay wiped her brow with her meaty arms and used them to adjust her too short skirt. Not to mention her thighs which have grown tremendously thicker and gave an obvious sign that Lindsay\u2019s butt had grown tremendously as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell young man. I was taking my \u2018pain-in-the-heart\u2019 walk through the neighborhood I couldn\u2019t help, but to overhear your conversation\u201d. She flashed a chubby grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout feeding our teacher food?\u201d, Bart crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy ears are ringing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could you possibly help us?\u201d Milhouse inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as you couldn\u2019t tell by my \u201cfuller\u201d physique, I\u2019ve been addicted to a little substance called Cream of Lard. Seem familiar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarn alternate continuities. Anyhow, I need to get this splendid product on the market and I figured we could collaborate by pushing it onto your teacher. Then it will snowball to the whole faculty then who knows elsewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell. As long as Ms. K gets fat then what could be the harm? Looks like we have a deal, Lindsay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Meet me at the school at 6 AM sharp.\u201d Lindsay turned to leave to reveal that the entire back of her sport coat had ripped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMilhouse.

Spreading from Krabappel\u2019s classroom to the entire school, then to the children\u2019s parents, and finally to the rest of Springfield. Not one soul had been saved from gaining weight.

Bart was at least able to be proud that grades were going up across the board, due to teachers not carrying anymore and giving A\u2019s to everyone. Many teachers had even taken up Krabappel\u2019s policy of giving students can\u2019s of Cream of Lard with every test given back. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite Bart\u2019s pleasure with the good grades, he didn\u2019t know how he felt about his new body, and he wanted to do something about it.

By modern Springfield standards, Lindsey was a twig, being 100 pounds lighter and a few inches taller than the blubbery Edna. How long Lindsey\u2019s lithe frame would last however, was up for debate. When Edna saw her, she was riding a motorized scooter, complete with a cup holder and tv, just to make the rider\u2019s life even easier. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dSorry about that, Lindsey!\u201d said Edna, giving a rare apology, \u201cDidn\u2019t see you there!\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201dIt\u2019s alright, Edna!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Springfield has always had a history of taking things to the extreme, and the Cream of Kard craze was no exception. They had gone so far off into the path of obesity, they had officially been crowned the fattest town in America, the first time Springfield had ever one ANYTHING. Obesity was the new norm, and it was even coveted by some.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Springfield was a fat fetishist\u2019s playground. Scooters crowded the sidewalks and belches and the sound of ripping jeans were all too common. In particular, one Laura Powers was rather adversely affected. How was it possible for one to get so fat so fast? It wasn\u2019t actually that hard, once she started spending her time baby sitting being waited hand and foot by her ward.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bart Simpson, as it turns out, was one of the Aforementioned fat fetishist, a feeder to be more specific. The boy who had at first despised his new world now thrived in, using his prankster energy to increase girth in all whom he could.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Laura was an easy target for Bart. She was young and impressionable, and had just gone through another break up with Jimbo. For the love of chub, Bart was able to set his ADD addled mind into hyper speed, focused solely on Laura. Laura had already been putting on weight, just like everyone else, (in fact Jimbo broke up with her because she was too fat!) but Bart made sure she was just getting started.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He would cook meals for her every night, always adding a little cream of Lard to everything, He it soup, burgers, or fried butter. Laura took quite well to the new diet and never suspected a thing. Her stomach was quick to outgrow her shirt but she didn\u2019t care, she was more preoccupied on getting her jacket to fit. Her arms were fat and soft, with wings large enough to take flight, and it was a struggle just to raise them into her jacket\u2019s sleeves. Even once she had gotten her arms in, she still had to worry about it resting comfortably on her ever enlarging boobs. Her breasts had always been large but they had grown even more significant and hypnoticly swayed to the heavy blow of her breathing. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her fitness was most certainly not helped by her lethargy, which she had developed with Bart\u2019s help. When at the Simpson\u2019s residence, she never took a step. Bart would never leave her in a situation where she had to. She just laid on the couch, ready to be fattened up like a prized hog. As soon as the rest of the family would leave, she would relax her attire, removing her pants which constricted her Lucius and pillowy booty in its tight clutches. She would sit there in only a food stained tank top, helplessly in the thrall of Cream of Fat cuisine, much like the other residents of Springfield.</span></div></div>",

It's time for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she prepared her plain meal of egg whites and low-carb, low-calorie slices of toasted wheat thins, in her mid-end apartment. She reflected upon the reason why she had put on a whopping thirty pounds within the last two months, \"Sure, it's a few slip ups of ordering an extra large pizza leading to guzzling down bottles of wine and soda, but once I found that stupid bakery, Top Muffins, BAM! I grew a muffin top!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat from the stovetop began to diminish once Edna extinguished the flame. She began picking away at the tasteless breakfast that dreaded cookbook offered. Y'know. The ones that offered simple, tasty, yet somehow low-calorie meal preparations, that fail to keep her full after an hour of eating them, \"Well, they ain't cheap or tasty. I oughta sue for false advertising!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the purchase, Edna's found her grocery bill to quadruple in the usual amount. Turns out that fresh broccoli, salmon, and fat burning pills are more expensive than pre-packaged baked goods and meals from Krusty Burger. The elementary teacher sighed and looked at the book once more. A more than likely photoshopped picture of a happy, healthy, smiling woman looks back, \"This is one hell of a pickle. On one hand, if I actually gather up the small shred of willpower that I have, I could actually shed this fat, but I'll probably be bankrupt by then! I mean, I could drop this and eat the way I used to,\" the thought of her being eighty pounds over weight entered her head. She thought of having to squeeze through doors, not fitting into her wardrobe, and worst of all, being an object of ridicule to her peers, especially to the class she teaches. \"Hey, Mrs. Kra-druple bypass. Ahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you, Bart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna shook her head. Well, this was the moment. The moment in which she decides to either use her small amount of willpower to lose weight while being broke or tip the scales and live comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....\"</span></div></div>",

She was so embarrassed and humiliated, she had felt a connection to Homer one that she hadn't felt with anyone else. They were like two halves of the same coin, and yet he was such a good man that he stuck with his wife whom he loved and the family he raised. (You can tell this episode was from one of the early seasons, since modern day home would never be called a 'good man'.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of this humiliation and rejection she found comfort in booze.  It numbed the pain and kept her from thinking about it.<br>\r\nDay after day she would arrive to work late, in a mess, and would either be drunk or hung over.<br>\r\nShe made mistakes, far too many. And every time she saw Homer around the Power Plant she would only drink more until it was finally too much and she was fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she has stayed at home since then. Drinking and eating her worries away. She doesn't really know how much time passed like this, nor how much she was letting herself go, until she got a horrible shock. A final warning notice from the bank, they were going to take her house away for not paying her mortgage for months.<br>\r\n\"what the...how long has it been?\" she mumbles and wades though all the junk covering the house. She opens the blinds on the windows and cringes at the bright light of the sun. She hadn't gone outside in quite some time, the light was unpleasant. <br>\r\nShe turns on the tv and checks the date and nearly falls back when it dawns on her just how much time had passed since she was last sober. This was the wake up call she needed as she goes around the house opening all the curtains and blinds and windows.<br>\r\nShe gets herself washed up, fixes her hair for the first time in what felt like for ages and gets her house tidied up. It feels refreshing to clear all the trash and get everything clean. Like she is letting go of her misery and past and getting ready for a new future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly problem was there was some things that she couldn't just get rid of. Mindy had put on a decent amount of weight during her months of depression, she wasn't 'fat' but wasn't the slim yet curvaceous woman she had been before moving to Springfield. She had put on about 20 lbs, and whilst it wasn't a huge amount it was noticeable as it made her hips wider, her rear plumper and her breasts larger. She was actually quite lucky, her voluptuous figure had absorbed much of the damage and so if anything it had made her sexier than ever.<br>\r\n\"hmm, not bad\" she says standing before a mirror in her too tight bra and panties \"bigger than I was, but I think I can make this work until i manage to lose it again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets herself dressed and gets ready to hit the town. She needs to find herself a job as soon as possible to keep her house and she needs to make herself look as good as possible. No job is too low, she just needs something to get back on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat job does Mindy get?</span></div></div>",

The job is pretty straight forwards, passing him tools, running simple errands for him, nothing befitting a woman with her qualifications. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day as she is cleaning up whilst drinking she puts her beer bottle down among a collection of bottles as her phone starts to ring. She answers but it is just junk mail so she hangs up. Sighing she reaches over to grab her beer without looking and instead accidentally grabs an identical shaped bottle with a strange purple liquid inside. She downs the entire drink in one go before realizing that wasn't her beer. \"Doh!\" she remarks \"I can't get fired from ANOTHER job\" she says, fretting. She looks around for some way to cover her mistake, fretting more about getting in trouble than about the strange substance she just consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is able to cover it up by mixing food dye with her beer and putting it in the place before quickly rushing home, making some excuse that she was ill or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gets outside her stomach starts growling angrily and she doubles over in pain. She is so hungry! She has never felt hunger like this before in her entire life.<br>\r\nUnable to think about anything but food she jumps onto her motorcycle and rushes straight to Krusty burger, a place that she knew would have plenty of food immediately to hand. No waiting around required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushes inside and orders and obscene amount of food, demanding they bring every bit to her the moment it arrives, immediately devouring every food item the second it is brought to her.

She is almost as big as Mindy, though she wasn't trying to gain she was already half way there and has a weakness around food, especially when her friends are indulging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuann is the smallest of the three, she started pretty much as slim as Mindy and wasn't trying to gain weight, but she got caught up in the moment just like Sarah did and found herself getting bigger as well. To her dismay much of her weight amassed in her lower half, her hips grew wider, her butt rounder, her thighs squished together, she is a definite pear shape. Her belly has softened up as well, largely from proximity, but unlike the other two her breasts haven't really grown at all, which is perhaps a little depressing for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has taken weeks and months of effort, but finally Mindy had done it, she has finally reached 300 pounds and now all her dreams will come true.<br>\r\nSo what happens next?</span></div></div>",

A couple of more pounds and my dream comes true: working at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCut to Clancy and Sarah's bedroom at their home. Both are laying on the bed while Sarah reading a<br>\r\nbook. Clancy couldn\u2019t help but notice something different about his wife\u2019s weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClancy: Erm, sweetheart?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah: Yes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClancy: Umm...there's something I've been meaning to ask you. Did you put on a little weight this week?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah: Well, (nervous laugh) I was going to surprise you, but what the heck: honey, You see....this woman named Mindy Simmons, is purposely gaining pounds to get on disability. But as a result, her enthusiasm and my curiosity led to me gaining some as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClancy: Heh......never knew you were into food that much. I would love you if you weighed 400 pounds, and --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah: Aaaww, that\u2019s nice. Good night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they both went to sleep. Later cut to Mindy and Luann at the former\u2019s place in the living room, before Mindy goes to work. Mindy is weighing herself. Oddly enough, Luann also gained weight despite not being her goal from the start and rather as a sudden eating habit, thanks to Mindy. Now she was around 250 to 265 pounds. Larger than last time, but not as large as Mindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy: Oh, I've got 45 minutes to gain a pound or I have to face another day at work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuann: Bad news. We're out of food. We're even out of the basic elements of food. You ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy: I need a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuann then remembers she bought two squishees from the Kwik-E-Mart. One for Mindy and one for herself. She hands a squishee to Mindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy: Aw, but will it help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuann: [goading] Yo-ho...its says \u201dhigh calories\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy: [drinks it] Well, that's a plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy drinks it and weighs herself again. (Just over 335 lbs.) Woo woohoohahoo!, I did it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuann : Uh, your stomach\u2019s on the towel rack.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMindy removes her blubber from it.

She dropped her head into her hands, dreading the feeling she was overcome with. Despite the strong front she put on, she still felt hurt from her divorce, even despite how oafish her former husband was. It hit her especially hard nowadays with her daughter Laura gone and little to no future prospects because of her time spent in prison. A soft dribbling noise caused her to look up through her fingers. In front of her rested the bags from Krusty Burger, grease starting to drip through the bags. She also felt a small amount of disgust at the food she had been eating, but she had taken to eating far more food recently, and it helped dull the pain she felt, as did the copious amounts of alcohol that she tended to drink. With a groan, she forced herself to tear into the first bag, feeling the greasy mess squishing first in her fingers, and then in her mouth as she glutted herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large amounts of fattening food and alcohol, as well as the lack of activity conspired against her. She knew that she had been putting on some weight, but she couldn\u2019t build up the willpower to deal with it, nor any real feelings against her expanding body. After her stint with the steroids, she had actually started to dislike the sharp angles and muscular bulges of her body. The new layer of fat settling across her form helped soften all of that, and each time she looked in the mirror, she had to actually admit that she didn\u2019t actively dislike her new growing appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking open another can of Duff, she washed down another Krusty Burger, and another, feeling the now familiar ache of her stomach being pushed to its limits, as well as the haze of the beer flooding her mind. Both helped push her emotional pain aside again for a time. Grabbing the last burger, she pushed back from the table, wobbling slightly as she walked through her house. Shoving the last of the meaty fatty mess into her mouth, she teetered towards the bathroom, a sudden urge to check her weight poking through the fog wrapping her mind. It took her several tries to actually stand on the scale long enough, as well as looking down at the little dial, but she finally made it, taking another short while to comprehend what the numbers were telling her.</span></div></div>",

Or fifty one actually with the way the needle was resting. Sure some of it could be ascribed to the food and beer churning away within her gut, but not all of it. Looking up in the mirror, she couldn\u2019t even begin to think how she had missed all of the weight she had gained. She knew that she had gained some weight, but not nearly all of this. Her bust looked several sizes larger, a crescent of soft yellow stomach flesh now peeked out from under the edge of her shirt, and even her hips had broadened out and strained her pants. Seeing this didn\u2019t stir up any feelings of disgust or anything against her widening body, there was actually a small kernel of contentment that was buried deep within, but it still presented itself. Turning away from the mirror, she quickly stripped, feeling the softness giving as she pressed around her body. A quick shower later, and she dried herself off on the way to bed. As she drifted off to sleep, she found that she couldn\u2019t stop her hands from idling stroking and grabbing the layer of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Ruth felt a bit better, at least till she remembered everything as usual. With a depressed sigh, she got ready for another day. Her job wasn\u2019t great, and the money was even worse, but at least it helped keep her afloat for now. She still looked for a better job whenever she could, but it seemed like so many buildings in Springfield seemed empty most times or weren\u2019t in the same place twice. After finishing work for the day, Ruth found herself walking along, and before long she found herself outside of Moe\u2019s Tavern. The thought of a cold Duff or three was tempting, as was the idea of sitting around with other boozehounds who were as depressed as she was. She also thought about just heading home, and waiting for tomorrow to do it all over again. Then a third option poked into her mind: she could head over to the Simpson\u2019s house and check in with Marge, it had been a while since their run in together when she convinced Marge to take steroids as well.</span></div></div>",

Yet another day spent with various drunks and other malcontents leering at her body all day and night. At first, it had been kind of a joy to get all of the attention, as she had wanted when she got into the business, but it had started to become too much of a chore recently, especially after that one follower who had been following her \u2013 Impson or some such was his name, she thought \u2013 had given a heartfelt speech about not treating woman as just objects. There had to be a way to stop attracting so much attention, but with her body it was next to impossible not to attract attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan she stormed away from the door, dropping the bag from the Kwik-E-Mart on the counter. Her careless placement caused the bag to tumble over, the contents spilling out across the floor. With a deeper groan, she turned back and started picking everything up. She dropped everything when she came across the magazine she had grabbed while trying to hide her face. She hadn\u2019t even seen or read anything in the magazine, but the cover caught her eye now. The cover showed Sara Sloane, the famous actress, in an unflattering photo after obviously gaining quite a bit of weight. The article inside had a few more shots of the actress, each showing her a bit larger than the last, and hinted about how a bad relationship breakup had ended up the woman gaining quite a bit of weight. There were also hints about how her popularity as an actress had fallen quite a bit; creating a cycle that caused her weight to continue to soar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShawna looked up from the magazine, then back down over her pert bust. A wild thought crossed her mind, and despite all efforts, the thought wouldn\u2019t go away. Then she imagined her body swelling with pound over pound of fat, her thin frame buried and hidden away within a blubbery and bloated guise. She shook her head to try and dispel the thought, and tossed the magazine away so that it landed so that she couldn\u2019t see that cover image. Picking up the rest of the fallen items, she went about her business. Each time she let her mind wander though, the image of her fat swollen body kept rising to the surface, and each time the thought seemed more and more like the solution to her problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she dashed back into the living room, snatching up the discarded magazine and flipping through the photos of the fattened actress. Letting the magazine flop into her lap, she tried to wrap her mind around what she was thinking: did she really want to risk everything and purposefully put on weight to get some peace? She came to the conclusion that yes, she did. Plus, she had quite a little nest egg stored up \u2013 especially with some of the compromising situations that some influential people paid big bucks to keep quiet \u2013 so she could always change back when or if she decided to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question that remained to her was how, how was she going to get fat? There was always the old fashioned way of just eating as much as she could; she had always been careful to watch what she ate, and had sometimes thought about being able to eat just a bit more, and this would be her chance. That way might not be fast enough though, and she wanted to be rid of her fame as fast as possible. Another possibility drifted to the forefront: that Homer Impson fellow, he certainly looked like he knew a thing or two about putting on weight, maybe he could teach her something. Shawna had a third idea when her gaze settled on the observatory on a hill outside of Springfield: Professor Frink, the odd little man had never bothered her as much as others, so she didn\u2019t have much of a problem with him, and maybe she could \u201cconvince\u201d him to help her out with her new plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, which one should she choose, which one, she thought again and again as she tapped a finger on her lips.</span></div></div>",
