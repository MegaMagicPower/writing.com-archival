You've got all four of your monsters, plus your cannon, and the two traps you got from your teammate.

Even on the brink of defeat, Ren continues to give what little struggle he can. Misaki's certainly seen better duels.\" The announcer says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, but not good enough. I play the speed spell Wattcare. Now since I have two or more speed counters, I can sacrifice one to use this card's effect. I'm allowed to destroy one thunder monster on my field and regain life points equal to it's attack.

It was getting near the end of when lunch should be while you were out there, so you were both quite relieved to spot a burger cart near the lake. You pulled as close to shore as the boat allowed and asked the man if he could serve you real quick. He agreed and brought you both burgers, which you paid for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now nearing 3:00 PM as you pulled the boat up to the dock of the rental place. \"I'm gonna get this thing back on land over there. Mind going to give the guy the rental ticket saying we brought it back?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" She replies before stepping onto the dock and letting you row a good distance away to the nearest river bank. You pull the thing ashore before stopping to see where you had to take it. You see the other rentals nearby the shop and prepare to bring it over, however, something caught your eye while you were looking at the boat shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see some guy standing there with his hand against the wall, as if cutting off the escape of whoever he was talking to. You can't see who exactly he's cornered at first, but one sight of a familiar red hairstyle told you all you needed to know as you leave the boat behind to head over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey baby. What's a pretty little thing like you doing all alone in a place like this?\" You hear the guy say as you get near. Most guys would hear this and rush over in a jealous fit. But you know Akiza well enough to be certain she can handle this without you rushing in like a meathead. You can get involved when the time was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm with someone.\" Akiza replies, trying to look for a peaceful exit, but still showing no care for what this guy is offering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Well I don't see him.\" The guy retorts. \"I think you're just playing hard to get.\" He says while leaning in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had him meet with Akiza's fist in his gut, causing him to double back in pain towards you. \"And I think I said I'm with someone.\" She repeats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy stumbled back a bit before bumping into you, where you grab him by the shirt collar and spin him around to face you. \"That would be me.\" You tell him before you toss him to the side into the lake, where he was now sitting in the water, soaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both apologize to the owner for any possible trouble as you drag the boat back to the others before walking off. \"You okay?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. That guy was a creep, but he was all talk.\" She replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was half expecting you to skip him across the lake like a stone with your powers.\" You admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I considered it.\" She reveals. \"But then I remembered some wise words telling me that doing that only gives the haters what they want.\" She hints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...

Once she has you there, she wastes no time stroking your head as you both stare into the darkening sky. You see other park goers soon gather around your spot and looking up into the sky like you. Soon, the sun set over the horizon, and the show began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a spectacle, to be sure. You'd never really seen fireworks this close up before.

They were so cool, and everyone agreed as they all 'oooed' and 'aahhhed' with you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy in charge of this was certainly a fan of recent events. He had displays that showed several familiar dragons. Stardust, Red Dragon Archfiend, Black Rose, and of course, Blue-Eyes. Perhaps this guy was a big fan of the Fortune Cup last year?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour suspicions were confirmed come the finale, where it showed Stardust and Red Dragon Archfiend going head to head. Then, an eruption of fireworks shot up, exploding into the shape of the Crimson Dragon like it did that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the flares died down and the show was over, the crowd began to disperse. \"That was fun.\" You say as you get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" Akiza replies as she stands up with you. \"We should get back soon.

Hook the Hidden Knight's effect will save him once more.\" Hermann speaks up. \"And you know what happens when he switches to defense mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHtHK: 0000 DEF<br>\r\nQoT: 1800 DEF<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light emitted from Hook once more, and once more, Akiza notices the shadow hook coming for her rear wheel. This time, though, Akiza didn't bother with just a simple swerve. No, she went as far away as possible, causing the hook to try and extend, revealing itself as a shadowy version of Hook the Hidden Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" You say in awe as you finally get a good look at what she's been dodging this whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of here. You won't make me crash again.\" Akiza yells at it as it retreats back into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza: 300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now Hook the Hidden Knight is wide open. Go Splendid Rose, attack.\" She calls out as her other monster finally destroy's the knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A brilliant move by Akiza. Unfortunately, Hermann is still standing, and with her life points so low, can she make it to the next turn to end it?\" The announcer asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to with Splendid Rose's special ability. Now by removing from play one plant-type monster in my graveyard, she can attack again with half the power, but that's still enough for me to win this.\" She reveals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So by removing from play Copy Plant, Splendid Rose can attack again with half her attack points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSR: 1100 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Splendid Rose, attack Hermann directly.\" She yells as her monster finally puts an end to Hermann.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermann: 0000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since my turn is done, Splendid Rose's attack points return to normal.\" She finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSR: 2200 ATK</span></div></div>",

Since he was taken down, it now activates, letting me regain control of one monster of mine that's on your side of the field. With this monster back, I'm back too and more dangerous than ever. Stardust Dragon, come home.\" Yusei says as his monster is fished free from the Meklord Emperor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSD: 2500 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back to team good guy Stardust. And because Stardust has switched teams, Meklord Emperor's attack points now decrease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMEW: 3000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Yusei might pull off a win.\" You say as you watch him revive a tuner monster and end his turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So even getting Stardust back, you still couldn't mount an attack.\" The man gloats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone's depending on us Stardust.\" Yusei says as his beast roars as if agreeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you're all bark and no bite. Now my Meklord Emperor is quite a different story.\" The man brags as his monster whips up a storm. \"Everyone hold on tight.\" Ren says as you all brace yourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see the duel still going, but you can't make out what they're saying through the winds. What you do know is that you can see this Melord Emperor thing about to steal Yusei's Stardust again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" You say. \"He needs to do something or he's done for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not getting Stardust this time.\" Yusei says as he revs his engine.

Level two synchro tuner Formula Synchron tune with level eight synchro monster Stardust Dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, you're synchro summoning during my turn, but how?\" The man questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some things defy explanation. But the one thing that won't be defied again is my attempt at creating the ultimate monster. My attempt... to Accel Synchro!!!\" Yusei yells as you can see slipstreams form around him before the synchro rings surround him and his monsters. Then, he reappeared, now with a new monster. \"Behold, the Shooting Star Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSSD: 3300 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck did he just do?\" Ren asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but that looks like one strong monster.\" You say as you watch Yusei negate his monster's destruction and the man's attack all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now activate another of Shooting Star Dragon's abilities. An ability that allows me to take a peek at the top five cards of my deck to see how many tuner monsters there are, and then attack that many of your monsters.\" Yusei reveals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.\" You all awe as one by one, Yusei was able to draw five tuner monsters all together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Stardust, attack Meklord Emperor Wisel!\" He orders as his new monster attacks the mechanical menace five times in a row, leading to Yusei's win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: 0000</span></div></div>",

You see, there is a balance in this world between the good and the wicked. We are here to tip the balance to us and lead the future to the path we offer to all.\u201d Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy having Primo over there destroying our city?\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was part of the plan since he was the one that used your program to create his Ghost army and boy did it end bad.\u201d Lester said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it was him that had Lazar took his program.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBingo.

But we have found a solution to this problem.\u201d Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDestroy New Domino City.\u201d Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy destroying this city, we destroy the source of the effects.\u201d Lester said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat won\u2019t happen because you\u2019ll fail just like Primo did.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have it all wrong, Yuten Anjiou.

An earthquake then happened and you all see a giant golden brown robot that could mean one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBehold, Meklord Emperor Granel!\u201d Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then got the vision of the Emperors playing in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s.... the final Meklord Emperor.\u201d You figured out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you had a glimps of the might of their power. Though, if you want to stop us, duel us at the World Racing Grand Prix.\u201d Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTill then, bye.\u201d Lester said before creating a portal and left and Granel vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis just left you with more questions than answers.

Then, when I unlocked the power of Accel Synchro, the card took form into what you see now.\" He explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou search through your deck as well. Sure enough, where you once kept that blank fusion card, now sat your new Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon. \"Same here. I kept hearing about how I needed to unlock the next level of my dragons' power, but I wasn't sure how until those duel bots had me cornered. That's when I heard the voice of my dragon loud and clear.

Your runner was closest so you all gathered around to see what it said. \"Due to damages to the city and dueling infrastructure, the World Racing Grand Prix primary bracket first round has been postponed.\" You read aloud. \"Looks like our showdown with Illiaster will have to wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nods in agreement. \"Then let's not be idle. Everyone, use this time wisely to improve yourselves.\" Jack says as he gets back to his runner. \"We'll need it for our battle with these guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right.\" Yusei says as he and Crow mount their runners too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Yuten?\" Jack asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Jack?\" You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember that you still owe me a duel.

As expected, when you flipped through the channels, station after station was talking about it. Duel bots taking to the streets, making duelists crash and destroying the city, what else could people possibly be talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, there was one other topic on the media's lips. One station you flicked on was discussing a group of psychic duelists that had taken to the streets during the attack. You leave it on as Akiza sat up to see what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were showing footage of one of your members blasting a duel bot off the road, where it crashed into a wall. Then, the anchors began to talk. \"I think that clip says it all right there. These people, if you want to call them that, went out into the streets to cause even more chaos. They saw a city in turmoil and thought it would be fun to go out and add more.\" The one guy says. \"And where was their illustrious leader Yuten Anjiou? At the WRGP, where his brother and fellow psychic Ren destroyed and almost killed one of their opponents. These people are dangerous and we need to accept that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your anger boiling at this guy. He took just about every fact and ignored it so he could flip the story against you. You didn't even need to look back to Akiza to know she felt the same as you. You were tempted to turn off the t.v. right there if his co-host didn't start to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you possibly say that?\" She asks him. \"Do you even know where that footage is from? It was sent to us by a mother and daughter who were saved by that young duelist. After destroying that bot, he then led the two back to the safety of their own home, risking his life to do so. Does that sound like someone trying to cause chaos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, one good egg doesn't mean the rest aren't rotten.\" He responds. \"His actions don't justify everyone else, or what Yuten and his team did to Team Catastrophe during their match yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" The co-host asks. \"Because we have plenty of other clips sent to us by people that were on the street that day reporting that they were rescued by these duelists. So you can hardly call this one good egg. And as for what happened with Team Catastrophe, if you were paying attention it was Nicolas' own card that destroyed his runner. Yuten and the others had no involvement in that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was flustered, and both of you were happy. \"Well... I... uuuhhh.\" He stutters, trying to find some way out. He then made a motion to the camera to cut the feed, and \"conveniently\", the station experienced technical difficulties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like we at least have support now.\" You say as you lay back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it also looks like we still have some work to do if people like that guy still don't trust us.\" Akiza replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy's an asshole. I doubt we'll ever change his mind. For now, we have supporters, that's all we need.\" You tell her before hearing a frantic knock at your door. \"Who's this now?\"</span></div></div>",

Would you mind at least taking off your shirt so I have more body to watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I go into the Spirit World as I am out here, and it would be pretty awkward if I showed up there shirtless.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, go ahead.\" She says with a mock pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I'll be back soon.\" You say as you begin to focus. Soon enough, you were back in the Mausoleum of White, with Otes sitting alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Yuten. Good to see you again.\" He says as he rises to put a hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same sir.\" You reply. \"How is everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hamod and Kisara are currently studying in the library. Nama is tending to her garden behind the mausoleum. Tema is, well...\" He trails off before motioning you to follow him. He takes you outside to show you Tema training at twice the speed you've seen him do before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he saw you, though, he immediately stopped and rushed over and threw himself to the ground before you. \"I am so sorry my champion. Please, forgive me.\" He begs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" You ask. \"You didn't do anything wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have done wrong. I failed you. You summoned me to battle your enemies and I could not. I could not best the one with the sword, and then I was bested by mere lackeys. I am unfit to call myself a protector.\" He rants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you piece together that he's talking about last night. \"Hey, it's alright man, honest. You helped us out big time. Me and my friends might not even be here right now if it weren't for you.\" You tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed my son. Take heart knowing that you fought your hardest, buying enough time for Yuten to unlock the next evolution of the dragons.\" Otes says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he heard this, Tema quickly rose. \"Truly father?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Our clan's power has now grown even greater thanks to you and Yuten's efforts.\" Otes says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is glorious news to hear.\" Tema cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you know about that?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I not the master of this clan?\" He asks with a sly smirk. \"I sensed right away when you unlocked the new beast. But, I do not know the details. Please, tell me everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, champion. Me as well. I must know what happened after I lost.\" Tema asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell both of them everything that happened. The duel bots, the emperors' warning, and especially your new dragon. \"And that's everything.\" You say, wrapping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. This is indeed troubling.\" Otes says as he runs a hand through his beard. \"Just what do this lot have planned for the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But father, Yuten unlocked the next evolution of the dragons, does that not mean we are safe?\" Tema asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes. Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon. It sounds like a powerful beast, but whether it can win alone is still to be decided.\" Otes replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he won't be alone, and neither will I.\" You speak up. \"I've got my teammates by my side, and together, we'll win this and stop them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admire your confidence, champion. Let us hope you are right.\" Otes says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Before you could change it, you hear something that caught your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings to all of our viewers today. Today\u2019s story, young famous model, Misty Tredwell, was in a furious mood when she discovered on her latest magazine where they\u2019re were comments about her relationship with a psychic duelist. Not just any psychic duelist, but the brother of the Arcadia Movement leader, Yuten, who goes by the name of Ren Anjiou. We now go live to Angela Raines to talk to them about this matter.\u201d The newsman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much. I\u2019m standing here with the couple at this moment.\u201d Angela said before turning to Misty and Ren. \u201cSo, you must be infuriated after reading what was on the magazine. How do you respond to that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you how. Just because they have some psychic powers, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re all bad. Sure, he can be an idiot every now and then, but he\u2019s anything but a terrible person. In fact, he\u2019s the reason I\u2019m reunited with my long lost brother, Toby, who also happens to be a psychic.\u201d Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that correct?\u201d Angela wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet it is. Toby was one of the missing people that took very long to find where he was. If Ren here didn\u2019t find the place Toby was being held at, I would still never be able to see him again. For that, I owe him more than I could think of.\u201d Misty said holding Ren\u2019s hand tightly. \u201cIn fact, may I borrow your mic real quick?\u201d Misty asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Angela said before giving the mic to Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToby, if you\u2019re watching this, just remember that your big sister loves you so much. I don\u2019t care about the abilities you have. All that matters is that you\u2019re family. Nothing more and nothing less.\u201d Misty said before turning to Ren. \u201cAnd Ren? You finding my brother made you my hero. That\u2019s why I love you so much. You\u2019re protective of others and very very caring of them too. Remember that I will love you to the ends of the earth.\u201d Misty said to your brother\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, baby. I know.\u201d Ren said before Misty gives Angela the mic back and kissed him on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat right there was a touching moment. You smiled on while Akiza was too but with a tear going down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Mr. Ren? You and your team are still in the WRGP tournament once the rebuilding is done. How do you feel about the opponent you might be facing?\u201d Angela asks him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I can say is that I hope for the best to anyone we face and we put on a great duel.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd one more thing, do you feel the same as what Misty feels right now?\u201d Angela asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Just because they\u2019re different from the rest of society, does not mean that you should go and judge them. My advice, get to know them and try to feel some compassion a little. You may never know what surprises you might find.\u201d Ren said to the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much. We\u2019ll see you soon. For now, back to the studio.\u201d Angela said before you turned the tv off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was so touching with what Misty just said.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure was. And I agree with Ren said too. He makes perfect sense on that statement he made.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf they\u2019ve just shown that much love like that, I have a feeling that you\u2019ll no doubt be getting a new sister-in-law soon.\u201d Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s ironic when she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now what happens?</span></div></div>",

In the vision, the queen had a pet dragon by her side, one she loved more than anything else in the world. Then, darkness spread over the queen's kingdom. Her dragon rushed out to battle the darkness, but soon found itself outmatched and facing destruction. The queen ran out, weapon in hand to protect the beast and... the vision ended.\" She wraps up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you got all that just from looking into her eyes?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't explain it myself, perhaps it is her signer powers mixed with my fortune telling abilities, I don't know.

Before, we could barely afford mine and Ren's runners. How did you get so many for the students to use the other night?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can thank Miss Tredwell for that. When she agreed to sponsor us in the tournament, a lot of extra funds came our way. I was able to put together a few more runners for the students after that.\" He explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was nice of her.\" Akiza says as she sits down on her runner once more. \"You ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it.\" You reply as you rev up your own engine as you both pull out of the garage and into the streets.

Even with everyone working night and day to fix it, it was still far from all fixed like her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you pull up in front of her parents' house, where she wastes no time running up to the door and ringing the bell, with you coming up from behind.

Too tight.\" Akiza says as her parents begin to squeeze too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Her dad says as they release her. \"We were just so happy to see that you aren't hurt any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I took good care of her.\" You say as you remind them you were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you did.\" Her mother says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how's things going with the reconstruction?\" You ask her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's slow, but we're making progress. We just finished fixing the main highway out of the city last night, as well as the Daedalus Bridge connecting us to the Satellite. Now we're working on restoring the main roads and duel lanes so the tournament can resume.\" He explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you guys be more focused on making sure people can live their lives like normal again before caring about some tournament?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it will take some time to repair everything. In the meantime, though, this competition gets peoples' spirits up as it takes their attention away from the gloomy state of things outside. It's not perfect, but it's what we have.\" He answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" You muse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should go. You're busy and we still have to talk to a few other people.\" Akiza says as she starts walking back to the bikes. \"Goodbye.\" She yells back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave her parents goodbye as you pull away. \"Okay Akiza, who next?\" You ask.</span></div></div>",

I see you\u2019re up and about again, Akiza.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better believe it.\u201d Akiza said as Yusei let you two in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Hey Hey.

We wouldn\u2019t want that injury be a problem coming into the next part of the tournament.\u201d Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can say that again, Jack.\u201d You said before turning to Yusei. \u201cSo, Yusei? You found anything about those emperors from the other day?\u201d You asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. It seems these guys are good at keeping themselves secret from the public. And until we can get some kind of proof or a lead, Trudge can\u2019t do a investigation. That means we might be on our own.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBummer.\u201d You sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as long as we keep our heads up and believe hard enough, we can put these guys in their place.\u201d Akiza said with passion and you and the boys nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we should head out now. There\u2019s still people she wants to see.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Jack? See you at the finals.\u201d You said as you let out your fist for him to bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better be there or else.\u201d Jack said as he fist bumped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both got on your runners and drove off to see Misty next.</span></div></div>",

Akiza's finally healed up from the crash and she's wanted to make a day of showing everyone she's alright.\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Akiza asks as she once more demonstrates her painless free movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful to hear.\" She says with a smile. \"Now let's see if you can stay on the bike in the next duel.\" She jokes, getting a laugh from both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by the way Misty.

When you said that all it took was getting those two to get along, I figured that's all it would take and then <b>bam</b>, new card.\" He admits. \"But with all the effort I've seen you and Akiza put into your cards, I see now that I might have a long way to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll figure it out soon.\" Misty says as she puts a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I hope so. Otherwise, who knows what could happen if I don't figure this out in time.\" He says as you all enter your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's next on the agenda?\" Misty asks. \"Shall we end tonight the same way we ended our last double date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not tonight Misty. With what happened last night, I don't think I have the energy for that. I wouldn't mind just relaxing on the couch.\" Akiza says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then. Shall we watch one of your collection, then?\" Misty asks her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice.\" Akiza admits. \"I'll go pick a movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll head into the kitchen to make some popcorn.\" Misty says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll call up Trudge now while we wait.\" You say as you head for the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. I got this bro. You go help Akiza decide on a movie.\" Ren says as he's already dialing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no other option, you decide to take his advice and head over to help Akiza choose. \"So what are our options?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking one of these three.\" She says, holding out three vastly different types of movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akiza, I don't think Ren's the kind of person that would be into a black and white noir film.\" You say as you put aside her first choice, one of the older movies in this little collection. \"And Misty hardly seems the type to enjoy superhero movies.\" You tell her as the second movie went back on the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this one? I feel like both of them can appreciate a good slasher movie.\" She suggests as she holds up the third and final one of her choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll work.\" You say as you take the box from her hand and go to get it set up while Akiza hunted for the remote. Soon enough, everything was ready and you were both sitting on the couch waiting for couple number two to finish up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Popcorn's ready.\" Misty says as she walks in with both the bag and a bowl full of popcorn. \"I figured we can split it in half between us rather than all fight over one bowl.\" She says as she hands you the bowl and takes her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys. Just got off the phone with Trudge.\" Ren says as he walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he say about the bot?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said that he'll send someone when he can, but right now everyone's focused on the reconstruction still. But that brings me to the good news. According to him, the WRGP will be back up and running in four more days.\" He announces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great to hear.\" Akiza cheers while Ren takes a seat next to Misty. \"Four more days and we'll be back to stopping those Emperor creeps from destroying our city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and that means I that starting tomorrow, I've got three days to try and figure out this card before what could very well be the final battle.\" Ren says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we watching.\" Misty says, quickly wanting to get Ren's mind off the subject of his card right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a feeling you guys are gonna love it.\" You say as you push the play button on the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Now since my life points are lower than yours, by removing from play two psychic-type monsters in my graveyard, I can draw two cards. So I'll remove Esper Girl and Serene Psychic Witch to draw two more cards. Then I'll activate the continuous spell, Future Glow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that do?\" Ren asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good question. With Future Glow, I can remove from play one psychic-type monster in my graveyard. Then, as long as this card stays on my field, any psychic-type monster on my field gains attack points equal to the removed monster's level multiplied by 200. So with this I'll remove from play Magical Android to give all other psychic-type monsters 1000 attack points.\" Sayer tells him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad you don't have any psychic monsters on your field.\" Ren reminds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait, because here's where the fun starts. I activate the Psychic Feel Zone spell card. Now since I have one psychic tuner and one psychic non-tuner removed from the game, by putting them back in the graveyard, I can special summon a psychic synchro monster who's level equals the total of the two monsters' levels.\" Sayer reveals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?!\" Ren questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can he do that?\" You ask Akiza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I've never seen this card before.\" She admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now I'll put Magical Android and Esper Girl back into my graveyard. And since their combined levels are seven, I can special summon a level seven synchro monster. So say hello to Psychic Lifetrancer.\" Sayer says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPL: 2400 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't forget, since Future Glow is on the field, she gains 1000 attack points thanks to Magical Android.\" He reminds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPL: 3400 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that means she's now stronger than Red-Eyes.\" You say in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. But first, her special ability lets me remove from play one psychic-type monster in my graveyard to gain 1200 life points. So I think I'll remove Magical Android once more.\" He says as he removes his card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayer: 6000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now it's like Red-Eyes never even hit him?\" Ren says in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's a shame, isn't it? Bet you wish baby bro Yuten just handed over the Movement when I asked, huh? Then none of this would be happening to you.\" Sayer taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance. My bro is gonna forge a new path for psychic duelists that you never even tried to see, and me and Akiza are gonna see him get there. Akiza as the shield that keeps him safe, and I'll be the sword that cuts the way through.\" Ren rants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How poetic. But right about now, I think you may want to wish for that shield right about now, because Psychic Lifetrancer is about to destroy your Red-Eyes. Attack!\" Sayer calls out as his monster throws two balls of energy at Ren's dragon, destroying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen: 5400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaahhhh!!\" Ren screams in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren!!\" You call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really think I wasn't going to hold back my powers on you? After what you did, I plan to hit you with the full force of my abilities as we go.

I now summon the tuner monster, Unknown Synchron.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUS: 0 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf this is what I think it is...\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better believe it, little bro. I tune Unknown Synchron with Red-Eyes Black Dragon. Time to meet an old friend, Sayer. I synchro summon, Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons!\u201d Ren said as he summons his ace dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBotDD: 3000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell well, you managed to get your best monster. But it\u2019ll do you no good.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me, Sayer. You of all people should know that. In case you forgotten, Beelze, attack Psychic Lifetrancer! Twin Plasma Cannon!\u201d Ren commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do know that my Lifetrancer is still stronger, right?\u201d Sayer reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen: 5000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. There\u2019s a reason for that attack. Not only is Beelze safe, but he also gains attack points equal to the damage I took.\u201d Ren said feeling a bit of a sting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBotDD: 3400 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it was just to make him stronger.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBingo. That\u2019s one of the main reasons why he\u2019s my best monster. The pain he feels makes him stronger just as I was stronger through every trial I\u2019ve been into.\u201d Ren said standing his ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Can you say that when you\u2019re rampaging?\u201d Sayer asked getting Ren\u2019s attention. \u201cWhen I discovered your inner power, you were known as a force that can\u2019t be stopped. A beast that can\u2019t be tamed. You let yourself into you anger and you could\u2019ve used it to help me with my goals of revenge against the non-psychics of the world. Instead, you choose to back down.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to be that kind of person. Thanks to Yuten and everyone else back home, I was able to take control of that power.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you?\u201d Sayer asked sinisterly while Ren growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. Back to the duel. I now activate the effect of Dark Nephthys from my hand. By removing two dark monsters from my graveyard from play, I can send it straight to the graveyard and then he can be special summoned to the field on my next turn. With that, my turn\u2019s done.\u201d Ren said feeling a bit peeved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think Sayer\u2019s getting under Ren\u2019s skin?\u201d Akiza wondered with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe. He needs to keep himself cool or else who knows what he\u2019ll do.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>I just wished I know why Sayer is always so evil.</i>\u201d You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>A very excellent question, my champion.</i>\u201d A voice said in your head, which is none other than your Blue-Eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Blue-Eyes? Where did you come from?</i>\u201d You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>I\u2019ve always been here with you, Yuten.</i>\u201d Blue-Eyes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Point taken. Any particular reason why Sayer always seemed such an evil douchebag?</i>\u201d You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Being outcasted and discriminated can reveal the worst of humanity. I believe something has caused Sayer to believe that the non-psychic humans should be eradicated.</i>\u201d Blue-Eyes suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>You mean like he snapped somehow?</i>\u201d You figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Perhaps. But no one really knows for sure.</i>\u201d Blue-Eyes said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ain\u2019t that the truth.</i>\u201d You said in your head as you looked on.</span></div></div>",

With all the power you possessed, you could\u2019ve been one of the most powerful psychics in the world. Instead, you chose to hold it all back. That makes you weak.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. It means I know what\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s right. At least I\u2019m able to see things more clearly rather than being blinded by desires of revenge.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a shameful one you are.\u201d Sayer said as he shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, are you here to duel or trying to get into my fucking head!?!\u201d Ren yelled seething again.</span></div></div>",

I know you two have issues with each other, but I need you both now more than ever. Please, work with me here.</i>\u201d Ren thought as something was happening to his deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Sayer wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the world?\u201d You wondered as well as Akiza looks confused herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ren drew the card that was glowing, he can see his chance. \u201cI play the spell, Dark Fortune.

If it\u2019s not, that card is removed from play and I must end my turn.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen: 1850<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very big risk you\u2019re playing at. You do know that if you fail on this draw, you\u2019ll fail in the duel too.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do know that. But, I\u2019m willing to take that chance. Here we go!\u201d Ren draws in fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe card was then revealed to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dark Creator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d You cheered with Akiza as Sayer was actually surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince my Dark Creator is a level eight monster. I can draw four cards.\u201d Ren draws his four cards and sees the hand he has now. \u201cWell, Sayer, this is the end.\u201d Ren said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really expect me to believe what you\u2019re saying? You don\u2019t have what you need to win and you know it.\u201d Sayer said denying your claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, time to make a believer out of you. First off, I\u2019ll play the face down that you locked down. Escape from the Dark Dimension. This will bring back one of my removed from play dark monsters. So come back home, Beelze.\u201d Ren said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBotDD: 3000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not impressed.\u201d Sayer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me finish. Now I\u2019ll play Monster Reborn to bring back my Red-Eyes Black Dragon from my graveyard.\u201d Ren said as his other best dragon comes back too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nREBD: 2400 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow for the icing on the cake, I play the spell, Polymerization. With this, I now fuse Beelze and Red-Eyes together.\u201d Ren said as his two dragons merged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fusion was happening, Ren was glowing purple during the entire event while you all looked to see what\u2019s happening. When it stopped, the fusion stopped, the purple aura quickly died down as Ren opened his eyes. His expressions shows that he wasn\u2019t violently angry. Instead, he was calm as his eyes were red looking at Sayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSayer, I present to you Red-Eyes Diabolic Dragon!\u201d Ren said as his new beast has the body of Beelze, but his two head resembles to that of Red-Eyes Black Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nREDD: 4000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the?\u201d Sayer said in absolute confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did it. My brother actually did it.\u201d You said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe really did.\u201d Akiza said too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet ready, Sayer. This new dragon is going to put you in your place.\u201d Ren said with defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease. He maybe stronger, but he only has four thousand attack points. Even if he destroys my Ultimate Axon Kicker, I\u2019ll only take one hundred points of damage.\u201d Sayer said not concern at all about Ren\u2019s new monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean not quite?\u201d Sayer wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean that he\u2019s going to finish you off this turn. With his effect, he can destroy one of your monsters and deal you half of it\u2019s attack points as damage.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you forgotten about something? My Axon Kicker can\u2019t be destroyed by your card effects.\u201d Sayer reminded Ren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that. That\u2019s why I play the spell, Forbidden Chalice. It\u2019ll give your Ultimate Axon Kicker four hundred points, but it\u2019ll also negate his effects until the end of the turn. But that won\u2019t last long, will it?\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUAK: 4300 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be!\u201d Sayer said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can, Sayer. It can. Now destroy his Axon Kicker.\u201d Ren commanded as Sayer\u2019s synchro got burned to ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayer: 1850<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that burns.\u201d Akiza said as you agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuckily for you, my dragon can\u2019t attack on the turn I activate his ability.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. I still have life points left. So much for your big finish.\u201d Sayer said still cocky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink again. I now play the spell, De-Fusion. I now split my dragon back into the two I used to summon him.\u201d Ren said as Beelze and Red-Eyes are back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBotDD: 3000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nREBD: 2400 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is impossible! I couldn\u2019t lose! Not to you of all people!\u201d Sayer said knowing that it\u2019s over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, here\u2019s the thing, Sayer. Like you, life\u2019s a bitch. Beelze and Red-Eyes, attack Sayer directly and end this duel.\u201d Ren declared as both dragons blasted Sayer back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayer: 0</span></div></div>",

What's on your mind?\" You ask him. Instead of answering with words, he walks up and throws his arms around both you and Akiza, wrapping you both in a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to say thanks. I was a nervous wreck after I found out the twins were taken, and you guys didn't even hesitate to drop everything and help me.\" He says, fighting back tears of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are teammates for?\" Akiza says as she pats his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You'd have done the same for us. In fact, you <b>have</b> done the same for us with how many times you've pulled my ass out of the fire since we met.\" You say as you return the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. It's still nice to know that you guys have my back no matter what.\" He starts to sob. \"I owe so much to you guys that I don't think I could ever repay it. Thanks to you I've patched things up with mom and dad, met Misty, finally controlled by powers, and so much more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. How about you come in and have dinner with us? It's been a long day and we've barely eaten since we were busy hunting.\" You offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. That sounds good.\" He sniffles before you see a fire enter his eyes. \"I'll whip up something amazing as a 'Thank You' for your help today.\" He says as he storms into yours and Akiza's room and you can already hear him going around the kitchen inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... this should be interesting.\" Akiza says as you both go in after him and shut the door.</span></div></div>",

I don't get him. We've made so much progress. The pulsars, the PR, the tournament, saving the city during the duel bot attack. So much, and yet not only does he still want to hold us back by trying to get us to focus on revenge, but by using Luna and Leo to fit his needs, he's still just as much of the ruthless manipulator he was before. Even children aren't safe from him.\" She admits. \"Oooo, that's the spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it just means that we've got a second front to fight this battle on. First we have to get the people of the city to accept us, then we have to convince people like Sayer that all revenge does is hurt us more than help.\" You explain as you finish the massage and stand up. \"I'm gonna hit the shower real quick before bed. Wanna join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As fun as that seems... I wouldn't mind just turning in as soon as possible.

That just means we need to bring our A-game once again.\" You say as you step out of the bathroom to see Akiza already lying under the covers.

My Daredevil can now destroy your new dragon.\u201d Ellsworth said as your dragon goes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, because when you destroy Deep-Eyes with an effect, he can destroy all of your monsters.\u201d You said as Driven Daredevil bites the dust too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe won\u2019t be gone for long. I play the trap card, Call of the Haunted, to bring him back.\u201d Ellsworth said as his ace is back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. I\u2019ll end my turn. And during my end phase, my White Stone of Ancients can now activate its effect. When it gets sent to my graveyard this turn, I can summon another Blue-Eyes monster from my deck. And since his effect let\u2019s him count as a Blue-Eyes monster, I can special summon Dragon Spirit of White in defense mode!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDSoW: 2000 DEF<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen my dragon spirit is summoned, he can remove one spell or trap card on the field from play. I think I\u2019ll choose your Solemn Wishes. No more life points for you.\u201d You said as Ellsworth\u2019s trap is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo far, Yuten is pushing Ellsworth back into a corner!

However, that was stopped thanks to my brother. We all have this dream that we can create harmony and peace between us just like the connection that was made between Satellite and New Domino. In order to make that into a reality, we must protect it by protecting the future. That\u2019s why we duel and that\u2019s why we\u2019ll win.\u201d Ren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry was quite astonished with your speech as she sees you and the others at the pit when they come around.

You see, when Necro Fleur iz destroyed by an effect, I am allowed to special summon Sorciere de Fleur from my deck.\" She reveals. A new monster appeared on her field as she says this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSdF: 2900 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad. Even if you attacked my Doomsday Horror, you still wouldn't do enough damage to finish me. Looks like that's the end.\" Ren says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monsieur, you must learn to not speak when you do not know ze truz. It makes you look ze fool.\" Sherry says. \"Wiz Sorciere's special ability, I can special summon one monster from your graveyard to my side of ze field. And I see it as only poetic zat I summon your precious Red-Eyes Black Dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nREBD: 2400 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! Not Red-Eyes!\" Ren exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. But before I continue, I play Speed World 2's effect to remove ten speed counters to destroy your face-down.\" She says as Ren's card is destroyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry: 0 SC<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I play my last face-down, High Half. Wiz zis card, I can take one of your monsters wiz 2000 or more attack points and cut zose points in half, and I choose your Beelze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBotDD: 1500 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna hurt.\" Ren says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wiz zat, I agree. And it will hurt even more wiz my last two speed spells.\" Sherry says. \"Wiz ze Overboost speed spell, I can increase my speed counters by six until ze end of ze turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry: 6 SC<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And wiz my speed counters now above four, I can play ze Rapid Shotwing speed spell to increase Red-Eyes' attack by 100 for each speed counter I have until ze end of ze turn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nREBD: 3000 ATK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, Sorciere de Fleur, attack Doomsday Horror!\" She declares as her monster fires a blast from it's staff to destroy Ren's monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen: 1200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, my new Red-Eyes will attack Beelze. Go my dragon, and wipe out his life points.\" She concludes as Ren's own monster fires at him. Beelze survives, but Ren's life points don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen: 0000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since zis match is technically over, Beelze does not gain his attack bonus from zat battle. And since my turn ended, Red-Eyes is destroyed once more.\" She concludes.</span></div></div>",

Alright you two, see ya later.\" Ren says before going in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Akiza return to your own room and begin to undress for bed. \"So... Akiza.\" You speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Akiza questions as she slips out of her riding outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About your duel with Sherry. Were you actually jealous of her?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance. Like I said, as long as I have you, what does she have?\" She says with confidence. \"Besides, it's not like she's sexier than me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think such a thing is possible.\" You say as you two snuggle into bed for the night and turn in.</span></div></div>",

Now, since I would've taken damage from a card effect, I can remove from play light monsters in my graveyard to negate a thousand points of damage each. So by removing my Protector, Priestess, and Maiden from play, I'm saved from all 3000 points.\" You explain. \"And since I'm still in this duel, my dragon still gets his attack. Now attack with White Lighting!\" You repeat as your dragon fires at Luna directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna: 100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that, I end my turn.\" You conclude</span></div></div>",
