Charity now leads a double life, by day she is a mild mannered librarian at New Wolf City's Central Library, by night she calls herself Sweet Charity, her difference from most superheroes is her emphasis is not on punishing the guilty but protecting the innocent, she's more into helping people out of scrapes then beating up the wicked, however if she has to defend herself or others she can rely on the power all cobras have...venom. But if she has to bite anyone, she won't let them die, she'll always take them to the hospital, she's out to prove not all snakes are bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: Unlike most snakes, Charity has both arms and legs, she wears and orange jumpsuit and and an orange eye mask to conceal her identity,  she is pure reptile as she has no breasts and she is very slender she can squeeze into places most Anthros can't go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is she now?</span></div></div>",

Melody looked him in the eyes, and approached him slowly and brought her mouth close to his, but not close enough to kiss, and whispered \"Always\".<br>\r\nDan left and got into his suit, and took off towards the prison. Once there he was informed by the warden that all inmates were accounted for, except the Hyena, a few others and Panth. While standing outside the prison, multiple explosives went off and the prison began burning. Dan immediately took off into the prison despite the orders of the warden. It didnt matter to him, he had to find Panth, he had to make sure Panth was safe. Does he find Panth?</span></div></div>",

Dan was given a state burial, his coffin covered with his countries flag, carried by his fellow officers, and through a Guard of Honor. All officers wore black as a sign of respect. The mourners gathered at his grave, family, friends, co-workers, and some heroes. Even Jack was there with his brother on his shoulder. People stood to say kind words, and share warm memories. Then the crowd dispersed, one by one. Finally the only one left there was Melody who knelt at his grave and between the bouquets of flowers, she laid a single rose, and wept for Dan, she said hoarsely \"Im... still waiting... for you\"<br>\r\nOn a rooftop, overseeing the graveyard, stood an ebony feathered bird anthro, to his side was a shepard anthro. \"Thanks again, Raven, I owe you one\". Raven looked at the shepard \"No Dan, now we`re even\" Raven then flew off. Dan felt bad for Raven, he always had a burden to carry. Raven was in some words a hero, he had the supernatural ability, to see into the future, and call forth the spirits of the dead. He did this for Dan, he called his spirit back to the world of the living, and gave him a body identical to his one, that was just buried. Dan took in a deep breath of fresh air, then looked at Melody weeping over his grave and sighed. He decided not to regain his old life, at least not so soon, he felt it would be very hard on the emotions of those he cared about. Dan was heading to his apartment, he needed to get some things there, before moving into a new place, however since everyone in the city knew what he looked like, he needed to keep things on the down low.<br>\r\nNext?</span></div></div>",

But when his powers came to surface he was treated as an outcast by society, friends, and by his family. His family didnt want him anymore, so he spent a majority of his youth living on the streets trying to survive. He hitchhiked to New Wolf City for a fresh chance, as in this large city, with its busling masses, people wouldnt assume him to be the same \"freakshow\" they heard about in the news. He began using his powers to create optical illusions to earn money from passerbys, and if he was ever strapped for cash he was not above using his abilities to scam people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription:Jack is tall and thinly black furred wolf. He wears a trench coat, gloves, claw tipped boots. He wears a bullet proof vest under the coat, he also wears a pair of formal trousers.<br>\r\nBefore he started out using his abilities for the detrement of his fellow species, he witnessed a hero battling against a villain, and during the battle a toxin that was meant to hit the villain missed and got him in the face. It was the day he decided that if that the hero could be careless, so could he. To prevent himself from being wrapped up in morality, he decided to be a villain. Since his face was badly scarred by the toxin, he wore a steel helmet, with intimidating eye holes carved into it, and a mouth with jagged teeth carved into it. He added something to the helmet which made the carved areas shine with a luminescent yellow, to increase the fear of those who see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is he doing now?</span></div></div>",

One of the last few Chaos Hell-hounds still alive, Daemon spent many of his younger years in the guidance of some of the most powerful Demons in the underworld. Often bullied by those who are more powerful, it left him with a craving for power. This hunger is his main motivation for anything he does. This makes him untrustworthy and at times even unstable. He would easily cast aside an ally if he no longer needed them in order to get more powerful items or artefacts. Despite all these faults, he is not heartless, no one living as long as he has can be. He often ignores civilians during a heist or job, only hurting those who stand in his way. He is also prefers quick and painless with his killings to long and painful. And to be honest, he's lonely. He hasn't even had a decent conversation in about 1600 years, so he doesn\u2019t kill all that often. But most importantly, he's smart. You never find him breaking anything on the evil overlord list, and he always thinks through his plans, weighing up the best solution for him and occasionally others.<br>\r\nFor combat purposes he uses his own custom sword \u2018Fatesplitter\u2019, a massive two-handed sword with a 6 foot long blade and 5 foot long hilt. He will also use chaos magic (not the traditional kind) for defence and offence. On a side not, Daemon hates Clich\u00e9s with a passion, and if anyone uses on in his vicinity he is likely going to give them a good smack on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: Daemon is very tall, about 7 feet 8, easily towering over others. He is also very muscular. Other things about him include his clawed hands and horns in the side of his head pointing forward. In terms of clothing, he does not normally wear a shirt, going bare chested, and keeps on purple armoured leggings for his lower body, and purple armoured shoulder pads. His fur is a blood red and out of his back are two blackened wings that allow flight when he summons them using magic. As for his head he looks like a wolf with large horns in the side of his head. He also wears a wooden mask that hides his face with glass eye holes and demonic markings. When needing a disguise, he can make himself look like a wolf man with coal fur and yellow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's he doing right now?</span></div></div>",

I really need to work on my evil plan names. My name is Dr. Monkey-Swap and I am madness incarnate! I had recently captured two superheroes to use as bait and as experiments. I pulled on my lab-coat the only piece of clothing I wear, besides the biter mask I still wear from my asylum escape! As a reminder, that I bite people! Also, I don't button my lab-coat, I have no need for buttons, I tore them all off! Geez, stop asking! Anyway, I stepped briskly into my lab to meet my captors, Sweet Charity and Ice Fang. \"You'll never get away with this you... Guy!\" He said while struggling helpless in his steel fashioned chair. Charity was in a similar predicament, fastened to a chair, albeit with a small twist. She was wearing a biter mask, one I developed that is completely sound-proof and venom-proof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She muttered incoherently as I turned to respond to Ice-Brain. \"Well, Frosty the snow-wolf, you'll see that I have gotten away with it. Also my name is Dr. Monkey-Swap.\" I said proudly, I couldn't afford to let the riff-raff know I have identity issues. It happens when you have the power to mind-swap with any fool who happens to cross your path. \"Let me out of here, you villain wannabe! I'll end you! And my name is Ice-Fang!\" He said trying to sound threatening in his steel shackles. \"Say... Frost-Woof, do you like Sweet Charity?\" I ask, while grinning like the cheeky little monkey I was. \"I like her as a friend and ally! What are you implying?\" He responded, trying to sound like the wolf he pretended to be. However, I knew that he was a little girly sheep in wolf's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Say, what would you do if you were Sweet Charity? Say, if you had her body?\" I ask in a deviously creepy voice. \"While I would... Uh... Condone from doing anything she wouldn't do! Yeah!\" He stated in a somewhat half-hearted manner. He would totally grope himself if he was her. I think I'll give him the chance. I walk over to a machine and press a button. Two silver helmets fall quickly from the ceiling stopping right above both of their heads. It was so fast, they didn't even get the time to see it coming! Ice-Frappe Bark-Wolf the fifteenth was freaking out, especially because he had no idea what was about to happen. The silver helmet on top of his head made his girly barks reverberate. It annoyed me, so I cut the drama short and pull the level swapping them. What happens next?</span></div></div>",
