(Strange thing is,I haven't seen Sue or her friends in a long time. And what's even weirder is that the army is no where to be found.) You thought. (Didn't you have the guys bug the place?) He said. (Yeah, but i think most of them got destroyed when I tried to get Sue to talk. I'll have them do it again when the it's all done.) You said. (It's been how long since we've seen Sue?) He said. (Almost a year.) You said. (Think they are plotting something?) He said. (Wouldn't put it past them. Me and Sue didn't leave off on the nicest of terms.) You said. As you look at the reconstruction, you smell something. What the? That smell.....(You said. (Smells like death and.....pleasure?) He said. Only one thing can have that combination..... You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trace the smell and it leads you to o district. I'm getting closer.( I haven't smelled this in a long time.) He said. ( Better savor it.) you said. You find where the smelled you.  So this is where you were hiding. You say. You see what the smell led you to. The very first type of enemy you fought. A succubus. This one's looks different than the one you faced. Something about her that seems she's just''not entirely, maybe not at all, evil. Even when you feel her energy, it's not evil. It's''.playful. She has long purple hair,horns, red eyes, bat like wings and a bodice. Heh heh.  Now what do we have here? She said. (I expected that response, but the tone''it was like she said it as if we were playing a game.) You thought. I could say the same.(She's not 100ft. Thanks for that.) you thought. You look like you've been looking for something. Or maybe someone. She said. I was just passing by until I smelled something that i thought I never would smell again. And that smell led me to you. You say. And why would that be? She said.( On a hunch, how strong are succubus? )He said. ( Very. Depending on how they rank. A normal one is like fighting a train. A high ranking one is like fighting a meteor.)You say. (How strong is she?) he said.(By just looking at her, I rank her queen.)You say. So what led you to find me? She said. The smell of death and sex is one I'll never forget. But you do reek of it. You just have a smell of it. You say. You see her flap her wings and fly 3 feet of the ground. She starts to circle you. (Fast.)You say. She comes closer to you and hold your arms down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You don't seem particularly evil. You say. And you seem to know how to keep yourself in good health. She said. You're just playful, but since you're a succubus and that you have my arms pinned. I can tell what comes next. She said. And what would that be, cutie? She said. I've heard that those who get it on with a succubus slowly kill themselves every time they do. You say. You're well informed about my kind. She said. I have firsthand knowledge. You say. She strokes you face and lean up against you. So why don't we use that firsthand knowledge right now? She said. She leans in for a kiss, but you use your free hand and block her. Nah. I have a girlfriend. You say. So? Doesn't mean we still can't have fun. Don't you want to feel good? She said. She does. You say She moves her hand down your chest. Finely built. You say. You reach for your knife and try to stab her, but she grabs your arm. Nice try cutie, but not today. She said. Worth a shot. You say.  She flies up high in the air. Let's go. I want you to meet some people. She said. She flies off with you in her arms. You try to break free.(She's strong. She's not even holding me tight. She's concentrated on flying.) you say. You stab her again. This time she doesn't realize it. You hit her on her side. Ow! She said. The pain caused her to drop you. You free fall and land feet first on the ground like iron man. You get up. You see you landed a forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Where are we?) he said.(don't know, but I know we're not in o district.)You say. You check the PTM. You see it said you're in the same time. Strange. It said I'm in the same time period. You say. You check your data glove. And my glove said I'm in o district''.wait a minute. Parallel universe. You say. (You mean she flew so fast that she took us into a different universe?) he said. (yep. The PTM can take us back. I think.) You say. You're about to use it when you hear fighting. Someone's fighting. You say. You go to the sound and see a kid with a sword fighting''a girl made out of slime? What the hell is she? You say. You see the kid having a hard time. You rush over to help. You draw your knife and slash at her repeatedly. Before you slash her again, she melts and reforms behind you. This isn't over! She said. She runs away. You'..ran right into battle and helped me? He said. Yeah. You looked like you were struggling there. You said. (Another minute and he'd be dead.) he said. He's wearing what looks like an adventure outfit. Who are you? He said. I have questions myself but if there are more of her around, I don't think talking here would be good. You say. R'..right. Follow me. I'll take you back to my village. He said. Great. Maybe some answers. You said.You follow him back to his village. </span></div></div>",

Well, technically, it was 65% self-defense. he said. You look a little young to be holding a sword. You say. I can hold my own for a while. He said. With that flailing around of your? You say. You....saw? He said. Maybe, but that doesn't matter. You say. After a few minutes of walking, you arrive at his village. A blacksmith, a shop, a.....temple? You say. Come on. We're almost to my house. He said. He leads you to his house. Nice set up here. It's like a log cabin, but without the mounted bear. You say.( or a pelt on the floor.) he said. So you said you had questions? He said. Uh. yeah. For starters, Why is there a temple in a village? Does that seem a bit.....over the top? You say. Oh. That's the temple of illias. he said. Who? You say. Our goddess. He said. Ok. I'll play ball. Second. You got a name? You say. Luka. he said. Ok. And third why are there monsters around? You say.It's......hard to explain. He said. Well start from the beginning. You say. He tells you the who story. So these monsters are all females and there are some that actually eat humans and other that mate with humans and other shit. You say. Pretty much. He said. No different where I'm from.( Except these monsters aren't 100ft tall.) you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where are you from? He said. Oh......From a faraway land. He said. .......ok. I think I see. You're clothing speaks for itself. he said. Yeah. You say annoyed. You have a knife.? he said. Yeah. It's no sword, but it still gets the job done. and it's special. You say. How special? he said. You'll find out soon. You say. Oh ok. he said. So who controls those monsters? you say. Controls them? He said. Yeah. Someone has to. otherwise it'd be even chaos. You say. That'd be the monster lord. he said. Weird title, but ok. You say. She reigns on a far island from here. After I get my baptism, I'm going on a quest to beat the monster lord. He said. And your other goal? You say. You......know I have another goal? He said. Beating the monster lord solves nothing, but the purpose behind it is the reason. You say. he hesitates for a minute. I want to become a hero and want coexistence between monster and humans. He said. Ok. At least you're being honest. So when is this baptism of yours? You say. Later on today. He said. Hmmmm\u2026\u2026alright. Count me in to. You said. What? He said. You need someone to train you in fighting. That and I couldn\u2019t let you go on this journey by yourself.You say. Well\u2026\u2026..The more the merrier. Why not. He said. Great. You say. ( Argh. Babysitting.)He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait a few hours at luka\u2019s house for him to get back from his baptism. (A goddess. We\u2019ve been here for only a few hours and this world is a lot similar to ours. In a way.) he said.(So you have no problem helping him?) You say. ( I do, but I want to see how the monsters stack up to the monsters we have at home.) He said.( So you\u2019re in it to see the enemies?) You say.( Yeah.) He said. As you take account of the supplies, you  feel something coil around your leg and when you looked, it wraps around your whole body. What the? You say. You  see it\u2019s half snake, half human.( A naga? No naga\u2019s aren\u2019t this powerful.) You say. She\u2019s purple, has long white hair with a pink flower in it, some clothing, yellow eyes  and has weird markings on her left side of her body. ( She doesn\u2019t have the look to kill.) He said. She moves closer.( She\u2019s going for my neck. A little help?) You say. What she does surprises you. She doesn\u2019t bite your neck, she\u2019s sniffing you.( What the fuck?) You both said. The minute she got your scent, she backed off. You\u2026..smell unbaptized, but also smell like a hero. She said.( She got all that from my scent?) She said. (By the look on her face, she doesn\u2019t like the smell.) He said. Who are you? She said. Kind of wrapped up at the moment. You say.( Are you proud of that joke?) He said. She un coils herself from around you. Ok. Now I can breathe. You say. As you breath in, you recognize what kind of monster she is.( She looks like a lamia.) you say.( A lamia?) He said. ( yeah. Like naga\u2019s except these are on a whole different plane. All females. All dangerous. Even the kids.) you say. Awnser my question. She said. Damn. Is there a please coming in? Or is that the attitude? You say. You can see she\u2019s not amused. Alright. You say. Before you could say anything, you see Luka come through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n So how\u2019d it go? You say. I missed my baptism. He said sad. Damn. Well screw it. Who said you need to be baptized to go out of the village. You say. He thinks for a minute. You\u2026\u2026\u2026your\u2019re right. He said. Then he sees the the lamia. Ahhh! He said. Relax. She\u2019s\u2026\u2026.i hope\u2026\u2026nonviolent. You say. As luka and the lamia talk to each other, you have your own thoughts.( She\u2019s no ordinary monster. Her powers are through the roof.) You say.( Could she be the monster lord?) He said. ( I need more evidence first, but there\u2019s a good chance she could be.) You say. ( if she is, it would be a good test of power.)He said. (Really. Is that all you think about? Fighting.)You say.(I just like to prove my dominance by kicking the ass of anyone who tries me\u2026..i mean us.)he said. (Yeah.like always.) You say. Hey. Hey! Luka said. Huh. What? You say. Come on. Let\u2019s go. He said. Where\u2019d the snake woman go? You say. Her name\u2019s something. Too long to pronounce, but she said we can call her alice. She\u2019s coming along to. He said. Perfect. Nothing like fighting monster while having one watch your ass. You say sarcastically. Just give her a chance. She\u2019s cold and uncaring, but I bet she means well. He said. Yeah. She really does.You say.( She\u2019s going to watch as he gets eaten.) He said. ( She sure is.) You say. answer </span></div></div>",

As long as I get to punch something. he said. Whatever. Come here. You say. You show him your data glove. I've looked at all kinds of monsters. I can't get anything solid on slime and the we're going to use on head on, but I did find some mythical ones. Lamia, Kitsune, succubus, dragon all that. You say. You think there might be a Cerberus? He said. A three headed dog? Maybe. I've seen a lamia and a succubus. So I think so. You say. The kraken? he said. I.....think so. It wasn't real back home. Why here? You say. You really believe in that goddess crap? He said. No, but I'm going to play it along if we encounter people. Who knows how fanatic they are. You say. Not as far as human sacrifice? he said. No. You say. Well. Here they come. he said. He goes back inside you. About time. I thought you chickened out. You say. No way. I'm seeing this through. Luka said. (I can already tell. She's going to be a problem.) You thought. I was starting to. Did IIias really abandon me? I waited for a long time to be baptized, but I wasn't in the end... Luka said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it's better you didn't. What's so good about? Alice said. I agree with......alice. You don't need to baptized just to do this. You say. A hero has a lot of perks to it. respect and low rates at Inns. And they get divine protection from IIias. If you come across an evil monster, she'll defend you. He said. (Didn't luka say that monsters rape people here?) he said.(Yeah. So I wonder who's in more trouble. Me or him?)You said. The semen of a baptized person is horrible. So they are likely not to be attacked as much. Alice said. That's how it goes? Luka said. ....You didn't know? Baptized people tastes like angel liver....not so good. She said. How'd you......never mind. I wouldn't like the answer to that question. You say. That's why someone like you looks delicious. Alice said. She looks at luka. Not you. (Ok. so I'd say I'm about 75% safe from monsters.) You thought. (And the other 25%?) he said. (I'll be attacked first.) You say.  So where are you headed? Straight to the monster lord's doorstep? Alice said. I'll get there eventually...it's far from here, but i'll never stand up. Not yet. I'll have to get better on the way there. he said. So we hit other places along the way. What's the closes town? You say. Iliasburg. If we move now, we'll be there tomorrow. He said. oh really. Is everything named after her? Alice said. She's not into domination, is she? because everything has her name in it. You say. Is everything that comes out of your mouth bad? Luka said. Don't use that tone on me. More important, I'm hungry again. Alice said. Did you just eat all my dried meat at the house? Luka said. You're part snake. Go find a rabbit and eat that. Although if you can unhinge your jaws...You say. What?! Alice said. Enough you two. Luka said. You better make an effort tonight. You're not bad at cooking. Alice said. ( We really did pick up something annoying.) You both thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both thought about it, you're suddenly jumped. What the fuck is that? You say.  it's a girl, top half, but lower half is part slug . Luka said. She's look like she's wearing southern clothing. You say. Travelers? Not baptized either. You look delicious. She said. She particularly looks at luka.(yep. Luka first, then me.) You say. My second fight against a monster...what should I do Alice? Luka said. She's gone. You say. g....gone?! He said. Who are you yelling at? the slug girl said. She moves slowly towards luka. You got this. Just find an opening and strike. You say. R.....right. Luka said. Luka swings at her, but his sword didn't go through, stopping it short. The mucus is too sticky and elastic. Causing it to fall short. My attack...Luka said. You can't cut me with a weak attack like that...She said. Crap! What can I do? He said. Try a stab! You say. Luka pulls back and stabs at her chest, but the sword just bounces off. Still nothing. Luka said. It's useless. She said. Dammit! if I was a little more powerful, I could go straight through her. He said. I'll get on top of you. She said. She climbs on top of luka. Oh. that's sick.You say.(meh.)he said. Luka's completely covered by the slug's sticky body. Here...have a taste of a sticky hell. When you can't take no more, just let it all out! She said. Luka! Get free! you say. I'm......trying! he said. he can't break free. You hate it that much? I'll move it all around. She said. The slime move all around luka. grr.....! Luka said. he struggles intensely and gets free. You didn't like my slimy hell...? She said.  My attacks aren't doing it. What should I do? A slug's weak point....salt.Luka said. Luka grabs the salt from his bag. Th....that's! She said. her expression goes dark. Luka throws some salt at her. Kyaa! it's working! You say. Alright! Luka said. Luka throws more slat on her. Stop that! She said. She starts to shake, shivering away from luka. I\u2019ll remember this! She said as she ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI won! Luka said. (sloppy. Just freaking sloppy.) he said.( it\u2019s his victory. Let him have this.) You say. Pathetic looking fight. Alice said. And where were you? Is snake girl afraid of a slug girl? You say jokingly. Yeah. You ran off. Luka said. I didn\u2019t \u201crun off\u201d anywhere! I just didn\u2019t want to be seen by other monsters. She said. Is that right? You say. (Must have her own meaning to it.) Luka thought. Anyway, you made a big mistake in that fight. She said. Mistake? Luka said. You throw out all the salt for tonite\u2019s dinner\u2026How are you going to season it effectively?!She said. Are you kidding me? All this and you\u2019re worried about food? Does anything else go through you skull? You say. Enough. You could have given a hand. Luka said. I\u2019m not your ally. I\u2019m just observing you. She said. Oh I see how it is. So if he does become monster food ( which he will)he said. You\u2019re just going to abandon him? Class act. You say. I said enough. I don\u2019t need her help anyway! Luka said. By the way, what are we having for dinner? She said. You can\u2019t be serious. You say. You and luka set up camp. Alright. Camp's set. Now to feed miss bottomless pit here. You say</span></div></div>",

You say. (Good to hear a compliment from her) Luka thought. If only you were good with a sword. She said.(Of course.) Luka thought. Where'd you learn from? it was horrible to watch. Alice said. What do you mean, alice...I've been train for five years. He said. Five years? I thought it was your first time\u2026 What were you wasting your time doing? She said. I learned from pilgrims who came to visit the temple. I mixed moves into my own style. He said. Bad skills learned from untrained people will be bad combined. Alright. I\u2019ll teach you something. She said. Really? After what you said early? You\u2019ll teach him how to fight? It\u2019d be boring to see him get eaten right away. She said. Of course. You both say. I\u2019ll train you to fight monsters. She said. P\u2026\u2026Please do. Luka said. Hang on. If you\u2019re teaching him, so am i. You need to learn how to deal with getting out of a hold. After alice is done, come to me. You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor few hours, Luka practices with alice. Right there. You need to use your feet as you swing. Don\u2019t just use your arms when you swing. She said. Like this? He said. \u2026\u2026.Not bad. This move is good for someone small like you. She said. Ok so like this. He said. \u2026\u2026..Good. Keep it up. She said. After a few more times doing it, luka comes to you. Alright. What do you have? he said. You couldn\u2019t get out of the slug girls slimy hell. If she remained on you, you\u2019d give in. Now what I think you need is to visualize pain. You say. Pain. Yes. That\u2019s the opposite of pleasure. Now turn around. You say. Luka turns around. You pull out your knife. Ok. Now pretend I\u2019m one of the female monsters and I\u2019m holding you.You say. Ok. He said. Now\u2026.You couldn\u2019t break free. You need to break free on your first try, because if you don\u2019t, that\u2019s all they need. You say. Ok. Luka said. He tries to get out, but can\u2019t. You have to try harder. They\u2019re not going to let go just because you said please. You say. He fights some more, but still can\u2019t get out. Ok. I\u2019m going to give you a boost. Now close your eyes and picture me like I said before. You said. He breaths in. Ok. Now do you feel the pain in your right shoulder? You say. Yes. It hurts. He said. Good, now use that pain and get out of this hold. You say. Luka struggles more and breaks free. I\u2026..did it1 he said. Good. Now. Next time you\u2019re in a hold. Instead of squirming around, picture that pain and it will be easier for you to get out. You say.Ok. I got it. One more. He said. You both do it again. It takes only two tries this time. Very nice. Now. Keep the pain in mind. Imagine if it\u2019s pain instead of feeling good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter teaching luka how to visualize pain instead of pleasure, the training ended. Alice, you\u2019re not going to use a sleeping bag? Luka said. I don\u2019t want anything restricting me\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll sleep here. She said. She coils herself around a nearby tree. By the way, idiot. Where\u2019d you get that ring from? She said. You can\u2019t eat a ring alice. Luka said. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she could. You say. Idiot\u2026..What do you think goes in on my mind? She said. We don\u2019t want to know. You say. You\u2019re just always hungry. He said. Idiot. I just feel something faint in that ring. She said. Faint?( Oh I feel it.it\u2019s very low.) You say. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s my mother\u2019s keepsake. She died of an illness ten years ago.Luka said. What kind of illness? You say. I don\u2019t know. He said. I see\u2026..i\u2019m sorry about that. She said. Eh? You both said.You were both taken back by that.( Did she just say sorry?) he said.(yes she did.)You say. What\u2019s with the surprised look? We both have a parent that dead. She said.That\u2019s\u2026.right. Luka said. You\u2019re father \u2018s t still alive? She said. No\u2026 He died before my mother did\u2026luka said.  Ah\u2026I see. You\u2019re father went off to fight the monster lord and didn\u2019t come back. That\u2019s why you took up your father\u2019s wishes, and trained to be a hero. Did I get it right? She said. You\u2019re way off. Luka said. Hit it on the head for me. My father died and I took up his wishes. I just didn\u2019t want to be the hero part. If you\u2019ve seen what I\u2019ve seen, you\u2019d not care about being a hero. You\u2019d want revenge. You say. Revenge? Luka said. Forget I said anything. I\u2019m going to bed. You say. You go to sleep. You wake up in the morning to the sound of sound of shouting. Shit. What\u2019s with all the noise so early? You say. Whatever\u2026..i\u2019m hungry. Alice said. (We\u2019re starting it this early. It\u2019s going to be a long day.) he said. After breakfast and luka\u2019s praying to his goddess, which really makes you uneasy. She\u2019s not in that s and m shit is she? You say. No. It\u2019s one of the commandments. He said. It\u2019s like you\u2019re here slave. Alice said. Doesn\u2019t she hate monsters and doesn\u2019t that contradict what you believe? She said. Uh\u2026\u2026Luka said. Soft spot.You say. And besides, What\u2019s with her forbidding a human/monster relationship? Most monsters can\u2019t breed if they don\u2019t have a mate. So there are just as many humans as monsters that have broken that law. She said. That\u2019s true! Luka said. You\u2019re just getting it? Moron. Alice said.  Wait, but isn\u2019t that a double edged sword? That\u2019d be exterminating the monsters also. Luka said. You\u2019re putting too much thought into it. So far from what I heard, she favors humans and hates monsters. She might as well just say kill all monsters you see. You say. Even this\u2026\u2026.human gets it. Alice said. We can have this talk later. Shall we keep going? If we wait any longer, we won\u2019t reach Illiasburg. Luka said. That would be problem. Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter packing up the camp, you all headed out again. As luka and and Alice trade comments on what they\u2019re expecting from the city, you remain quiet until you come across a plant in the ground. That\u2019s a huge steam. You say. What is it? Luka said. Of course she\u2019s gone. You say. Should we pull it? Luka said. I don\u2019t know. It could be dangerous. You say. </span></div></div>",

Just a bit more.   Just as the sun sets, you can see the city. About time, I was getting sick of walking. you say. We can\u2019t go into the city because of\u2026\u2026her. Luka said. What? Why are you both starting at me? Alice said. How fierce is the hate? You say. High. Very high. He said. Alice\u2026can you disguise yourself as human? Luka said. Being a human is unpleasant. Why should i? She said. No human. No Ama ama Dango. You say. Fuck. Ok. I guess. How\u2019s this? She said. Alice\u2019s tail turns into a pair of legs and her purple skin turns white. That\u2019s\u2026\u2026good. Luka said. You close his mouth. Flies get in like that. You say. You all head inside. Strange. The streets are deserted. No venders, people, anything. Luka said.(Like opera.) he said. It seems everyone\u2019s barricade inside. And there\u2019s a feeling of tense in the air. You say. What\u2019s going on here? Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He runs down the main street until he reaches the city plaza. Hey. Wait! You say. You follow him. He pulls you behind a tree on the side of the road. That\u2019s\u2026.! he said. Who? You say. You see a dragon swords woman standing in the middle of a dozen of bodies on the ground with only three solders left standing. Even I heard of her\u2026 One of the four heavenly knights. Granberia, with a sword arm no human can compare. He said. She\u2019s that strong? You say. Let\u2019s just say if you had an army of 100 strong men vs. her, you\u2019d go with her. He said.(Someone worthy of a fight.)He said. She\u2019s attacking this place. And those three are the last line of defense. You say. Not to rain more on this damp parade, but Alice has high tailed it. You say. Damn. Luka said. Two are standing tall, but the third is cowering. You say.(Kill him first.) he said. As one solider charges her and about to swing, she\u2019s already gone. Where\u2019d she go? Luka said. You activate the optical eyes. She\u2019s behind him. You say. Wha? Luka said. In the next instant, the solider faints from the blow. Damn you! The solider said. He runs towards her from behind. Slow\u2026She said. She grabs her sword and it\u2019s on fire. The heat reaches you and luka. She  swings at him the intense heat makes him faint from being so close to it. Incredible\u2026 Luka said. She dropped them like they were nothing. That\u2019s one tough dragon swordswoman. They don\u2019t look dead. Just very hurt. You say. The third solider  runs away. (He can never call himself a solider again.) he said. This is not good. Luka said. Is this all?! Having your city taken by one monster\u2026..there\u2019s no complaints? She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What can I do? As a hero\u2026.er as someone aiming to become a hero,  I can\u2019t sit here, but she\u2019s so strong. Luka said. Luka\u2026\u2026Let me do this. You say. You? He said. Yes. You\u2019re still to green. That girl would cut you in half. You say. But I need to do this if I need to become a hero. He said. There\u2019s a thin line between hero and just plain stupid. This is plain stupid if you go out there. You already know the first lesson of a hero. Helping the helpless. You say. Yes. He said. The second rule is to when to let someone else do the job. You can\u2019t do everything. Sometimes you need to swallow your pride and let someone else do it. You say. But\u2026\u2026He said. Relax kid. I\u2019ve faced worse than some dragon swordswoman. You need to be alive to become a hero. And I\u2019m going to make sure that happens. You say. Luka hesitates. Alright\u2026\u2026 Go ahead. I still need to learn how to break free of a hold in one go. Take my sword.He said. Watch and you might learn something. You say. You get up and go to her. This city isn\u2019t yours yet. You still have one challenger left. You say.  Was that you boy? She said. She sees the sword. Oh. You\u2019re a warrior. Then I\u2019ll treat you like one.She said. You hold the sword like it should be . You have spirit. I\u2019ll give you that. But don\u2019t you think you\u2019re biting of more than you can chew? She said. Wouldn\u2019t be the first. You say. Very well. Then I\u2019ll be your opponent! She said. You enter calm mind. Wha? I can feel the movement of his heart! Where did you learn that? She said. You slash at her. \u2026.Ack! So you\u2019d go the way of the coward? So be it! When I\u2019m done with you, you\u2019ll regret ever taking up a sword! Prepare yourself! She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the flow of the town and block all noises except your opponent. Take this!She said. She jumps up and slams down her sword hard. You feel the energy flow is violent and above you. You side step her attack. You cut across her torso with precision. It hits her. She puts some distance between you. She steps like thunder towards you and goes for a stab. The energy is violent and in front of you. You grab the sword. You\u2026\u2026stopped it?! She said. You hit her with the butt of the sword and cut her on her face. Oh, how I longed for the pain of battle again! She said. The sight of her own blood makes her more fired up. You come out of calm mind. You both circle each other there. You slash her in the chest, but she\u2019s gone. Hm? You say. Then you put the sword behind you and block her attack. You kick her back. Wow\u2026\u2026Luka said. Her sword turns of fire. You cover your eyes to avoid them from getting hit. You\u2019re not the only one with fire tricks. You say. Your eyes turn optical and black fire goes own the sword. You both circle each other again. Then you both attack each other. All of yours and hers attack hit each other at the same time. After each attack is block by another, the fire from her sword is gone. Incredible.  How can you control fire? Is salamander teaching you? I want to see her now! She said. Salamander? I don\u2019t know any salamander. You say. Bullshit! She said. You go for a stab and she blocks and counters with a stab through your stomach.  Heh heh. You say. You simply take hold of it and pull it out and the wound instantly heals up. What? Impossible. She said. You hit her back. A simply stab isn\u2019t enough to even wound me. You say. \u2026\u2026.I can\u2019t help by admire your skills. No one has ever matched me in battle before, but I can\u2019t let someone walk around with a power like this. As one of the heavenly knights, I must not allow this! Tell me where you got this power from and I\u2019ll go easy on you! She said. I got them on my own. You say. Can\u2019t be. She said. You charge at her and she blocks your attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can tell\u2026\u2026you\u2019ve live your whole life by that sword. Nothing wrong with that, but what you point that sword for is the key. You say. I know what I point it for! She said. You shove her back and punch her. While stunned, you take her sword and slash her twice. She falls to one knee. No\u2026\u2026way. She said. This sword ain\u2019t that heavy. You say. You toss it to her. It seems I win.  You say. She was able to get up. There\u2019s no shame in losing. Only fuels my resolve. But I must know my opponent. She said. Can\u2019t say. You say. That\u2019s insane. Someone who can move like water and have the fire on his sword must have a name. She said. I do. I just don\u2019t give it out. I had fun though. You\u2019re the first person in a long time to actually give me a wound this big. Maybe if we see each other again, you and I can have another bout? You say. \u2026..hmph. She said. She quickly vanishes.  I\u2019ll take that as a yes. You say. Then luka runs up next to you. That was amazing! You took on one of the heavenly knights and came out on top! He said. It was nothing. You say as you handed his sword back to him. You got to teach me some moves of yours. He said. Yeah\u2026\u2026..hey. stand here. You say. What? Here? he said. Yeah. See you in a few hours. You say. You vanish into thin air. Whoa. Luka said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutskirts<br>\r\n(Why are letting him take the credit for our work?) he said.(Because\u2026.the inn won\u2019t be cheap in a town like this. So since being a hero seems to be a popular trend here, I decided to let them think luka is a hero.) You say. (But he did nothing. We fought that dragon woman, not him. What\u2019s the point of being a hero if he can\u2019t back it up?)he said.(He will. He wants to be a hero and that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to be, but I\u2019m going to make sure he lives to see that he is. Now what kind of hero he becomes is up to him.) You say. ( So you\u2019re going to fight all his fights?) he said. (No. he is. I\u2019ll just take the ones he can\u2019t handle yet.) You say.(And if he can\u2019t handle any?) He said.(he\u2019s not that weak. He just needs to fight a lot more. Give him some time. He\u2019ll even have you surprised.) You say.( I doubt it. So far, he wouldn\u2019t even get close to me.)he said.</span></div></div>",

Hey people. What I miss? You say. Where'd you go? Luka said. Oh......nowhere. But I see this room is nice. This is like the vip treatment. Uh.......is alice smiling? You say. She got the food she wanted. Luka said. Oh. The dangos. And the plate is clean. Glutton. You say. Was it good? Luka said. is was sweet! She said. her tail is waving happily, which means she did like it. Oi, oi. Don't lost your transformation. Someone might see you. Luka said. (Like a dragon swordswoman's not enough.)he said. lice turns back into human form, and rings the service bell. Wow. Still hungry? You say. The owner comes in and clears off the dishes.(She seems like an important person.) he said,(Yeah. it seems she can't turn your reputation either good or bad.) You say.  How'd you like the Dangos? She said. it was incredibly sweet, but it didn't overtake the flavor. Alice said.(Sheesh. Only she would go into detail about it.)You say.(Did you just hear what she just said?) he said. (What?) you say.(Something about harpies and a village.) he said.(Harpies? What is this? God of War? Like dragons wasn't the half of it.) you say.(I don't know, but it has something to do with the dangos because of the honey and male shortage.) he said. (Male shortage? hmmm. Might not be a bad idea after all to see what's going on there.) You said. I didn't see you earlier with them. She said. Oh.....I'm just dropping by to visit a friend. You say. Well then please. take as long as you like. Have a nice rest! She said. She walks out.Whew. You say. Man. I'm not use to this. A little high class and ritzy for me, but I think i'll still be able to relax. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm...I'm hungry again...Alice said. Whoa whoa. Didn't you just eat a whole plate of dangos? You say. How can you still be hungry after all that? Go back to your room. Luka said. They went into another stomach... My other stomach wants some human...She said. (Oh Fuck.) You both thought. Alice glances at you for a few seconds.(If she comes closer, i'll be locked up for murder.) You say. Luckily for what alice said before you all got on this journey about hero's, she turns her gaze to luka. Someone unbaptized as you is simply.....delicious. She said. Oh would you look at the time. I got.....things to do. Luka, she's all yours. You say as you bolt for the door. You open and close the door quickly, despite luka's protest. Whew. you say.(What now? Sleep outside?) he said.( Well alice will probably bunk with luka. Leaving a perfectly unoccupied room for us.) you say. You head for the empty room, which is right next to luka's. You can hear them. Oh boy. It's going to be hard to catch some zzz's. you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're waiting outside for luka and alice. (You think alice decided for round 2?) he said.( I hope not. I heard them all last night. I'm still tired.) You say. ( Let me handle it from here.) He said.(Ughhhh. I'm too tired to argue. just don't kill anyone unless you have to.) You say. You let him take over your body. Then you see luka and alice. About time. You two had fun? You say. We.....were that loud? He said. yeah. who didn't hear. Probably the whole town knows you two were at it like animals. You say.(And of course she's unfazed. Smug bitch. I should just kill her now. No way she's more powerful than me. He won't mind. he said no killing unless I have to.) You say. Can we go now? Luka said. Yeah. Waiting on you and your rapist here. I wonder how your goddess will react to this? You say. .......let's go. Alice said. As you get some distance from the city, Alice calls out for luka. Don't keep me waiting. you say. yeah.......I won't. Luka said. He goes to alice. (This is bull shit. I feel like a babysitter. Watching over this runt. And then there's her. I can't even describe her. First she says she wants to observe him on his journey. then she trains him how to fight monsters. Make up your mind!) You say. Then the ground starts to buckle and swell, like a mini earthquake was going on. The hell? You say. When you take a step back, you see a female earth worm. Hm?You say. Oh. A traveler? Let me wring you dry. She said. I never like science, but I loved to dissection part. You say. She wraps her slimy body around you. He heh. Gotcha. She said. Piss off. You say You power out and grab her by the tail. You grab your knife. Let\u2019s see what you look like on the inside. You say. You stab your knife into her stomach and make a huge incision across her stomach.  Argh! She said. Why are you screaming? I haven\u2019t gutted you yet! You say. You slice through her like stomach and all of her insides pour out. Ugh\u2026\u2026.ohhhh\u2026\u2026ahhhhhh\u2026\u2026She said as she died. You let go of her tail. Good thing I paid attention in class. You said. Hey sorry it took so long i\u2026\u2026whoa! Luka said as he sees your hands are covered in blood and sees the dead body of an earthworm girl. What\u2026\u2026happened? Luka said. I should ask you the same. You encountered what I did? You said. Yeah. That\u2019s why it took me so long. And I see you had no problem here. He said. Very barbaric. Stylish, but barbaric. Alice said. You get in her face. Unless you\u2019re here fighting, I don\u2019t want to hear anything about how I get shit done. You got that snake bitch? You say. Whoa whoa! Luka said. Now\u2019s not the time to be at each other\u2019s throat. We have bigger problems to deal with. Luka said. Yeah yeah. What the hell? What kind of fucked up sword is that? You say. You take a closer look. It\u2019s called angel halo. He said. I can see. I count at least 666 angles on that sword. Why do they look like they\u2019re in pain and why does it look like it has a huge eye? You said. Long story. He said. Ok now that that\u2019s out of the way, where to next? Alice said. If we go north, we can take a boat to sentora, but there is still those bandits to the west. Luka said. Let\u2019s not forget what the owner at the Sutherland inn said about a happiness village. Alice said. Right\u2026.she did said something happened there. Luka said. Oi, oi. What\u2019s with the sudden interest in this? What happened to avoiding  \u201cunnecessary things.\u201dLuka said. Food. You said. Nevermind. Luka said. Just pick where. You said. Alright we go to\u2026. </span></div></div>",

A dragon and a vampire' can't win against them, but I can't ignore this. I'll or die trying. Luka said.( Vampire? Great.) You thought. Idiot. Alice said. Disregarding her, do you even know where they are at? You say. To the mountains. He said. Great. Climbing up a mountain. You say. You all head for the mountains. After a few hours of walking, you reached the base of the mountains. Well, we're here. Where are they? You said. Crap'.i didn't know. Luka said. It'll take forever to search this place. Still want to do this? Alice said. Ugh'What to do'Luka said. While you both wander aimlessly, you get a feeling. You block what feels like a hammer and jack up the person who tried to hit you. Rrgh'..let go! She said. Huh? You're just a monster child. You say. That's a goblin. Luka said. Aren't goblins supposed to be green and ugly? You say. Hey! Who you calling ugly?! She said. Shut it! Luka take care of this brat. We got bigger fish to fry. You say. You throw her in front of luka. You look around. (And alice is gone.) you thought. While luka is dealing with her, you watch.( What'd I miss?) You said. (Nothing. Luka got a new sword, killed an earthworm girl, gave alice the business, going to deal with bandits. That's all.) He said. Hey.Hey! Are you listening? Luka said. What? I hear you. What? You said. I know where the hideout is. He said. Well what are you  waiting for? An ivatation? Go! You say.So you found out where they're hiding out. Alice said. Yeah'vampire'.lamia''dragon. 3 powerful monsters. Not to be taken lightly at all. He said. I told you to give it up. Still in a hurry to die? Alice said. I don't want to die'but I can't turn my back on Illiasburg in their time of need! Luka said. 'Idiot. Risking your neck for other. What an idiot. Alice said. While alice sighs in disgust, you all head for the hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm'Here's another one. Luka said. It better be. This'll be the fifth. You say. Has your eyes always been red? Alice said. I was going to ask that after we finished this, but alice beat me to it. Luka said. SHouldn't you be worrying about the getting sucked dry or chocked to death or maybe being burned alive than my eye color? You say. '..You're right''.scary, but right. Luka said. Is thre really a dragon in there'? I don't sense one'Alice said. Alice smells the air with a sigh. Hmm'So it's like that huh? She said. What? What is it? Luka said. You feel the energy around you. You got to be kidding me. You say. What? What do you two know that I don't know? Luka said. I'll wait here. Finish this quickly, and come back. Alice said. Yeah. I'll be here too. Don't keep me waiting out here. you say. Oi, oi. What are you both saying? Luka said I'm not going to spoil it. Just get in there. You say.( A dragon, lamia, and a vampire' I didn't think I'm able to finish this quick'.much less walk out. But I can't stop now! Not this early in!) Luka thought. Alright. Here I go! Luka said. You and alice watch as luka goes inside the cave. Then it's just you and alice. There is dead silence between the two of you. (She keeps trying me. I'll gut her too.) He thought. (Ok. I'm better.) You say. (Normally I'd argue, but because I'm with snake breath here, I'm not going to argue.) He said. You take back control of your body.( Just to let you know, luka's in there with a vampire, lamia, and a dragon.) He said.(And you just let him go in there by himself?) you said.( Feel the energy.) he said. You feel the energy.( Oh. Yeah. He's go this.) you say. After a 10 minutes of waiting, you head inside. You find luka. So these are the bandits. A vampire, dragon, and lamia, and a goblin. Isn't she supposed to be green and ugly? You say.(Same thing I said.) He said. They're nothing but kids. You say. I know. Luka said. They look like they are about to cry. Aw fuck. What now? You say. They're only four of you? Luka said. That's right'The dragon girl said. We could only find four'The vampire girl said. They responded while wiping away tears. Well? We can't just let them know what they did was right. You say. Well'What should we do, alice? Luka said. You were the one who wanted to take care of the bandits. Sell them, violate them, kill them, or eat them. Do whatever you want. She said. Eat them? Really!? You say. Don't eat me! The dragon pup said. They all burst into tears. Hey hey. You say. You comfort them. Don't listen to her. She has problems. Lots of them. You say. They stop crying and hold onto you for protection from alice and luka. Wow. They immediately took a liking to you. Luka said. Just one of my many knacks. So what to do? We can't leave them crying here. you say. First let's go to illiasburg so they can apologize. You caused them a lot of trouble'understand? Luka said. I'll apologize'.*sniff* The dragon pup said. Still crying, they all nod. So you're going to put them around town? What will you do if people lynch them? Alice said. L'Lynch'? The tiny lamia said. Nooo! Waaah! The goblin girl said. *sniff*Waaah! The vampire girl said. It's ok. They won't do that! Anybody who tries to lynch you, I'll beat them down! Luka said. They have to go through both of us. You say. You'.You're both such good guys. The dragon pup said. They hold you tighter every time alice glares at them. With you, luka, alice, and the four crying monster, you all headed back to Illiasburg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait outside the city for 30 minutes. About time. Ready now? You say. Yeah. Why didn't you come into the village? They girls wanted to see you off too. Luka said. If I'd went in there, they'd say we both did it. I hate to say it, but I'm already a hero. You on the other hand need to build up your reputation. You say. You'.hate being a hero? Luka said. '''If you've seen the things I've done. You'd say I'm the exact opposite of a hero. You say. What'd you do? Luka said. ''.what's our next place? You say. You say. Happiness village. Luka said. You're eyes are back to the old color. Alice said. We should go. You say. You all head of to the village. While luka and alice talk about why the village is called that, you remain silent. Then alice  just disappears. That means a monster is nerby. Luka said. You both see a bee girl. Damn. Almost big enough to be queen, but not old enough. You say. Fufu' a unbaptized traveler. You look delicious. She said. Honey is dripping from the nest attached to her abdomen. Ok luka. She'll definitely try to hold you. Do what I taught you. You say. Got it! He said. I have you now! Luka said. Luka jumps in and slashes at her neck. His footing's off by 3 inchs, but he got it. You say I'll cover you in honey. She said. She pours honey all over luka. What is this!? Luka said. Luka! The honey will slow you down. Hurry and finish this before you can't move! You say. Haa! Luka said as he attacked her. Let me taste you. She said. Her tongue  quickly licks luka's dick. Take this! Luka said. He stabs the bee girl in the stomach. Fufu'.got you. She said. Luka's body is held tight by her. Let me lick you more.  Drown in the pleasure'She said. Luka! Use what I taught you! You shout. Luka imagines it painful that pleasurable. Get off! Luka said. Luka breaks free! Alright! You say. I'..i did it. Luka said. You weren't satisfied? She said.  I got you now! He said. Luka slashes her. What's''.this? ''My strength''She said. She turns into a regular bee and flies off somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nice! You say. I still need improvement here and there. Luka said. More like everywhere. Alice said. Oh boy here we go. You say. As alice grills luka, you see someone. Hey..... Tom? What are you.....? You say. You see him walk into the thick trees. Hey. Who are you talking to? Luka said. What? Huh? You say. You were talking into the thin air. Are you sane? Alice said. Sane as you were when you decide to come with luka. Look are we almost there? You say. Yeah. We're almost there. Luka said. You all keep going.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So this is happiness village...? Luka said. A peaceful farm village. Women tending the crops and the beehives all over while the guys are inside getting fat wondering who can burp louder. You joke. Ha ha ha. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re around. So far\u2026..nothing out of the ordinary. Luka said. Are you blind or stupid idiot? Do you see any men? Can you say that\u2019s not unusual? Alice said. He made a joke, but now that you put it in perspective\u2026.you\u2019re right\u2026..I only see women\u2026Luka said. Me too. No guys are here. You said as your eyes turn to normal. Except that little boy who\u2019s helping to transport one of the hives.  Luka said. Even the heavy jobs are done by women\u2026You say. Oh. Travelers? Two young ones, at that. A woman said. A woman working a nearby beehive starts to speak to both of you. You came all the way here, but we don\u2019t really have anything to entertain travelers with. Due to a shortage of man power, we have a shortage of specialty happiness honey too\u2026 She said. Why\u2019s that? Luka said. As luka asked, someone screamed.  That\u2019s the little boy! Luka said. You both run towards the sound. There you both see a harpy. She\u2019s going to take him away in her talons! Hey! Let go of that kid! Luka said. He pulled out his sword and point it at the harpy. Everyone seems to run inside. Huh? I haven\u2019t seen you here before\u2026Are you a traveler? She said. (At least she\u2019s not like the ones from God of war.) You thought. The harpy sizes both of you up with her eyes. Then she releases the boy and smiles as she licks her lips\u2026\u2026at you. Alright\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll let the boy go. Instead\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll kidnap you! She said. You say. Get to a safe distance boy! Luka said. O\u2026..Ok. he said. Luka makes sure he gets to safety by keeping his sword pointed at her.(I wonder who she\u2019s looking at. I\u2019ve only been attacked once, luka\u2019s unbaptized, but by law here, so am I.) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Heehee\u2026.You\u2019re a lot cuter than that little boy\u2026.I\u2019ll take you back to my nest, and we can have lots of children. Or we could start making them right now\u2026? Be a good boy and make tons of children with me\u2026She said. Grr\u2026I\u2019ll take out all you kidnapping monsters! Luka said. As luka attacks, she flies to safety. Hey! Get back down here and fight me! Luka said.  Heehee\u2026it\u2019s time to mate. She said. The harpy flies\u2026..past luka? Huh? Luka said. She\u2019s heading towards you.(oh boy.) you say. She pushes you on the ground. The harpy straddle\u2019s you. Hey! You\u2019re fighting me! Luka said. You\u2019re cuter than any boy I\u2019ve seen. Mate with me. She said. Luka\u2026 stay there and swing when I tell you. You say. What do you mean? He said. Just do it. You say. With one swift motion, you kick her off you and towards luka. Now! You say. He swing his sword and damages her greatly. You get up and rush her and uppercut her in the air, then you punch her hard on the ground. Whoa\u2026.Luka said. You go to her and put you boot on her back and start pulling her wings. Whoa whoa. She\u2019s had enough! Luka said. As she flails to get free, you let her go. She gets up. I\u2019ll\u2026I\u2019ll let you go with just this today! She yelled as she flaps away. And stay out! You say. Damn. Are you always this brutal? He said. Are you looking to be a hero? You say. Yes. He said. Then yes. You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened?! A woman said. The travelers drove away the harpy? Amazing! A girl said. The villagers, coming out of their houses, gathered around both of you. ( There isn\u2019t a single older guys here.) You thought. Driving off the harpy\u2026you both must be really skilled! An old woman said.  From among the crowd, an old woman with a stern face stands in front of both of you. You must be the village chief\u2019s wife. Well now you\u2019re the acting chief. You say. How can you tell? Luka said. Going from village to village and all the things I do, I\u2019ve learned stuff. Like how to perceive events. You say. Locking yourself up in your house even as a child is being kidnapped? Can you call yourself a chief? Not a single person in this village tried to help\u2026 Alice remarked. Grrrr\u2026You say. Hey alice! Luka said. The woman all go silent from alice\u2019s words, and stares at the ground. You said too much, alice\u2026 It isn\u2019t possible for these woman to fight monsters\u2026Luka said. \u2026What can we do? Now, travelers. We hate to impose, but we have a favor to ask of you\u2026The elder said. Hahaha, here we go heroes. See how they force their problems on you both. Alice said. (Control yourself. Can\u2019t lose temper here.) You thought. The elder\u2019s face flashes with anger, but she keeps talking. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re both aware, but there are no men in this village. As you both saw earlier, the harpies are taking all our men. She said. The man I married two months ago was taken\u2026A woman said. My new husband also! Even though he was from another village, he was kidnapped a month ago\u2026Another woman said. Even my fourteen year old son\u2026Another said. That\u2019s terrible\u2026Luka said. Does anyone know why they are? You say. We don\u2019t know\u2026None have come back.  Slaves? Eaten for food? No idea. The elder said. \u2026How awful\u2026Luka said. You remain silent. With no men, this village is bound to fail. Please, travelers. Can you root out the harpies, and return peace to our village? The elder said. Why can\u2019t you do it? Alice said. Oi, Alice! Luka said. It\u2019s not right though? What\u2019s the good of bringing peace if you can\u2019t maintain it by yourselves? To rely on outsiders while hiding in your houses\u2026Pathetic. Alice said. That\u2019s what you think. You say. But It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask weak villagers to fight monsters? Luka said. Well\u2026where do they take them all? Luka said. It seems like they have a settlement to the east of this village, in the forest. The elder said. Are you both really going to them\u2026? A woman said. Yay! Thank you so much, travelers! A young woman said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you both happy now? The fake hero\u2019s easy to influence and the so called already hero\u2026 is already on the bandwagon without question. How many people have you sent to defeat these harpies? Alice said. (So called?!?!) You thought. Am I the first? Luka said. While the old woman hesitates, another woman speaks up. Seven have go in\u2026.none have returned. She said. That many!? Luka said. And when where you going to mention this? You\u2019re too trusting luka. If you defeat them, they\u2019ll be happy, don\u2019t and you both will be sent to your deaths. You still want to help out such a horrible village? Alice said.We don\u2019t have anything to fight them with\u2026..we\u2019re powerless! The elder said. Even so, you\u2019ve sent seven travelers to their death. And now you\u2019re trying to send two more? The harpies are doing something bad, but you all are no better. Alice said. Not arguing against her, all the villagers silently stare at the ground. That\u2019s enough, alice. I\u2019m still going to the harpies village.Luka said. Do you really want to be praised by the people of this village so badly\u2026? You\u2019re willing to destroy yourself with that silly wish, you idiot.Alice said. It\u2019s not about the praise\u2026 I just want to protect the weak! He said. You\u2019re still a fake hero, though.Alice said. \u2026I\u2019ll go too! A woman shouted. My husband died early of a sickness\u2026 My only son, mark, was taken by them! If he\u2019s still alive, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s waiting for someone to help him\u2026As a mother, I have to go! She said. It\u2019s too dangerous, Mary! The elder said. I\u2019m coming too! Another woman yells out.  It\u2019s just like the silver haired woman said. In the heat of a bad situation, we all hid like coward. That\u2019s right\u2026This is our village and we have to defend it! Another girl said. Finally, my eyes are open. This is our problem. A woman said. After few minutes, everyone\u2019s in agreement. An attack on the harpies\u2019 village. But everyone\u2026The elder said. It\u2019s too late chief. We can push an unrelated traveler to solve our problems. A girl said. If we band together, we can do this! Another woman said. Wait a minute! Even if we band together, it\u2019s still too dangerous. Luka said. Harpies are like wolves. There\u2019s always a leader of the pack. Take out the leader\u2026\u2026. You said. And the rest will fall into chaos. Alice said. If that\u2019s true, then I\u2019ll take out the leader! Luka said. No you\u2019re not. I\u2019m going to. I know what you\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s not going to happen. You say. But\u2026Find somewhere safe to wait. Once the leader is down, I\u2019ll give you all a signal to attack. Luka said. We understand. A woman said. You still got stuck with the hardest part\u2026Alice said. Being a hero doesn\u2019t mean taking the easy way out. You say. We still have time before we go. We\u2019ll wait around in the village. Luka said.</span></div></div>",

Alice said. I just want to help them\u2026Even if you call me a fake hero. It doesn\u2019t change what I believe in. Luka said. Humans are selfish, and will trample the weak if it benefits them. Putting their desires ahead of others. While watching the woman prepare alice sighs heavily. They\u2019re sloppy and unorganized; they don\u2019t look that bad when united. Humans are strange\u2026Alice said. Standing right here. You say. Nobody likes being weak. Humans hate to think and imagine there selves like that. Luka said.Hmm. Coming from you, that sounds believable. Alice said. Ahh don\u2019t let her get you down.  You\u2019ve gotten a lot stronger than before. You say. \u2026\u2026thanks. At any rate, everyone\u2019s ready to go. Luka said. Everyone\u2019s ready! A woman said. My first fight\u2026I\u2019ll do my best! A girl said. Alright, let\u2019s head east! Don\u2019t push yourselves! Luka said. You all headed out of the village towards the harpies location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is it\u2026A bit farther and you\u2019ll come across the harpies village. A girl said. Alright. I\u2019ll\u2026\u2026ahem. You interrupt. We will defeat and end the signal. Once they\u2019re all confused and panicking. I\u2019m counting on all of you! Luka said. Be careful! If push comes to shove, run away! A woman said. If i\u2026\u2026we fail,please run away yourselves.  Ready? Luka said. Waiting on you. You say. Hey luka. Alice said. Eh\u2026? He said. \u2026.Make sure you come back. Don\u2019t lose in a place like this. Alice said. \u2026.I won\u2019t lose.( Did hell freeze over?) Luka thought. No sendoff for me? You say. You\u2026\u2026too. Don\u2019t lose here. Alice said. You both charge ahead. We made it this far without being seen. You say. Alice said they would be fast asleep if we came at sunset\u2026wake up early and fall asleep at sunset. So here\u2019s our chance. Luka said. The leader should be in the top tree house. You say. I\u2019m\u2026..nervous. This is the first time people are actually counting on me. Luka said. That feeling never leaves. You say. Do you think I have a chance? At being a hero? Luka said. The road to being a hero isn\u2019t an easy one. Lots of tough choices and fights, but the main thing is what. What are you a hero for? The helpless? The weak? You say. I guess I still have to find out. Promise me something. Luka said. What? You say. If\u2026\u2026.if I don\u2019t make it from this place, Promise me you\u2019ll finish my quest for monster/human coexistence for me. He said. Aw shut up luka. You\u2019re getting in and out of here. And we\u2019re going to knock hard on the monster lord\u2019s door when we get there. You say. Thanks. Ok. Let\u2019s go. Luka said. You both step lightly, not to draw any attention yet, until luka steps on a twig and it snaps. Dammit. Luka said. Hey sis, did you hear someone? A voice said. You\u2019re right\u2026it sounded like a human. Another voice said. Crap! Luka said. Fuck! You say. Two harpies  girls appear. (One\u2019s younger than the other and I sense a bond between them. A sister bond. They\u2019re sisters.) You thought.  Sis, I never seen these two before. The younger harpy said. You\u2019re right\u2026..Why are you in a place like this\u2026? The older harpy said. Caught! Luka! You say. I got this! Luka said as he pulled out his sword. End this quick! We can\u2019t waste time here! You say. (I\u2019ve got to finish this quick before more show up.) Luka thought. Hey\u2026sis\u2026I want to mate this boy\u2026The young one said. Haha\u2026.Do you like him? Ok,Let\u2019s make him your first partner. But first we have to weaken him\u2026 The older one said. Try me! Luka said. He attacks, but the harpies fly into the air. Dammit! Luka said. Not again! You say. That surprised me, sis! The  younger harpy said. Don\u2019t worry, he can reach us from up here. The older harpy said. The harpy twins both step on luka. Hey! Two on one! You say. Just stay back! I\u2019ll handle this! Luka said. He attacks again, but they fly away. It\u2019s useless you know. The young one said. Grrr\u2026! Luka said. We\u2019re burning time here! You say. I know! Luka said. While luka\u2019s talking, he\u2019s gets taken down. Fufu\u2026.caught you! The older one said. She has luka pinned. (Now\u2019s my chance.) Luka thought. Your big sister is holding him down, so play as much as you want. She said. Ok! I\u2019ll make your dick feel good. The young one said. Luka swings his sword and get a critical hit. Aieee! The older harpy said. Sis! The young one said. Alright!  Luka said. Don\u2019t die sis! The young one said. I\u2019m ok\u2026Your older sister will defend you! She said. You meanie! Don\u2019t kill my sister! The young one said. Ahh, geez! Let\u2019s go! Luka said. Fuck! I hate falling back, but in this case\u2026! You say. You and luka run away from the twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn\u2019t give chase. You say. Ahh..we have to make sure we aren\u2019t found again. Luka said. We can\u2019t take our sweet time. They will alert the rest. We have to draw out the leader. You say. Ok. Then we rush at full tilt! Luka said. You both jump from out of the bushes and run forward at full speed towards the tallest tree.  Do you need something from my house..? A voice said. You both hear the sudden flap of wings behind you. You both turn around to an unusual sight. You both see a regal pink looking harpy, standing alone. Are you the leader of the harpies? Luka said. Indeed, I am the queen harpy. Do you both need something from me? However I have a very good guess\u2026 She said. I want you to stop kidnapping the villagers, and return the men. Keep this up and humans will never be able to live peacefully with monsters\u2026Luka said. (reason first. Then he draws his sword. A retro tactic, but doesn\u2019t hurt to try.) you thought. \u2026.You have it backwards, human boy. We are forced to do this because humans can\u2019t live peacefully with us. She said. What do you mean\u2026? Luka said. I have no reason to explain myself to you. This is of very importance to us as well. She said. I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re getting at, but if you don\u2019t release them\u2026! Luka said as he drew his sword. So it has come to brute force\u2026Then I\u2019ll show the power of the harpy queen! She said. Gah\u2026!(This isn\u2019t going to be easy. He did say tough fights were a part of this!) Luka thought. Pointing a sword at a queen is a rather huge crime. Even so, rape is the punishment. I\u2019ll see to it myself that your punishment is carried out. She said. Take this! Luka said. He attacks quickly so she can\u2019t fly away in time. It hits. (She didn\u2019t fly away?) You thought. I see\u2026You aren\u2019t too bad with your sword. She said. It hit? You didn\u2019t fly away like the others\u2026? Luka said. Like I\u2019d fight in such a sloppy manner. She said. (She\u2019s distracted!) I got you! Luka said. Luka jumps in and slashes at her neck! Alright! That had to hurt! You say. The queen massages luka with her feathers. When she stops, shespreads her wings and stands still. Give it your best shot boy. You\u2019re too pathetic to damage me. She said. What\u2026? Luka said. (Come on luka. Don\u2019t attack.) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes luka attack?</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll let you have this for free. She said. Luka keeps standing still. You\u2019re pretty careful\u2026She said. She puts her wings down. Got you! Luka said. Luka stabs at her. Shall we get\u2026.closer? She said. The queen throws luka onto the ground. She leans down on luka. Ohhh\u2026(Could be my chance.)Luka said. You should be pleased. Someone like you gets to mate with the queen. She said. Now! Luka said. Luka attacks as hard as he can and delivers a hard blow. The queen lets go of him. So you waited until my guard was down\u2026You might be better than I thought. She said. She massages luka again. Ahhhh\u2026.he said. Once more! Luka said. He jumps in and slashes at her neck again. (She\u2019s wearing down. For his first real fight, he\u2019s doing pretty good.) You thought.( Could be better.)He said. The queen spreds out her wings and stands still. Are just going to stand there? Come on. She said. Luka remains still. Come on boy. Are you going to pass up a free hit? She said. Luka remains still. You\u2019re pretty careful. She said. She puts her wings down. Take this! Luka said. Luka slashes at her. (One more and she\u2019s done.) you thought. Drown in the ecstasy\u2026She said. She puts luka\u2019s penis between her breats and starts to shake. Ahhh\u2026.Luka said. Feeling good? If you give up, I can make it better\u2026She said. (Not good.) you thought. Haa! Luka said. He ends it with a hit to her neck. How could i\u2026.She said. After that hit, the queen slumps to the ground. She doesn\u2019t have the strength to continue. Alright, I manage to take down the queen harpy! Luka said. In the air! Luka said. He throws a magical cylinder into the air. (Nice job. All you luka.) you thought. As it exploded, you disappear into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, after waiting back in iliasburg, you see luka and alice. Nice to see you. I guess everything worked out perfect? You say. Yeah\u2026.where\u2019d you go? Luka said. I said before. This is your journey and I\u2019ll help you but, you\u2019ll take the fame.  So how\u2019d it go? You say. Long story short\u2026\u2026the harpies and the village are helping one another and the men were taken, but\u2026\u2026it\u2019s complicated. You had to be there to see it. Luka said. Oh\u2026.i think I already know. I also saw the little monster kids. They\u2019re on the up and up. Although, the vampire did try to hypnotize me and make me buy 3,000 herbs. You say. Yeah\u2026me too. Luka said. Ok. Bandits and harpies are done. Now what? You say as you leave the city. How about that village the shopkeeper mentioned? It\u2019s close to my hometown, but I\u2019ve never heard of it. He said. Hm\u2026 it\u2019s not mentioned in y guide book. Maybe there\u2019s a new specialty food to discover\u2026Alice said. You both sigh. Let\u2019s go. You say. You turned southwest, and started to head towards Enrika. You sure this is the way? You say as you keep walking through the woods. He gave rough directions. Luka said. Hm..? there\u2019s an unusual monster\u2026Alice said.  Eh\u2026? Luka said.  She\u2019s gone. You say. In her place, you both see a light skinned elf with a sword on her left leg. An elf? You say. Yeah. They are usually kind hearted and friendly, but some have fallen into darkness. Those are called dark elves. He said. Aren\u2019t they supposed to be\u2026shorter? You say. Turn back to where you came travelers. This isn\u2019t a place man can\u2019t approach. She said. She pulls out her sword and points it at luka. All yours. You say. Why aren\u2019t humans allowed? He said. Because they are human, If you done retreat, I\u2019ll be forced to act. She said. (That sword is blunt. She\u2019ll make an opening and use pleasure.) you thought. Luka points his sword at the dark elf. If you won\u2019t back down, then I\u2019ll force you into deprivation. I will contaminate you with my darkness, and turn you into my play thing! She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere I go! Luka said. He steps in and slashes at her neck. With my mouth, give in to the pleasure\u2026She said. The dark elf starts to suck on luka\u2019s penis.  Luka slashes at her. Will you fall from this\u2026?She said. The dark elf crushes luka\u2019s penis with her breast. Once more! Luka said. He jumps in and slashes at her neck again. Can you withstand this? She said. She presses her breast between luka\u2019s penis. Luka stabs at her. What\u2019s this? My body..She said. The dark elf shrinks down enough to fit into your pocket. I like her already. You say. Sealing me..I\u2019ll remember this! She said. While cursing at you both, she runs away. A dark elf in a place like this. Why on earth..Alice said. Who knows? Luka said. Or cares. You say. I never knew elves were this close to Ilias village\u2026He said. Just a few steps ahead and another monster blocks the path. Tentacles? You say. There are tentacles coming from under her black dress. A purple elf with tentacles? You say. I won\u2019t let you come an closer\u2026I\u2019ll summon a tentacle for both of you, and make you it\u2019s prey\u2026She said. She\u2019s not going to listen to reason! Luka said. Here I go! Luka said. Luka jumps in, and slashes at her neck. Haha. She said. She summons a tentacle that winds around luka\u2019s dick and almost gets you. Hey! You say. Luka attacks her with a quick stab. Can you withstand this? She said. Another tentacle wraps around luka and nearly gets you again. That\u2019s it! You say. You charge her and punch her hard enough that she went through a row of trees. Wow\u2026.Remind me never to make you mad. Luka said. Interesting\u2026with just a minor punch, you sent that dark elf through a row of trees\u2026Alice said. Minor? That was anything but minor. Luka said. Are we there yet? You say. I don\u2019t know. Luka said. After that, You walked around for a few hours. Finally, you see a break in the trees. There it is. You say. You both head towards the village. This is Enrika\u2026? Luka said. Very small village. You say. So it\u2019s like that\u2026Those dark elves make sense now\u2026Alice said. What do you mean\u2026? You say. A lone woman walks out from the interior of the village. (She stands out  against this weird atmosphere from the rest of this village.) you thought.  You\u2026Don\u2019t appear to be a merchant\u2026She said. Th..that\u2019s right\u2026A shopkeeper in Iliasburg told me about this place. Luka said. \u2026Please go away. Other than merchans who trade things we need, we don\u2019t allow anyone else in the village. She said.( They aren\u2019t going to let us in. I wonder\u2026.)You thought. No way\u2026Luka said. You may take offense to our prohibition\u2026but that\u2019s how we\u2019ve lived for a long time. She said. \u2026.We understand. Sorry for bothering you. He said. As you\u2019re about to leave, she notices luka\u2019s ring. That ring! Could you be\u2026Luka!? She said. Uh\u2026That\u2019s right. He said. You really are luka\u2026you\u2019ve grown so big\u2026She said. Um\u2026Do you know me? He said. \u2026yes. My name is Micaela. I knew your mother and father well. She said. But now, please turn back. When the time\u2019s right\u2026.we\u2019ll be able to talk. She said. \u2026.I understand. He said. (She\u2019s not going to give anything else.) Alright\u2026.I\u2019ll come again. Luka said. You all turn away from the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026What a strange village. Luka said. What does it mean\u2026That village\u2026Luka said. What\u2019s wrong alice? When we entered the village, you looked like you realized something. Luka said. I understood something, but what I don\u2019t get is that I was for sure that Enrika was an isolated elf village. She said. Wait. The whole village is elf? You say. That what I thought\u2026But that Micaela woman\u2026She said. Alice sighs like she\u2019s giving up. Whatever, I didn\u2019t get to have a feast in the village like I thought I would. She said. (It\u2019s always food.) you both thought. Well this was a bust. Where to now? You say.<br>\r\nIliasport. Once we get there, we take a ship to sentora. Time to leave this continent. Luka said. We won\u2019t come back here for a long time. Anything you want to do before we go? You say. Nah. I\u2019m ready. Let\u2019s go! Luka said. Hm\u2026if it\u2019s a port town, there should be a lot of foreign delicacies form all over. Alice said. (As long as she eats, she\u2019s fine.) You said. ( if she can unhinge her jaws, I\u2019m taking a gun to the bitch.) he said. Hmmhmm\u2026I\u2019m getting ecited. Let\u2019s go! Alice said. Ok, ok\u2026Luka said. You turn north and head for Iliasport.  The divine protection of Ilias is strong here. Little chances of monsters here. Luka said. Oh. Perfect. You say. As you look over the horizon, you see something. T\u2026.Tom? You say. Coward. He said. You\u2019re not real. You say. He disappears. Hey. You see something? Luka said. \u2026\u2026No. Nothing but grass and a glutton lamia. You say. I heard that. Alice said. It\u2019s getting dark. We should set up camp. A hungry alice is something I don\u2019t want to see. You say. Why? Luka said. You see she\u2019s half snake right. What if she can unhinge her jaws? Do you want to be the first human she ate? You say. Luka imagines that for a few minutes and shutters. We\u2019ll set up camp. Luka said.</span></div></div>",

Listening to luka tell the story of some former hero. \u2026..What do you mean \u201ceveryone lived happily ever after\u201d you idiot. Alice said while biting into her food. Manners Alice. You say. I thought it was a good story\u2026why\u2019d you call me an idiot this time? Luka said. Take a good look at her. And I mean a really good look. Past the human part. You say. I\u2019m a monster. Did you really think I\u2019d enjoy a story about a human killing a monster lord? She said. I dunno. I kind of liked it. You say. If you want to build a peaceful world where everyone can coexist, you\u2019re going to need to have some delicacy about that. She said. Sorry\u2026Luka said. Well\u2026..Heinrich defeated that monster lord is worthy of some credit. She only cared about power, destruction, and chaos. Maybe being taken out by a hero was brought on herself. She said. Brought down by her own mistake\u2026That\u2019s a cunning remark.  Luka said. Trying to rule by power is a savage act. You should expect to get savagery back. She said. You\u2019re right. Luka said. Damn straight! You say. I wonder how the current monster lord is\u2026? It\u2019s said that she\u2019s extremely strong, and may even be the strongest monster lord yet. Luka said. That strong huh\u2026? You mutter. I wonder if the slaughter of ramina was by her as well\u2026She must be a terrible person after all, right alice? Luka said. Who knows? She said. She looks into the sky with a strange expression. Maybe\u2026.the monster lord lost her way\u2026whether humans should be destroyed\u2026She said. Alice, do you know the monster lord!? Have you seen her? Luka said. Yes\u2026.I know the monster lord. She may be closer than you think\u2026She said. To me? I\u2019ve only grew up in the countryside. Luka said. Man, you\u2019re dumb, you idiot. Well, changing the topic\u2026 She said. Alice suddenly stands up. It\u2019s time for more training. Seeing you fight made me disappointed. If you fight the monster lord like that, It\u2019d be horrible. She said. Yeah\u2026.you don\u2019t have to sugar coat it. Luka said. Now, pick up your sword! I\u2019ll show you how you should fight! She said. Please. Who\u2019s going to show you how to fight alice? You say. They train into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s the way\u2026..stabilize your upper body. Step forward with your foot, and quickly thrust into the enemy like I showed you. She said. Like this\u2026? Luka said. He steps forward and lunge quickly. Hm,,it\u2019s not too bad. You need to actual try it out in combat. Not just training. Alice said. Thank you\u2026This is an awesome move! Luka said. After he\u2019s done with alice, he calls for you. So\u2026.done training with the chumps and want to train with a champ? Alright. You say as you jump down from the tree. What now? What we did last time? Luka said. No. You and me. Right now. You say. Y\u2026.you mean\u2026.Luka said. Yeah. Hold up that sword! Let\u2019s see if you can hit me! You say. Luka takes his sword and grips it tightly. Here\u2026..here I come! He said. He slashes at you. Weak! You say. You dodge it. He rebounds and goes for a stab. Slow! You say. You side step. Luka keeps attacking and you keep dodging. You must fight! Fight until your enemy can fight no more! Only then will a victory be guaranteed! You said as you dodge and countered his attacks. You grab him by his shirt and toss him into a tree. Oh\u2026.He said. All the while not wearing yourself out in the process! You say. He gets up. I\u2019ll try my new move! He said. Luka steps forward and lunges quickly. You grab the sword. What\u2026.? How\u2026.? Luka said. I see right through you. You say. You take his sword and hold it at his neck. You can\u2019t beat me using that. Now. Take the sword! You say. Luka takes it. Now! Let\u2019s see if you can block my attacks! You say. You charge luka and he barly blocks you. You keep attacking combining punches, kicks and your knife attacks. Defense...(attacks.)\u2026\u2026is just as important as offense\u2026\u2026. (Attack.)\u2026.. You must not let your defense fall or you will die! Is that want you want?! You say as he blocks you again. No! I\u2019m not going to die yet! Luka said. Then you must keep your defense up at all times! You say. You block his counter attack and hit him in the head. You grab your knife and hold it to his neck. Remember: A monster always finish what they started. You defense is moderate, but one good heavy attack and it all shattered. You tried to counter me, but let yourself wide open. If this was a serious fight and you were my enemy, you\u2019d be dead by now. You say. I\u2026..i\u2026..i see. I\u2019l\u2026.i\u2019ll work on that. Luka said.  You prefer to fight with your bare hands\u2026..and your style\u2026\u2026.i can see you make your own moves and combine them. Alice said. Yes. I make my own moves. Practice them, and use them in combat. Your technique was\u2026\u2026..impressive. Alice said. Oi, oi, Why so quick to compliment him? You haven\u2019t even seen him fight. Luka said. Just by looking at him, you can tell he\u2019s refined. Like he\u2019s been fighting since day one. Plus if he can punch someone just once and send them flying through a row of trees can tell you that\u2019s power. What he does with that power is up to him. Alice said.  Uh\u2026.thanks. I think. You say. Anyway, That\u2019s enough for tonight. Alice said. Yeah, I agree. You say. You find a good spot and lay down and go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Alice said. Ahh\u2026Ilias\u2026Thank you for giving me revelation! Luka said. Praying right as you get up\u2026you\u2019re like some old man. Alice said. Even the young people give their  gratitude to Ilias. Do you want to pray alice? Luka said. Are you kidding? I\u2019m a monster! Why the he;; would I pray to your god?! Alice said. (And the day begins.) You thought. You all continue towards Iliasport. This is a muggy sorest. Luka said. In these places, tropical monsters are likely show. Watch were you\u2019re going. Alice said. Tropical monsters\u2026? Luka said. Like spiders and snakes and other stuff that live in a jungle. You say. Oh\u2026\u2026great. Luka said. And you know what spiders do to their prey? Suck the fluids right out until nothing but skin and bones. You say. Does anyone smell that? Alice said. I think luka pissed himself. You say. Hey, Alice. Even if a monster was going to eat me, would you just watch it all happen? Luka said. It\u2019d be unfortunate, but I\u2019d sit and watch. To my own reasons, I won\u2019t give out special support to a human. She said. Unfortunate\u2026? You say. Sounds like she plans on eating you first luka. You say. S..s..s\u2026she wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u2026Would you alice? Luka said. It would be better to be eaten by me than a monster like that. \u2026Wouldn\u2019t you agree? Alice said. Haaaa\u2026.! Luka said. And the remember the unhinging of the jaws. You say. Let\u2019s just get out of this forest. Luka said quickly. Ok. Snakefood. You say. Iliasport should be close by. Let\u2019s go! Luka said. With amazing seafood delicacies. I can\u2019t wait! Alice said. You  must have better things to do than eat. You just have to. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon arrived in Iliasport. For a port town, it\u2019s not that lively. Alice said. You\u2019re right\u2026I wonder what\u2019s going on. Luka said. It\u2019s like it\u2019s deserted. You say. (A ghost town.) He said. Ask that shopkeeper over there. You say. As luka questions the shopkeeper, you do your own investigating. Hmmm. There are people here, but no commerce. And this is a port town where commerce should happen. You say. So what\u2019s the word luka? You say. A storm keeps hitting ships every time they leave the coast. He said. Every time. Like if a ship leaves right now, a storm will come? You say. Right. That\u2019s why there isn\u2019t anything here. Luka said. That\u2019s not natural. You say. Hm\u2026I see. Alice said. What do you know alice? Luka said. A little. She said. Explain it. Luka said. I can\u2019t say much about it\u2026.A strong youma is blocking the ships. Their goal is to block pilgrims from making it to the Ilias temple. She said. A ypuma..? So we have to beat it! Luka said. If it is a youma\u2026..then that\u2019s what it is. You say. You wouldn\u2019t last long\u2026..but at this rate, I won\u2019t be able to try the forging delicacies\u2026She said. Well, what to do? We can\u2019t swim it. Luka said. You activate the eyes. You see a cave, with a small blue bell. That? You say. What? Luka said. Your eyes return to normal. There\u2019s a cave\u2026..east of here. In there, there\u2019s a bell. It looked important. If you have the bell, no matter how fierce the storm, the ship won\u2019t sink. You say. If this is true\u2026..then this item is something we need. Luka said. But the cave is riddled with monsters. Getting it won\u2019t be easy. You say. Then we need to be prepared. Luka said. As he heads to the entrance of town, you and alice stay back. You\u2019re hiding something. You say. What do you mean alice said. You just happen to know what kind of monster it was off the top of your head. No way. You\u2019re letting on more than you know. You say. \u2026..I have nothing to hide. If anyone\u2019s to be questioned it\u2019s you. You just happen to know where  this cave is and what\u2019s in it off of your head. She said. So what? I just know these things. You say. Like hell you do. I\u2019m not keeping any secret. You\u2019re hiding a busload. She said. You\u2019re hiding something too here, but I\u2019m not going to pressure you to spill and neither are you. What\u2019s in the dark will come to the light. You say. You head for the entrance and you and luka head eastward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan. A lot farther than I thought. Luka said. Shit. Maybe we should have spent the night back in the port. You say. I thought it would only take a few hours. We\u2019re barley halfway. Luka said. You both make camp for the night. Haphazard idiot.  Pick up your sword, we\u2019re training again. Alice said.  I\u2019ll do my best! Luka said. Luka and alice trained for a few hours. Haa\u2026\u2026haa\u2026..haa\u2026..Luka said. (He just improved on the basis. Learning a new move every time would be hard to remember.) you thought. You have so many useless movements. It kills your speed and power. Alice said. I\u2019m swinging with all my power. Luka said. Your movements need to be like the wind, your body one with the earth, and have fire in your sword. Alice said. That\u2019s the secret of fighting. If you can\u2019t get beeter, beating the monster lord will just be a dream. Alice said. Hm\u2026.I\u2019m not very good at those kind of things. Luka mutters while he takes a meditating cross legged postion. Don\u2019t grumble. It\u2019s said that a fallen angle was able to immediately heal all those wounds by meditting. It\u2019s a fake story, but concentrating your body is still important. Alice said. Luka quietly meditates and his wounds heal. It\u2019s true! Luka said. What?! Is that even possible?! What the hell is wrong with your body?! Alice said in shock. \u2026.is it strange? You told me about it. Luka said. Why  do you think it would be normal for you to be healed?!  Having you wounds healed by meditating is strange no matter how you look at it. Alice said. Luka quietly meditates and more of his wounds heal. See. I can do it again! Luka said. What is that\u2026..scary\u2026Alice said. Hey! Quit poking me! Luka said. Hahaha! This is a riot! You say. You\u2019re a strange one\u2026.Alice said.</span></div></div>",

You don\u2019t like foxes? You say. No particularly. I say we find and eat it. Alice said. Carnivore. You say. What does a fox smell like? Luka said. Thin fried tofu. She said. So they smell like vegetarians? You say. Yes. Alice said. Let\u2019s just keep moving. Luka said. The wall and floors are sturdy. Nice place to hold something. You say. If pirates did hide treasure here, there should be traps all around. Alice said. We\u2019ll need to be careful. Luka said. Wait we\u2019re probably not the first to come here. You say. You\u2019re right. Treasure equals people who try to get it. So where are the bodies? Alice said. It feels like ghosts will come out at any second. Luka said. G\u2026 Ghost!? Alice said. Aw\u2026.is the little snake scared off ghost and need her hand held? You joke. N\u2026.No! She said. What\u2019s wrong? Luka said. N\u2026Nothing\u2026Alice said. Alice gets close to luka. Why\u2026.are you so close to me? Luka said. Yo\u2026.you\u2019re the one whose too close. Alice said. Whatever\u2026.Luka said. Besides\u2026..Why would you think I\u2019d be afraid of something like this? There\u2019s no proven fact that ghost are real anyway. Alice said. Now you\u2019re trying to reason. You say. What was that? Luka said. Ooooooooohhhhh. You say. Aieee! Alice said. Alice jumps and wraps her tail around luka. Hahahaha! You\u2019re afraid of ghost! Hahahaha! You say. I am NOT! Alice said.  Ugh! Don\u2019t wrap around me! I wasn\u2019t kidding. I did see something. Luka said. \u2026..This isn\u2019t a ghost. Alice said. Ghost\u2026? Luka said. Don\u2019t say that word! Finish this quickly! She said. Alice disappears in a panic. A monster? Luka said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white fox girl with two tails comes into view.  Wah! A human appeared! She said. Is this the fox alice mentioned earlier? You say. They are called Kitsune. They can be very weak or very strong. The more tails, the more power. She only has two. Luka said. So it\u2019s like the beasts from Naruto. You say. She must be weak. She only has two tails. Luka said. Wh\u2026.what should I do\u2026I got separated from tamamo and now humans show up. She said. I don\u2019t get it, but if you\u2019re attacking humans, I won\u2019t forgive you! Luka said. She told me not to let a human take Poseidon\u2019s bell! I won\u2019t let you two by me! She said. (Poseidon\u2019s bell? What is this god of war?) You thought.( it\u2019s a strong  reference.) he said. Who was it? Luka said. \u2026.That\u2019s a secret! She said. That name you said\u2026..Tamamo was it? Luka said. Auu\u2026She said. Got it. You say. We need to get by\u2026if you won\u2019t let us through, I won\u2019t go easy on you! Luka said. Can I get in on it? It gets boring sometimes just watching. You say. Uh\u2026..Yeah. Why not? Luka said. Hm\u2026.two against one\u2026..Good. You\u2019re going to need a second person to deal with me! She said. Luka steps in with all his strength and sharply thrust his sword. It does huge damage. You attack her with less than 5% of your power because you don\u2019t want to hurt her.  Hmm\u2026..which one goes first? I\u2019ll go for you! She said. She turns her attention to luka. Cover my tail with your white stuff! Her tails rub all over luka. Take this! Luka said. He attacks with a stab and you round house kick her. My tail is really fluffy! She rubs her tail all over luka. Try this! Luka said. Luka jumps in and aims for her neck. While she regains herself. You strong punch her which makes  her knell over. Luka runs and jumps off your back and using the momentum, downward slashes her. Hyaa! She said. The Kitsune turns into a little fox. You can\u2019t do anything bad now. Luka said. Luka sheath his sword. Don\u2019t touch her. Get back! You yell at her. Asserting your dominance, she runs deeper into the cave. Are you finished yet\u2026.? Foxes shouldn\u2019t be in a place like this\u2026 Alice said.  \u2026Then where did she come from? Luka said. Man, those things are really annoying. Alice said. Let\u2019s just keep moving. You say. You go deeper inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a giant boulder in the corner of the passage and a giant ball with spikes\u2026.and a huge pitfall. This trap was triggered. You say. I wonder if it was that kitsune\u2026Luka said. It\u2019s already triggered, so it\u2019s safe we need that bell if we want to get across the sea. You say. Right! Luka said. You quickly rush forward.  What would they want with the bell anyway? Luka said. If you used your head more, you\u2019d figure it out. They\u2019re trying to get the bell so humans can\u2019t get it. Doing all that work to cause a strom whould be pointless if humans got that bell. So they have to get it first. Alice said. The time is strange. If the bell\u2019s been there for so long, and it\u2019s that important, then they would have gone for it already. After only a year, suddenly they\u2019re going for the bell at the same time as we are\u2026Luka said. So you\u2019re not that dense after all. Alice said.  Quiet. You hear that? You say. It\u2019s\u2026.that kitsune\u2026..and she\u2019s struggling in a cobweb. Is that a monster\u2019s trap\u2026? Why would it be caught by a monster? Luka said. Not all monster see each other as allies. Like humans, they fight each other sometimes. Especially the insect type, they\u2019ll make almost anything their feed. That kitsune was stupid. Alice said as she disappears. Cobwebs equal spiders. You say. The spider appears in front of both of you. Stop! Luka said. Hehheh. The siper upper half is human while the lower half is spider. More stupid catch appear. Ohhh\u2026\u2026two delicious looking boys too. I\u2019ll squeeze you both dry\u2026She said. Like hell. Never liked spiders. Always burned them with a magnifying glass! You say. Let the kitsune go! Luka said. Sure\u2026.if I catch you both, I don\u2019t need a tiny monster. Instead I\u2019ll eat both of you. She said. You remember what I said about spider? You say. Yeah\u2026\u2026not going to happen here. Luka said. Luka step in and stabs sharply. You grab your knife and cut her. The one that fights more is always the most tasty. She spins a web that wraps around you.  The hell? You say. I\u2019ll eat you first. She said. Luka slashes at her. I\u2019ll eat you later. She said. She shoots a web that pins luka to the will. Now\u2026.for my meal . she said. Sorry, but i like my insides. You say. You break free from the web and break luka free. Together! You say. Luka jumps in and slashes at her neck while you slash at her lower abdomen. Both you and luka step in with your weapons and stab sharply at her.  How could i\u2026She said. The spider girl turns into a little spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she\u2019s sealed, her cobweb vanishes. The tiny fox, no longer stuck, falls to the ground and turns and run. \u2026..you finished? You both took your time, but you both fought in perfect sync. Alice said. Was that a compliment? You say. You should have just let survival of the fittest take its course. If that spider doesn\u2019t eat, she\u2019ll die. Thinking an act like that is thinking all of nature is evil. You get it? Alice. \u2026..I kew that, but\u2026.Luka said. If you save all the prey, the predator will starve out. \u2026Is that a better out come? Alice said. And if everybody lived like that, would it be any better for them? Nature can take its course, but helping the helpless, is always top priority. You say. But even you should know that you can\u2019t save them all. Are herbivores better than carnivore? If someone declared that, would he be good or bad person? Luka or you wasn\u2019t able to respond to that. \u2026.Well even if you understand it\u2019s pointless. Alice said. Pointless? You say. Even understanding the inherent contradictions, it seems human nature to help something when it happens in front of them. Criticizing the act in self-righteous while still doing it\u2026.hypocrisy. Hypocrisy or not, if someone\u2019s in trouble, survival of the fittest or not, I\u2019m helping them one way or another. It\u2019s called the right thing, but that\u2019s something you wouldn\u2019t understand even if it hit you. You say. The right thing vs the course of nature and survival of the fittest. You know which one is better. Alice said. So if the course of nature or survival of the fittest wants you dead, are you going to just stand by and let it happen? You say. Alice said nothing. Didn\u2019t think so. Luka just believe in yourself. Not her. You say. \u2026\u2026let\u2019s go. We still need that bell. Luka said. \u2026\u2026right. The bell. You say. You keep going further inside.</span></div></div>",

She has 7 tails. Luka said. So she's in a league of her own then compared to the other kitsunes. You say. Yes\u2026.I am Nanabi. She said. Eh\u2026? So you\u2019re not tamamo? Luka said. Past this door is the treasure\u2026.so I can\u2019t let you pass. If you chose not to return\u2026.She said. I\u2019ll advance, even if by force! Luka said. Understood\u2026I\u2019ll show you the power of tamamo\u2019s aide! She said. Ugh\u2026! Luka said. Shrinking back from her overwhelming presence, Luka takes out his sword. You\u2019re not alone luka! I\u2019m here. You say. \u2026\u2026I know\u2026..luka said. Just stay calm\u2026..i got your back. Well do this together. You say. \u2026\u2026Ok. Luka said. Luka steps in and stabs sharply. She barley fazes. Luka follows it with a slash. It barley did anything. Argh! So\u2026.powerful! Luka said. You hit her with force. Your attack shows results. \u2026\u2026You have power behind your attack. Luka runs off your back and aims at her neck. His shows little results. One of her tails comes after you. You block it and counter hit. Luka takes advantage of this and steps in with a quick stab. This one hurts her a little from her defense you wear down. She\u2019s still not paying attention to luka. Strong\u2026..shall I start trying? She said. She starts concentrating her magic. Luka attacks her, but it shows little results. Now prepare yourself\u2026.She said. Seven tails come your way. You remain calm. You dodge them one by one. Wow\u2026..! luka said. You dodge them all\u2026..She said. Nobody will lay a hand on my jewels. You say. Without the moon, it takes time to regen my magic. She said. Sheresting. You and luka attack her. Now\u2026.shall we begin again? She said. One tail grabs and holds luka. Stand aside boy. She said. Let him go. You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTell me\u2026.. I must know\u2026..someone of your caliber is travelling with this little boy who has little to no skills. Why? She said. I\u2019m guiding him. This is his journey. I\u2019m just here to make sure he gets what he wants. You say. But with your skills, surly you could have chosen someone better. She said. Where\u2019s the point or fun of teaching someone who knows everything. This kid may be new to the whole hero thing, but he has the guts, curage, strength, and potential to be a hero. And if you turn, you\u2019ll see why. When she turns her head, luka\u2019s ready with his sword and hits her hard, which makes her drop him. I got a solid blow! Luka said. I see\u2026..have me distracted, lower my guard, and have him deliver a power swing.  She said. She sends 7 tails towards luka. Each tail plays with him. Ohhhh\u2026.Luka said. Heal now luka! You say.  I won\u2019t give you the time! She said. Nanabi stares at luka and you with her magic eyes. Guh\u2026..da\u2026\u2026mn\u2026\u2026guh\u2026.Luka said. Bi\u2026\u2026tch\u2026\u2026.ugh\u2026..You say. You and luka fall asleep. I\u2019ll use my tail to force you to come! She said. Nanibi\u2019s tails shoot out at you and luka. But you and luka dodge it. What the?! She said. Alice\u2026.you shouldn\u2019t eat that\u2026..Luka said. Must\u2026\u2026train\u2026.You say. Was that on accident\u2026!? She said. Her tails shoot out at you and luka again, but you both dodge it.  Guh\u2026\u2026.*snore* Luka said.  Ahhhh\u2026\u2026*snore* You said. Are you mocking!? No\u2026.they are definitely asleep\u2026She said. Zzzzzzzz. Here\u2026.go\u2026.Luka said. Luka attacks in a deadly dance! Luka\u2019s attack does tremendous damage. Kuh\u2026.impossible! he\u2019s a totally different person! She said. Here\u2026..this\u2026.You say. You attack full on. Not holding any power back. They\u2026\u2026they\u2019ve changed! In that case\u2026..how about this!? She said. Two tails shoot at you and luka, but you both dodge them. What the hell..!? She said. *Snore* so full\u2026Luka said.  More\u2026..need\u2026..You say. You and luka build up power. Your energy transfer to your right hand and you throw it and luka shoots his power at her. What is this!? If I get hit by that\u2026! She said. She starts accumulating magic. Take this! My ultimate attack! She said. She attacks with all seven tails. Mmmm\u2026useless\u2026.Luka said. Hmmm\u2026.worthless\u2026\u2026you say. You both counter and a star falls into hell and a black circle appears around her. The star falls on her and black fire engulfs her. Impossible\u2026This\u2026. She said. Nanabi turns into a fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMm\u2026nm\u2026.fwa\u2026.that was a nice nap. Luka said. Ohhh\u2026..ugh\u2026..fwa\u2026\u2026I need that. you say. You open your eyes to the dark cave celling. You both wait a few seconds before you remember what happened. That\u2019s right! Those weird eyes made us fall asleep! Luka said. Where is she? You say. In front of you both, a fox sitting silently. Was\u2026.she sealed somehow? Luka said. What the fuck happened? You say. Suddenly the first kitsune that you both defeated appears. She runs around nervously until she lays down next to the sealed nanabi. What\u2019s going on\u2026? Luka said. You both don\u2019t remember? \u2026..It looks like you guys really were asleep. Alice said. Alice\u2026.what\u2026\u2026just happened? You say. You both were significantly stronger when asleep, but I don\u2019t know why\u2026She said. Eh? I am? Luka said. So\u2026.we defeated her while asleep? You say. I\u2026.don\u2019t remember anything? You say. You should only fight while sleeping from now on. If you do that, it will be an easy trip. Alice said. No way\u2026.Luka said.  Let\u2019s go! This bell must be behind this door. You say. We\u2019re late\u2026Alice said. Why? You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slowly opens\u2026and a lone kitsune appears. She looks weaker than nanabi. Luka said. Idiot. Look at her tails. Alice said. One, two, three\u2026..eight!? it\u2019s only one more than nanabi!  Luka said.( You feel that?) You say. ( yeah. It\u2019s huge. Her power is great.) he said. Idiot. Seven tails isn\u2019t even comparable to eight. She\u2019s one of the heavenly knight.Tammo. One of the top monsters, like Granberia. Alice said. (Like granberia\u2026.) You say.(Damn.) he said. W..what!? Luka said. (This little girl is as strong as granberia?) You say.( Maybe she\u2019s doing what you do. Hold all your power back and when in a match, release it all) he said. Sorry, you two. You became like this as I moved onto the treasure. Tammo said. She pats the two sealed foxes on the head. I\u2019ll give you a tiny bit of my power. She said. Saying that, her palms brightly shine as she pats the sealed kitsune on their heads. The white fox return to normal. Wawawa\u2026She said. She hides behind Tammo\u2019s back.Nanabi\u2026.it will take longer to return you. Sorry, but I\u2019ll have to do it later. She said. Finally tammo faces you both. Hum\u2026.so you\u2019re a luka? Deafeating nanabi\u2026.you must have some skill. She said. Tammo slowly walks around luka, sniffing.  So cute. You\u2019d be a good mate. She said. No way! Luka said. Haha\u2026you\u2019re a good guy. I want to play with someone like you on my bed\u2026She said. She turns her gaze to you. And who are you\u2026? She said. Nobody. You say. She does the same thing to you. You\u2019re cute too. You\u2019d make a perfect mate. She said. I don\u2019t think so. You say.  Luka notices she has the bell. An old bell attached to a string. No way\u2026is that\u2026 Luka said. Indeed. This is the poseidien\u2019s bell. Crossing over the sentoras is so annoying. So I\u2019m taking this. Personally, I don\u2019t care, but Alma elma is so annoying\u2026She said. (Wait you think it could be\u2026.) he said. (Maybe\u2026.) you say. Alma Elma\u2026? Luka said. She\u2019s one of the heavenly knights as well, causing storms that block the route. Alice said. (Hmmm\u2026..no can\u2019t say yet) You thought. IS there a reason why? Luka said. Saying that? What are you planning on doing with the bell? Tammo said. Uh\u2026..defeat you and take it, I guess. Luka said. As he grabs his sword, Alice grabs his wrist. \u2026stop. She isn\u2019t someone you can handle yet. Alice said.(Wait. She just stopped luka from attacking her. If this was a normal monster, she wouldn\u2019t have done that.) you thought. You think for a few seconds until it hits you. (Alice is the\u2026\u2026.) You say. Watching them, tammo starts to laugh.  Haha. That\u2019s surprising\u2026.that human has caught your attention, monster lord? Tammo said. \u2026..monster lord? Luka said. (So my hunch was right. Alice is the monster lord.) you thought.  Alice\u2026..you\u2026.Luka said. \u2026..Did you just realize it, idiot? I am the monster lord. Alipheese the sixteenth. She said. No way! Luka said. Oops\u2026was I not supposed to say that? I spoke out of place\u2026Anyway I\u2019ll be taking that bell\u2026.hm? Tammo said. The small kitsune pulls at her sleeve. What\u2026? Hmmm\u2026.I see\u2026. \u2026.i see. So you saved her life, Luka? Then as the leader of the kitsune\u2019s, I must thank you. She said. As she walks up to luka, she laughs softly. How do you want me to thank you? Fried tofu, or do you want to touch my special fluffy tail? She said.</span></div></div>",

I only fight those whose try and stop monsters and humans from coexisting. Luka said. Hm\u2026An admirable effort . However, we will fight eventually. After all, I am one of the heavenly knights. She said. \u2026.if it happenes, it happenes. Luka said. Well then, farewell. She said. She places the bell in lukas hand and she and the other two vanish. You and luka are left alone with alice who has a dark expression on her face.  \u2026.so Alice. You\u2019re the monster lord\u2026? Luka said. \u2026I didn\u2019t hide it. You weren\u2019t smart enough to figure it out. Alice said. Looking back now, it was pretty stupid not to notice\u2026Luka said. And what about you? You\u2019ve been quiet the whole time. Alice said. (All this time, we\u2019ve been travelling with her. Why did she hide it?) You thought. Why\u2026.did you decide to travel with me? Luka said. My answer\u2019s the same as before. You\u2019re an interesting human. And I wanted to see the world with my own eyes. Travelling with you satisfied both my interest. Alice said. Did you declare all-out war on humans? Luka said. Only in self-defense are you allowed to exert power. That was my only command to them. It must have gotten one-sided when it reached human ears. I don\u2019t want a full scale war\u2026It would be bad for both sides. Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Exert power not to rule, but for self-defense\u2026? Luka said. But why was granberia attacking Iliasburg!? Luka said.  A lot of monsters have taken a\u2026..liberal approach to what I said. An inexcusable act! Alice said. Luka said.  Well that\u2019s the end of that talk? So what now luka? The person you have to beat is right in front of you. Alice said. Uh..? Luka said.  Luka thinks for a moment. Don\u2019t joke around. What would you have done if I challenged you? Luka said. Besides, if you vanish right now, wouldn\u2019t all the monsters be confused and in panic? Luka said. Hm\u2026.they might. I want them to obey my orders\u2026but I still get the wishy washy ones like granberia and Alma Elma. So the person causing the storm between the continent was Alma Elma herself, and not your order? luka said. But you know\u2026granberia has always insisted that the Ilias temple is the main source of evil. It\u2019s a human factory than churns out humans to fight monsters. She argues that destroying it is self-defense. As a theory, it\u2019s not far from the mark. The who called themselves heroes are horrid. But is it ok? Not fighting me. Alice said. I\u2019ve told you before alice, I only fight monsters that get in the way for coexistence. \u2026..you\u2019re different. But\u2026.aiming at the castle is still my goal. And the heavenly knights are going wild with their own things. Luka said. I can understand there viewpoints. That\u2019s why I usually leave them alone. Alice said. I have my own viewpoints as the monster lord. All monsters are my cute subordinates. No matter what you say, I won\u2019t raise a hand to defeat my own subordinates. You understand, right? Alice said. I won\u2019t ask for your help. You\u2019re traveling with me, but not my ally. Luka said. \u2026.Exactly. Alice said. \u2026..Alice. You say. Yes? She said. What you said this whole time\u2026\u2026.when you said you were the monster lord\u2026\u2026I expected your true colors to show, but\u2026..what you said\u2026..you\u2019re far from evil\u2026\u2026your goal is kindof like luka\u2019s dream except you can order it, but where\u2019s the fun? Traveling with you to it the castle\u2026\u2026it might be strange, but then again\u2026\u2026it just might be fun. So what do you say? Travel partners? You say as you extend your hand. Alice hesitates, then smiles. She shakes your hand. Travel partners. Alice said. Just tone it down on the rudeness. Alice said. With the bell in hand, you all headed out of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive back at the port. Alright let\u2019s find a ship. You say. You go to the harbor. Luka talks to the captain of one. Excuse me\u2026.we\u2019d like to take boat to the sentora continent. Hah! You must be kidding boy. You know what happens to any ship that leaves here, right? The captain said. If we hang this from the bow, the ship will be fine. Luka said. \u2026.Don\u2019t be ridiculous. If a dirty bell could, I\u2019d be rich. The captain said. If you let me give it a try, you\u2019ll understand. I\u2019ll prove I\u2019m not lying. Luka said. I don\u2019t have enough free time to listen to a brat\u2019s prank. The captain said. You and alice nod at each other. \u2026.Move luka. Alice said. Alice stands in front of the captain. Oh\u2026.what a pretty lady. I\u2019d give you a special ride. The captain said. Your eyes turn optical and alices suddenly glow. \u2026..Follow my commands. Alice said. You will listen to us. You say. The captain straightens his posture and stands at attention.  Yes. I will obey. He said. Take us to the sentora  continent. Start at once. Alice said. Understood. He said. And while you\u2019re at it. Have a truck load of any food you can find and give it to the nice lady here. You say. Yes, sir! Oi, you all. Pack it up and prepare to depart! The captain said. Ro\u2026.roger. The sailors said. Alice\u2026..did you both just hypnotize him? Luka said. Haha\u2026.these are magic eyes that only high ranking monsters have. Using them I can charm, confuse, petrify, and cause someone to faint at will. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt night onboard, alice is training luka. Jumping during battle is suicidal. It\u2019s damn obvious where you\u2019re going, but with this move, you\u2019ll be too fast for anyone to track and be able to crush the skulls of your enemies. Alice said. Like this\u2026? Luka said. He climb the mass and swing his sword as he jumps off. With alice guiding him, he repeats it. Hmm. You\u2019re still immature with it, but you learned it quickly. Alice said. \u2026..thank you. Luka said. The sea starts to rage. In this intense water, a ship would capsize, but this one\u2019s not even rocking. You say. The bell is softly glowing. Alice\u2019s expression turns dark. Suddenly the storm vanishes. Strange\u2026.You say. What\u2019s happening? Luka said. Right after the wind fades\u2026.A beautiful monster appears on the bow. It shocks you because it\u2019s the same one you saw last time. The succubus. You\u2026.! You and luka said. I see\u2026..so you\u2019re that human. That boy that caught alice\u2019s eye\u2026..you look delicious. She said.  She turns her gaze to alice. Lord alice. According to your order, I\u2019ll exterminate the hero who\u2019s attacking monsters. May I execute your orders of defense? She said. \u2026..I don\u2019t give excpetions. I\u2019m just observing this boy. Alice said. It\u2019s like that luka boy. I won\u2019t let you through this area. She said. Luka\u2026.boy? luka said. I\u2019ll beat you and pass by through force! Luka said. As luka grabs his sword, you hold him back. Out of your league. Besides, I\u2019ve got unfinished business with her. You say. You\u2026.know her? Luka said. You can say that. Just like tammao said about her, you\u2019ll fight her soon, but for now, sit this out. You say. Luka hesitates at first, but relents. Alright. Have at her. Luka said. You stand in front of Alma Elma. Remember me? You say. Huh\u2026\u2026oh yes. I remember you. She said. You caught me off guard last time. This time will be different. You say. (You still have\u2026.those?) he said.( The pills? Yeah? But it\u2019s too dangerous.) you say. Heh heh. How should I violate you first? With my hands, maybe squeeze you with my breast, maybe with my mouth/ She said. None of the above. Because you won\u2019t be violating me at all! You say. You charge her, but she flies into the air. Not this time. You say. You\u2019re eyes turn optical and you disappear and reappear behind her. You kick her and she blocks it. Got you! You say. While she\u2019s guarding her right side, her left is wide open you hit her on her on her left side. You pound her towards the sea. At the last second, she stops herself. You disappare and reappear behind her and go for it again, but she\u2019s expecting it and grabs your leg and grabs and hold you. Such strength and determination from you. She said. Let go! You say. Why don\u2019t you just let me suck you dry and show a heaven you\u2019ll never forget? She said. Sorry, I have a girlfriend! You say. You break free and uppercut her. You disappear and reappear behind her as she flies in the air. You hit her all around and the final time, you go for another, but she grabs you and takes you into the sea. As you struggle, she kisses you, slowly stealing your breath. The weight of the water is increasing and slowing you down and taking away the fight. (Just surrender. It\u2019ll be a whole lot better for you.) She said. You break free hit her upward. Luka and alice look aver the ship edge. How long it\u2019s been? Luka said. It\u2019s only been a 3 minutes since they\u2019ve been underwater. Alice said. The Alma shoots through the surface and you disappear and reappear behind her. You start concentrating and black fire explodes, but she barely dodges it You both land on the ship. Huff\u2026..huff\u2026..huff\u2026\u2026Taking me underwater\u2026\u2026kissing me to stop me from breathing\u2026\u2026dirty\u2026..but effective. You say. Huff\u2026..huff\u2026..huff\u2026.She said. You\u2019re worn out as I am, and to tell the truth, I wasn\u2019t even using half of my strength. You say.You say. Impressive. So this is what you can do. And I wasn\u2019t even trying that much, but still you took me on. This time\u2026..i\u2019ll let you have the win. She said. Such a thing is fine, right alice? Alma said. If that\u2019s what you want. Alice said. Heheh. It\u2019s like that tough boy. I\u2019ll retreat this time. But next time I\u2019ll be serious opponent. She said. She licks her index finger at you. I\u2019ll violate you like this\u2026..even if you scream\u2026..even if you faint\u2026\u2026teasing you all over, I\u2019ll show you a hellish pleasure. She said. And next time, I\u2019ll rip those wings off and your horns and shove them up your ass. Then again, you might like it. You say. Until then\u2026..She said. A strong wind blows and she vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes return to normal and alice and luka stare at you. What? I said something bad? You say. No\u2026..just\u2026..wow\u2026..Luka said. \u2026..I don\u2019t say this much, but very good. Alice said. It\u2019s late and I\u2019m wet. I want to go to bed. You say. You head inside the cabin. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day after the ship was attacked, you arrived a port natila. We\u2019re here. Luka said. Stepping on a new continent.  This is going to be fun. You say. Alice is giving you a curious look. \u2026..Unlike Illias port, this place is lively. Alice said.  This is the main port for the sentora continent. Luka said. That explains all the commerce. Pepole back and forth between shops,  buyers trying to sell their stuff and\u2026\u2026.mermaid? You say. Mermaid!? Luka said. Luka sees a mermaid among the crowds. They\u2019re walking on their tail fins. You say. According to the book, port Natalia has a lot of mermaid. This town accepts mermaids as residents. Alice said. Hey luka, isn\u2019t this how your dream supposed to be? Even though only mermaids are only allowed. You say. Yeah. This is how it\u2019s supposed to be. Luka said. Where are we even going now since we\u2019re here? Alice said. For now, We\u2019ll make our way to San Ilas castle to the west. The faith in Illias is strong there, so they should welcome heroes. Luka said. \u2026..Will they welcome fake heroes as well? Alice said. I have the heart of a real hero! Luka said. Who gets raped by a lamia, and kept me up all night. Probably the city hasn\u2019t forgotten. You say. Uh\u2026..Luka said. So who rules there in San Ilas castle? You say. The high priest. It\u2019s a theoretical city. Luka said. A priest? You think he can tell you\u2019re not baptized? You say. Hm\u2026I don\u2019t particular want to go. The food seems bad too. Alice said. Oh man. Her gut\u2019s empty. You whisper to luka. Suddenly a beautiful mermaid comes up to luka. Um\u2026.excuse me\u2026.Mr traveler\u2026\u2026could I speak with you for a moment? She said. Y\u2026..yes, of course. Luka said. Business before pleasure, hero. You say to luka. I noticed your sword, and couldn\u2019t help but notice you\u2019re not an ordinary person. She said. Yeah. I see why. Luka said. Someone who holds such an extraordinary sword\u2026.would you be willing to listen to my story\u2026? She said. Before he responded , there was a large noise that rings out. What was that!? You say. An explosion!? Luka said. A building in the plaza suddenly collapse. OH no, The mermaid school! The mermaid said. Ah shit! You say. You both rush to the ruins of the building. All the nearby residents gather around the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smell gunpowder\u2026..A bomb was detonated. Alice said. A bomb!? Luka said. A lot of mermaids are crawling out of the rubble, as solider try to save the wounded. You go to lend a hand. Ugh\u2026..! Help me left this! A soilder said. You help him remove the rubble from ontop of a mermaid. You drag her out from under it and carry her to safety. No deaths have been called. You say. Luka sighed in relief. But then luka sees someone familiar in the crowd. You!! Luka said. \u2026..What\u2019s wrong luka? Alice said. The man slipped back into the crowd. Did he set that bomb? You say. Luka\u2026\u2026you\u2019re sweating a lot. Did you know that filthy old man? Alice said. He was my father\u2019s closet friend\u2026Luka said. (Lazarus\u2026\u2026still doing this\u2026..) Luka thought. \u2026\u2026let\u2019s keep going. Luka said. No. Let\u2019s rest in the town for tonight. Do you even know how much of a sweat you worked up? Alice said. Your body is shaking and  your head  is sweating a lot. You say. Im\u2026.I\u2019m fine. Luka said. Idiot, don\u2019t say that when you look terrible. Let\u2019s find a hotel for the night. Alice said. As luka struggles, Alice forcefully drags him to a hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Thanks alice, I\u2019m feeling better already. Luka said. By the way, who was that flthy man? When you saw him, your face got pale. Alice said. He\u2019s one of the leader of the Ilias Kreuz group. \u2026..he might be top leader now. Luka said. Ilias kruez\u2026\u2026I already don\u2019t like it. Alice said. They\u2019re radicals. You say. Yes. They\u2019re horrible. They take a fanatic stance on Ilias\u2019s teaching, and advocate the extermination of all monsters. The one that says no intercourse with a monster, they believe it means you should have any contact with a monster at all. Don\u2019t talk to monsters, don\u2019t even look at them. Luka said. Damn. There\u2019s always people who take the teaching of anything too far. You say. I see\u2026\u2026so you\u2019d be their enemy with what you\u2019re trying to do. Coexistence is the opposite of their goals, after all. Alice said. They\u2019re worthless fanatics. They preach about the eradication of monsters. Not just the ones on the road, but the ones with settlements and town. Luka said. Well we can\u2019t just let them get away with it. You say. I see\u2026.so they were behind the attack on the mermaid building. Sheesh\u2026\u2026Among the worthless are even more worthless. Aice said. But most people don\u2019t listen to them. People see them as too radical. Even back in my home village where the faith was strong, people thought it was too radical. Luka said. So they just go around killing monsters. You say. Being isolated only made them more fanatic. \u2026..How worthless. Alice said. Coexistence won\u2019t be easy with people like that. Luka said. \u2026..I see, but still I\u2019m surprised. I thought you didn\u2019t know a single thing about the world because of your head filled with sunshine and rainbows. Alice said. I\u2019m not that ignorant of the world. Luka said.  By the way\u2026\u2026I\u2019m hungry\u2026\u2026Alice said. By the time she said that, you\u2019re already out the door. He\u2019ll be fine in there\u2026\u2026I hope. You say. You head for the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to the bar and see it's not that packed. You go to the bartended and she's a cute mermaid with pink hair. Haven't seen you before.......what will you have? She said. I don't drink, but give me what their having. You say.  One regular. She said. She makes a froth mug of beer and gives it to you. You chug half off it. A cute boy like you must be staying somewhere. She said. Nah. you say. Well there\u2019s an extra room upstairs. She said. And you\u2019re willing to give me that room? You say. For a cute boy like you, yes. She said. She hands you a set of keys. You drink the last of you beer and takes the keys. Thank you mam. You say. You head up the stairs and enter the lone room. Being in a bar\u2026..reminds me of my days as a mercenary. There\u2019s a window, bed, and a few other necessities. You lay down on the bed and go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

You say. You head out and place the key on the bar table and leave to get luka and Alice You wait at the entrance to town for Luka and alice. then they get here. there you two are. We should get going. You say. you head for san Ilis. you headed west along the beach.. So we're heading for san IIis? Alice said. yes. About a three day walk to the west. I wanted to ask the king about the path of a hero.  Hrm......how stupid. Alice said. he just need some guidance. There's more than one way to be a hero. You say. As you're walking across the beach, alice is still giving you a curious look. If you want to ask, then go ahead. you say. Ask what? Luka said. ......alright. I'll start by asking how were you able to keep up with Alma Elma for someone who hasn't fought that much here. Alice said. Like you've been doing with luka, I've been fighting for a long time. You say. That still doesn't answer my question. How'd you move so fast? one minute you're on the ship, next , you're in the air with her. Alice said. it's called speed. you say. Bullshit. Nobody moves that fast. Alice said. You disappear and reappear behind her. What.....when!? Alice said. Good enough? You say. You disappear and reappear in front of her. Ok.....maybe you are fast, but how are you so powerful? you're able to kill someone with one punch. Alice said. Can you really...? Luka said. yeah. I can do more......but I won't do it here. You say. Are you even human? Alice said. I ask myself that every day. You say. let's continue this discussion when we don't run the risk of being food. You say. You keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to a prairie. Big open field.....alice is gone. You know what that means? you say. Luka pulls out his sword. A lamia appears. An unbaptized traveler. how rare. I'll coil around you. Slowly squeezing the life out of you, i'll torment you. She said. guh.....Luka said.(Lamia are tough monster. She doesn't look strong, but i'll have to be careful.) Luka thought. Luka steps in and sharply stabs her. It feels good doesn't it? she said. She massage luka with her tail. take this! Luka said. he slashes at her. I'll tightly wrap around you. She said. She coils around luka's body. Is this what you wanted, to be wrapped by me... be happy I'm going to squeeze everything out of you now. She said. Luka! You say. Luka remembers your training. She tightens her hold on luka. I'll squeeze my prey until you can't fight anymore. Get.....off! Luka said. he struggles and gets free. that's the first a human has gotten away from me. No matter. I'll wrap around you again. She said. here I come! Luka said. Luka climbs up a tree and jumps off the top. Luka delivers a devastating hit to her head. gah! She said. She's reeling, but doesn't go down. Even though you're a human, you put up quite a fight...if that's the way, then play time's over! She said. She takes off her clothes. Grrrr......she's stubborn...Luka said. You made me mad. I won't let you get away anymore! She said. She tightly coils around luka. I'll squeeze  tighter and tighter around you until you're weak. I'll violate you by force, and squeeze you dry! hse said. guh....!So tight! Luka said.( His arm is free. I hope he figures it out.) you thought. Luka attacks with his free arm. I'll squeeze you tigher until you can resist. She slowly tightens her grip on luka. A few more times and you won't be able to resist. She said. Luka attacks again. tighter.....tighter....She said. She keeps squeezing luka. (if this keeps up, she's going suffocate him.) You thought. Auuu....Luka said. Is it painful? Soon you won't be able to resist. She said. Luka attacks again.  You won't be able to move soon. She said. She tightens her hold on luka. One more and you're done. She said. Luka swings with all his remaining strength. No way....how could I.....lose? She said. the lamia turns into a tiny snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka gasps for air. breath man breath. you did it. you say. is it over? let's keep going, then. Alice said. .....that's it? Don't you think I've improved? Luka said. A little. Alice said. No insults? No how it makes you feel? You say. I say we take it and keep going. Luka said. You all continue to San Iias. San IIas started out as a massive cathedral, and eventually a castle. From then on, it started to grow. all heroes want to meet with the king......but there's a problem, He will only meet with baptized heroes. Luka said. maybe he won't notice. You say. Standing in front of the gate, there are a lot of strong looking heroes who seek an audience with the king. it could be a while. you say. Are you also looking for an audience with the king? please sign your name on the application form. A guard said. Luka signs his name and hometown. Come on. let's go inside. Luka said. Alice has a bored expression on her face as you and luka entered the castle. The architecture is renaissance. You say. it's amazing! Luka said. Their religious artwork, painting, and IIlias. covered the walls. Alice seems bored and since you don't believe in luka's goddess, you were a little bored. This is amazing! Luka said. he stops in front of a giant statue of IIlias. this is the famous magnificent IIias goddess statue. Luka said. Ego. You say. is that so. Alice said. For thousands of years, this statue has guided humans. Luka said. You know that everyone is careful when walking around to not point their sheathed sword at the statue? Luka said. No. You say. it's one of the five commandments. Point your sword at her and thou shall cry. I;ve been careful not to do that. Luka said. .....How stupid. Since I hate stupid things, can I destroy it? Alice said. What are you saying!? Didn't you hear me!? Luka said. I heard, you idiot. Don't point your sword at the goddess? making sure you slaves don't become hostile to your owner. you idiots even apply it to her own statues. Alice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey Alice. Look.  You say. Alice looks and sees you pointing your knife at the statue. You and alice laugh while luka takes and sheaths your knife. Are you crazy!? Luka said. Just having some fun. Alice liked it. You say. Hey, is there a mr. Luka here? A luka that applied for an audience with the king? A guard said. Yes\u2026.I\u2019m luka. Luka said. Fearfully, he slowly walks to him. Hmm\u2026.so it\u2019s you? The king will meet you right away. He said. Luka was hastily  pushed into the audience hall. With you and alice following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king looked more like a wise old man, but he seems restless. I\u2019ve brought him king. The guard said. Thank you, you\u2019re dismissed. He said. It\u2019s just the 4 of you. Traveler that is called luka\u2026\u2026I wish to ask you a question.  Ok\u2026.Luka said. You\u2026.you\u2019re not baptized are you? He said. \u2026.that\u2019s right. I\u2019m not baptized. Luka said. The kings eyes shoot open. So it is just like iIlias showed me in dream.  Luka is stunned and king looks excited. last night, Iilas came to me in a dream. her beautiful hair and pure face. he appearance was......that doesn't matter.....get to the important part. Alice interrupted. Alice! Watch what you say to the king. Luka said. .....Anyway, IIlias gave me a revelation. An unbaptized person named Luka would come before me. And this unbaptized hero will beat the monster lord. He said. I...will? Luka said. Now, I shall indicate the path you should take! there are three wise men on this continent. You need to demonstrate your power to all three of them and receive their blessing. I shall bestow this only to the one who receives all three blessing. he said. The kink motions to an amazing sword next to his throne. Dazzling brilliance, it gives off a radiant light. The sword of a true hero. the goddess sword. If you wield that sword, all monsters, even the monster lord, will bow to you. He said. Alice looks calm. She's not bowing to the sword. Now, begin your quest to get proof from the wise men! he said. What a stupid quest. Alice said. She and you walk towards the sword. What are you two doing? Luka said. What's the big deal about this sword? you say. Alice grabs the sword and raises it above her head. In the next moment, the sword shatters. How can this be!? the king said. Alice! Luka said. I can tell, that wasn't going to hurt anyone. You say. With crap like this, you won't hurt anyone. I'll show you the real way. Go to the four spirits and ask for there blessing. Alice said. Four spirits....? Luka said. undine, salamander, gnome, and sylph. They should be somewhere on this continent. Alice said.  And what happens when I do? Luka said. You'll get a might power from each of them. Alice said. .....Really....? Luka said. Even if you do the quest, the sword is shattered. And besides, I think the king has lost it. You say. Ok......I believe you. Luka said. Let's get out of here. the king has lost his mind. You say. You all leave the audience hall. There's chaos all over. you say. That was necessary. there's no way a sword like that could make any monster bow. You say. At any rate.....let's get out of here. Luka said.</span></div></div>",

No! It's one of the heavenly knights, Granberia! He says before he faints. What happened!? Another guard said before he faints. No way...! Luka said. Suddenly standing in front of luka is Granberia. Granberia! Luka said. Luka pulled out his sword and stands in front of her. Her presence is as powerful as before. Oh.....you got the basic down pact. And your holding it right. Graberia said. This time you're attacking San IIla this time? Luka said. Don't joke around. I have no point attacking a place in the middle of nowhere. I came here for two reasons. I came here to cross swords with you. She said. M....me!? Luka said. I want to see if they are just exaggerating your abilities. I'll confirm it with my sword! Now let's have a match! She said. Guh.....I'll stand and fight! Luka said. Luka step in and thrust sharply. Oh....thunder thrust. Not bad......Granberia said. She quietly holds up her sword. Luka attacks. that can't be all you got....She said. granberia quickly hits the hilt of his sword. (She's testing him.) you thought. I got you now! Luka said. he jumps in and slashes at her neck. Demon decapitation.......it has force and some power behind it. She said. She quietly hold up her sword. Luka attacks her with a quick stab. Surly you won't fall to a small attack. graberia lightly slashes at luka's sword. Take this! Luka said. Luka puts his strength into one good slash. Hmmm......focusing all of your strength into one move......Luka said. Luka has a smirk on his face. He turns and uses his elbow to open her defense and goes for a free hit. I've seen that before.......so you've been teaching him? Granberia said. What I can. You say. I won't hold back forever! She said. She hits luka with part of her strength. Try this! Luka said. He climbs the ceiling and delivers a crushing blow to her head. Demon skull beheading..........so they weren't exaggerating after all. you have potential. .....Interesting. I'll let you live a little longer. She said. Eh....? Luka said. Don't disappoint me. Don't get beaten by a worthless monster. She said as she turned her attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you've been training this boy how to fight? She said. I didn't teach him those move, but I did teach him how to open up a person's defense. I see.......you remember what you said last time we meet? She said. Like it all happened yesterday. you say. You take luka's sword and point it towards her. This time.....I won't lose! She said. You both charged at each other and exchanges blows. while in a lock, you kick her back. Let's see what you've learned! You say. She cuts down everything in her path.  You block with the sword. You parry it and slice downward. She uses the hilt and hits you in the stomach. You block her attack and upper slash her. Come on. Surprise me. You say. She breaths out fire. Whoa! You say. You dodge it. (use the black fire.) he said. (can't I don't want to make a scene.) You say. granberia steps in like thunder and quickly stabs. You grab the sword and push her back. You jump in the air and downward slash her. She dodges it and the sword is lodge in the ground You kick her back and as she travels back, you use your fists and pound away at her. She dodges them at first, but she can't keep track of your movements and you start landing hits. her back hits a wall. you go for a punch and she moves out of the way. Creating a medium size hole in the wall. Graberia swings her sword and sends you flying back over your sword. You get up and remove it with ease. you actually go a hit. You have been training. You say. The wound her sword left has already healed. Come on. Show me more! You say. She stands ridged and creates two clones of herself. Impressive, but it's going to take more than that to beat me. You say as your eyes turn optical. ( the real ones on the right,) you thought. You attack each other. You attack in a flurry on one clone and it disappears. you block a attack from behind and slash rapidly at this clone and it disappeared. You hit the real one just quick enough before she could attack you. You slash at her repeatedly. She still stands strong. Still standing.....? you're tough. Show me something I haven't seen before. You say. Wow......standing against granberia on equal terms. Luka said. Granbereia's sword catches on lightning. Lightning!? You say. Just like fire, I've learned to utilized lighting to enhance my attacks! She said. Your sword catches on fire.  You both attack each other and your attacks are blocked by the other person. During s break, granberia vanishes. You block and attack from behind. You hit her with your fist and slam the sword on the ground. A wave of fire shoos out. Granberia jumps into the air. She slams down hard with her sword. you block, but the impact forced you to the ground. You kick her off you and jump in the air and hold the sword downward. She blocks  it and shoves you off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're slowing down granberia. You say I still have one more trick. She said. She concentrate both fire and lightning on her sword. She breaths fire at you, but it doesn't hit, just lands at you feet. through the fire, granbria charges and somehow got a hit on you. She swings her sword and sends you flying into the wall. You hit it hard. Now do you see!? She said. Heh heh. Oh......I see alright. You say. You get up and brush yourself off. I see I need to take it up a notch. you say. You power up. you charge at her with the entire sword radiating with black flames and charge at her. She charges at you and you both slash at each other. You both pass each other and after a few seconds, granberia falls. No......All that training......She said before she collapse. Her sword stops radiating. your eyes return to normal and the firs goes away. Luka and some guard are stunned from that battle. You had luka his sword back. She's improved.......is she alive? you say. She's still breathing.....she'll live. Seeing granberia in such a state. this is going to damage her pride. She's only going to train harder to defeat you now. Alice said. Man. She's that obsessed? You say. Dragons, like lizard girls, are almost impossible to drive off once you've impressed them. And it looks like she like you more than luka. Alice said. And she decides to show it......by swinging a giant sword at me. You say. that's just the woman she is. Alice said. Most of the guards weren't killed. Maybe she's not bad at all...Luka said. can we just go? people are staring. You say. We still need to find out where the spirits are. Luka said. isn't there a library in the basement? Alice said. Yeah. We could go there. Luka said. Yeah. you go......I've already attracted too much attention to myself. You say. You leave the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich pov will you follow? </span></div></div>",

I\u2019m here to help you and him out. All you need to do is a job for me. He said. \u2026\u2026.my days of killing and stealing for money and favors are over. You say. What I have isn\u2019t money or a favor to be called in. It\u2019s something that could help you both in the long run. He said. I don\u2019t need help. You say. You don\u2019t, but he will. Let\u2019s be honest\u2026\u2026the rate he\u2019s going now, he won\u2019t even make it to the monster lord castle, let alone get in. I have something that could boost that and all I need you to do is a job for me. He said. \u2026\u2026..Fine. What is it? You say. There have been some monsters that have been lurking around in the east of here. I want you to go there and kill them. Bring me each one of their teeth as proof. He said. How dangerous are these monsters. You say. Nothing you can handle. The job\u2019s waiting if you want it. He said. When you look to see who it was, he was gone. You sigh deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the bar and head east like the guy said. You come across a forest. You hide in the trees. Alright. Where are these monsters at. It wasn\u2019t a long walk. I see why the guy might want this done. You say. You see three monsters. A beetle girl, a plant thing girl, and a spider girl. Great. You say. You take a good look and see that they aren\u2019t hostile to each other. These monsters don\u2019t have a single bad bone in them. In fact, they\u2019re nice. You say. (Am I doing the right thing?) you thought. You hold out your hand. Just one more and that\u2019s it. No more contracts. You say. You use your low level energy attack so it won\u2019t hurt them much. You\u2019re aim at them. You start sweating. You evergy balls at them. You had your eyes closed the whole time, so you don\u2019t know if they hit. When you open them again, you see bodies on the ground. You jump down from the tree and check. You pull out one of each of their teeth\u2019s and return to the bar. You sit at the table. Keep them coming. You say. After 20 minutes and 12 glasses, you hear a voice. Well. Is it done? A voice said. You put the teeth on the table. I took their human teeth. You say as he takes them. There\u2019re not human son. Never were in the first place. He said. So I did my part. What about you? You say. He places a small glass with sparkling dust in it. What is it? You say. The knick in the monster lord\u2019s armor. You give that to her and she\u2019ll be easy as pie to beat. He said. How do I know if it works? You say. Trust me son. It works. Now how you give it to her is completely up to you. He said. When you look back, he\u2019s gone. What did I get myself into? You say. You take it and put it in your pocket. You leave the bar and head back to San Iias. When you get there, you see luka sitting on a bench, reading an old looking book. What\u2019d I miss? You say. Alice stared a fire in the library. Luka said. A fire!? You say. It was an accident. She said. \u2026\u2026did you find that book about the spirits? You say. It wasn\u2019t easy to get, yes. Luka said. You had to fight monsters to get it. No way someone would just let that book go. So where are these spirits? You say. Salamander is in the volcano in the gold region, on the north end of the continent. Undine is in the east end of the sentora, near the holy springs. Gnome is on the west end of sentora, somewhere in the deserts of safina. And sylph is in the forest of the spirits, close to where we are now. Luka said. So sylph would be the closest for you to go get. You say. It would take three days. Luk said. Elves live separately from other monsters in the forest of spirits. As the monster lord, I really don\u2019t want humans to go in. Alice said. I understand, alice. As long as they don\u2019t attack me first, I won\u2019t bother them. Luka said.  Good. Since you\u2019re a human I can trust, I\u2019ll allow you to enter the forest. Alice said. \u2026\u2026Do you really trust me? Luka said. \u2026\u2026hm? What\u2019s that? Alice said. Her eyes lay on a wooden bulletin board, covered in notice held on by small thumb tacks. A request boars for people who need help. Luka said. Nothing good here. These are all physical labor jobs. You say. Then a pigeon flies over you and lands on top of the board. There\u2019s a tiny slip of paper attached to its foot. Hm\u2026.What\u2019s with this pinion? Alice said. It\u2019s a messenger pigeon.  You say. It uses its beak to take the paper off its foot and stick it on the board and flies to its next stop. I see\u2026\u2026.humans trained pigeons to do such things\u2026.you humans think of some interesting things. Alice said. It\u2019s a request for someone who\u2019s not biases against monsters. The person lives back in Port Natalia. You say. I\u2019m interested\u2026..let\u2019s go see. Luka said.  You aren\u2019t going all the way back to port Natalia? Alice said. I\u2019m sure this will bring humans and monsters together. Luka said. You really like doing stupid acts of kindness, don\u2019t you? Just leave it alone\u2026.Alice said. I\u2019m a hero. It\u2019s my job to help those in need. Luka said. A fake hero\u2026..Alice said. It\u2019s because I\u2019m a fake hero that I must have the heart of a real one! Luka said. Hm. You learned how to talk back. Alice said. Just leave at that. You won the conversation. You say. Should we gather information before we leave? Luka said. I\u2019ll be waiting outside the city. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait about 10 minutes before luka and alice meet you. Anything good? You say. People say there is a haunted mansion to the north. Some say it was an execution ground. Others say it\u2019s a grave yard, a dead girl, or a sorcerer. Luka said. Haunted mansion? That equals ghost. You say. No! Ghost are proven not to be really. Stop being stupid! Alice said. But aren\u2019t there zombie monsters and such? Luka said. Those aren\u2019t ghost! When a lot of magic is gather in a dead body, they turn into normal monsters. Don\u2019t mix them with stupid things like ghost! Alice said. You know, we may just have to go to that haunted mansion. I don\u2019t want monsters to continue to trouble humans. Luka said. That isn\u2019t necessary! Go to the forest of spirits and get sylph. We don\u2019t have time for any pointless detours! Alice said. \u2026..Why are you so angry? Luka said. A touchy subject about ghost\u2026you say. Speaking of detours, there also that request from meia. Luka said. You\u2019re just an idiot. Stop doing pointless things for strangers. Alice said. Either way, just pick a place. You say.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alright. Let\u2019s head to Port Natalia. Luka said. You\u2019re such an idiot. Did you forget the purpose of your journey? Alice said. My only purpose wasn\u2019t to head right to the monster lord castle. I want humans and monsters to get along. Luka said. Ugh\u2026.Alice said. You and luka head off with a disgusted alice. It was a lot easier going back here. You say. Mm\u2026\u2026these yumatai crackers are delicious. Alice said. Feed the beast, keep her happy. Nice luka said. She gets annoying when hungry. Feeding her is a good way to keep her quiet. Luka said. A lot of thoughts are running through your head. (Should I do it? What do you think?) you said.(Personally, I don\u2019t care. I know I can beat her. Luka will get stronger. How strong is up to him.) he said. (I know but\u2026\u2026.i haven\u2019t even seen alice in battle, so I can\u2019t judge how strong she is.) you say. (She\u2019s the monster lord. So of course she\u2019s strong.) he said. ( I can\u2019t decide yet. I\u2019ll wait a little bit more.) You say. \u2026\u2026What are you staring at? Alice said. Nothing. You say. You\u2019re staring off into space\u2026\u2026and you look nervous\u2026\u2026.did you do something here? Alice said. N\u2026.no! Let\u2019s find meia\u2019s house. You say. It was 6th street. You say. You find 6th street. The house number was 3-29. You say. 3-29\u2026..is this it? Luka said. Luka walks up to the house that matched the address. Luka knocks on the door. Is anyone there? Luka sad. I\u2019m coming! A female voice said excitedly. Suddenly, the mermaid you all meet before in the town appears. Oh\u2026.? Are you Meia? Luka said. Yes\u2026..i\u2019m meia. I\u2019m sorry about cutting our conversation short last time\u2026.Because of the explosion, I forgot about our conversation\u2026Luka said. Don\u2019t be sorry. Luka said. You all went into her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease excuse the small house. I don\u2019t have much to entertain you with either\u2026She said. Don\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019re fine\u2026Luka said. She sat down some suspicious looking aquatic based cakes and tea on the table. We\u2019re really busy. This better not be stupid. Alice said. Ahhhh\u2026\u2026can you be quiet for a minute? Here\u2026..if you keep biting  on this seaweed, it will probably taste good after a while. Luka said. Seaweed\u2026Alice said. Alice gives it an odd look before taking a bite. So what was it you need help with? Luka said. Actually\u2026..i\u2019m in love with a human. Meia said. She holds her cheeks  as she blushes. Good for you\u2026.are you already in a relationship with him? You say. Yes. We live together in this house for a while. But he\u2019s out fishing now\u2026She said. That\u2019s great! Luka said. But\u2026..although we love each other deeply, we\u2019re not married. It\u2019s because we can\u2019t do the marriage trial dictated by marine law\u2026She said. Marriage trial\u2026? Luka said. When a mermaid and a human get married, they have to offer a written pledge to the queen at the temple on the seabed. But\u2026..The monsters on the way are too dangerous. I have some magic power, but my darling isn\u2019t too strong. We wouldn\u2019t be able to make it there safely\u2026She said. So you want us to the temple\u2026\u2026which is on the bottom of the ocean\u2026\u2026to deliver a pledge? You say. Yes\u2026I\u2019m sorry for the tremendous request. Could you please deliver the pledge to her in our stead? She said. Is someone allowed to take your pledge in your place? You say. The law doesn\u2019t say those getting married had to deliver it. It doesn\u2019t say someone else can either\u2026..but it should be fine. She said. So you\u2019re taking a gamble on us because your husband isn\u2019t strong enough to get there\u2026..you say. Yes\u2026\u2026Meia said. Not the strangest job I had, but there it\u2019s at the bottom of the ocean\u2026..how are we going to get there without drowning or being crushed by the pressure? You say. Before she answers your question, the front door opens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m home! A boy said. Ah welcome! Meia said. A small boy enters the house. Eh\u2026.? No way, you\u2019re already had a kid together? Luka said.  No, no\u2026.this is my darling! She said. He\u2019s a kid\u2026\u2026.looks no older than 11. You say. Hey Meia. Who are these people? He said. They\u2019re very admirable travelers! I asked them to deliver our pledge of marriage to the queen! She said. Oh, really? Thank you! We really want to get married so that would help us a lot. He said. Um\u2026.meia\u2026.Don\u2019t you think you should wait until he\u2019s older? Luka said. Or at least of age? You say. But my darling is turning twenty five this year. She said. Eh!? Luka said. Then why does he look like a kid? You say. I\u2019m an adult! I can get married! He said. I used a little bit of my mermaid magic to stop his growth. She said. Why? You and luka said. Because\u2026.he\u2019s so cute like this! She said. So that\u2019s why! I thought it was weird! Meia! That\u2019s awful! He said. The boy(? )started to pout while meia laughs. That how it is, so please help us! Please go to the queen at the bottom of the sea and deliver our pledge! Meia said. Please! The boy(?) Said. \u2026..Alright. We\u2019ll take the request. Luka said. I still have a problem with the \u201cat the bottom\u201d part. You say. Thank you so much! Meia said. Don\u2019t look, but alice is glaring at you. You say. The\u201ddoing more troublesome things\u201d face? Luka said. Big time. You say. It\u2019s only something, but I can give you a reward. It may not be enough for you though. Meia said. Oh no, you don\u2019t need to give me a reward. Luka said. Then please take these\u2026.this is our pledge, and a ball of guidance. She said. She hands luka a document with writing on it, and a transparent crystal. What\u2019s this? Luka said. While standing on the nearby beach, you need to use that. Then you should be able to go on the undersea road. Meia said. I see\u2026so if we follow that road, will it take me to the temple? Luka said. Yes\u2026.I\u2019ll pray for your safe journey. Meia said. Leave it to me! Luka said. Saying that, you leave the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sure do like to be used by others. There\u2019s no point in doing such a personal request as that. Alice said. Don\u2019t say that, alice. Isn\u2019t it great to break down the racial barrier in the name of ove? Luka said. But won\u2019t he be breaking Ilias\u2019s law? Alice said. Laws were meant to be broken. Luka has demonstrated that before. You say. I have not. Luka said. You\u2019re looking at the monster that did. You say.  Uh\u2026..that\u2019s a weak point. Luka said. Ok. Let\u2019s get this over with. Let\u2019s go see the queen of the fish people at the bottom of the ocean. You say. Why are you so happy about this? Alice said. I\u2019m not. I just don\u2019t like water and the thought of the temple is at the bottom fills me with uneasment. You say. An underwater temple\u2026..i doubt there\u2019s anything good to eat. Alice said. While you shake your head in disbelief, you three leave town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the beach with the ball of guidance, what do I do? Luka said. Well, use it. You say. Luka take the ball and hold it up. It shoots out a beam of light far out into the sea. A road of light to follow. You say. It\u2019s a tunnel to the bottom of the sea. It\u2019s possible to go all the way to them bottom. Alice said. Luka timidly steps into the light tunnel.  You step in next. Do we still have to swim? You say.  Seems so and our clothes aren\u2019t wet neither. Luka said. Just stay in the light tunnel. You say. You, luka and alice swim to the bottom.</span></div></div>",

Luka said. As long as you\u2019re holding the bell, you\u2019re fine. Alice said. Don\u2019t drop it. You say.  Reaching the bottom of the sea on this road\u2026\u2026the trail of a couple that wish to marry\u2026.Knocking down every monster that challenges them to show their courage\u2026 Alice said. That\u2019s pretty drastic just to get married. You say. I know. It must differ from monsters. Luka said. Alice, what does someone have to do for them to marry someone of your race? You say. First, the man has to be strong. Second, the man has to want to get married. Only a man stronger than the female is allowed to marry someone of my clan. Alice said. Someone stronger than you? Damn. Putting that aside\u2026.it looks like a fantasy world around here. Luka said. Yeah. Thousands of colorful and beautiful fish are swimming around the tunnel in every direction.  It\u2019s beautiful\u2026..The mysteries of the deep are amazing, aren\u2019t they? Luka said. I\u2019m more worried about the dangers of the deep. . You say. A monster that\u2019s a shark? Luka said. Yeah. Hope you swim fast. You say.  The deep sea is the monsters domain. They will attack without mercy. Alice said. Alice\u2019s head quickly turns to the side. See\u2026.of course. Right as soon as I said it. Something comes this way. Alice said. A monster quickly approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a jellyfish girl. You say. Humans this deep under the sea? How strange. She said. I don\u2019t want to bother you. So please, just keep swimming along. Luka said. I\u2019m not in the mood to be bothered. You say. You both look delicious. I\u2019ll wring all the semen from you both and savor it\u2026 She said. She\u2019s not going to go away. Luka\u2026.you say. I know. I was trying to be peaceful about this, but you\u2019re right. Luka said. He takes out his sword. Luka steps in and stabs sharply. I\u2019ll tease you\u2026She said. A tentacle strokes luka\u2019s groin.  Take this! Luka said. Luka slashes at her. Your penis is weak\u2026She said. A tentacle strokes luka\u2019s groin again. Luka attacks again. This tentacle\u2019s special\u2026She said. The barbs of the jellyfish girl\u2019s tentacles prick luka. Numbness starts to flow through luka\u2019s body. My\u2026..body\u2026.Luka said. Now, I\u2019ll eat you. She said. Her tentacles are about to coil around luka, but you push him out of the way and get caught. Oh\u2026..i was going to save you for last, but I guess I\u2019ll start with you first. She said. You easily break free and hit her. You dodge one of her tentacles and cut off one of here tentacles. Argh! She said. You swim out the way and luka hits her with his sword. My strength\u2026She said. She turns into a regular jellyfish and swims off somewhere. I\u2019m glad the blade still works underwater. Luka said. What idiotic things are you saying? You idiot. Alice said. You don\u2019t have to say it twice in a row\u2026Luka said. Suddenly, luka feels something that touches his right foot he looks down to see it\u2019s a tentacle. It\u2019s coming from all the way to the bottom. Wa! What is this!? Luka said. Oh\u2026.That\u2019s a sea anemone girl\u2019s tentacle. Alice said. Eh\u2026? Luka said. You grab his hand and pull. Damn. I got no footing! You say. Because your feet aren\u2019t on the ground, you can\u2019t pull with all your strength. You lose your grip and luka vanish from view. You swim after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep swimming down until you see luka and he\u2019s being held by the sea anemone. You dash towards her and cuts the tentacles that is holding luka. But before you can do anything, her tentacles regrow and grab you. Oh\u2026.Another human boy. Since you want to play hero, I\u2019ll eat you first. She said. . You power out of her hold and you and luka attack together, doing crippling damage. What is this\u2026? Kyaa! She said. She turns into a regular sea anemone.You ok? You say. Yeah\u2026\u2026there sure are a lot of monsters in the sea. Luka said. But there are a lot of things to eat. It\u2019s a nice place. I like it. Alice said. Alice is eating a fish she caught. It\u2019s not surprising. Well at least we\u2019re on the floor. You say.There. I see the outline of the temple. Luka said. Alice is staring intently at the rock on the seabed. Something wrong? You say. That sea anemone\u2026.i wonder if it taste good. She said. \u2026..let\u2019s go, alice. Luka said. You keep going. Is this the temple? Luka said. The structure is that of a temple, but more under the sea like. You say. What kind of monster is the queen of the bottom of the sea? Luka said. I believe the queen who rules the southern sea is from the kraken family. Alice said. Wait. The kraken? You say. Yes. I left her in charge of this part of the ocean. Alice said. As we moved further along, you see a dim light. What\u2019s that\u2026?Luka said. You pull him behind a column and hide. Shhhh. Angler fish. You say. You wait for her to leave. You come out of hiding. While you two were hiding, I found where the queen was. You\u2019re almost there. I\u2019m tired of eating fish. Hurry up and finish this. Alice said. Yes. Let\u2019s. Luka said. You and luka swim to where alice directed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom of the temple, you come across a giant hall. At the end, was a regal looking monster. Are you the queen of the southern sea? Luka said. \u2026.yes. that\u2019s correct. I am entrusted by the monster lor to rule over the southern seas.  Now humans\u2026.what business do you have here in this temple? She said. Um\u2026..I\u2019m a hero that\u2026. \u2026\u2026hero!? She interrupts. Her eyes instantly narrows. You must have come to steal the orb in this temple! But I won\u2019t hand it over! She said. Orb? We came about this pledge. You say. Silence! If you want the orb, you both have to defeat me first! She said. She takes a battle stance. Luka\u2026..she won\u2019t listen. You say. I will never hand the orb over to bloodthirsty heroes!  She said. We don\u2019t want the damn orb! You said. I said silence! She said. She won\u2019t listen! Luka, get ready! You say. Luka pulls out his sword. Luka steps in and thrusts sharply. You attack and land a powerful hit. Does this feel good? She said. A tentacle caresses Luka\u2019s body. I\u2019ll force you to feel good against your will. A tentacle goes for luka\u2019s penis. Luka and you attack together. I\u2019ll play with you like this\u2026she said. A tentacle caresses luka. Does it feel good? She uses her tentacle and caresses luka. You attack with force and luka follows it up with an attack on her neck. I see\u2026\u2026both of you together are a force to be reckon with. Let\u2019s see how you do on your own! She said. She wraps her tentacles around you and squeezes. Are you just going to sit there and let me rape your friend? She said. I\u2019m not so helpless! You say. You power you way out and you and luka attack together. You nail her in the gut while luka comes down hard on her head. Not bad\u2026\u2026But the monster lord has entrusted me with this orb\u2026..I won\u2019t let two heroes take it! She said. We said we don\u2019t want it! Luka said. We\u2019re just delivering this pledge! You say. I\u2019ll bind you with my tentacles. She said. Her tentacles coil around luka. Are you ready? I\u2019ll rape you slowly. She said. Luka starts to struggle, but can\u2019t get free. I said I won\u2019t let go. She said. While she\u2019s rubbing luka with her tentacles, you hit her so hard that she lets go of him. Thanks. I was having trouble. Luka said. Let me take this for a while. You say. You hit her and dodge her tentacles. She doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re getting her attention. Luka takes this chance and surprise her with a slash. You are indeed heroes\u2026..you\u2019re both really strong. But I won\u2019t be beaten so easily! She said. All of her tentacles raise above her head in a ready postion. I\u2019ll attack with all my tentacles. She said. You and luka put up your defense. All of her tentacles shoot at both of you, but you and luka dodge them all. That was close. Luka said. You avoided. It looks like I might have to use it. She said. Luka aims for her neck and you open her up with weak attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing me to use this technique\u2026She said. The water swirls around in the form of a magical diagram. What is this!?Luka said. Aqua pentagram\u2026.the absolute defense made out of water. Now neither of you will be able to lay a hand on me. She said. Luka attacks, but it\u2019s deflected. This isn\u2019t an ordinary barrier. There are 5 users of this technique in the world. It manipulates time and space to a complete nullify physical attacks. She said. No way\u2026.Luka said. Luka attacks again, but his attack is deflected again. There\u2019s no way you can win. Now to finish you both\u2026..oh? Who\u2019s there? She said. A shadow appears in the corner of you and luka\u2019s eye. Alice\u2019s eyes shine brightly. Eh\u2026.? Alice, what\u2026..Guh. Luka said. What\u2026..are you\u2026..ohhhhh. You say. You and luka both fall asleep. What was that shadow? Hmmm\u2026but before I chase them, I\u2019ll finish off these to. She said. The kraken\u2019s tentacles approach you and luka, but you both quickly dodge it. Impossible\u2026.avoiding it will asleep. And what\u2019s this strange feeling? It\u2019s like they\u2019re different people\u2026She said. Zzzzzz\u2026..Wall\u2026? break!? Luka said. Luka\u2019s blade flashes. The power tears through time and space, and breaks the barrier. No way. A physical attack can\u2019t break my barrier. Breaking through time and space\u2026.how could he do that? She said. Over\u2026\u2026power\u2026\u2026You say. You attack with all you power and strength. Such\u2026..strength. She said. A dazzling star falls into hell. What powerful magic! How are is he using magic.!? She said. She starts to tremble. \u2026\u2026.fear\u2026..You say. You use the fear that\u2019s in the area and blast her. Impossible\u2026..this has to be a bad dream! I don\u2019t stand a chance! She said. \u2026..Stop the fight! That\u2019s enough! Alice said. Her eyes shine brightly and you and luka wake up.  \u2026\u2026huh? What? You say. Who? Where? Luka said. Just what are you\u2026..? the kraken said. She loses the will to fight.</span></div></div>",

Hero\u2026..why are you so intent on this orb? Have you gotten tired of killing monsters on this continent? She said.  It\u2019s like I said from the start! We\u2019re not after the orb you\u2019re talking about! Luka said. What\u2026? Then why\u2019d you come here!? She said. We brought a pledge of marriage for one of your mermaid to marry a human! That\u2019s why! You say. \u2026..Why didn\u2019t you say so in the first place? She said. We did! At the start! You and luka said. \u2026..What a funny misunderstanding. Alice said. So that was the case\u2026.It seems I put you thorough some unnecessary trouble\u2026 I shall receive the pledge of marriage. Now who\u2019s  it for? She said. A couple from Port Natalia. She said. You said you were delivering it\u2026? Why didn\u2019t they come themselves? Children these days. She said. She takes the peldge. \u2026..i guess it doesn\u2019t matter. The law doesn\u2019t state who has to bring it. She said.(is this place going to be ok with her here?) You thought.( Nope. Not at all.) he said. At any rate, the pledge has been delivered. As queen of the southern seas, I declare Meia and her husband married. Now take this pledge ring. Wearing it on your finger, you will always remember the pledge to your partner. She said. She gives it to luka. No matter what, you must always support each other. Now, I shall give you the queen\u2019s blessing. She said. Hmph. I\u2019ll give them the monster lords blessing too. Alice said.( Ceremony feels weird without the bride and groom.) you thought.(And no cake neither.) he said. By the way\u2026..are you possibly\u2026..She said. \u2026\u2026I\u2019m nobody important. I\u2019m just a traveling gourmet who passed by on a whim. Alice said. Incredible. Coming all the way to the bottom of the sea for food! The kraken said.(This place is in trouble.) you and luka thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, our business here is done. I don\u2019t want to spend any more time here, so I\u2019m going back. Alice said. Wait for me. You say. Me too. Luka said. You don\u2019t need to go back that way. As an apology for before, I shall send you to the surface. Your eyes turn optical and you disappear and reappear on the beach. He should land here. You wait a few seconds and see luka fly out of the sea and\u2026\u2026*Thud*\u2026\u2026.land on the beach. Blegh\u2026.guh\u2026Luka said. So how\u2019d you enjoy the trip? You say. It was horrible! Luka said as he writhers in the sand from the friction of the water and the blunt impact of the sand. Here apology was the biggest injury. You say. What a funny queen. Alice said. Alice\u2026..thanks for helping us before. Luka said. \u2026\u2026Hmph. That was the last time. Because it was a misunderstanding, I hesitated to just leave you. Alice said. One issue after another. You say. You head back to port Natalia. Luka tells them the whole story. \u2026\u2026here\u2019s you pledge ring. Luka said. T\u2026.thank you so much! Meia said. She takes the ring with a huge smile on her face. Husband fishing again? You say. And so is alice. Luka said. My darling will be happy with this. Now, I need to reward you\u2026She said. It\u2019s alright. I don\u2019t need a reward. Luka said. But I\u2019m just an ordinary citizen\u2026I don\u2019t have much money, or an item that a hero would find useful\u2026 therefore\u2026.As a reward, Shall i give you a blowjob? She said. Eh? Luka said. You already left the building. Enjoy luka. You say as you head for the market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being in the market for 8 minutes, you see luka walking dizzily through. There\u2019s the man. You say. \u2026\u2026What\u2019s wrong? Your face looks funny. Alice said. Geh! Alice! Luka said. He jumps back in surprise as alice appears out of nowhere. W\u2026.what? Why are you so surprised? Did you do something bad\u2026.? She said. No not particularly. Meia was very happy. Luka said. Yeah. Too happy. You say. \u2026.Hmph. Well, whatever. Alice said. Any way\u2026..isn\u2019t it wonderful thing for man and monster to be in love like that? Luka said. Yeah. One step closer to your dream. You say. \u2026\u2026But I am happy. It\u2019s good to know that the bond between human and monster hasn\u2019t been completely severed. Alice said. Yeah! I know! Right!? Hehehehehehehe. Luka said. S\u2026..shut up! Alice said. There is a heart in there. You say. S\u2026..shut up! Alice said a little angry. So where to now? You say.  Let\u2019s head for the haunted mansion to the north. Luka said. Alice glares at luka silently. Sleep with one eye open luka. You say. You all head north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the mansion amid the darkness the night.  Bigger than I thought. There\u2019s a really creepy atmosphere. What\u2019s wrong alice? You say. She has a calm face, but something is bothering her. Hey, look\u2026\u2026there\u2019s a graveyard. Luka said. There was a graveyard next to the house.  I already saw that! But even then, I didn\u2019t mention it! Why are you pointing out obvious things! You don\u2019t understand a woman\u2019s heart at all! She said. What does this have to do with a woman\u2019s heart? You say.Hm\u2026.?Luka said. What? You say. A small girl just peered out at me through that window. Alice, you saw it? Luka said. Aieeee! Alice said. She hides behind luka. Alice\u2026\u2026by any chance\u2026..are you scared of ghost? Luka said. O\u2026.of course not! The only thing that scares me is hunger. She said. Ohhhhhhhhhhh. Alice heared. Aieeee! Alice said. Hahahaha. That was me! You say. You\u2026\u2026jerk! Alice said. Let\u2019s just go inside. Luka said. I won\u2019t! Alice said firmly. Did you forget why you\u2019re on this journey? Why are you wasting your time with this? Alice said. Your upper body holds firm, while your lower body is shaking like a baby\u2019s rattle. You say. It\u2019s the role of a hero to help people in need. Luka said. Certainly the big, bad monster lord, isn\u2019t afraid of a ghost? You say. O\u2026..of course I\u2019m not. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. Alice said. Then let\u2019s go. Luka said. Aaa\u2026.Alice said. You walk into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has that mansion look on the inside. You say. It looks creepy\u2026\u2026and dusty. Luka said. Alice stays silent behind luka\u2019s back. How old is this place? You say. A\u2026anyone get the feeling of being watched? Alice said. No. You say. You feel the beam on the stairs. Rickety, old, and\u2026\u2026dusty. These place has been here for a long time. You feel a shadow presence behind you. You round house kick. Coming your way luka! You say. Luka sees the flying monster and pulls out his sword and stabs it in her back. My\u2026..power\u2026.She said. The monster turns into a mysterious light. What monster was that? Luka said. I don\u2019t know. I felt it behind me and just reacted. Where\u2019s alice? You say. She was\u2026..just behind me. Luka said. Maybe she got lost? You say. She\u2019s the monster lord, she shouldn\u2019t be attacked. Luka said. Doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t be attacked. You say. Let\u2019s look around. Maybe we\u2019ll find something. Luka said. You and luka head up stairs. You look into the first door you came across. \u2026\u2026I found alice. Or what\u2019s left of her dignity. You say. Alice is trembling in the corner of the room. \u2026..What are you doing? Luka said. Alice doesn\u2019t respond. She\u2019s frozen in fear. You say. Did something happen? Luka said. As he calls out to alice, a woman\u2019s voice is heard. Uuuuu\u2026..It said. You hear a groan from outside the room.  Hyaaaaaa! Alice said. Alice jumps up and starts slithering around in circles. Her tail catches something as she slams into the floor. Knocking over a bookcase and a desk, a loud crash is heard as everything is dumped onto the floor. A small picture of a girl slides over to luka\u2019s feet. Hyaaa! \u2026..That girl! Alice said. Her eyes widen as she looks at the picture. You know this girl? Luka said. The girl in the picture looks like a refined woman. Is that her you saw in the window? You say. No. Not even close. Luka said. Haaa\u2026..Alice said. Alice lets out a weak scream as she starts slithering in circles again. You step on her tail and slap her. Calm down!  Pull yourself together! What kind of monster lord acts like a scared baby!? You say. Then a shadow appears at the entrance of the room. Uuuuuu\u2026.She said. Is that a\u2026\u2026zombie? You said. Hyaaa! Alice said. She punches the in the face and knocks off her head. Jeez. Don\u2019t surprise me like that and\u2026\u2026.can you get off my tail? Alice said. You get off her tail. Hm\u2026? Alice said. The floor starts to creak underneath alice. Then the floor cracks. Uwaa! Alice said as she falls through. Will she be alright running around like a mad woman? You say. She\u2019ll be fine. She is the monster lord. Luka said. Uuuuu\u2026..A woman\u2019s voice said. You hear that? You say. You hear voices and the shuffling of feet behind the door. There\u2019s three of them. You say. Man\u2019s\u2026\u2026energy. One said. You\u2019re anger starts to build. Who\u2019s doing this? Who\u2019s disturbing the dead\u2019s rest? You say. You build up energy in your hand and blast it at the three. A bright light shoots out from all three zombies bodies as the body\u2019s fall to the ground. How\u2019d\u2026\u2026.you\u2026\u2026.do that!?  Luka said. Ah! My experiments! A mysterious girl said. Who are you? Luka said. The girl runs away as soon as she sees you both. That\u2019s not the girl from the picture. She\u2019s not human. You say. Did she just call these zombies her experiments? Luka said.  Get back here!! You say. You and luka run out of the room the room.</span></div></div>",

Why are you going in my laboratory? She said. The real question is what's wrong with you!? What are you doing here? You say. My name is chrome. I'm a necromancer. This place was an execution ground, then a graveyard. Since there are so many corpses, it's great for my experiments. She said. Necromancer....?Luka said. it means she experiments on the dead people. How can you call disturbing the dead great? you say. This particular girl was the daughter of the rich guy who owned this place. A perfect specimen. I want to reanimate the dead into something more powerful than normal monsters! She said. So the rumors were true. So you created these zombies before too? Luka said. Of course I did. That ghost girl who came in here was of her own will, but the zombies were all my creation. She said. You created them all!? Luka said. You rage gets more fierce. Stop your horrible experiments at once! Otherwise\u2026Luka said as he pulled out his sword and point it at chrome. Hmph. I still have a lot of things to test. I\u2019ll make the two of you my new experiments! Get them, Frederika! She said. The zombie called Fredrika, shambles towards both of you. She has a different feeling than the other zombies\u2026.Luka said. You made this too\u2026..damn you! Luka said. Her body is misshapen and deformed, but she\u2019s the same one from the picture. So this zombie is\u2026..Luka said. So you noticed. Fredricka is my masterpiece. That elegant rich girl\u2019s pure body was excellent raw material to create a splendid zombie. Chrome said. Unforgivable! Luka said. Hmph. I don\u2019t care what you have to say. Go, Fredrika! Make the boy with the sword go insane! Chrome said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstood\u2026..master\u2026.She said. Gah! Luka said. Defiling the dead\u2026\u2026.turning them into zombies\u2026\u2026\u2026disturbing their rest\u2026\u2026..and turning this girl into this\u2026\u2026You say. Your energy and power increase. Your hair starts to stand up. While luka is taking this thing on, your focus is on chrome. I won\u2019t forgive you!!!You say. Your power and voice make the whole house shake. You went into rage mode. What\u2026\u2026.happened? Luka said. What\u2019s going on!? Chrome said. I\u2019ll kill you! You say. When chrome sees you, she gets scared. Uwaaaa! She said. She runs away. Get back here! You say as you chase here. You chase her to the catacombs. Where are you!? You say. Thousands of coffins line the wall. I\u2019ll bring this whole place down to find you! You say. You prowl the catacombs. You\u2019re only delaying your death! You say. You break a few pillars, but she\u2019s not hiding behind them. Then see a shadow behind one of the coffins. Now I got you! You say. As you flip over the coffin, you see it\u2019s alice, not chrome, trembling in fear. Alice!? You say. Hey! Luka said. You power down. You defeated that thing? You say. When you chased chrome off, it was easy. In fact, it\u2019s like she wanted me to kill her. Is that alice? Luka said. I\u2019m so sorry! I\u2019m so sorry! An evil god, the first monster lord, I don\u2019t care! Just please help me! I won\u2019t do bad things anymore! I won\u2019t bully the kitsunes either! I won\u2019t pull on their ears! Or step on their tails! Or steal there fried tofu! Alice said. She really likes to bully those foxes\u2026..Does she have a grudge? Luka said. Alice, that girl is the bad person. Luka said. She\u2019s making zombies here. Did you see here!? you say. She\u2019s the bad one\u2026..? Are you both sure\u2026.?Alice said. Alice\u2019s eyes brighten as she stands up. She turned this whole place into a laboratory. Luka said. It\u2019s her fault that I was like that! I won\u2019t forgive her! Get out here!!! Alice said. Her eyes flash with anger. The next moment, the lid of a nearby coffin explodes. Ahhh! Chrome said. Chrome jumps out of the coffin that\u2019s now on fire. Hiding there\u2026..Luka said. Alice quickly moves over to chrome. And smacks her with her tail. Who are you!? Another gh\u2026..ow! Gah!  Chrome said. It\u2019s your fault! Alice said. Ouch! Chrome said. Save some for me! You say. You put down the coffin and you and alice take turn hitting chrome. Ugh! Wawa!Ow! I\u2019m sorry! Chrome said. You and alice continue to smack her as she cries. (This is painful to watch.) Luka thought. Calm down, both of you! She still just a girl\u2026.Luka said. Just because a monster looks young doesn\u2019t mean they really are. This girl is 100 years older than me. Alice said. Then you shouldn\u2019t hurt your elders then. Now chrome, apologize to alice and him. Luka said. \u2026\u2026I\u2019m sorry. Chrome said. (She apologized that quickly? She must be terrified of alice and him) Luka thought. It\u2019s good to be devoted to something\u2026.but you can\u2019t treat corpses like toys. It\u2019s also very bad to create zombies like this. If you keep this up, the big mean snake lady and her friend will get angry again. Luka said. \u2026..I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be good\u2026 Chrome said. If you understand, then get the hell out of here! Alice said. Wwawa! I will! Chrome said. After being scolded by alice, chrome runs as fast as she can. You finally calm down and your power and energy return to normal. Sheesh\u2026.So she was the cause of all this crap in the mansion? The townspeople saw the zombies and thought them for ghost. How stupid! Ghosts don\u2019t exist! Alice said. Is that what you believe\u2026? Luka mutters to himself. Suddenly an elegant girl appears. She\u2019s the one from the picture. You say. F\u2026.Frederik\u2026..? Luka said. Thank you,hero\u2026.now my\u2026\u2026No, our souls have been saved\u2026She said. With our bodies turned into zombies, our souls were bound here\u2026.but now, we\u2019re finally free\u2026One ghost said. Even if I\u2019m just a soul, I can finally return\u2026.The homeland I missed so much\u2026.san Ilia.Another ghost said. It\u2019s not just those three\u2026.all around us, thousands of souls are drifting towards the sky. Thank you, heroes\u2026thanks to you, we\u2019re finally free\u2026They said. The ghost thank you both as they asend. Finally, all of them vanished. Now they can finally rest peacefully\u2026.Luka said. Finally. You say. Isn\u2019t that great alice? Luka said. Alice doesn\u2019t respond. Alice? You say. Alice faints. Hey\u2026..Alice! Luka said. He picks her up and starts heading out of the mansion with her on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s already morning? Sheesh, this girl is heavy\u2026.Luka said. Luka said. How is that possible? She eats, and eats, and eats, but doesn\u2019t gain a pound. You say. As you both reach the gate, a strange woman walks up. (She looks like a scientist.) You say.(Hmmm. I\u2019m getting a weird feeling. A feeling I haven\u2019t had since our 7th day of training.)You say. Excuse me\u2026.Do you have business here? I don\u2019t think there are any ghosts left. Luka said. I see. So chrome left? She said. (How does she know chrome?) You thought. Eh\u2026!? Luka said. Tch. I came all this way to deliver some new tech too. She said. Well whatever. That stupid necromancer still pulled something. Putting the monster lord into such a state\u2026She said. She eyes alice as she talks. Just who are you? Luka said. Ignoring his question, she quickly leaves. Who was that? She had a strange atmosphere. You say. I\u2019d give chase, but who know what will happen to you both. You say. I guess we\u2019ll head back to San Ilia\u2026Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are ghost everywhere. Walking through walls and stuff. You say. Better drop alice at the inn. If she sees this, she might not wake up again. Luka said. Luka takes alice to the inn and you both explore the city. I wonder if this is better? Luka said. I don\u2019t know. You say. Hey. That was good back there. At the mansion. You say. Well, it is my job. Luka said. You\u2019re getting better and better with this fighting and becoming a hero. You say. I am? Luka said. Yeah. Don\u2019t let alice get to you. Just keep practicing and you\u2019ll get more and better. Maybe I should up the ante of your training next time. You say. After a few an hour of exploring the city, you, luka, and alice get ready to leave. So ghost are everywhere now. Luka said. Alice closes her eyes. The haunted mansion incident is solved\u2026.i think. Luka said. I say it might have spread. You say. Humans and ghost\u2026.? I guess that\u2019s something. You say. Human and ghost children are playing tag. I guess in there eyes of children, ghosts are just more playmates. Luka said. I think that\u2019s the first step to coexisting. Got to start somewhere. You say. The rest is up to the people of san Ilia. Luka said. \u2026..we\u2019re leaving here. That\u2019s an order. Alice said. I get it\u2026.stop looking at me with those creepy eyes. Luka said. If we stay, alice might break and start foaming at the mouth\u2026\u2026let\u2019s stay. You say. She glares at you. Kidding. Damn girl. Lighten up. You say. \u2026\u2026Hmph. Let\u2019s go. Now! Alice said. Well what\u2019s next now luka? You say.</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s probably not going to come along if we ask nicely. Be ready for anything she got. You say. Yeah\u2026..I get it. Luka said. As luka and alice leave, you ponder about alice.(Well, have you decided?) he said.(if\u2026.she\u2019s training him how to fight and telling him where the spirits are, she might be strong.) You say.(So yes?)he said.(I still don\u2019t know. If I could just see her in a fight, just once, I\u2019ll be able to decide.) You say. Hey! Come on! Luka said. You catch up to them. As you and luka travel to get sylph, It gets dark and you and luka set up camp. So\u2026.That\u2019s how the fallen angel who rebelled against Ilias came to be known as the monster lord. Luka said. \u2026..Are you an idiot? Why are you telling the origins of the monster lord to the monster lord? Alice said. Point there. You say.Besides monsters hate that legend. The founding monster lord was never a subordinate to Ilias. She was an equal to her. Humans went and changed the story to fit their view. Alice said. The first monster lord was an equal to Ilias!? Luka said. \u2026..Looks like you doubt me. Alright listen. Originally, this world was just darkness and light. They both mix together and Ilias and the founder were born. She said. So they were like two sides of the same coin. You say. So if they were both gods\u2026..why did one become the monster lord? Why would they come to the ground? Luka said. That\u2026.I don\u2019t know. The founder must have had a reason.  Alice said. So where is the founder? If they were both alike, then they should be immortal, right? Luka said. \u2026..The founder entrusted the throne to the second generation of my family, and return to the heavens. Alice said. (Snoozevile.) He said. That\u2019s not so convincing\u2026Luka said. You\u2019re still doubting me!? The first monster lord was equal to Ilias! Alice said. Yeah, yeah, sure. That\u2019s good. Luka said. Nuuuuu\u2026\u2026Whatever. Grab your sword. It\u2019s time to train again! Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re ability right now doesn\u2019t even come close to the monster lord! Alice said. I\u2026.I know\u2026.Luka said. Luka and alice train into the night. As you watch from a tree, you see luka swings his sword rapidly, linking each swing as a single slash. \u2026\u2026it seems you\u2019re getting better. A barrage of attacks doesn\u2019t give your opponent any time to defend. It\u2019s very powerful, but if you use it without thinking, it could put you in a bad spot. Alice said. I see\u2026.I\u2019ll be careful. Luka said. Usually these skills can\u2019t be learn so quickly\u2026But since it\u2019s you, I thought it might work\u2026Alice said. Hehehehehe\u2026..So alice is finally acknowledge my ability? Hehehehehe. Luka said. No! You idiot. Stop that creepy laughing. It\u2019s because when you fall asleep, that skill you used looked a little similar. You\u2019re such a strange person\u2026..Sheesh.  Alice said. Wow. The monster lord calling you strange. You say. I also want to see more of that strange secret strength\u2026that power is far beyond what a human should be capable of. Alice said.(You\u2019re in for a surprise.) He said. You\u2026..Don\u2019t think I\u2019m really a monster, do you? Luka said. You don\u2019t have fangs of claws\u2026\u2026.and you\u2019re not ugly to look at. You say. If you did have monster blood in you, I\u2019d be able to tell. I also didn\u2019t sense anything from that ring. \u2026..You\u2019re really a strange person. Alice said. She said it again. You say. You don\u2019t have to keep saying that! Luka said. Heh heh. I never peg you for a normal person either. Maybe you are strange. Hahaha. You say. Luka heads for his sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you, luka and alice reach a forest. Is this the forest of spirits? Luka said. The trees are so thick. I can\u2019t see through them. You say. Along with sylph, there are lots of faries and elves that live here. But they don\u2019t mean no harm to humans. \u2026\u2026But fairies can be mischievous. Alice said. So no fighting? Where\u2019s the fun? You say. Good enough for me. Let\u2019s go! Luka said. Alice, you coming? You say. If the monster lord was seen in their forest, the faries would be shocked. I\u2019ll wait outside this time. Alice said. I see\u2026.We\u2019ll try to return as soon as possible. Luka said. You both head further into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh\u2026.a clearing? I wonder if she\u2019s up ahead. Luka said. I hope so. I\u2019m getting tired of walking. You say. Hey. A fairy. And she\u2019s holding some kind of flower. Luka said. You see the fairy. That\u2019s not an ordinary flower. She hasn\u2019t notice us yet. Let\u2019s sneak around\u2026..and this time, watch where you step. You say. Ah! Humans! She said. Despite the effort, she notices both of you and flies over. Ah\u2026..hello. Luka said. Danm, she\u2019s small. You say. Hey\u2026.let\u2019s play! She said. Eh\u2026? Luka said. I want to play a prank on big bro\u2019s penis with this succubus flower\u2026 If I do that, I get to see that white stuff!  This flower can drink all of it! Then the flower will be happy! She said. What the hell? You both say.  Hehehe\u2026I\u2019ll use this flower to play with you. She said. You can\u2019t do bad things like that! Luka said. \u2026.Why not? I thought all men liked having their penis played with? She said. I know luka does here. 2 times by you know who. Heh heh. You say. \u2026\u2026.Anyway, you can do that. If you do that, I\u2019ll get upset. I\u2019ll have to punish you with this sword. Understand? Be a good girl and go back to watering your flower. Luka said. \u2026..I don\u2019t want to! She said. Oh boy. You say. You clap your hands together around her. Whoa! Hey! Luka said. Relax. I didn\u2019t use even half of my strength. You say. You open your hands and the fairy girl flies away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re welcome. You say. Does diplomacy ever work? Luka said. Sometimes, but mostly, you got use force. You say. How horrible!  Hurting a poor fairy! A voice said. Oh no. you both say. Suddenly running into the spot the fairy was at was an elf. I must protect this forest! I will not allow hooligans like you attack fairies! How can you attack an innocent fairy! She said. Easy. Like this!. You say. You show her what you did. Come on. I\u2019ll go easy on you. You say. I\u2019ll protect this forest! She said as she jumps back and ready\u2019s her bow. This arrow won\u2019t kill you\u2026.She said. She fires off an arrow. Your reflexes are quicker than her fast flying arrow and you dodge it and it hits luka. Guh\u2026..Luka said. You quickly close the distances and stab her with you knife, but not too hard. I can\u2019t challenge a fighter up close. She said. She jumps back and fires her an arrow. You dodge it and it hits luka again. Oh, come on! Luka said. You close the distance and grab her. You take her bow and arrows and throw them away. You throw her against a tree. You charge and punch her. Was that your ribs I heard? You say. Luka! You say. He throws you his sword and you stab her. Not only monsters\u2026..but humans as well!? Wii there be no peace for this forest!? She said. The elf shrinks. You toss luka\u2019s sword back to him. Huh? You stab me straight in a vital spot\u2026.Why didn\u2019t I die? Is this some sort of magic seal? She said. Two things. One: Why was it that when she attacked you, I got hit? Two: We\u2019re sorry, but he had to seal off your power for a while\u2026.If you collect enough magic power, you\u2019ll revert back. The fairy attacked us. We were us defending ourselves.  We don\u2019t mean any harm to the forest dwellers. Luka said. Certainly\u2026.you don\u2019t seem like the type for mindless violence. But why did you both come to this forest? She said. I came to borrow sylph\u2019s power. Luka said. I see\u2026.no human have come to meet sylph for hundreds of years. She said. How old are these spirits anyway? You say. I\u2019m sorry for attacking you without hearing you out first. Ever since this unknown monster came into the forest, we\u2019ve all been on edge. She said. \u2026\u2026.What do you mean\u201d Unknown monster\u201d? Luka said.  \u2026..We have no idea. All we know it\u2019s a plant type. She said. A plant type\u2026? Like an Alraune? Luka said. \u2026..it\u2019s not cute. There is an Alraune that\u2019s lived here for a long time\u2026But this unknown monster is completely different. I\u2019m not even sure if it\u2019s really a monster\u2026She said. It\u2019s a plant, that means it burns. You say. We understand. If we see it, we\u2019ll root it out. Luka said. Don\u2019t joke like that\u2026.That thing is terrible. It kills monsters and humans alike. We haven\u2019t figure out if it has emotions\u2026We were thinking of contacting the monster lord directly. Dealing with it would be impossible for humans like you two. She said. Is it that powerful? Luka said. Yes. Run away if you come across it. \u2026..if you are able to. She said. W\u2026.we will. Luka said. We will? You say. then you hear a rustling from behind bushes. What's that? you say. You and luka stand ready. Coming from the bushes was.....</span></div></div>",

There is a horrible monster roaming around! Do you want to get eaten!!? The elf said. Oh? Big sister is tiny! Fairy one said. Tiny! Fairy b said. That doesn\u2019t matter! Hurry and get home! The elf said. Hey\u2026.Why don\u2019t you take a step forward? Fairy one said. Why don\u2019t you? Fairy b said. Eh\u2026? The elf said. She takes  a step and falls into a small hole. Hey! I won\u2019t forgive you two for this! The elf said. The fairies turn their attention to you both and you clap them together. Seriously! Again!? Luka said. You let them go and they fly away. Problem solved. You say. The tiny elf climb out of the hole. The elf chase after the twin fairies.  You and luka keep going into the forest. After traveling through the forest, you step on something squishy. Ow! You heard. A fairy flies out from the flower you stepped on. Are you ok? You say. Fairies you know\u2026..hide in flowers, so that\u2019s why you have you watch where you\u2019re stepping. She said. Sorry. You say. Please be careful from now on. She said. Ok. I will. You say. Ok. Here take this. She said. She hands you and luka a small acorn. Here. A proof of our friendship. She said. I\u2019ll take care of it. You say. Me to. Luka said. We should get going. Bye1 She said. You and luka travel deeper into the forest as other fairies wave good bye to you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both get deeper into the forest. Oh? What do two humans have business here? A voice said. You see another fairy, but different. Are you sylph? Luka said. Yes. I\u2019m sylph. Do you require something of me? She said. I\u2019m on a quest to defeat the monster lord. And I need\u2026\u2026Luka said. What are you taking about? Spit it out. Guess I need to use the wind to find out. She said. Sylph falls silent. Yes\u2026I see\u2026..Hmm\u2026.you\u2019re  human who wishes for men and monsters, and you want my power to defeat the four heavenly knights? She said. You know that much? Luka said. Yes. My power. You wouldn\u2019t use it for evil. But\u2026..the four spirits can\u2019t hand their power over to a weak man\u2026\u2026Rather a weak man can\u2019t master the power. So I\u2019ll test you if you\u2019re worthy. She said. Test? Luka said. Yes. In a fight. If you can land a single blow, I\u2019ll lend you my power. She said. All you luka. You say. A cool wind blows through the forest. You stay on the side lines. Luka thinks about how to attack. (The wind is blowing in her favor. If I attack, my attack will probably deflect and leave me open.) Luka thought. Hehehe. Has it sunk in yet? It\u2019s impossible. Doing this uses all my power. So hurry up and give up. She said.( Makes her tired. If I can draw this out\u2026) Luka thought. You\u2019re still trying. You\u2019re attack won\u2019t hit me. She said. Luka waits.  Give up already. She said. Luka waits her out. You haven\u2019t given up yet? She said. Luka waits. Hey! Hurry up and attack. She said. Can\u2019t hold on\u2026.She said. Luka still waits. Ugh\u2026No more. She said. The wind dies down. Luka attacks her.. Fuuuu! You meanie! She said. Sylph starts to cry. Wah!/ I\u2019m sorry! Luka said. Quick change in attitude. You say. Truthfully I can\u2019t fight\u2026\u2026this was the first time. Luka said. We\u2019ve noticed. You said. If it\u2019s you\u2026..can you properly use my power? She said. Uh\u2026..I\u2019ll try my best. Luka said. Ok. We\u2019ll be together forever! If we\u2019re attacked, I\u2019ll lend you my power. She said. She flashes bright and is gone. Where\u2019d she go? You say. I\u2026..can hear everything from the wind. How many insects there are, the fairies, everything. Luka said. (So this is the power alice told him about.) you thought. (Hmph. Nothing special.) He said. Luka, trembling in happiness of his new power, you both went back to the entrance of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the entrance, alice is still there with a bored look on her face. Hmph. Looks like you got sylph\u2019s power. You\u2019re also carrying yourself different. Alice said. You can tell? Of course you can tell Wahaha! Hahahahaha! Luka said. \u2026\u2026Sh\u2026..Shut up! Alice said. Thanks alice. Telling me about a wonderful thing. Luka said. \u2026.Hmph. it annoys me to hear someone so weak introducing themselves as a hero. Alice said. She closes her eyes in slight embarrassment. So have you mastered it? She said. For now, I can hear the voice of the wind. I don\u2019t know how to manipulate it like sylph. But if I do, I\u2019ll need a catachphrase. Luka said. No catchphrase. This isn\u2019t a convention. You say. Suddenly, you and luka feel something. The air has changed\u2026\u2026it\u2019s a deranged blow. Luka said. This isn\u2019t a very good feeling. This one is bad news. You say. It\u2019s getting closer until it breaks through the trees. What the hell? You say. It\u2019s core is human, but it\u2019s made up of parasitic plants. Alice\u2026.what is it? Luka said. I don\u2019t know. Alice said. If alice doesn\u2019t know, then this is a the unknown monster. You say. A monster that the monster lord doesn\u2019t know about\u2026\u2026Should one exist? Luka said. No. it shouldn\u2019t. Alice said. Alice has a serious look on her face. Ivy and  flowers shoot out and attack all three of you.  Luka jumps back and you and alice blow the attack back. What\u2019s the meaning of this!? Attacking me!? Do you know what it means to attack the monster lord!? She said. A storm of fire chars the Chimera dryad. What!? it didn\u2019t even flinch! Alice said. Alice, you\u2019re the monster lord, leave the fighting to the heroes! Luka said. This isn\u2019t the time to talk foolishness! This\u2026..thing isn\u2019t human or monster at all! Alice said. Please stand back alice! Luka said.  But\u2026.Alice said. I\u2019m the hero! I don\u2019t want to see monsters fighting each other. And we promised the elf! We\u2019ll defeat this thing! Luka said. I see\u2026.I\u2019ll step back. Be careful this thing is strange. She said. Alice vanishes. It turns her cold, hollow eyes on you both. Just before he attacks, luka feels the wind change. Huh? What is this? Luka said. He looks towards you and sees lightning formed in your hand. No\u2026.No way. He\u2019s controlling lightning!? Luka said. The air luka\u2019s feeling turns violent and powerful. N\u2026\u2026n\u2026\u2026.No The air is\u2026\u2026..Is he this powerfully!? Luka said. The lighting gets more fierce and turns black. I\u2026\u2026it turns black?! H\u2026\u2026How is he!? Luka said. When it\u2019s done, you charge at her, dragging your hand through the ground. It shoots ivy and flowers at you, but you dodge them and strike hard in its center. Black lightning shoots through its body and through it. It vanishes into thousands of particles. The left over flowers and petals scatter around, but there is no human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou power down and the lightning disappear. When you turn around to see luka, he\u2019s shivering and backs up some. What? You say. W\u2026w\u2026.w\u2026.what\u2026\u2026are you? Luka said. A strange garden of flowers fills the area. Is it over\u2026? What was it? Alice said.  She looks to see the strange flowers that appears and also sees luka is cowering in front of you. What\u2026.happened? Alice said. Y\u2026..y\u2026.you didn\u2019t see it. He\u2026..he\u2026..he controls lightning. It turned black. The air changed violently. Luka said. It was parasitic. It took her as her host. You say. So it was human? Luka said. It was human. Her body was corroded with it. So you freed it. Alice said. Yeah\u2026..freed. you say. When you walk past luka, he backs up. Stay here if you want, I\u2019ll be in the town. You say. You leave. You head to san Ilas. You\u2019re in the market. I just don\u2019t know how to keep it under wrap. You say lowly. Well boy. Did you do it? A voice said. No. I can\u2019t find a right time for it. You say. It doesn\u2019t matter when you do it, as long as it\u2019s before he gets to the monster lords castle. He said. I know. I still haven\u2019t found a good way. You say. Well it better be soon. If you wait any longer, it could be too late. He said. When you turn around, he\u2019s gone. Man. You say. You see the fairies all around and some playing with the children. A step in the right direction. You say. You buy a canteen and fill it with alcohol. Hey! Luka said. Come on! He said. As you observe him, he\u2019s putting on a brave face, but his knees are shaking and alice is eyeing you suspiciously. Where are we going now? I\u2019m already tired of this place. To the Safina region. Luka said. For Gnome. Suits me. You say.  You all  head on out.</span></div></div>",

Luka said. \u2026\u2026hot\u2026\u2026Alice said. What are you complaining about? You are brly wearing anything. I\u2019m the really one that\u2019s hot with all this on. Luka said. You can take off you cloths too you know. That way it makes it easier for the monsters. Alice said. Oh, you\u2019d love that I bet. You say. You drink from your canteen. That\u2019s good alcohol. You say. \u2026\u2026..So hot\u2026\u2026.And hungry. Alice said. You and luka shake your heads. Uhhhg\u2026.Why is the air so dry? Alice said. Close to a desert. You say. Sabbasa castle is in the center of the desert. It\u2019s ruled by the ninth king of sabasa . Luka said. Argh. Another monster\u2026\u2026making me move this much while it\u2019s so hot. Alice said. Sheesh. You both said. As alice disappears, a minotauros appears. (that\u2019s one burly mino. And axe.) he said. Oh\u2026ho. A healthy looking male. I\u2019ll rape you. She said. Shit. We don\u2019t have time for this. You say. Your eyes turn optical. When she looks at you, she gets on one knee. We\u2019re in a hurry. Move. You say. Yes\u2026..master. She said. She moves out of the way. How\u2019d he\u2026..Luka said. You coming? You say. Uh\u2026..yeah. he said. You both continue and your eyes return to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for a bit, you both in the middle of a desert. So hot! Luka said. Yeah. Alice, Where\u2019d you get those scorpions? You say. Here and  there. She said. (Why is she proud of that?) he said. ( I don\u2019t understand this girl.) you said. Why did you catch so many? Luka said. Well\u2026..i was wondering if I could eat them. She said. Carnivore. You say. Disgusted by her stomach, you and luka keep walking. What\u2026.is that? Luka said. You come across some strange luggage. A shirt, turban, backpack, a hat. Did someone melt? Luka said. What\u2019s this? You say. You pick up a lamp and hand it to luka. (You remember Aladdin?) he said.( yep.) you say. Luka rubs the lamp and a genie comes out. I was called. I shall grant you one wish. She said. A genie? I heard about this, but never thought one was real. Luka said. What do you think? Luka said. Me? I don\u2019t know. Just make a wish so we can move on. You say.  Hmmmmm\u2026.Luka said. The genie is pushing her breast towards him. Like trying to seduce him. Now, state you wish. Wealth, power, or\u2026.the ultimate pleasure.  \u2026\u2026I bet it\u2019s pleasure. Shall I give you a taste of heaven? She whispered in his ear. Oh man. You say. Oh crap. I don\u2019t have any wishes for you to grant. I only have one goal to achieve. Luka said. \u2026..i see. You have a strong will. I like men like that. As a reward, I\u2019ll give you a special service. She said. A mystic force flows into luka\u2019s body. I wish you both well on your travels. She said. She goes back into her lamp. \u2026\u2026Shesh. I thought you were going to jump her with how excited you look. Alice said. I felt weird for a moment! But I shock it off. Luka said. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Pervert. Once we get to sambas, I\u2019ll need to squeeze everything out of you again. Alice said. Eh\u2026.!? Luka said. At least she\u2019s giving you a heads up. You say. You all continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs night looms and luka\u2019s asleep, you kick him to wake him up. Huh? What? Are we under attack? Luka said. Get up. I\u2019m training you. You say. Now? He said. Yes. Take your sword. You say. Luka takes his sword. I wanted to be the first one you use the wind on. Knowing alice, she\u2019ll want to see you blast off into space. You say. Now, summon sylph. You say. Sylph. Lend me your power. Luka said. You use your weakest attack and it\u2019s deflected. You know I wasn\u2019t trying. I\u2019ll come at you harder. You say. You use one of your heavy attacks and the wind is barely able to block it. That was my heavy attack. Alright. One more hit. I\u2019m coming at full tilt! You say. Your eyes turn eyes optical and you disappear and reappear in front and then behind him and hit hard. You move faster than the wind he had could keep up and hit him hard. Luka drops to his knees. You kick him over. That\u2026\u2026Hurt. You\u2019re fast. He said before he passes out. You lay on the sand and fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, you wake up and see alice is slapping luka awake. How long have you been at it? You say. 5 minutes. Alice said. Are you trying to wake him or just for fun? You say. At first to wake him up, now it\u2019s just for fun. Alice said. She said. Move. I\u2019ll show you how to wake him. You say. Alice moves out the way. Play along. Alice is that Illias over there? You say. I think so. She\u2019s also asking for luka. She said. Too bad he\u2019s out cold. You say. Illias!? I\u2019m awake. Luka said. You are an idiot. You say. Why is my cheek sore? Luka said. Come on. Sambasa\u2019s close. You say. Seriously, why is my cheek sore? Was I raped in my sleep? Luka said. Alice? You say. Please. If I was, he wouldn\u2019t be able to move right now. Alice said. You three get to sambasa city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s a commercial district. A lot of commerce. You say. Oh? Is this the sabasa castle special dish? A piping hot sabasa fish packed with steaming hot vegetables, flavored with special spices? Alice said. \u2026..Do you want to eat it? Luka said. Alice nods her head like a child. It\u2019s expensive. We can\u2019t afford it with the money on hand. Luka said. Mr. adventure! The baptized hero price isn\u2019t too expensive! The clerk said. Err\u2026.I\u2019m not actually\u2026..*muffled* He\u2019s baptized. How much? You say. You uncover his mouth. If alice is full she might not rape you. You say. Uhh\u2026..Are you sure it\u2019s ok to lie? You say. Alice is happy. Look. She\u2019s tearing into that fish. If she\u2019s happy. She might, and I say might,  not rape you later. Fine. Luka said.  As you head for the market, you see a guard walk up to luka and take him to the castle. You fill your canteen with alcohol and wit for luka and alice. When they get back, luka tells you what\u2019s happening? So the princess was kidnapped and he wants you to go find her? You say. Yes. He said. So what\u2019s in it for us? You say. More sabasa fish. Alice has grown attached to it. Oh boy. You say. Anyway, we\u2019re heading for the hotel. You coming? Luka said. Yeah. You say. You follow them to the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka....Can you hear me out? Alice said. S\u2026.sure. Luka said. You want to make the world where monsters and humans coexist. At first, I thought you were an idiot. A stupid boy still playing hero. She said. I remember it like it was yesterday. Luka said. But\u2026..my first impression was wrong. You seem to be aware of the of the absurdity in the world. You aren\u2019t like the others who want to be regarded as a hero\u2026for some reason, it feels more like you\u2019re a martyr\u2026She said. Ruining your body for your belief\u2026..how\u2019d someone as young as you become like this? Alice said. \u2026\u2026..My father was\u2026.killed by a monster. Luka said. I see\u2026..that must have been painful for you. But that doesn\u2019t make sense. If a monster killed them, why don\u2019t you hate them? She said. There was a reason. He was the founder of Illias kreuz. Alice said. Illias kreuz\u2026..The anti-monster organization. Alice said. \u2026\u2026Before  he met lazarus guy in port Natalia, he was an adventurer. He and lazarus, along with two others, decided to go and kill the monster lord. But\u2026..they failed on the way. Luka said. That\u2019s a common story. Alice said. But\u2026.after his failure, my father\u2019s intention became biased. Him and Lazarus founded Illias Kruez after that. With my father as the leader, they started committing terrorism all over. Luka said. So he abandon  his hero ways for terrorism? You say. Yes. Luka said. I see\u2026is that the cause of your reckless behavior? Alice said. Of course. I\u2019d rather die than loss my way like he did. In the ended he was killed by a monster. Luka said. So sfter killing so many, he was killed himself. You say. \u2026..You have a complicated way of thinking. Alice said. I wasn\u2019t happy he was killed. But if I went out for revenge to kill the monsters who were acting in revenge, then what!? Luka said. It\u2019ll be a pattern to be repeated. You kill them, I\u2019ll kill you. It\u2019s as old as time. You say. That\u2019s true\u2026..that\u2019s good. The chains of revenge need to be cut. Alice said. That\u2019s why I have to change this world. Even if I have to trade this body with the same blood as my father. Luka said. \u2026.idiot. Willing to trade your life for that. Alice said. E\u2026.even if you say that. If I want to achieve something so big, I got to risk everything. Luka said. You\u2019re trying to reverse your father\u2019s action. But confronted with such a target, you think your only choice is to throw your life at it. Alice said. What do you know!? I\u2026.Luka said. You can\u2019t carry the crimes of your father on your shoulder. You can\u2019t atone for him. You say. That\u2019s why you\u2019re so eager to throw your life away. Alice said. Atonement for my father crimes\u2026\u2026I\u2026. Luka said. The question is are you going to follow your views or his? Are you going to die for your dreams or his crimes? You say. Do you want  a world where a world monsters and humans can coexist? Then you must live and make sure to build it yourself. Otherwise your way of life is just sad. Alice said. \u2026..But I\u2019m a hero. If I\u2019m defending the oppressed, I won\u2019t regret my actions. Luka said. If that\u2019s what you want, I don\u2019t care, as long as you\u2019re not throwing your life away for your father. I don\u2019t want you to die in such a stupid way. Alice said. Awwww. You say. I get it. I\u2019ll be careful. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s strange having alice encourage you luka. You say. Were you\u2026..Ah. Don\u2019t ask that. You interrupt. Alice wraps around luka. Hey! What are you doing? Luka said. Hasn\u2019t your lust accumulated on this long journey? I have to wring you out once in a while. you're just hungry again! Luka said. How rude. Don't you think it's impolite? the monster lord is by your side and you give into another monster's temptation? Alice said. I shock that off! Remember!? Luka said. I'm not the only one......here. Luka said. You already left. Have fun you two. you say. you head for the market.</span></div></div>",

I don't want to talk about it. let's just get to the pyramid. Luka said. Don't know why we need to go to a pyramid, but you're the designated driver. You say. Another detour, but I\u2019ll tolerate it this time. The king isn\u2019t a bad person, but if it was done by one of my cute subordinates, I can\u2019t overlook it. Alice said. Oh please. You\u2019re just in it for the food. You say. You all head for the pyramid. So this is the pyramid\u2026.? Bigger than I thought. Luka said. Was the princess taken here? A strange place to hold a princess. You say. So this is the pyramid? A female soilder said. Uh\u2026..You have business here? Luka said. Id\u2026.who are you? She said. Uh\u2026.Are you going to help the person inside the pyramid? Luka said. Someone\u2019s in there? She said. Then what are you doing here? You say. That\u2019s\u2026\u2026not you concern.  \u2026..Well, I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m a thief trying to steal from the pyramid. I want to take the dragon seal trial inside the pyramid. I want to do it for my love. She said. A trial? Inside the pyramid? You say. There\u2019s a trail in the pyramid, but I thought it was only for monsters. It\u2019s dangerous. Luka said. I know, but I\u2019ll still go. She said. Strong willed or stubborn. Thin line between them. You say. \u2026..Alright. Let go together. Luka said. Together? With You? She said.  The more people, the better chances of success.  You aren\u2019t going to be a burden, are you? Luka said. I was thinking the same. She said.  Fine. Even if it\u2019s your first time exploring a dungeon, you do have some experience fighting. You can give me support. She said. Go ahead. I\u2019ll wait here. Alice said. Yeah. Me too. I don\u2019t like spelunking. You say. And you alice? Luka said. No food in there. Alice said. Alright. Let\u2019s get in there. By the way, what\u2019s your name?  Luka said. How rude. Shouldn\u2019t you introduce yourself first? She said. I\u2019m luka. He said. I\u2019m Sara. I\u2019m aiming to become the top swordswoman, but I\u2019m still in training. She said. After their introduction, they enter the pyramid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just leaves you and alice. Alone. After a few minutes of silence between you too, You notice alice is eyeing you suspiciously. If you want to ask the question, ask it. You say. \u2026..Ok. Luka told me about what happened in the forest of spirits. He said you can use lighting. Also he told me about how you made a minotorous girl bow before you like royalty. She said. Yeah? You say. I thought he was joking\u2026..but knowing how you fight. Is it true or not? Alice said. You mean this? You say. You concentrate and lightning forms on your right hand. Alice\u2019s eyes shoot open. What!? A human using lightning!? She said. You stop and it goes away. Your eyes turn optical and when you look at alice, she gets on one knee. When your eyes return to normal, alice stands up straight. How....? You aren\u2019t a monster, but you hypnotized me! How\u2019d you do that!? Alice said. I have tricks. Let\u2019s just say if I make direct eye contact, your will is mine to command. Just as how you did that captain. You say. Your eyes turn optical again. Knell. You say. Alice tries to fight back, but she still knells.  Stand. You say. She stands up. How is this\u2026\u2026.silence. You interrupt. Alice goes quiet. Now. Take this knife. You say. She takes your knife. Slit your throat. You say. Alice tries to fight it. Her hand slowly moves toward her throat. Before she moves her it, you stop her. Your eyes return to normal. You start laughing. Oh man. That was so funny! Hahahaha! You say. You\u2026\u2026Jerk!  You tried to make me kill myself!! She said. You take your knife back. Oh come on. Ok. How about I let you do it to me? Fair is fair. You say. Rgh! Alice said. Just as alice is fuming, luka and Sara come out of the Pyramid. Everything worked out? You say. Tell ou later. Let\u2019s get back to the castle. Luka said. You all head back to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back to the city, you go to the pub. After drinking 4 glasses, you leave some money on the table and leave. You go outside and see luka and alice. I saw lazarus in there. If you want to go and give him a piece of your mind, now\u2019s your chance. He\u2019s in there? Luka said. Yeah. I\u2019ll be out here. You say. Luka and alice go inside. After waiting 15 minutes, luka and alice come out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell how\u2019d it go? You say. I\u2019m not in the mood to talk about it. Luka said. Why would he be there anyway? You say. Luka thinks for a minute. He wouldn\u2019t! Luka said. An explosion shakes the ground. No!! Luka said. He blew up the pub!? You say. Lazarus!! Luka said. Quiet down. Nobody\u2019s hurt. Alice said. Soldiers rush to the scene and start helping the wounded. Alice\u2026..is what I\u2019m doing self-righteous? Luka said. Who knows. Good and evil is relative. No matter what you say. It comes down to wordplay. She said. But\u2026.I don\u2019t even listen to anyone who agree with me. I just ignore them. Luka said. People are going to have different things and views on coexistence. Not everybody is going to jump on the bandwagon. Lazarus just made that clear by blowing up the pub. You say. \u2026\u2026Let\u2019s go. We still have a lot to do. Luka said. Ok then? Where to?</span></div></div>",

More of you thrusting your face to where it doesn't belong. Isn't it a hero's duty to fight monsters?  Why stick your head into humans killing each other? Alice said. It's called murder and genocide and I think it's a little of both. I don't know what we're going to do there, but I'm in. You say. I won't allow that to happen. No matter the reason, I don't want humans killing each other. Luka said. Sheesh. Alice said. You all head out for the village. After a while of walking, you come across the village. This village is pretty lifeless. You say. The atmosphere also feels oppressive. It almost feels hard to breath. Luka said. It also feels like people have been tortured and executed. You say. They also said that the female lord is catching travelers and villagers, labeling them witches. Luka said. Aren\u2019t witches only female? We\u2019re both male and alice\u2026\u2026.well she could past for a witch. \u2026\u2026Well, what are you going to do? To start, can you even do anything here? Alice said. For now, I want to meet the lord and tell her to stop. Luka said. You think because you ask nicely she will, idiot? Alice said. It\u2019s a figure of speech. You say. I know it won\u2019t work. If she doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll force her to stop. Luka said. Oh, so it\u2019s going to be preemptive crime then. You barbarian. You\u2019re pretty violent, you know. Alice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luka takes a step into the village, a female villager warns you both. Are you both travelers? You must not enter this village. Turn back right away. She whispered in a hushed tone. That silvered haired woman will be quickly caught. But it isn\u2019t just woman of being witches\u2026young boys like you two would be caught just as fast! She said. \u2026.Thank you, miss. Luka said. The two soldiers approach from behind. Travelers! Don\u2019t move! I need to inspect you first. One said. Peasant! What are you saying to them? Are you a witch!? The other said. No\u2026..they were asking for directions. She said. She backs away in a panic.  Why have you come to this village? One said. You, woman! What\u2019s with the color of your hair!? He said. And you! What\u2019s with your cloths!? The other said. There witches! He said. One guard faces alice and one faces you and pulls out a knife. It\u2019s said that witches don\u2019t bleed, even when cut. Therefore, let me make a cut on your hand so we can check. If you\u2019re not a witch, then blood will come out. Do you understand? He said. You and alice look at each other. \u2026..Of course. This will be amusing. Alice said. Sure. You say. You and alice both hold out your hand as told. One solider grabs alice\u2019s hand amd the other grabs yours\u2026\u2026and cuts both your hands. Ouch\u2026.Alice said. Blood starts to drip from your and alice\u2019s hand. Eh\u2026.!? One said. What\u2026..Impossible! The other said. They stare at you and alice in amazement.  That\u2019s impossible! This knife\u2026.he said. Oh, that knife? What about it? Alice said. Wasn\u2019t it supposed to make us bleed when it cut? You say. Alice has a sadistic smile on her face as she licks her blood. Your blood stops dripping and the cut heals. Blood came out, just as you said. Alice said. That proves we\u2019re not witches. Does it? You say. No way\u2026.One said. You\u2019re a\u2026..a real\u2026..the other said. They both start to tremble. They throw the knife away and run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..I knew it. This knife is\u2026..Luka said he picks it up. It\u2019s a trick knife. Put a little pressure on it and it retracts into its handle. Blood wouldn\u2019t come out even if you moved it on someone\u2019s hand. Luka said. So that\u2019s how they\u2019ve been framing people. You say. Hmph. Running away at being surprise. Arrogant because of their lord. Alice said. Unforgivable! Luka said. There\u2019s a house in the middle of the village. She must be in there. You say. Luka runs toward the mansion. Hey! Wait up! You say. Sheesh\u2026.You\u2019re really whole hog on this, aren\u2019t you? Alice said. You don\u2019t have to come. This is a human problem. Luka said. Indeed\u2026..there doesn\u2019t seem like any food that would interest me there. But don\u2019t let your guard down luka. The mansion is strange. Alice said. Let\u2019s go! You say. You both run to the mansion. Two solider are standing at the front gate. I want to meet the lord. Luka said. Who are you!? Lily wouldn\u2019t want to meet outsiders! One said. You\u2019re both suspicious\u2026Are you a witch!? The other said. Declaring us witches on sight. Luka. You say. \u2026\u2026Sylph! Luka said. Luka summons the power of wind and with a fierce gust, blows the helms of the soldiers and you knock them out. People like these are the real scum of the earth. You say. You and luka head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs that a cauldron? And potions? And spell books? Luka said. Yep All legit witch stuff. You say. Hehe\u2026..how surprising. A voice said. Who are you? Luka said. I\u2019m the lord of this mansion. Meister Lily. A sorcerer aiming to understand the truth of all creation. She said. She\u2019s wearing all green and has long green hair.(Meister? Is this soul eater?) he said. No way\u2026.the lord herself is a witch!? Luka said. We have a lot to ask of you. Like what happened to everyone you kidnapped? You say. I used the woman as experimental material. The men\u2026I just squeezed out their seed until they were dry, then discarded them. She said. Experiential material?! They are not something for you to use! You say. Luka holds you back. Why are you doing this!? Luka said. This old fashion village always rejected knowledge and magic. But ever since I became lord five years ago, I\u2019ve become fascinated by magic power. So I decided to use their prejudiced to start a witch hunt to collect materials for my experiments. She said. Experiments\u2026.!? Is that all they were to you!? You say. Luka physically has to hold you back. Let me go! Let me go! You say. Was their life worth nothing but that? Luka said. It looks like you have some magical power too. Why don\u2019t you join me? She said. Like hell! You\u2019re going to boil in that cauldron! Let me at her! You say. We\u2019ll never be a companion of yours! Luka said. Is that so? Well, then I\u2019ll just capture and research both of your power.  First\u2026I\u2019ll analyze your semen. Hehe\u2026.First I want to do a reproductive experiments. I\u2019ll be care\u2026..A fine specimen like you is too rare to brake. She said. Don\u2019t fuck around! We\u2019ll save everyone alive here! And mount your head on a stick! You say. Oh? Such fire. Hehehe\u2026.Welcome to my mansion, then. Please take your time and\u2026\u2026make yourself at home. She said. She escapes to a nearby door. Luka let\u2019s go. Experimentation on people! No justification! You say. We\u2019ll stop her, but only if you can keep your head cool. Luka said. You calm down and you and luka chase after her.<br>\r\nYou see a whole bunch of cells. Is this a prison? Luka said. Cages everywhere. Anyone here? you say. You see a strange sight. Aaaa\u2026You heard. Two are hang out of a strange creature, which looks like a sea anemone is hanging from the ceiling. It caught that man and sucking out his bodily fluids. He\u2019s already gone insane from lust. He\u2019s foaming at the mouth. You say. W\u2026who\u2019s there!? Luka said. In front of you was a girl from the village. Come on. We\u2019ll get you out.You say. Haha. What a naught little girl. You\u2019ll have to be punished. Lily Said. With a snap of her fingers, the girl starts to transform.  What are you doing!? Lily said. I just forced her to change into a life form that craves semen. Ah, but it looks like she\u2019s another reject. Right in front of you both, she changes into the same organism that is attacking the other men. Well, since you tried to escape, I guess the body of a failure suits you. Now make yourself useful and suck both intruders dry. Hehe don\u2019t you both want to be sucked dry? Just look at the other males. Lily said as she escapes. You won\u2019t get away! You say. You charge ahead and rip tight through the tentacle that was coming for you. Hey! Don\u2019t run ahead! Luka said. He\u2019s stopped by the organism. Oh Shit! Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You chase her to another room. Nowhere to run now. You say. Hehehe. Such fire and determination. You\u2019ll make a fine specimen to break. No. Someone of your caliber shouldn\u2019t be used and disposed of. I\u2019ll keep you\u2026.as my toy. She said. I\u2019m nobody\u2019s Toy! You\u2019re going to pay for all your experiments! You say. Such passion. I\u2019ll break you of it. She said. Both her arms turn into numerous tentacles. What the hell!? You say. This is my ultimate research. The others were partial. She said. You\u2019re a cold hearted bitch! All those lives you killed just for this! I hope it was worth it\u2026\u2026cause you experiments about to be put to the ultimate test! You say. You really think you can beat me? My tedious experiments have generated the ultimate organ. I\u2019ll show you the beauty if my research! She said. I\u2019ll show you something alright\u2026\u2026.You\u2019re guts! You say.</span></div></div>",

A tentacle comes at you, but you dodge it. I\u2019ll rub every part of your body. She said. Her tentacles rub you all over. (Ugh! Cold!) You say. You grab one of her tentacles and pull her towards you and sock her hard in the face. Her tentacles rub you all over. You power through and kick her. You knee her and tackle her and hit a wall. A little more power than I thought. Show me more. She said. Her tentacles wrap around you. Time to experiment. She said. You can\u2019t concentrate for how angry you and can\u2019t break free.

Then luka barges in.(Shit.) you thought. You stop concentrating and power down. Your hand returns to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caught up. About time. You say. I got held up by things. Looks like you did your share of damage also. Luka said. What do you mean the village did terrible things to you? You say. \u2026..My mother was a dancer born in sabasa. She was a mistress of the lord of this village, and I was eventually born. I was viewed as a burden\u2026The daughter of some froing prostitute\u2026..the villagers despised me. On top of all that, my mother died when I was young of sickness. She worked to death trying to provide for me\u2026After that, the harassment grew. The church even refused to had a funeral for her.She said. Lily bites her lip as she stares at the floor. After she died, I was sent to my father. But even that turned into another hell. Do you understand? How everyone looked at his illegitimate child in his own house!? She said. Yes\u2026.I do\u2026Luka said. \u2026..I wanted revenge on them. That\u2019s why I studied the magic in the prohibited books! I killed my father and brothers by squeezing  them all to death using that power! After that, I took over as the lord. Hahaha! The prostitute\u2019s daughter they despised so much was now their lord. She said. (I don\u2019t know if I should feel happy for her or pity her.) You thought. (I vote pity.) he said. I would never forgive them. They despised me\u2026.ridiculed me\u2026..throw stones at me. They were the real reason my mother died. Can you even begin to think to understand the pain my mother and I went through.? She said. Lily\u2026.Is that the end of your pathetic justification!? Luka said. Luka attacks her. You knew firsthand the pain that persecution from others bring! Luka said. He attacks again. Such whitewashing! Those villager got exactly what they deserved! They cause my mother to die\u2026.they brought me so much pain\u2026unless I force them to suffer, I\u2019ll never be at peace! How can people like you both understand the pain I went through!? She said. I know it well. I know it too well! Luka said. How can some hero who people admire ever understand my pain! The pain from the villagers\u2026Even my own family! She said. You were lucky! You were able to get revenge on those you had I grudge on! But I\u2019m different! I wasn\u2019t even allowed to hold a grudge! Because\u2026..I had to become a fine hero! That\u2019s\u2026\u2026that\u2019s what my mother wishes! Luka said. Luka attacks her again. \u2026..you can\u2019t understand! My feelings when I had no choice but to become a hero! He said. Luka attacks one final time. No\u2026.My power\u2026..My magic power\u2026Without this\u2026..I\u2026She said. Her tentacles vanish and her arms return to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe powerless now. That\u2019s enough. We\u2019ll hand her over to the villagers and they lay their own judgment. You say. You three head back to the village. Everyone who was locked in there was freed and Lily\u2019s magic was sealed, her power over the woman vanished as well. You and luka travel down the road and her cries of joy and sadness. Far too many were killed. You say. Heroes\u2026.there is no way we could ever express our gratitude to you both. Please, take anything you want from the village. A villager said. No\u2026that\u2019s alright. I just want her to get a fair trial. Luka said. You and luka quickly head away. When you both reach the entrance of the village, alice is right behind you. You both look depressed after a victory. Alice said. \u2026.i can\u2019t help but think how many were killed. Hundreds of people won\u2019t return to their families. Right in front of me, people were attacked and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. How can I be happy? Luka said. There are horrors of being a hero. Even though we try, we can\u2019t save them all. No matter how hard we try. You say. \u2026\u2026You\u2019re depressed after that? But are you ok with this? Leaving Lily\u2019s punishment to the villagers? Alice said. We\u2019re just strangers here. They\u2019ll take care of it. You say. She\u2019s the only offender. They\u2019ll likely kill her. Alice said. Even with death, that won\u2019t be enough compensation. How many did she kill. Luka said. \u2026.But still, you did well. This village was saved because of you both. Even if you did partner up with a fake hero. Alice said. Hero huh? That brings back memories\u2026 my mother\u2026.Ilias village\u2026 Luka said. Painfully memories? Alice said. Yes, there\u2019re painful memories, but now I\u2019m friends with everyone there. Even thought it was after my mother\u2019s death. Luka said. Is that so? Did they all repent after you mother\u2019s death? Alice said. Hahaha\u2026.Now who\u2019s the unrealistic one? Shortly after she died. It spread to the rest of the village. All the elders died and the populace lowered and the village depended on immigrants. Suddenly I, the previous outsider, was one of the senior villagers. Luka said. \u2026..you\u2019re pretty dark. You act happy dispite your twisted path. Alice said. One wrong step and I could have been like lily. Luka said.  \u2026.No. You\u2019re different from her. Even among monsters and humans, there are only two types. Those who endure the suffering spread it. And those who endure it and don\u2019t give it to others. Lily\u2019s the former. You\u2019re the latter. Alice said. Is\u2026.that so? Luka said. I can\u2019t speak for the dead\u2026but I\u2019m sure your mother would be proud. Alice said. Alice\u2026.Luka said. \u2026..That\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t say you didn\u2019t have a choice but to become a hero. Don\u2019t you think you\u2019d use your sword for the weak anyway? Alice said. \u2026.that\u2019s true. I was so blinded by the title, I forgot what it actually meant to help people. Luka said. \u2026..thank you, alice. Luka said. I think alice is breaking out of her bad attitude shell. You say. Hmph\u2026Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the village girl approaches luka. Thank you hero\u2026 thanks to you, we were able to return to normal. She said. Ah\u2026Your\u2019 Luka said. One of the girls turned by lily? You say. Yes. Everyone wants to thank you. But they\u2019re too weak to move at the moment, so they entrusted it to me. Thank you hero!! We shall never forget you kindness. She said. We\u2019re glad we could help\u2026You all will have a tough time going forward\u2026..please don\u2019t lose heart. Luka said.  \u2026..We know the reason lily acted the way she did. Her intense hatred of us is what caused her to curse out bodies. We won\u2019t continue the cycle of hatred\u2026We\u2019ll never let another tragedy like this happen again. She said. I see\u2026that\u2019s go. Now we must continue on our journey. Luka said. Goodbye hero! She said. As she raised her hand, her arm turns into tentacles. What the hell!? You say. Ah, I\u2019m sorry, how rude of me\u2026.I\u2019m still not used to having a human arm back. She said. In a instance her arm turns back human. Are the others the same? You say. She timidly nods. Yes\u2026the tentacles are already part of my body, but our minds are free, so we can change it back when we want to. She said. I see. Luka said. It may be tough, but don\u2019t give up. You say. Please come visit us again heroes! We will certainly welcome you! She said. You and luka wave back to them as you both leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans are quite resilient, aren\u2019t they. Alice said. No matter how painful it is, they have no choice but to live with it. Luka said. Plus we don\u2019t give up, even if we\u2019re staring death in the face. You say. And doing the best with what you have\u2026.That\u2019s what it means to be human. Luka said. Hm..I see. Alice said. So what now? you say.</span></div></div>",

After that, we won\u2019t have to stay in this desert. Alice said. I thought snakes liked deserts. You say as you three started traveling to the Safaru ruins. This is the ruins? There\u2019s only that pillar. The sand must have covered the rest. You say. Alice picks up a piece of rock and lick it. This is a thousand years old. She said. You can tell that by licking it? How do we find gnome? You say. Gnome is cowardly, but curious. If you\u2019re looking for her, she show herself. Alice said. So just wander around aimlessly? You say. I\u2019ll just take a rest over there. Alice said. Without moving, she just vanishes. Let\u2019s go. You say. You and luka start walking around. Gnome? Are you there? Luka said. Calling out won\u2019t work. You say. Then a mud doll runs by. Ah! There! Luka said. As luka takes a step, his foot sinks into the sand. Shit! He said. You grab his arm. This isn\u2019t regular sand. If it was I\u2019d pull you out. This is an ant lion trap. You say. Then in the center was an ant lion girl. Oh\u2026.two delicious look men. Why don\u2019t you both come closer? She said. Luka! Hit her! You say. Luka swings his sword with his free arm. Keep swinging! You say. Luka sinks deeper into the sand. No matter how hard you struggle, I\u2019ll eat you. She said. Luka hits her again. Uh\u2026.Beaten by my prey. She said. She turns into a regular tiny ant lion and the quick sand soften and you pull him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2026.was close. Luka said. You see a mud doll run by and vanishes by hind a dune. Let\u2019s get it! You say. You and luka runs after her. Damnit! Where\u2019d it go!? You say. It fast. Luka said. You look around and see it. There! You say. You and luka chase it. Around the dune was a small girl, standing alone. I think this is gnome. You say. Are you gnome? Luka said. She nods her head. Can she talk? You say. \u2026..I\u2019m here to borrow your power. Luka said. What\u2019s she saying? Luka said. \u2026..I see. So I have to show her my power? Luka said. Who are you talking to? You say. Slyph. He said. Ok. So fight her and get that earth power. You say. You stand back. Mud dolls appear around gnome. Luka don\u2019t hold back. You say. A powerful wind blows around luka. The mud dolls plays with luka\u2019s body. The wind shoves off the 2 mud dolls. Luka attacks the mud dolls. The mud dolls play with luka body. The first one rubs his thigh. The second one plays with his right nipple. The third one rubs around luka. (You know, in some places, this is considered rape.) he said. Here I go! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a shooting star. His attack is chained together with multiple slashes. It caused some mud dolls to collapse. That\u2019s 3 gone. Keep it up. You say. Gnome points her finger at luka. Following her orders, the remaining mud dolls jump on luka, but the wind pushes them away. Luka jumps up and aim for one of the dolls neck with his sword. The mud doll restrains luka. Pinning down his arm and feet. Luka struggles, but can\u2019t get free. Gnome continually squeezes and releases luka penis. Luka struggles intensely and breaks free.  Luka steps in and quick stabs one of the dolls. The mud dolls fondle luka\u2019s penis, but the wind blows them away. Luka attacks both mud dolls and the last two collapse. Alright! Gnome\u2019s all that left. Luka said. Gnome starts concentrating her magic. Not good. You say. Gnome unleashes her magic. The sand rushes like a tidal wave. Uwa! Luka said. A tornado forms around, protecting him from sand. You use the optical eyes and disappear and reappear next to luka. Gnome is overwhelmed by the tsunami of sand. Gnome!? Luka said. You and him see gnome\u2019s hat in the sand. When you both dig her out, she unconscious. Heh. I guess you win by default luka. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..Are you alright? Luka said. Gnome\u2019s eyes snap open as she nods her head. She stares at luka while she extends her hand. Eh\u2026.? Luka said. Gnome shakes her hand around as she stares at luka. Shake her hand. You say. Luka shakes gnome\u2019s small hand and a she vanishes. I can feel\u2026\u2026.the power of the earth. Luka said. Are you two best friends? Luka said. Talking to the spirits again. You say. Hmph. Got gnome\u2019s power? Alice said. Oh\u2026Alice. Yes. The power feels different than that of the wind. Luka said. The power of earth is a lot more difficult than wind. Do it half assed, and you\u2019ll get crushed by your own power. Alice said. We just saw it happened you say. Your eyes return to normal. They have powerful magic, but no combat experience. It won\u2019t be the same with undine and salamander. Luka said. Undine is pretty skilled and salamander is\u2026\u2026.well, I\u2019ll let you find out. Alice said. Wait? What? That makes me even more worried! Luka said. Do you feel any different? You say.No, but I can feel her breath. Luka said. Well, two left. Who\u2019s next? You say. East is closer. Let\u2019s get undine. Then salamander. Let\u2019s head to Noah. Let\u2019s start walking eastward. It\u2019s a flat field. It shouldn\u2019t be difficult. Luka said. Noah\u2019s still underdeveloped. It should have some unique food. I can\u2019t wait! Hahahaha! Alice said. Stop that creepy laugh! Luka said. I wonder what\u2019s out there? Luka said. Only one way to find out. Race you to the next spirit! you say as you take off. Hey! I\u2019m the one looking for them! Luka said as he chased after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou three come across the leafy green of the noah region. So where to? You say. The grand Noah castle. There, resides Queen Noah the tenth. Luka said. Hmm. It seem there are some unique specialties to be found. The coliseum in the castle is quiet famous. Alice said. Coliseum? If they have matches there, I\u2019m competing. I get to bust some heads! You say. Well, not that I care about what goes on in the coliseum floor. But the food stands are supposed to be exhilarating. You mentioned that already. Luka said. The coliseum is my goal. You say. You brute. Is fighting all you think about? Alice said. Is food all you think about? You say. Alice turns her gaze back to her book. In the far east from here, there\u2019s a village called Yamatai, with a unique food culture. Sushi, tempora, soba\u2026.it sounds interesting. Alice said. That far\u2026..We can\u2019t get side tracked. We got other things...*muffled* Luka said. We\u2019ll make time. You say. See that gaze? Not good. You say. You uncover his mouth. Fine, we\u2019ll make time. Luka said. Ok. Now come on. I want to see the coliseum! I want to fight in there! You say. It\u2019s almost sunset? Let\u2019s camp here tonight. \u2026..Luka, make dinner. Alice said. Didn\u2019t you just eat!? You both say in amazement. You and luka set up camp. \u2026\u2026Alice. Who taught you be the monster lord? Luka said. Tammao. She was put in charge of my education from the previous monster lord. Alice said. Tammao? You\u2019re younger than her? How old are you anyway? 300 years? Luka said. You idiot! I\u2019ll be 22 this year! She said. Eh!? You\u2019re that young? Luks aid. I\u2019m older  than you. Show some respect! You idiot. Alice said. Just how old is tammao? You say. I don\u2019t know. She was also my mother mentor. There are rumors that she was the 5th monster\u2019s mentor. Alice said. So\u2026.she\u2019s ancient? You say.(probably older than this Illias.) He said. Wow. Luka said. \u2026..That\u2019s enough on that topic. It\u2019s time for tonight\u2019s combat training. You need to be able to really use sylph and gnome\u2019s power as soon as possible. Alice said. Alright. I\u2019ll do my best\u2026Luka said. Luka and alice trains into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Might as well do some of my own.) you thought. You get up and find a huge boulder. Ok let\u2019s try the first move we did. You say.(That one? Ok.) He said. You concentrate your energy and you dark half also concentrates his energy. A sphere of energy that is half white and half dark forms in your hand. You chuck it at the boulder. It hits and disappears.(This is my favorite part.) he said. Then the boulder starts to crack and then it explodes into tiny pieces. ( I love that move.) he said. Hmm. I\u2019ve been thinking. Let\u2019s see if we can chain it. Attack multiple targets. You say. You stand in front of some trees and concentrate. You chuck the attack at the tree. It goes through the first one and stops in a huge tree. After a few seconds, the trees explode. Wow. Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to do it on my first try. You say. (Fighting in our blood.) he said. You walk up to another boulder and punch it. It breaks into tiny pieces. Feels good not to hold back. You say. You head back to the camp. Alice and luka are already asleep. You lay up against a tree and catch some zzz\u2019s.</span></div></div>",

Humans and monster are co living in this village. This your dream? You say. Yeah. Hit the nail on the head. Luka said. Look. They not even paying attention to alice. You say. It\u2019s amazing. Human\u2019s and monster can live together. Noah\u2019s the proof. Luka said. But it\u2019s just here. So the dream isn\u2019t fulfil until it\u2019s allowed  all over. You say. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m going to make it come true! Luka said. It\u2019s nice to be determined to something. You say. I\u2019m going to find out about this coliseum. See you two later. You say. You leave the group and collect information from a solider about the coliseum.  After a few hours, you get to the coliseum, you pay for your ticket and find a seat. Hey. You guys made it. You say. I wanted to see it also. Luka said. And I see alice is also eating food already. You say. You see anything strange here? Luka said. Yeah. Barely any guys are here. Mostly young girls and women. You say. Hey. The match is starting. Luka say. A minotauros emerges with a giant axe. Against her is an agile centaur. Brute force vs speed. Classic. You say. Who\u2019s going to win? Luka said barely containing his excitement. The two clashes together, but it goes bad for the minotarous. The quick footed centaur out moves the minotauros. Looks like the victor is already decided. You say. \u2026..She\u2019s luring her in. Luka said. So you notice. She\u2019s protecting herself and waiting for a chance. Alice said. Waiting\u2026..? A noblewoman said. \u2026..Excuse me, but what do you mean? She said. She\u2019s bidding her time. Look. Her opponent is fast, but she\u2019s got power. You say. All it takes is a single blow and her hopes will be crushed. Alice said. Watch. You say. The centaur got too close and seeing her chances, the minotarous lands a powerful blow on her body. The centaur crumples to the ground. Is she ok? Luka said. If she was human, she\u2019d be dead. But  as a monster, she\u2019s fine. She\u2019s a train warrior. Alice said. The minotauros raises her axe in victory as the audience cheers her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my. It went exactly as you said. By the way, are you a skilled fighter? She said. Well, sort of\u2026Luka said shyly. I am. You say. Hmm. I see. She said. She strokes her chin, as if in deep thought. The next match is starting. You say. It\u2019s a dullahan against a human opponent. Luka said.  He has a giant battle axe, and he looks powerful. You say. The match was over very quickly. He was defeated in seconds. The dullahan must be strong. Luka said. No way. She couldn\u2019t have brought him down that quickly. You say. What do you mean? Luka said. Something\u2019s going on here\u2026.You say. Then bright light cut on like some performance was about to happen, the crowd goes wild. Oh shit. You say. Can\u2019t be! Luka said. \u2026..I don\u2019t want to watch this any longer. I would like to speak with you, if you wouldn\u2019t mind. The noblewoman said. The woman get out of her seat and motions for you both to follow her. Y\u2026yes. Luka said. Hm? Are we leaving? Alice said. You follow the woman out of the coliseum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow her to the castle entrance. We\u2019re under arrest if we walk right in there. You say. Welcome back, your majesty. A soldier said. Eh!? Luka said. The soldier eyes you both suspiciously. They are my guests. Let them pass. She said. Yes! Please step this way. He said. Are the the\u2026..Luka said as you both walk through the castle. I\u2019m the tenth queen of grand Noah. She said. So you are. Luka said. You both make it to her throne room. \u2026..As you saw, our country\u2019s proud coliseum has turned into something horrible. She said. She sits on her throne with a sigh. The only ones to win are monsters. Every so often, there\u2019s a human contestant, but it always end the same.  Ever since I took the throne fifteen years ago. There has been no human victor yet. I don\u2019t discriminate against monsters\u2026but that fact is depressing. She said. That is sad. Luka said. These days the monsters rape them after they win. You noticed the spectator of the coliseum? They don\u2019t care about the fight itself. They just like to watch the rape. There are even men who participate just to get raped! Our once proud coliseum has turned into something horrible. She said. I see\u2026..Luka said. The place where 2 fighters go at each other to test their skills is now an exhibition for rape\u2026you say. But if that\u2019s what the populace wishes for, I can\u2019t stop it. I just want to see for once\u2026once every four years, the queen cup is held. Just once, I\u2019d like to see a human win. You see where I\u2019m getting at? She said. You want me to win the cup? Luka said. Yes, that\u2019s right. To celebrate the 15th year of my coronation, this queen\u2019s cup prize will be the green orb handed down through the royal family. I wish to give it to a human warrior\u2026.Would you please fulfil my dream? She said. Alright. I\u2019ll do it. Luka said. Me too. You say. You also? Luka said. I came to compete in the arena. And I\u2019m going to. You say. The queen happily nods at both of your responses.  Wonderful! She said. Be prepared luka. We might meet against each other and I have no reason to hold back. You say. There\u2019s a few days until the queen\u2019s cup. Until then, please enjoy yourself in my fair city. She said. Yes, thank you! Luka said. You and luka both sign up and the days passed by quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day of the cup came. You and luka are waiting in the holding room for contestants. Is alice going to be watching? You say. I think. Luka said. Sounds like a match started. You say. Man, wish I could see. Luka said. Luka pace back and forth. Players are unable to watch the matchs of their fellow contestants. To keep all players on equal grounds and not gain an unfair advantage. The staff member said. We got it. You say. Luka continues to pace around the room. Until he\u2019s called. Now, mr. luka. Please step into the arena. Good luck. He said. Yes! Luka said. Luka rushes to the arena floor. Go get em! You say.(You know they should just hand us the trophy right now. We got this in spades.) He said. (They should, but where\u2019s the fun? It\u2019s a coliseum for a reason.) you say. (Saves the other guy the shame of getting his or her ass kicked.) He said. (hey. You like humiliating the opponent.) you say. (true.) he said. After waiting 5 minutes, luka comes back. I did! I won the first round! Luka said. Congrates. Man. You say. Then they call your name. My turn. You say. You walk out into the arena. (I\u2019ve forgotten what this feels like.) you say.(Hey! Focus!) he said. You gaze at your opponent that walks out of the other entrance. It\u2019s a minotorous.( Same one from a few days ago.) You say. (Brute force vs brute force. Our brute force is better.) he said. Oh. A cute warrior. I\u2019m looking forward to put on a show after you lose. She said. Like I\u2019d lose to you. You say. You think you can win? I\u2019ll have to put you in your place by humiliating you in front of everyone. She said. Try it. You say. You pull out your knife and charge her. She blocks it and grabs you. Hehe\u2026\u2026Ready to be violated? She said. Personal\u2026\u2026space! You say as you break free. You move so quickly that you left an after image. You hit her in the face. Ugh! Fast. She said. If you can\u2019t keep up. You done. You say. I see\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll stop you movement. She said. She hits you with the axe handle. Then just as she brings the axe down, you catch it. What!? She said. You\u2019re open. You say. You uppercut her and kick her hard. Impossible\u2026..beaten by a human warrior? \u2026\u2026I give. It\u2019s my lose. Suffering from a kick you didn\u2019t even put 50% of your power into. You only put 10% yet it seems like it was too much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a human, you\u2019re pretty good.  I need to train more. Once I\u2019ve improved, will you have a rematch with me? She said. Sure. Anytime, anyplace. You say. You head back into the waiting room. Passed with flying colors. You say. Alright! Luka said. After that fight, there wasn\u2019t a challenge for you or luka. After winning four matches in a row each, you both made it to the semifinals. Whew\u2026.Luka said. Tired already? Ready to quit? You say. No! I aim to win! Luka said. Then there\u2019s a knock on the door. Come in! Luka said. It\u2019s the queen.  How are you both fairing? The queen said. Incognito, You say. Both of your skills were better than I expect for two boys so young. The others were\u2026\u2026She said. Not as good as they said they were? You say. Yes. Wiped out but you two. She said. Knocked out before the semifinals. Luka said. The undefeated champion has enlisted. She goes by the name kyuba. Without fail, she has dominated anyone brave enough to stand against her. She hasn\u2019t made an appearance in a while, so I believed she wouldn\u2019t compete. Sadly, I don\u2019t think even both of you can hold victory. She said. Hey! Never count us out! If one of us goes out, the other will win for sure. You say. \u2026..indeed, it\u2019s still too early to lose hope. She said. The semifinals are about to begin. You should get to your seat queen. Luka said. Yes. Good luck to you both. She said. The queen leaves. So luka\u2026. We\u2019re both going into the semifinals. You and me might be matched. How should we do this? You say. First one to the finish. Luka said. You\u2019re on. You say. You both shake on it.</span></div></div>",

(Luke's cleaning or collecting more skulls, that i know. Em probably knows we're gone and is worried, but not enough to tell Luke yet. The guys are goofing around and the girls are doing girl things.) You said. (I can tell you're still wondering about Sue.) He said. (It's not like her to do this. Just up and disappear on the city you promise to protect? Not like her.) You said. (Just when you think you know someone. Like Luke when he keep that secret from you.) He said. (Still think his reason is bullshit.) You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback. Back at the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen in the world where you going to tell me about this?! You said. Because one, you'd act like this. And two, you weren't ready to know. Luke said. Ready to know? That my mother was witch? My father was a hunter? That I have markings that appear on my body? When would have been a good time? You said. When you were stronger. He said. Stronger? Don't you think that was information you could have told me at any time?! You said. And what would you have done? The same thing you just did. If i told you your parents were killed by them, you'd still go there. And these are just some random preteen monsters you deal with. These are witches. Dangerous and deadly bitches who would kill or enslave you in a heartbeat. You had no experience dealing with them. And i know your first encounter with one in there, you couldn't do anything. He said. I had no experience fighting giants,but that didn't stop me. You said. I just said there's a difference between the two. You don't know how to deal with magic users. How many times were you mind taken over? Or your vision altered? Or came across a barrier? He said. A lot. You said. You see my point. If not for your dark half and need for vengeance, you'd be waiting on one of those bitches on hand and foot.He said. (Someone acknowledges the pain and suffering i go through.) He said. Then train me to be ready for one. You said. What? He said. Teach me how to beat those bitches at their own game. You said. You'd have to be a witch hunter. He said. Then train me to be a hunter. You said. You want to be a hunter? He said. Whatever it's called. Whatever it is that makes those fuckers sleep with one eye open at night. I want to be it. You said. ......This is a serious decision. There's no going back once you start. And magic is no joke. He said. I don't care. Train me to be a hunter. You said. ......Then this is your first lesson. He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(All this time he thought i wasn't ready to know. If taking on 4 giants who stole my powers doesn't say something, i don't know what will.) You said. (You got to admit. There were some close calls back there.) He said. (Nothing we're use to. We still went there and brought it down. And we didn't have magic on our side. What does that tell you of them?) You said. (And yet we still needed to use the pills.) he said. (......Shit.) You said. (Look i hate admitting when i'm wrong, but maybe, this one time, Luke had a point.) He said. (And that's the worst part.) You said. (If you want to take your mind off it, we still have a tournament to win and I know who we are up against.) he said. (Right.) You say.</span></div></div>",

This is how it should be.) You thought. (Can I possible win?) Luka thought. Luka. Never doubt yourself. You came here with a reason. now show me that reason! You say. R.....right! You say. Luka comes at you and aims for your neck. Slow....You say. You side step him and when he lands on the ground, you kick, but not hard to where his spine breaks. Ow....Luka said. You have to be faster than that. You say. Luka quickly steps in and stabs, but you catch the sword. You throw him to the ground and jump into the air. Luka moves before you make contact with the ground. You dodge it in time. you say. Gnome, lend me you power. Luka said. (Calling on gnome. Ok then.) Should I start trying? you say. You charge at luka and punch him hard. Ugh......! Luka said. You kick him into the wall. Don't tell me that's all? You hopes, dreams, everything will disappear if you don't give 100% in everything you do! You say. (My hopes.......dreams.......everything....) Luka thought. Luka gets up. I'll show you 100%! luka said. Luka comes at you and slashes his sword numerous times.(he's not slashing wildly. The slashes are chained together. And the determination I see in his eyes.) You thought as you dodge. On his last swing, you grab his sword. (uh-oh.) luka said. Oh....ow.....you got me. You say. You fall on your knees. I give. This fight yours. You say. Huh? Luka said. You get up and head to the city. (You took a fall.) he said.(yeah. You saw the determination in his eyes, right. And he showed all his moves. Why crush his chances?) You say. (You're going soft.) he said. (Better soft than a hard, ice cold, heartless person.) You said. (You know you just described kyle.) He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting an hour, you see luka. So how'd it go? you say. Crappy. You know who the champion was? Elma Alma. Luka said. the succubus woman? She was the champion? you say. yeah....Luka said. Let me guess. She toyed with you instead of actually fighting. you say. yeah.....Didn't feel like I won anyway. But she did teach me, at least I think she did, how to use the wind. She said. Let me take another guess. You can't control the wind. if you do, it will pass you by. You have to play with it. you say. Y.....yeah. how'd you know that? Luka said. Nobody can control the wind. The wind is unpredictable. One minute it could be gentle, the next it could be wild as alice if she was at an all you can eat buffet. The best you can do is play with it. So, and this is just a hunch, but I think while she was toying with you, I think at the same time she was teaching you. You say. I....guess I should be happy, but knowing that she was playing around and didn't take me seriously got to me. He said. ......Get the rest of the spirits. Get them all together and master their power. If you can combine them together, you\u2019ll gain some real strength. If you do that, you\u2019ll be on the same level as the four heavenly knights. \u2026..Maybe. Alice said. Maybe\u2026? Luka said. All depends on you. Give all that powerful force to an idiot and he\u2019ll kill himself. Alice said. That\u2019s true\u2026Alright, I\u2019ll do my best! Luka said. (He got over his sense of defeat.) You thought. Where to? You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow about Yamatai village? Luka said. Hm Hm\u2026.Sounds good. Especially  the onigiri and Soba part. Alice said. You and luka head down the path to the village. According to the map, this is where we have to cross mountains. Luka said. Mountain climbing. Always wanted to do that. You say. I\u2019m fine no matter the environment. But are you prepared, luka? Alice said. That\u2019s right\u2026Gear for mountain climbing\u2026Luka said. Gear? Really. Come on. You say as you pull luka towards the mountain. The mountain and trees are covered in snow. Hmph. Snow\u2026.Alice said. Her tail coils and runs excitedly all over the ground. Alice\u2026..Is this your first time in the snow? Luka said. That\u2019s right. But I\u2019m not some child who would be excited about it. She said. Your tail says otherwise.  You say. \u2026\u2026it\u2019s fine if you want to play in it. Luka said. Alice lays on her stomach and uses her tail to propel herself like a missile through the snow. In a few seconds, she\u2019s far out of view. Luka laughs at the sight while you throw a snowball at him. Oh, it\u2019s on! He said. You and luka have a snowball fight for 10 minutes. Alright\u2026..I give. Luka said. Already? You say. You pelted me all the time and I only got you once. He said. I\u2019m just that good. You say. Anyway, where\u2019s alice? Luka said. Don\u2019t know, but a blizzard\u2019s coming. You say. We have to go. Alice will be fine. Luka said. Do we even know where this village is? Luka said. You\u2019re eyes turn optical. This way. You say. You and luka find your way out of the mountain before the blizzard. Your eyes return to normal. Whew. That was close. Luka said. About time you both got here. I thought you got lost. Alice said. Aww. She cares. You say. The grass and trees are all lush. And look. A human village. Luka said. That must be Yamatai village. You say. Before that, let\u2019s eat. Alice said. All that\u2019s left is some dried fish. Luka said. As luka takes the fish out of bag, you see something behind a tree. Cat. You say. What? Luka said. The cat jumps from behind the tree. Nya. She said. What is it? You say. A nekoamata. Usually friendly to humans. Luka said. Seems like she wants that fish. You say. \u2026.Do you want this. Luka said. Nya. She said. That\u2019s a yes. You say. This is all we have to eat. Wait. I still have that grilled anemone from illias port. I can give it to her. Luka said. He pulls out the anemone. Here. You want this? Luka said. Nyaa. She said. The nekomata\u2019s eyes light up in happiness.  With a leap, it takes the grilled sea anemone and eat it. Nya! She said. After finishing the anemone, the nekomata pushes something to luka. Are you giving this to me? Luka said. Nya! She said. Luka takes a bell from the nekomata. This\u2026Luka said.A strange power flows into luka from the bell. Nya! She said. With a final meow, the nekomata vanishes into the grass. \u2026..Funny monster. Luka said. Let\u2019s go. You say. You all head to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to walk down the path to the village. A Cerberus? You say. Yes. I\u2019m serious. Luka said. You went up against hell\u2019s guard dog in the third match? You say. Yes. If it wasn\u2019t for gnome, I\u2019d be raped. Luka said. (Lucky. I wanted to go up against a Cerberus.) he said. It was as strong as its name applied. Luka said. As you and luka approach the entrance, two girls in strange clothing block the path. (Villagers\u2026? No. Those are elf ears!) Luka thought. (A samurai and kunoichi elf.) you say.(Where are we? Japan? Naruto?) he said. Faces I have not seen before\u2026.the samurai said. We will not allow hostile strangers into our land. The kunoichi said. Wait a second! We\u2019re just going to yamatai village\u2026Luka said. To yamatai village, you say? The samurai said. Then you\u2019ll have to go through us first! The kunoichi said. Luka, it\u2019s pointless to reason. Take the samurai. I\u2019ll take the ninja. You say. As you stand in front of the ninja elf, something about here reminds you of your past. But you shake it off. You go to hit her, but she\u2019s gone. Fast. You say. You don\u2019t move. You hear the rustling of leaves and grass. You mute everything out. There. You say. You turn and punch her. How\u2019d you hear me? I was dead silent. One of the first rules of a ninja\u2026..You say. See and hear the unknown. She said. You disappear. Your turn. You say. The ninja elf doesn\u2019t move and blocks all sounds. When she think she\u2019s heard you, she aims, but miss. I\u2019m here. You say behind her. But\u2026..you were just behind me. I heard you. She said.A ninja\u2019s best weapon. You say. Stealth, speed, and precision. She said. A ninja strikes when their enemy least expects it. Like when their backs are turn. Are you a fellow ninja? She said. I prefer the term assassin. I see\u2026\u2026no wonder you know so much. An assassin always gets there kill. So are you going to kill me? She said. Now, why would I do that? You\u2019re not threatening me. You say. So you\u2019re letting me go? She said. Yeah. You say. I see. Maybe not all strangers are hostile. She said. You feel something on your cheek. *kiss* She said. She hops into the trees. Hey! Luka said. You done? Alice said. Y\u2026..yeah. let\u2019s go and see what\u2019s interesting in this village. You say.</span></div></div>",

Luka said. heh. I'd rather have some excitement. You say. Hey. Why aren't you in human form? Luka said to alice. Look over there. Alice said. Luka sees a nekomata walking by with no one paying attention to it. An old man claps his hands twice and bows to the passing nekomata. Mighty cat! thank you! here, look.An old woman said. The old woman gives the nekomata a fish. Another strange village. You say. There also doing the same for alice. Luka said. And already eating soba or whatever. What was the reason for coming here again? You say. None. Remember you said we'll go? Luka said. Oh, yeah. You say. Oh mighty fox! Thank you! Please wait a moment. We'll bring some thin fried tofu! An old man said. Mighty fox? You say. What crazy thing are they clapping for now? Luka said.  \u2026\u2026Oho? You\u2026Tamamo said. Y\u2026.you?! What are you doing here!? Luka said. This village is my home. She said. \u2026..I see\u2026..Luka said. As you watch this, an old man interrupts the sound of clapping and eating. Oh! Mighty traveling heroes! Oh! Mighty fox! Oh! Mighty snake! Welcome to yamatai village! He said. Mighty snake? Oh she\u2019s mighty alright. In being a glutton. You joke. Hrm. Alice said. All joking aside, who are you, sir? Luka said. I\u2019m the chief of this village. You may have already know, but there has been a problem in this village. He said. Found our reason. You say. Shall we listen? Alice said. Since when are you interested in a person\u2019s request? You say. Shall we speak somewhere else? The chief said. You, alice, luka, and tamamo follow the chief through the village streets. \u2026..oi, Why are you following to? Luka said. Watch your tone with your elders. I heard rumors of an impudent fool causing trouble here. I won\u2019t let something like that continue. Tamamo said. Defending your home. At least we know why. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n About that\u2026yamatai village is in quiet a rough spot due to a certain monster. The chief said with a strain in his voice. What kind of monster? Luka said. Her name is yamata no orochi. She\u2019s an eight headed monster that lives in a nearby cave. He said. Yamata no orochi\u2026..No human can do anything against her. Alice said. Yamata is demanding a villager to be her sacrifice\u2026 One young man per year\u2026 If we don\u2019t send her a sacrifice, she\u2019ll destroy the village. \u2026..That what she said when she came here five years ago. He said. Five years ago? So\u2026..Luka said. We are weak. We can\u2019t do anything about her. So far, we\u2019ve sent five sacrifices to her\u2026 He said. H\u2026How horrible! Luka said. Don\u2019t misunderstand me. Yamata said she wouldn\u2019t kill the sacrifice. To prove it, she sends back the previous year\u2019s sacrifice when we send the new one\u2026.so we are not sending them to their deaths. He said. Eh? So they come back alive? Luka said. Yes, but they are quiet exhausted and weak. Now on here. he said. The chief stops in front of a large building and opens the door for you all.  This is the meeting hall for those to discuss who goes. Please come this way. He said. He leads you all into a large room. Look. He\u2019s the last year\u2019s sacrifice. He said. What\u2026.the? Luka said. Laying on a futon, in the middle of the floor, A scrawny young man is mumbling to himself. Ahh\u2026..Master yamata\u2026 Where is she\u2026? He said.She\u2019s not here. You\u2019re safe. The village nurse said. No\u2026..not that. Suck more\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t care if it kills me. He said. They came back broken\u2026 they recover after a year\u2026..but they are precious young workers. And that\u2019s not the only problem. The chief said. The chief glances at the wall. From the other side, the sounds of men arguing. It\u2019s almost time for a new sacrifice. The young men meet and decide who it will be\u2026 But it turns into a huge dispute. He said. Of course it would. Luka said. You remain quiet throughout all of this. The chief leads you all to the building. So, please\u2026 Can you defeat yamata? He said. Why are you speaking so softly? Luka said. If the men heard me, they\u2019d beat me up. He said. Ah, I see\u2026 Luka said. I\u2019ll get rid of her. Luka said. Hm, hm\u2026..I wonder what the reward is? Alice said. Alright, I\u2019ll assist in taking down this fool. Tamamo said. You\u2019ll help? Luka said. Of course, you\u2019ll be quiet useful. Name luka as this year\u2019s sacrifice. Then luka can eliminate the fool. If he loses, then he\u2019ll really be the sacrifice. Tamamo said. Oi, oi\u2026.i don\u2019t like this strategy. Then again, it might be the only one we have. Luka said. Then I can leave it to you? In that case, tonight will be the best night to carry it out. The chief said. Yeah, let\u2019s do it. I\u2019ll take down yamata! Luka said. Ah, thanks for being so understanding! But please, keep this from the young men. He said. G\u2026.got it.  Luka said. I\u2019ll convince them to name you as the sacrifice, now if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2026.the chief said. The chief turns back to the arguing men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what do you think? Luka said. You still remain quiet. Saying nothing? No comment on the enemy? No sly thing to say? No boost how easy this might be? Alice said. You glare at alice. Your eyes, for a moment, turn red. Alice face pales a little from the sight of you. You leave wait around the village for night time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait next to the carriage with luka. (the air when I stand next to him. It\u2019s changed to a low blow, but with a feeling of hostility.) Luka thought. Then alice appears out of nowhere. Where\u2019s tamamo? Luka said. \u2026.She went back to the castle. It seems she didn\u2019t want to assist you directly.  Alice said. Really? Luka said. So\u2026.she left this in her place. She told me to give you this item. Alice said. Item\u2026? Luka said. Alice hands luka a strange ball of fur, about the size of his hand. T....this\u2026.Luka said. He gently pokes the ball of fur. Uhyahaya! That tickles! A voice said. You already know the voice. There. I handed it over. Alice said. Thanks\u2026.Luka said. He puts it in his bag. Just as usual, I won\u2019t assist you. If you fail, you really will be the sacrifice. Alice said. Yeah, leave it to me! Luka said. Saying that, alice vanishes as usual. The village chief quickly shows up. Thank you for waiting. Oh? Where\u2019s the might snake and fox? He said. Eh\u2026..I\u2019m the only one going. Luka said. I see. If she senses someone else, she may figure it out.  Now please, step into the carriage. he said. The carriage is held  by multiple villagers, and made of gold. Luka steps onto the carriage. Now then, let\u2019s go. The chief said. The men lift up the carriage and take luka out of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait a good 6 minutes before following the carriage. You get to the cave and enter. You go deeper inside Guh\u2026.! She\u2019s so strong! (All my attacks and she\u2019s barely flinching. The gap in power too wide. If this keeps up, I might not....Wait. the air. It\u2019s changed. He can\u2019t have.) Luka thought. Luka sees you step into the fight slowly. W\u2026..what are you doing here? Luka said. You remain quiet. Oh? Another human boy. Two for the price of one year. She said. Your eyes turn red. Hehe. Just sit back and wait your turn. She said. Yamata aims at blow at your body, but it bounces off  Wh\u2026.what the!? She said. It\u2026.bounced off?! Luka said. So it wasn\u2019t a total waste to come. Tamamo said. The ball of fur comes out of luka\u2019s bag and uncoils and grows into tamamo. Ta\u2026.tamamo!? Luka said. So you can feel the power of the earth too? Tamamo said. You stay quiet. Listen, to use the power  of earth fully, you have to feel it\u2019s breath. To be able to feel it underneath you. You need to imagine that your body is one with the earth. Tamamo said. The breath of earth flows up tamamo\u2019s feet into her body. \u2026\u2026What are you doing, you little beast? I\u2019ll teach you to interfere with me! Yamata said. She aims a blow at tamamo\u2019s neck, but she takes no damage. Wh\u2026..What?! She said. The image is the most important part. You must feel the energy coming from your feet, as if it coursing through your body. Do that, and blows will be nothing.  Tamamo said. Imagine my body is with the earth\u2026? Luka said. Come on, give it a try. With gnome with you, all you need to do is imagine it right. Tamamo said. G\u2026Got it\u2026Luka said. Luka concentrates. \u2026..hurry up. If you play around for too long, you\u2019ll be defeated. Tamamo said. Kuk\u2026.! Hold your tongue, impudent beast! Yamata said. She aims at tamamo\u2019s neck, but again her attack does nothing.  Impossible! Why is this little beast no reacting to my attacks!? She said. \u2026..you\u2019re wasting your time. You could do it a thousand times and the results will still be the same. Tamamo said. Take the breath of earth\u2026.Luka said. The breath of earth takes hold in luka\u2019s body. This is\u2026!? Luka said. Hmph. So you can do it. Now, let me play a little to. Tamamo said. The power of earth flows into tamamo\u2019s fist. It\u2019s a devasting hit. How can this be!? What is this force? Yamata said. You go in and hit without holding anything back. Luka attack, but it does little. Damn. Not even a flinch. He said. Hmmm. Seems too difficult for you to handle just yet. Tamamo said. The power of earth fills tamamo\u2019s tail. She slams her tail right onto yamata\u2019s body. Ahhg! How can this little beast hit so hard\u2026.!? Yamata said. You build and kick her hard.  Shesh. A few hundred years from home and the young girls here got arrogant. Now then, it\u2019s time to finish this. Tamamo said. Tamamo takes the angel halo from luka. This is the end! Tamamo said. She raises the sword above her and jumps high into the air. You focus all your strength and charge. Tamamo\u2019s attack, filled with the weight of the eart, slams into yamato\u2019s head, and your attack hit so fast and hard, that you went through her. My\u2026.power\u2026.. this can\u2019t Be! Yamata said. Yamata turns into a snake with multiple heads. After the fight, you quickly vanish back to the village</span></div></div>",

About time. I thought you were the sacrifice. You say. What do you mean? You were there. Luka said. No I wasn't. I was in the village. I thought since alice and tamamo would help, you didn't need mine. You say. But'..i was sure I saw you. Clear as day. Luka said. Maybe you were desperate and imagine I was there. You say. Hmmmm'.Alice said. Anyway'.where to? You say. To plansect village. I heard different monster races live together. Luka said. I hope in harmony. You say. Are you really going'? Sheesh, whatever. Alice said. Why don't you want to go? Is something wrong? Luka said. I do want to see it with my own eyes. Alice said. It's yes or no. Are you coming? You say. You and luka head out. So this is the entrance to plansect village? Luka said. I don't like how the trees are. See how low they are hanging. It's like they are being controlled. You say. Hm. I thought there'd be building, but there aren't. But I'm still looking forward to it. Luka said. You and luka  head into the forest. Hey, if you really weren't with me, why were you so quiet? Luka said. You know I'm deadly in a fight, right? You say. Very. Luka said. I was thinking. And when I think, I'm 2x as deadly. You say. So what were you actually doing then when I was in the cave? Luka said. Talking to that ninja elf. You say. The one who was blocking the entrance? Luka said. Yeah. She's kind of cute. We talked and she told me about why she was so reluctant to let us by. You say. So are you going to be''Luka said. No. I have a girlfriend. You say. As you observe the area, alice is looking at you again with curiosity. Just spit it out already alice. You say. ''.Your eyes''..She said. What about my eyes? You say. They're a different color now. At first they were red, now they went back to their original color. She said. And? You say. Maybe he has different eye color. Luka said. No. I know what I saw. His eyes were red like fire. You're strange luka, but he's even stranger. Alice said. Anything else you want to question about me while we're at it? You say. A lot, but we don't have the time for all of it, so I'll only ask one more thing: That thing on your wrist''.what is it? She said. That'..secret. Come on. You say. You keep walking. Hey look. Monsters up ahead. You say. Come on. Let's go. Luka said. Wait. Look. That doesn't look peaceful. Look around. Monsters on the ground wounded. You say. This is the exact opposite. It's a race war! Luka said. Plants vs insects'.you say. Come on! We have to help the plant monsters! Luka said. Luka rushes ahead. And I'm the reckless one? Luke's going to feel like an ass when I tell him this story. If he believes it. You say to yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurry up next to luka and stand beside him. Ohohho? Humans? The caterpillar girl said. Oh'..humans comeing to this village? How unusual'. But why would they protect the alraunes? Mosquito girl said. I don't think they are their reinforcements''  I think they are intruders. Moth girl said. I don't know what's going on, but stop this fight! The alraunes have already lost the will to fight! Luka said. If you're defending the plant monster, then you're our enemy to. Moth girl said.  Haha, today will be quite the feast. Not only plant juice, I'll get to suck out some human semen. Mosquito girl said. Enemy! Enemy! Get him!  Caterpillar girl said. Guh'..Not what I was hoping for'.Luka said. He pulls out his sword. You roll your eyes. Here I come! Luka said. Whoever makes him come first gets him. How's that sound? Moth girl said. First come first served? Fine by me. Mosquito girl said. Heheheh'..time to put him in my cocoon. Caterpillar said. Your eyes turn optical. The insect monsters all stand down Huh? Luka said. Go back to where you came from. Never show your faces around here again. You say. Yes'..master. they said. The insect monsters obediently obey your order and leave. Your eyes return to normal. Luka stares at you. Luka. Stay here and cut open that cocoon. I'll scout ahead. You say. R'..right. Luka said. You head deeper into the forest. Nothing interesting so far'.You say. Then you hear something behind you. Who's there? You say. It's alice. On one of your strolls? You say. ''.Fight me. She said. What? You said. I want you to fight me. Fight me right now. Alice said. What? Why? You say. I know you've secretly wanted to fight me when you found out I was the monster lord. Now's your chance. Or are you to scared? Alice said. Then luka comes out of the bushes. Hey. What's going on? Luka said.  I'm challenging him to a fight. No human can make monsters just listen to him at will. I challenged him to see how strong he is. Alice said. At a time like this? Alice, there are bigger problems here than this. Luka said. Come on. I know you secretly want to fight me one on one. Now you get it. Or have you chickened out? Alice said. This is crazy. Talk her out of this. Luka said. Alright. I've been waiting for this for a long time for thisLuka wants to protest, but he can feel that if he interferes, he'll be killed. So he quickly runs away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ok. We're alone. No hindrances. You say. Then come. Alice said. You and alice lock eyes for a minute and both of you charge and punches collide between the both of you. (From now on, all battles will be like Naruto UNS3 after someone wins a fight.) With each of your blows intercepted by the other, it will be hard for a hit to land. You block one of here and grab her arm. You toss her through some trees and she doesn't stop until she hits a huge tree. You run towards her, but she moves out of the way and you hit the tree with your fist. The power you had behind it knocks the tree out of its roots. Alice binds you with her tail. (Her hold is strong. Like she wants to kill me, but I'm stronger than she'll ever be!) You thought. You power your way free, grab her and charge through trees with alice as a shield. You stop after running through 8 trees. You throw her down, but she gets right back up. (expect nothing less.) You thought. Alice uses the power of darkness. What the? You say. Lice attacks you reapeadly, but you take no damage. Is that all? You say. Alice eyes flash brightly. (that again?) you thought. You disappear and reappear in the same spot. Anything else? You say. Give in to me. She said. Her eyes flash brightly again. Your eyes turn optical and negate her hypnosis. W'..what?! Alice said. I can't be hypnotized.  You say. You disappear and reappear behind alice. Endgame. You say. You stab alice with your knife, but just the tip of the knife and yank it out.<br>\r\nIs this all the monster lord has? You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeh. You say. You were holding back. Alice said. So you knew I wasn't fight at 100%. You say. If you were powerful enough to make 3 monsters obey you, then you are more than powerful to have beaten me within 2 minutes of the fight. Plus, you only delve the tip of your knife into me. Alice said. I didn't want to kill you. Just beat you to the point you realized what happened in a fight with me. You say.  Just one thing: Why didn't you put all your effort into it? Alice said. I'm not the one who wants to beat you alice. That's luka's job. He wants to beat the monster lord. Not me. I'm just here to make sure he gets to your castle alive. Plus, if I did go 100% on you alice, one punch would have been the end of you. You say. You extend your hand to her. She reluctantly takes you hand and you help her up. I didn't beat you up too bad, did i? You say. The only thing that hurt was being rammed through the trees. Alice said. Like you said, I was holding back. You say. You laugh. What? Alice said. You're kind of cute when you're serious. You say. '''.jerk. Alice said. You and alice find luka and he fills you in on the subject. Alice, can't you force them to come to an agreement? You say. The monster lord should never be a tyrant. If I forced a peace agreement that neither side wants, it won't end well. Alice said. So this war is the only option. Luka said. So why are you all out here alone? You say. I'm apart from the detachment force. Luka said. Assassin. Well, I can't let you wander in a forest like this by yourself. Who knows what's in this forest. You say. And just like that, you're in this too. Alice said. I don't know the story, but I'll help as best I can. Alice''.do'..whatever it is you do while me and luka are dealing with a problem. You say. After you said that, alice vanishes. Ok. Let's go. You say. You and luka head down the path until it splits. Which way to the queen bee's place? Luka said. While looking, you see tom walking down one of the paths. Tom..?Hey! Hey! You say. Whoa. You saw someone? Luka said. I saw''.something that lead down that path. It was one of my friends. You say. Maybe we should take care of the queen be first before looking for your friend. That way it be less dangerous. Luka said. Maybe''but there might be something I have to deal with right now down that path. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

So you sure you saw someone come down this way? Luka said. This was the only way. You say. That doesn't answer my question. Luka said. As you and luka keep walking down the path, a tree mysteriously falls on the road. Shit. The path is blocked. Now what? You say. Then you start hearing voices all over. What the? L-Luka are you hearing this? You say. You grip your head from hearing all the voices at once. Traitor. Monster. Killer. Murderer. They said. They stay for a few seconds then leave. Luka....? You say. You and luka move through the forest. While moving through, you see a piece of paper on the ground. You pick it up and read it. M...my first contract....You said. When you drop it you and see the person standing in front of you with a slit neck. Ugh....! You said. How much was i worth....? He said before disappearing. You remember him. You slit his throat from behind for for six hundred dollars.Then the world changes to m district. You then see yourself standing over a wounded and bruised Ashley. I remember this..... You said. You see yourself  punch Ashley through the heart and hear a bone chilling scream. Agh! What the hell's going on here!? Luka talk to me! You say. You regain yourself and keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and luka go farther into the forest until you see Tom. Tom....? You said. Coming from behind him, you see Hank, Cody, Bruce and Dante. Along with Kris, Kate, and Sam. Guys. What are you..... You said. You see a bright flash. When your vision returns, you see them on the ground dead. No.... You said. You look at your hands and they were covered in blood. So was your knife. No.....Not them. Of all the people..... I wouldn't..... You said as a piece of paper appears in front of you. You look and see all the zeros on it. S.....so much..... No...! NO! It's not worth it!! You shout as you rip up the paper. The bodies disappear and your vision returns to normal.  Luka? You say. Who else? Now are we going to stand here all day? Luka said. Stand here? You say. We've been standing here in front of this fallen tree for 7 minutes. Are we going or not? Luka said. ''No. let's go back and get the queen. Luka said. Maybe your friend found his way out. Luka said. You and luka head back and go down the left path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your head. (Luka didn't see what I saw? Oh no. I'm turning into Isaac Clarke.) You say. (Don't turn insane.) he said. As you and luka move through down the path, you see a gigantic cocoon. Whoa. You say. Look at it. A whole human could fit in there. Luka said. When you get closer, it starts wiggling. Someone's still alive in there. You say. We have something to do. We'll come back for it. Luka said. You and luka continue to walk and come across more cocoons. There's a whole bunch of them. Luka said. We weren't the first to come down this way. Something had to make these cocoons, but what? You say. An ominous feeling washes over luka. Something's behind us! Luka said. You'll be like that soon, too'.A voice said. You and luka turn around to see a monster silk worm. A silkworm. Of course. They're the only thing that make their own silk. You say.  Inside these cocoons are plant monsters'. They were nosing around, so I wrapped them up. My cocoons feels amazing. So it's like being in heaven'She said. You did all of this? Luka said. You must be strong then. The plants that were trying to get into sectforest were supposed to be strong. At least, that what luka told me. You say.  They were. Luka said. I'll wrap you both up too' It will be a taste of heaven, so just give in to it' She said. Guh'.I won't let that happen! Luka said. Heh. If I start giving up, I'd wouldn't be where I am today. Let's go luka! You say. Take a breath of earth into my body! Luka said. You punch her. Hehe'..delicious. She said. The silkworm sucks luka dick into her mouth. Luka steps in like thunder and stabs her. Hehe'.you'll be wrapped  in heaven in my cocoon. She said. The silkworm sprays sticky silk all over luka's body. Ahhh'.. This'.feels good. Luka said. Hehe'.My silk drowns it catch in ecstasy. You'll soon want to be completely wrapped in this silk. She said. Not on my watch! You say. You shoulder charge her back and cut luka out of the cocoon. Ahhh. Sorry.  Lost myself for a second. Luka said. Don't mention it. You say. You and luka attack together. I see'. You two together make a dangerous combination. So'..She said. She sprays sticky silk all over your body. Let's see how you do own your own. She said. Silk? Please. You say. Luka! You say. Right! He said. Luka runs up a tree and while he does that, you break free of the cocoon. Impossible'..No one has gotten out of my cocoon. She said. You hit her in the stomach which makes her bend over. Luka comes down hard on her skull. Guh'..What is this?! She said. The silk worm girl turns into a normal silkworm.<br>\r\nI think I'm improving. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess was right. These insects are no joke. Luka said. Take a breath. You need it. You say. Luka takes a few seconds to catch his breath. Ok. I'm good. Let's go. He said. You and luka keep going. So this is sectforest'.Luka said. I don't see much of a difference from planforest.  You say. There. That tree with the  huge hole in the base. Queen bee's hive' Luka said. No guards or anything. Let's go before they catch on. You say. You and luka cautiously walk towards the hive. Damn. It's like a cave. Luka said. Shhh. Noise discipline. In enemy territory. You say. You and luka head deeper inside, but are stopped by a hornet girl. Intruders' eliminate' She said. A bee type monster'.She has to be a subordinate of queen bee. Luka said. (Supple limbs'but a sturdy exoskeleton. She's bred for battle. This won't be easy.)Luka thought. When luka reaches for his sword, it's gone. What the hell? My sword!? Luka said. You appear behind the hornet girl and stab her in the back with luka's sword. The hornet girl turns into a regular hornet. You hand luka his sword back. Sorry I didn't say anything. We couldn't afford her to call more of them. You say. Argh. Can you clear it up with me first. I thought I was in trouble without my sword. Luka said. Yeah. You say. I could tell from glance that she was powerful. So the queen bee must be close. Luka said.  You and luka keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking a little longer, you both come to a large room. Right in the middle of that room, is a monster on a shrine. Are you the queen!? Luka said. Indeed. I am queen bee. Why did you come here, humans? She said. I want to end this war! If you won't listen and stop, we'll be force to defeat you! Luka said. ''Unfortunately, we cannot stop fighting. I govern this insect tribe. I must protect those in my charge. She said. Then we have no choice''we seal you away! Luka said. He raises his sword towards the queen. If you won't give up'..then I'll be your opponent. I'll defeat you both with the power of a queen! She said. You and luka attack at the same time. You won't last long with this'.She said. Queen bee forces luka's penis into her mouth, and violently suck on it. When you can't take it anymore, shoot in my mouth. She said. Queen bee continuous to suck on luka's penis. Luka uses you at a spring board and jumps into the air. He comes down hard on her skull. You attack her with a powerful kick. This is a man's weak point. She said.  The queen's hands reach towards you. You grab her two hands, but can't stop her other two. (Shit!) You say. Then two arms come out  of your side which grab the other two hands. What? She said. Luka! You say. Rihgt! Luka said. Luka steps in and stabs the queen bee. The two arms quickly disappear. Drown in the queen's chest'. She said. The queen sandwiches luka's penis between her breast. You kick her off. You attack her with an uppercut. You hit her towards luka and he stabs her. Hmmm'..I may have underestimated you both. Shall I get serious? She said. A kiss will mesmerize any man.  She said. She kisses luka. Luka has been seduced. Ahhh'.what'.is this? Luka said. Don't you want to drown in my body? I give you permission'..Do what you want with my body. She said. I don't think so! You say. You attack, but it's blocked by luka. That's right. Protect your queen. She said. I knew that would happen. Thought I'd give it a try. Ok. Let's go. You say. You attack again, but it's blocked by luka. Gotcha. You say. You grab luka and your eyes turn optical. Ugh'.! Luka said. He breaks free. Ohhhh. My head. Luka said. Hmmmm'..I see. I'll have to double my efforts with you. She said. Luka attacks with a slash. You attack her with a strong punch, but she grabs both your arms. Let go! You say. You're full of surprises. I think I'll keep you for myself. This fight is mine. She said. You're right about one thing. I am full of surprises. Luka! Now! You say. Got it! Luka said. Luka steps in so quickly that he leaves an after image and his sword is already sheath. Impossible'..when did he'..She said. We never fight without a plan. And this was the plan. If I could get you to focus on me, you'd forget about luka and leave yourself open to an attack from behind. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it. The war's over. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I'm defeated'..Then my insect tribe is doom! She said. The queen bee turns into a tiny normal queen bee. Whew'..She was tough. I thought for a moment our plan wouldn't work. Luka said. I couldn't just let you walk in swords pointed. Plus, My plans always work. You boosted. (Most of the times.) he said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As luka falls onto one knee, another hornet girl rushes into the room. Humans. Queen is? She said. Sorry, but I had to seal her\u2026 She isn\u2019t dead and can turn back to normal. But this pointless war is over. Luka said. (No. this thing is far from over. In fact, it\u2019s just starting.) You thought. Stop right there, insect scum. Your queen has been vanquished\u2026. Thanks to that, our victory is certain. An alraune said. (it\u2019s the ones from last time.) You thought. P\u2026Plants!? The hornet girl said. Hehehe. Time to hunt down the remains. Alra arum said. Alra arum grabs hold of the trembling hornet girl and wraps her in her petals. Now, to suck out your nutrients\u2026.She said. Uaaa\u2026.. Hornet girl. W\u2026.wait a minute! The battle\u2019s over, what are you doing?! Luka said. \u201cWhat\u201d\u2026.? We won the war. All of the insects scum are our spoils to be made food!  Hehe\u2026..Thanks for the meal. She said. With a pleased look on her face, she parts her petals from the hornet girl. With her body fluids all sucked out, the hornet girl\u2019s shivering body collapses on the ground. N\u2026No\u2026. Luka said. \u2026..Queen, what\u2019s wrong? Ah\u2026\u2026Plant soldiers\u2026.? Caterpillar girl said. Oho\u2026Delicious looking insect found! Alra rooty said. hehehe\u2026. What a tasty looking morsel. I\u2019ll need to pay you back for that humiliation from before\u2026. Alra arum said. Wawawawa\u2026. Caterpillar girl said. A black fire circle the two plant monster. What? They both said. Luka. You say. Luka grabs his sword and moves fast enough that he\u2019s on the other side of fire wall and his sword is already sheath. The two plant monsters turn into regular plants. Your eyes return to normal and the fire disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamnit. All I wanted to do was end this stupid war. I took a side, fought for them and this happens. Luka said. you didn\u2019t know which side was wrong. You just listen to one side\u2019s story. You say. *Sigh* All I wanted was to end this war. Now it\u2019s turn into genocide. Luka said. Not good. The plant army is going to be here, soon! Mosquito girl said. Siege! Endure the end! A hornet girl said. A few insect soldiers rush into the room. They\u2019re all injured, but still able to move. Humans\u2026.! Ah. You! Mosquito girl said. \u2026..Enemies!? Hornet girl said. Enemies, allies\u2026 I\u2019m sick of it! Luka said. Luka and you walk past the injured insect girls, and head towards the exit. \u2026\u2026How many insect soldiers are there?  How far away are they? Luka said. Over thirty. They\u2019re about to invade the hive at any moment\u2026. Mosquito girl said. You\u2026.ally? hornet girl said. \u2026..Didn\u2019t you hear me? Enemies or allies\u2026. Those words mean nothing! Luka yells. You and luka walk out of the hive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the hive, you both come across a hunting party. A group of plant monsters hunting down fleeing insect monsters. Running down stragglers, they pile on and attack. Wrapping them in ivy, and sucking out their body fluids, wrapping flowers around them. They toy with them in many ways\u2026 Ah\u2026.if it isn\u2019t the heroes of the war. Thanks to you both, the victory is ours! Alra parasol Said. Please, join the winner\u2019s feast along with us. Rape, eat\u2026. Whatever you like. Alra vore said. You and luka look at each other and nod. Your eyes turn optical and black fire surround them. Fire!? They said. Luka pulls out his sword and leaves an three after images and his sword is sheath. All three of the plant monsters turn into large flowers. Guh\u2026.heads up! More! Luka said. Right after luka defeats the three alraunes, three more take their place. Luka holds his sword down and to his side, and charges as fast as he can. You grab your knife and disappear. Give up, traitors! One alraune said. You may be strong, but you can\u2019t defeat us all by yourselves! Another said.  Get out of my way! Luka said. Luka slashes upwards with all his strength , and uses the momentum gained to hit the next alrunae with even more powerful downward blow. You reappear behind the last alrunae and slice her from behind. Ah\u2026.! She said. Luka steps in and stabs her. Damn them\u2026.Attack from behind! She said. You watch luka\u2019s back and stop the attack from behind him. He jumps off your back and crushes the alrunaes skull with his sword. Damn you, human! One alraune said. How dare you attack my allies! Another said. Out of our way! You say. The alrunaes attack in unison. Luka attacks the left alrune with a powerful slash and you attack the right one with a lethal thrust into her chest. How can we be losing with this many!? One alraune said. Are they really human!? Another said. It\u2019s because we are human\u2026. That we can\u2019t let this happen! Luka said. The plant monsters rush you both from all sides, as luka slashes at everything that moves towards him, and as you take them down hard with your superior moves. Then in only a few moments, you both are surrounded by a field of flowers and part of the field are dead alrunaes. Luka\u2019s breathing hard, but you\u2019re just standing there.  Your eyes return to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alice\u2026..You say. Alice\u2026.i\u2026..was I wrong? Luka said.  Your mistake was that you only listen to one side\u2019s story. You believe that your side has suffered an injustice, and the other side is the oppressors. Nobody every goes to war thinking they are the ones at fault. They aren\u2019t lying\u2026\u2026Both sides think they are right. Believing to be the side of justice opposing cruelty, both sides slaughtered the other feeling justified in their own cruelty. Alice said. it\u2019s never good to just hear one sides story. And this is the result of doing that. You say. Now then? What are you going to do now? Alice said. \u2026..I don\u2019t know. What would a true hero do\u2026.? What would I do? Luka said. How long are you going to bind your actions to that \u201ctrue hero\u201d crap? You made your own image of a \u201ctrue hero\u201d, and you\u2019re trying to use it to justify your actions. Alice said. But, I have to be a hero\u2026. I can\u2019t be anything but one. Luka said. You can be anything you want if you put your mind to it.  We know you want to be a hero, but is that what you truly want? What was the reason for taking part in this war you thought was pointless? You say. And didn\u2019t you use that to justify a deeper reason? Alice said. A deeper reason\u2026. Luka said. I don\u2019t want to see weak people bullied by the strong\u2026 neither human or monsters\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want to see anyone suffering. Luka said. Then that\u2019s your reason. Alice said. Wield your sword for your own desire, and you\u2019ll never falter. You say. You don\u2019t need to justify it as what a \u201ctrue hero\u201d would do. It\u2019s what you want to do. That matters. Alice said. Then i\u2026..we have to go to planforest. If you want to tag along. Luka said. Got nothing better to do. Plus, someone has to make sure you\u2019re not killed. You say. Looks like you found your path. Don\u2019t forget, you decided yourself why you started walking it. Alice said. Saying that, she vanishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy own reason huh? Luka said. You\u2019ve been deciding what a true hero would do this or that. But this isn\u2019t a true hero story, this is your story. You decide what to do and not do. You decide who to point your sword at, but mostly, you decide when your story starts and when it ends. You say. \u2026\u2026Every time, I\u2019ve been justifying my actions by placing them on the responsibility for the choice of my made up image of this hero. But now, I\u2019ll take that responsibility. I\u2019ll protect those in front of me\u2026. Let\u2019s go\u2026\u2026and put an end to this. Luka said. Walking right into the dragon\u2019s mouth? No other way than that. Let\u2019s go\u2026\u2026hero. You say. I\u2026\u2026haven\u2019t earn that title yet. Luka said. By what you just said, you have in my eyes. You say. \u2026\u2026Thanks, but until I know I\u2019ve truly earn the title. Don\u2019t call me that. Now let\u2019s go. You and luka rush forward to planforest.</span></div></div>",

You say. You aren't planning on stopping this war, are you? Luka said. ....yes, that's right. Once the insects have all been exterminated, the war will be over. Until the threat of them has been removed, we will never know peace. Is it true the Canaan sisters did horrible things to the insects? Luka said. All they did was feed on some live prey.... They're carnivorous plants, after all. But.... That's also their right as the winner isn't it? She said. ...There's no right to that. I'm not a pacifist. I don't think everyone in the world will hold hands and be best friends. But.... This isn't war. This is genocide. I won't let this continue! Luka said. .....it seems like you changed your position. Very well, I shall be your opponent. She said. Even after we sealed so many, you still want to fight... Luka said. In combat expertise, you both surpass me. But in the art of pleasure lies my chance. If I can exhaust you, my victory is guaranteed. She said. You're welcome to try. You say. I'm a high class Alraune. Scum like you doesn't deserve to touch my reproductive organ. But simpletons like you can be dominated in other ways. Now come, I shall dominate you! She said. Luka and you attack together. Be absorbed in the ecstasy of my scent... She said. A sweet smell spreads from the priestess's flowers. You both dodge it. You attack her. Here I go! Luka said. Luka's sword flash's like a frenzied star. heh, it's humiliating. Isn't it? She said. Alra priestess steps on luka's penis. You and luka attack together. This hair is more than enough.... She said. Alra priestess's hair wraps luka's penis. You attack her. Luka attacks also. More powerful than I thought. I'll have to go all out! She said. Be defeated by my breast... She said. Alra priestess squeezes her breast around luka's penis, and quickly them up and down. Let's go! You say. You strong punch her. While kneed over, luka comes down hard on her skull. Why..... how are you both so strong...? She said. Alra priestess turns into a flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot over just yet..... Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet out here, Canaan sister! Luka said. Oh, is someone calling me? A voice said. A voice calls out from the depths of the forest. Suddenly, a weird carnivorous plant appears. Just one? Where are the others? Luka said. My sisters? Ah, they're busy eating. We're having quite a feast thanks you two. She said. I want to ask just one question... Do you have to eat humans or monsters to survive? Luka said. No.... I can live off non sentient animals easily. A high class plant monster like me is even capable of living off water and oxygen. Then why prey on others? You say. I love it... teasing and bullying the defeated. The loser struggles as I slowly digest them... It's so fun! She said. You and luka nod at each other. We're going to have to seal you. Luka said. He points his sword t Dorothy's face. hehe... It's been I while since I've eaten a human. it feels incredible to be digested by a carnivorous plant. I'll let you both enjoy it.... You'll love being digested by me! She said. You both attack her. I'll play with you a little. She said. Tiny fine hairs from Dorothy wraps around luka's penis. Here I go! Luka said. Luke's sword flashes like a frenzied star. You attack. Come on. I'll force you in. She said. Dorothy grabs luka and brings him closer to her. Hehe, time to dissolve you. melt away in the sweet pleasure.... She said. Not on my watch. You say. You break luka free. hehe. Good job. It would have been heaven to. She said. Let's do this! You say. You take luka's sword and disappear. You reappear right behind her and do a powerful slash from behind. I....it can't be..... Sister! She said. Dorothy turns into a sundew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't that tough. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe're not done yet! Where are you!? I know the others are there! Luka said. Hearing his shout. You turn around to see another monster coming out of the forest. hehe, you both defeated Dorothy. Even though you both are humans.... You're quite skilled. She said. Quit attacking the defeated. If you don't, i'll seal you too. Luka said. hehe... I can't do that. I enjoy slowly dissolving my prey too much. I'll put you in my pitcher too, and let you join in the fun... You'll both drown in pleasure. She said. You both attack her. Fill this pitcher with your semen... She said. A small pitcher is forced onto luka's penis. The liquid stimulate luka's penis.  Luka steps in and stabs sharply. You attack. Let me make you feel good. Her ivy rubs all over you. You and luka attack together. I see..... In that case. She said. Her ivy shoots towards you and holds you. Grrr...! You plant bitch! You say. hehe. I'll digest you first. She said. Like hell! Luka said. Luka thrusts his sword, making her drop you. It can't be....! I.....can't....! She said. Raffia turns into a normal pitcher plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's finally over... Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for that. I was taken by surprise on that. You say. No problem. Wait. More enemies!? Luka said. Another one! You say. I'm the eldest of the Canaan sisters, Deana. Looks like my sisters have you two to thank for their current forms. She said. There was another sister.... How many more!? Luka said. I'm the last of us three. But that doesn't matter, since i'll be eating you. Personally, I prefer insects. But since you two challenged us, I'll gladly eat you. She said. You and luka attack together. I'll dissolve your penis.... She said. Deana's predatation organs wrap around luka's penis. it squeezes tightly. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. You attack. I'll even dissolve your penis. She said. Deana's predatation organs try to wrap around you, but you dodge it and hit her hard.Luka attacks also. Time to melt you... she said.  A sweet smell comes from Deana's body. But you both dodge it. You both attack at once. I'll catch you... She said. You're being restrained by her. I'll tease you while I digest you. You'll go to heaven while I play with you... She said. Play with this! You say. You break free. The longer you struggle, the more you suffer. She said. You hit her hard and luka stabs sharply. All three of us..... Lost? She said. Deane turns into a normal venus fly trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's over. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall on the ground. So what now? Both side's lost the bulk of their army. You say. .....it looks like it's really over this time. but it doesn't look like anything was solved. Alice said. I've hurt too many monster after coming from this forest. I wanted to be a hero. To do the right thing. Luka said. You justified your actions by claiming what your own self imagined hero would do. If that's how you determine justice in this world, You'll always make mistakes. Alice said. Justice... Luka said. Each side thought they were right and the other was wrong. They thought the other side was evil, and they were right. That's how most wars start. You say. It's not just here, but the world itself. When you stand on the side of justice and the other evil. it's quite easy to forget your own brutality. Alice said. So I did something good....? or bad? Luka said. Well, what'd you think? What was your goal for this again? You say. Stop this war. He said. Well, there you go. You say. Despite the foolish hero and the wanton sealing..... You still ended the war. You should be proud of that. Of course they were mistakes you made on the way. Alice said. that's right.... I don't want to make any more mistakes. My reason for fighting can't be called justice. I just don't want to see monsters or humans being hurt. that's why i'll fight. Luka said. Hm, that's good. The idiot should keep his idiotic reasoning.... Hm? Alice said. A nearby bush stats to shake. A plant monster sheepishly comes out towards you three. Ahhh.... She said. It's alraune, and she looks frightened. You say. She's not the only one. Luka said. After her were more plant monsters, and a few insects too. Uh..... Err.... Could it be.... Is the war over? She said. yeah.... And you are? You say. We're the ones who didn't want to fight.... While everyone was fighting, we all ran away because we didn't want to be a part of it. We met rally deep in the woods, and stayed together. But we came back because something strange was happening. She said. The war is over...? Can we stop hiding and running now...? tarantula girl said. Yes.... The war's over. Neither queen bee or alra priestess or Canaan sisters can hurt you any more. Luka said. I see..... We finally have peace! Alraune said. Everyone, did you hear that!? The war's over! No more fighting! tarantula girl said. Insect and plant monsters flood into the field, coming out from their hiding in the surrounding forest. (So many of them.) You say. ( lot didn't like this war.) he said. There're so many casualties... We have to do something... Alraune said. Let's split up the first aid duties! We'll head over to sectforest while you guys deal with this area! tarantula girl said. Good, we'll split up and help those in planforest! Alraune said. The monsters quickly divide up areas and get to work providing aid. Well..... That was interesting. You say. So there were monsters who didn't want to fight. Luka said. With this many monsters helping them with their own magic power... They'll be able to unsealed far faster than I thought. Your behavior was absurd and reckless. But now that we know it can be fixed, it wasn't bad at all. She said. Yeah. Wasn't all a disaster. Look they've already gotten half of the monsters up. You say. Alright let's go. Even if we stand here, we can't do anything. Luka said. Yes, let's keep going. This time, let's go somewhere where there's something good to eat. Alice said. it's always food.... You both say.</span></div></div>",

Yes. Let's go to undine spring. Luka said. You three headed to undine\u2019s spring. This is a spring\u2026.? It\u2019s more of a lake. Luka said. The atmosphere is the same as sylph and gnome when we found them. You say. This place\u2026. I see, Erubetie\u2019s\u2026. It looks like this is going to get annoying. Alice said. You know something, alice? Luka said. She\u2019s not going to tell. We might as well just head in. You say. As you take a step towards the spring, you hear a voice. Stay away. It said. What? You say. Humans. Stay away from this place\u2026 It said. Luka. Did you hear that? You say. Yeah. Was that undine\u2019s voice? Luka said. Only one way to find out. Come on. You say. But what do we look for? A cave or something? We don\u2019t even know where the entrance is. Luka said. The entrance must be in the spring somewhere. If you dive in, you\u2019ll probably make it to the entrance. Alice said. Right. I got it! You aren\u2019t coming? Luka said. I hate damp and humid places. I\u2019ll wait here. Alice said. Got it. Then we\u2019re heading out. Luka said. Get undine\u2019s power and come back safely. Don\u2019t lose in a boring, humid place. Alice said. Aw, she cares. You say. Sh\u2026.. Shut up! Alice said quickly. Let\u2019s go. Luka said. You both jump into the spring. Suddenly, you both are wrapped in a bright white light. When it fades, you both are in a dark, damp cave. Is this the place? You say. Yeah, but the strange atmosphere gives it a creepy feeling. Luka said. Of all the places, why would undine be here? You say. Must be relaxing for her here. Let\u2019s go find her. Luka said. As you both step deeper into the cave, a puddle in front of you both takes the form of a girl. Uh-oh. You say. Humans, why are you here\u2026.? Just for you  both, let me drink some semen. She said. It\u2019s just like the first monster you faced. You say. Yeah, but I\u2019m not the same back then. Luka said. Her body is flexible and able to change shape and form at will. We just want to meet undine. He said. I\u2019ll wrap up your body\u2026.. And play with you until you come. She said. She\u2019s not listening! Luka said. I prefer to use my fist, but they will just go through. So I\u2019ll use my knife. You say. You pull out your knife. Here I go! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. You slash her. Leak your semen into my slime. She said. The jelly girl\u2019s slime covers luka\u2019s penis. You both attack together. Drown in my slime\u2026. She said. The jelly girl spreads her slime over your body. Ugh! I just had this cleaned\u2026.. You say. You and luka luka attack together. Leak your semen into my slime\u2026.. She said. The jelly girl\u2019s slime covers luka\u2019s penis. Luka attacks again. What\u2026.. is this? She said. Jelly girl turns into a puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s a huge difference from before\u2026. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo monsters even attack us here. Luka said. Well, we are on slime territory. So it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise. You say. Let\u2019s go. Luka said. You both keep going. Even after I said not to approach\u2026 Why have you come here? A voice said. It\u2019s the same voice we heard last time. Luka said. It seems like whoever it is doesn\u2019t want us to be here. You say. You think it should be undine? Luka said. If it was undine, why would she want us not to enter? You say. Good point. Luka said. I think we should hurry up. You say. You and luka rush forward. You both stop when you hear the voice again. Are we getting closer? You say. I think. This cave seems not to have any turns. Luka said. Then you see a blue liquid leaks in from the ground. It pools and grows, taking the form of a woman. A powerful looking slime stands in front of you both. (This must be Erubetie.) You thought. You both ignored my repeated warning. And came here anyway. This sacred area where my brethren live in peace. We took this spring that humans polluted, cleansed it, and turned it into our own dwelling. Why do you humans continue to pollute this place? She said. No, that\u2019s not it! We didn\u2019t come here to pollute or anything! We just want to meet undine! Luka said. Undine feels the same as I do. She has no desire to meet humans. For treading upon this sacred place. I\u2019ll have to punish you both. That body\u2026. I\u2019ll play with it\u2026.. Dissolve it\u2026.. Eat it\u2026. She said. Damn carnivore. You say. Whoever disturbs our home, whoever it is, I\u2019ll melt them. She said. (She\u2019s totally different from the others. If I don\u2019t give it all, we won\u2019t get out of here alive!) Luka thought. You push luka back. Take a knee on this one. I got this. Luka said. But she\u2019s trying to kill us\u2026. Luka said. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone tried to. Luka\u2026.. Have I ever let you down before? Haven\u2019t I always trusted you? You say. No and yes. Luka said. Then let me handle this. You say. Erubetie stares at you both. \u2026.I dislike humans. Do you know why us of the slime race live here? Humans pollute the water, and steal away the environment for their own use. She said. But humans aren\u2019t\u2026. Silence. Your words will never change my opinion. You polluted this spring, and harmed the slimes living here\u2026 I\u2019ll need to give you your reward for those actions. She said. Before that, tell me. Can slime regenerate? You say. \u2026\u2026yes. She said. So none of my physical attacks will work. Ok then. You say. You sheath your knife. (wh\u2026.. What\u2019s he doing?) Luka thought. I\u2019ll melt you away\u2026. Feel  the anger and sorrow of our race as you dissolve into nothing. She said. Erubetie\u2019s slime creates a massive tsunami. The massive wall of slime slams into your body, but you feel nothing and still stand there. \u2026..Impossible\u2026.. She said. N\u2026.. No way!( he took that head on. And still standing.) Luka said. Slime is like water. Just with more weight behind it. I\u2019m more adapt to taking hits and not feel anything. Now it\u2019s my turn. Luka. Buy me some time. You say. But\u2026. He said. Trust me. I won\u2019t let you die. Especially not in front of me. You say. R\u2026. Right! Luka said. Luka stands in front of you. I won\u2019t give you the time\u2026.. She said. Erubetie\u2019s slime creates a massive tsunami. The massive wall slams into luka. Ahhh! Luka said. The powerful slime knocks luka down flat, but he\u2019s still hanging in there. I used the power of earth and everything I had to guard. It looks like you are able to use a little bit of the spirits power\u2026 Why are the spirits lending there power to a human\u2026.? She said. Luka stands back up. You took it once\u2026.. but that won\u2019t happen again. She said. She\u2019s going to use it again!? Luka said. Her slime creates a massive tsunami. <br>\r\nThen a burst of water creates a magic formation. The wall protects you both from harm. What the? You say. Eh\u2026.!? Luka said. It can\u2019t be\u2026.. A human using power? No\u2026. This was your doing, undine\u2026. Why did you protect these humans? She said. These humans came to meet me. There\u2019s no reason for you to deal with them yourself. Undine said. You dislike humans as I do, don\u2019t you? \u2026.. Well, fine. If you say so, I\u2019ll let you deal with them\u2026. Erubetie said. Erubetie melts, and sinks into the ground. Y\u2026.. You saved us? Luka said. Why? You say. Since sylph and gnome are obeying you, I deemed you worth meeting. That wish for monsters and humans to live together in harmony\u2026 I\u2019ll have to test you. She said. All you luka. Give it your best! You say. Then I do have to show you my strength! Luka said. I\u2019m not nice like sylph and gnome. If I see you\u2019re poor in use of power, I won\u2019t pardon you. I\u2019ll wrap your body, and take both your body and soul. You\u2019ll be taken inside my body and melted into nothing. She said. Then I\u2019ll make you acknowledge me! Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake a breath of earth into my body\u2026.! Luka said. Will you yield to this\u2026.? She said. Undine\u2019s tail wraps around luka\u2019s penis, slowly stroking him up and down. Here I go! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. If you come by, you\u2019re unqualified. She said. Undine grabs luka\u2019s penis with her hand. His penis sinks into her slimy hand as she shakes it all around. Luka attacks. I\u2019ll wrap up your body\u2026 She said. Undine\u2019s body absorbs luka\u2019s. If you\u2019re unqualified, then you\u2019ll be absorbed . She said. With the power of earth, luka breaks free. It seems you can use the power of earth a little, but your skill in handling it is poor. She said. Luka attacks. Endure this pleasure. Undine\u2019s grabs luka\u2019s penis with her hand. His penis sinks into her slimy hand as she shakes it all around. (Luka\u2019s doing good out there, but he\u2019s slowly losing it. If this keeps up\u2026.) You thought. Here I come! Luka said. Luka runs up a wall and comes down hard on Undine\u2019s head. Will you yield to this\u2026.? She said. Undine\u2019s tail wraps around luka\u2019s penis, slowly stroking, him up and down. Ugh\u2026. Luka said. Struggling at this point\u2026. You may not be qualified. She said.(What do I do?) Luka thought. Use both the power of wind and earth at the same time. If you can\u2019t even do that, then you aren\u2019t qualified to wield the power of water. She said. (At the same time. I don\u2019t have the concentration to do it.) Luka thought. If you can\u2019t, then I\u2019ll never deem you qualified. Unqualified humans will be preyed on\u2026. She said. Luka. Do it. You have to try. You say. Combined both wind and earth\u2026\u2026 Luka said. Powerful winds infuse with luka\u2019s body. I\u2026.did it! Luka said. It seems like you\u2019re able to call both of them at once. Perhaps you are capable of wielding my power too. She said. You mean\u2026..! Luka said. You pass. I shall grant you the power of water. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright! I did it! Luka said.</span></div></div>",

Project your calm heart out of yourself, forming a pure blade\u2026 She said. Eh\u2026? Luka said. There was once a swordsman who wielded all four spirits at once. He had natural talent, but it still took him a year to wield the power of water. I wonder how long it will take you\u2026.? She said. While saying that, Undine points at luka\u2019s hand. His palm sparkles in an astounding blue light as undine vanishes. This is\u2026. Luka said. Feel any different? You say. I feel the flow of water in my body. Not only that\u2026. I feel the flow outside me as well, as if I\u2019m in the middle of a tide. It\u2019s the same as the wind and earth. Luka said. Well let\u2019s see if you can top the last guy who had undine. You say. It took him a year. I hope it doesn\u2019t take me that long. Luka said. We should get out of here before alice thinks we\u2019re dead. Luka said. She\u2019d like that idea, wouldn\u2019t she? You say. You both leave the cave. Hmm, it looks like you got the power of water. Alice said. Alice\u2026. You had a lot of free time. Luka said. All around are crude in the dirt. Kind of creepy looking\u2026. You say. Is this drawing here suppose to be me!?Luka said. \u201cThe idiotic fake hero\u2026.\u201d She messed up your face. And your teeth are sharp looking. You say. Don\u2019t worry about that, you idiot. More importantly, how is the power of water? She said. I can feel something like a flow of water in my body and it feels connected to the world around me. Or something like that. Luka said. Hmm, I can\u2019t explain either. It must be something like that. She said. You don\u2019t know either. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n By the way, you both met Erubetie, didn\u2019t you? She said. Yeah. She hates humans. Luka said. With a passion. You say. Low grade slime can only live in region with pure water. As the humans living area expanded, the slime\u2019s areas shrunk. Even in this region, where nature still rules, this spring is all that\u2019s habitual. She said. So do all slimes hate humans? You say. I wouldn\u2019t say all of them\u2026.. Just the ones who share Erubetie\u2019s view. She said. Is she that strong? I know she\u2019s a heavenly knight, but\u2026. Luka said. Erubetie herself is an incredibly powerful slime that is capable of living anywhere. But not all slimes are on that level. To low level slime, the destruction of habitable places by humans is a serious issue. She said. So their backs are against the wall, then. You say. Erubetie followed my, and the previous monster lord\u2019s policy of non-aggression towards humans. At first, she was a very calm and gentle monster. But now\u2026. Well, you both saw. She said. Yeah. Whoever goes in there gets flayed alive. Whatever gentle and calm nature she had before, is completely gone by now. You say. What solution can you give to Erubetie as she is now? Alice said. Err\u2026. Luka said. We\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get there. Luka. If you want to do that, you need to convince Erubetie that not all humans are bad. You can\u2019t only think about getting stronger\u2026. You say. I know that. I know what the problems are, I just haven\u2019t thought of a way to deal with it. I\u2019ll find my answer to it my own way. But with all that said, my first purpose is to stop the four heavenly knights. And now, I have the power of water. Luka said. So all that\u2019s left is salamander then. You say. The gold region. It has a famous volcano and very mountainous. And at the northernmost tip of the continent is gold port. That\u2019s where ships that traveled to Hellgondo continent, where the monster lord\u2019s castle is. They stopped sailing after the slaughter of Remina. Luka said. So where to in gold port do we start? You say. Grangold castle. We\u2019ll collect information there and try to find where salamander is. Luka said. Hehehe\u2026\u2026I wonder want kind of feast are waiting me there? Alice said. The gold region is kind of a wasteland, so I doubt they have too many delicacies. Luka said. N\u2026. No! Alice said. Hah hah! No food for you! You say. With alice's face in horrified shock, you three continue onto the north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing we have to cross is the grand forest of Noah. Once we're through here, we'll be in the gold region. As luka and alice talk about the selection of the monster lord, you remain quiet. (How do you think the guys are doing?) He said.(Uh\u2026.. I think luke is making them do something impossible, chjinda\u2019s probably peeping again, and narue\u2019s probably worried sick about me.) You said. (What\u2019s stopping luke from killing them?) he said.(I don\u2019t know. Probably because he sees use for them.) You say. (I don\u2019t know how luke put up with tom and his craziness.) He said. (You weren\u2019t there when I went to the palace. It went bad. Very bad.) You say. (How bad?) he said.(Bader than when tom made fun of luke.) You say. Are we there yet? You say.  Almost. Luka said. Right as you three exit the forest, the sun starts to set. We should find a place to camp. Luka said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter diner, luka and alice start the usual training. You watch from a tree. Alright. Hurry up nd get into a meditation pose. Alice said. You better know what you\u2019re doing\u2026. Luka said. Luka takes a mediation poses. Empty my heart to nothing\u2026.. Don\u2019t think of anything? Luka said. Not quite\u2026 But close enough. Empty your heart and entrust yourself to the flow around you. Alice said. Luka closes his eyes. After a few seconds, alice slaps him. Ah! What the hell!? What\u2019d you hit me for!? Luka said. Why did you let that happen!? Alice said. I should be the angry one! You hit me! Luka said. (it\u2019s like watching a sitcom.) He said. Quit sulking, you idiot. You should have been able to dodge that if you had given your heart over to the flow. She said. You sure you just didn\u2019t want to hit him for fun? He\u2019s sitting there. Not moving. And you\u2019re there\u2026. You say. If you don\u2019t believe in Heinrich\u2019s teaching, all the other heroes are going to laugh at you. Alice said. Guh\u2026. Fine, I get it! All I have to make my heart one with the flow, right? Luka said. Good, that\u2019s way. I\u2019m going to hit you at some point, so you better dodge. Alice said. I\u2019m not liking this style of training\u2026. Luka said. Luka takes a meditation pose again and closes his eyes. After a few seconds, alice slaps luka again. Ugh\u2026.Ow! Luka said. What are you doing!? Dodge it! Alice said. No, I could feel something! But I wasn\u2019t able to react to it\u2026 Luka said. I think I\u2019m getting it! One more time! Luka said. You\u2019re motivated now? Alright, I\u2019ll slap you again without holding back! Alice said. Luka takes his meditation possess again. After a few seconds, alice slaps luka, but he dodged it, but he couldn\u2019t keep up the concentration and gets hit repeatedly. Argh\u2026. Luka said. \u2026.. I think it\u2019s time to stop. Alice said. No\u2026. A little more\u2026. Luka said. I agree with alice. Which is rare. You look bad. You say. Your concentration is already at its limit. If you keep going as you are, you won\u2019t accomplish anything. Let\u2019s end it here for now. Alice said. J\u2026. Just a little more\u2026 Luka said. If you can\u2019t put everything you have into your concentration, you won\u2019t be able to progress. But if you\u2019re so insistent\u2026. I\u2019ll teach you a new sword skill instead. Alice said. A\u2026. A new skill! Luka said. After all of your fights, you\u2019ve gotten surprisingly skilled using sylph. As you are now, you should be able to apply the power of wind to your sword. Alice said. To my sword skill\u2026. Luka said. Listen, this skill\u2026. While keeping the movement increase. Alice said. Alice trains luka to use his new sword skill. Like this? Ha\u2026! Luka said. Moving like the wind, Luka thrust forward so fast, even you were barely able to keep up with his movement. \u2026.Hmph. Well done. Basically, you use a thunder thrust while infused with the power of the wind. This is more powerful than your previous skill. Alice said. So I use it the same way as before. Just 2x\u2019s as powerful. Luka said. Yes. If you use it right away, the damage is also increased. Alice said. Hey, luka. Keep learning skills like that from alice, and I\u2019ll have to take you more seriously. You say. Well, it would be nice for someone not to think of me as an idiot and as a serious threat for once. Luka said. \u2026..hmph. Alice said. Hey alice, you might have a contender for you later on. You say. Please, don\u2019t insult me. I\u2019d still mop the floor with him. Alice said. H\u2026. Hey! Right here! I can hear you! Luka said.</span></div></div>",

This place is suppose to be advanced in technology. Luka said. Hm, I wonder what they eat here\u2026. I can\u2019t wait! Alice said. Really? Is food on your mind 24/7? You say. Yes. It\u2019s always is with alice. Luka said. As you both approach the castle, a huge monster blocks the path. Whoa! That\u2019s a huge one! You say. Warning. No authority to pass. Return. She said. What\u2019s a huge monster like this doing here!? Luka said. Hmm, I don\u2019t recognize this one. Alice said. A monster even the doesn\u2019t know\u2026.? It can\u2019t be\u2026. Like the one from the forest of spirits? Luka said. No, her nature feels entirely different. This one has the smell of magic about her. Alice said. Magic\u2026.? You mean she\u2019s artificially made? Luka said. Intruders remain. Begin removal.  She said. Dig your feet in! Here she comes! You say. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. You build up power. Selecting attack method\u2026. She said. (She\u2019s not going to attack\u2026..Perfect.) You thought. Luka attacks. You keep building up power. Crush enemy. She said.  The golem girl\u2019s gigantic foot slams into luka. Luka attacks. You keep building up power. Attack method b selected. Her gigantic fist slams down on luka. (Done.) You thought. Luka, stand clear! You say. You form a bright ball of energy in your right hand, and throw it at the golem girl. It hits. Cracks slowly form in her body, and she evaporates into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was easy. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoa. You were right about that when you told me. Luka said. Do you know what it does? It breaks down the enemy\u2019s cells. Every last one of them\u2026.. You say. Sounds painful, but\u2026.. it did work. Luka said. Sometimes\u2026.. Sealing an enemy is just too good for them. It\u2019s better if you kill them. You say. Just what was that monster\u2026..? Luka said. It was artificially created. So man made, I guess. You say. Manmade monsters? Luka said. Well, you did say this place was farther down in technology. You say. But to create manmade monsters\u2026..? What kind of technology is that? Luka said. As you both discuss it, the castle gate opens as soldiers flood out. That doesn\u2019t look like the welcoming party. You say. You think they are mad we killed a golem girl? Luka said. One way to find out. You say. The soldiers point their spearheads at you both. Yep. They\u2019re mad. You say. Damn you, you monsters! How dare you do that to golem girl!? A soldier said. Don\u2019t get close! These kids have some crazy strength! Another soldier said. I don\u2019t like people who point weapons at me. You say. Whoa. Hang on. Luka said. You knock out all the soldiers. Ahhhhh! What\u2019d you do that for!? Luka said. Relax. There\u2019re not dead. Just unconscious. You say. Is violence always the answer for you? Alice said. I try diplomacy, but it\u2019s hard to do that when soldiers come running and treating you like an enemy. You say. More soldiers come out until you both are surrounded. More of them\u2026.. Do they not see the others? You say. Let me talk to them first. We\u2019re not monster! We\u2019re humans! Luka said. Stop your lies! There\u2019s no human that can defeat a golem girl! A soldier said. What to see? You say. You take his weapon by the spear and toss him on the ground. Any other doubters? You say. Arrest them! Another soldier said. Well, we tried it nice\u2026.. You say. After a few minutes, you\u2019re standing in a field of unconscious soldiers. I wasn\u2019t even breaking a sweat. And you call yourselves soldiers\u2026.. You say. This is not good! This is not good! Luka said. Let\u2019s go see what\u2019s inside this castle. Maybe some actual fighters. You say. You go inside. I like his way of thinking. Alice said. Ugh\u2026. Why do I feel like I\u2019m traveling with two monsters\u2026.? Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow! This place is high style and ritzy. Luka said. This place is for people who could afford it. From my view. You say. Walking through the town, you see monsters freely walking in the streets. Just like Grand Noah\u2026. But only a few types. Ant and earth monsters. Luka said. You\u2019ve seen it too, right? How they\u2019re only ant monsters working? You say. Yeah. Where\u2019s the human workers? Luka said. I don\u2019t know. I see them all around. And now I\u2019m curious and a little concerned you say. You think the king or queen knows anything about it? Luka said. Maybe you should go ask them. I\u2019ll stay here. And look around. You say. You sure? He said. Yeah. I\u2019ll be fine. And I won\u2019t start trouble. You say. That\u2019s all I need to know. Luka said. Luka heads for the castle. Alright.  Time to look around. You say. You look around the town. (these ant girls are all working and shit. And no humans are working either.) He said. (I know. This isn\u2019t coexistence. It\u2019s slavery.) You say. (Just how are they controlling these ant girls? Don\u2019t they only take orders from their queen?) he said.( I plan on finding out.) You say. You gather information from a few townspeople, but it\u2019s not useful. You meet luka and alice back at the inn. Find anything? Luka said. No. The townspeople don\u2019t know anything. How\u2019d your visit to the king go? You say. Well, He\u2019s a carefree slacker king. He and the others in the castle leaves all the work to the ant girls. Luka said. So he does know about this. This isn\u2019t right. I don\u2019t like being here. You say. It bugs me too\u2026. Alice said. So what\u2019d you find out? You say. Something about lady\u2019s village, a volcano, and succubus village. Luka said. Your eyes shoot open. Succubus village!? You say. Yeah. There\u2019s something going on there. He said. So you\u2019re bright idea is to walk into a village full of succubi!? You say. It\u2019s not as the name applies. It\u2019s a human village, but every 100 years, succubi attack the village and we got get there. Luka said. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Pervert. Alice said. It\u2019s not like that! We\u2019re going to defend it! Luka said. Must we? Is it a really big issue? Is it something of the utmost importance? You say. Yes. If a village is about to be attack, then it is of the utmost importance. What\u2019s your problem? You didn\u2019t have one when it was the harpy village or another one. Luka said. I don\u2019t like succubi. I just don\u2019t. And a village about to be attack by them would not be good for anyone. Especially me. You say. Why? Luka said. You don\u2019t want to be around me when I\u2019m mad. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026I\u2019m hungry. Alice said. Again? Didn\u2019t you just had some food? Luka said. That stomach is full. It\u2019s my other stomach. Alice said. You mean\u2026.? Luka said. Luka hears a the door closes. Have fun you two. You say. (That\u2019s cruel.) he said. (hey, you want to go in there?) You say. (No.) he said. There\u2019s an empty room. Let\u2019s stay here. You say. (Although\u2026.. If It was a pretty monster\u2026\u2026 )he said. (Not you too.) You say. </span></div></div>",

Something\u2019s hidden in that castle. You say. As you wonder, there\u2019s a powerful explosion that rocks the streets. What the hell!?  Hey, what are the ant girls doing!? You say. (They\u2019re attacking all the citizens.) He said. Where are they taking them? You say. (Seems like it was only a matter of time. This is what happens when you treat people like slaves.) He said. (So what now?) You say. (I say leave them. It\u2019s just what they deserve. Just like what happen to us. We should let the ant girls have their way.) He said. (As much as I would love that, I could never leave someone in danger. To the castle.) You say. You head for the castle. Why are they taking the captives to the castle? You say. You reach the castle. Inside the castle, there\u2019s a lot of men crouched and shaking with fear. Also the grandgold king\u2019s here too. Damn. They work fast. You say. Many prisoners collected. One with high quality genes will be the queen\u2019s reproductive partner. Others will be slaves. An ant girl said. So that\u2019s why they bring them here. You say. Hey! Leave this to us! Everyone else, escape! You heard. Luka\u2019s here. You say. Eh\u2026.? Escape? One said. B\u2026.But I\u2019m too scared. An old man said. \u2026..Everybody, leave this to the heroes! Now, follow me! The grangold king said. The king jumps up with a yell, flashing his mantle to attract the attention of the men. He runs out repeating his cry of follow me. After a few seconds,  all of the men quickly run after their king through the exit. Wait! Stop them! An ant girl said. One of the ant girls tries to block the escaping men, but luka pulls out his sword and dashes in front of her. Can you handle this by yourself? We need to find the queen fast. You say. I think so. I\u2019ll be right behind you. \u2026.Just leave me something to fight. Luka said. You leave the fight to luka. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and find secret stairs that lead to the basement of the castle. While traveling down the stairs, you heard a voice. (That\u2019s the voice of the queen. Think she knows?) He said. (About to find out.) You say. You keep going down the stairs. When you get to the last step, the room it lead you to was full of beeping machinery and numbers flashing on the pedestal in the middle of the room. Whoa. Sci fi in here. You say. You look around and at the machines. Alice was right. The tech here shouldn\u2019t be that far ahead. You say. (Where did they get all this equipment from?) You thought. You feel a hostile presence. You can feel it getting closer. You look around for it. After a few second pass by, you can see the person with the hostile presence. I am the queen ant of the limitless ant army. Human, who are you to stand in my path? She said. Just a passerby, but I couldn\u2019t pass this by. You must be leading this rebellion. You say \u2026.yes, that is so. During the long time I have been sealed, my thoughts got stronger\u2026. Until they finally reached the outside world. I directed my children to fight against the humans. Now that I have finally escape, there\u2019s nothing to stop my family. She said. This place is in an uproar. You have a reason to be upset. In fact, I\u2019d let you burn this place to the ground. But\u2026. Isn\u2019t there a way to work this out? You say. \u2026.No. Sealing me with their machinery, and enslaving my children\u2026. Surly you understand my anger? The sorrow that the humans forced on my children will be returned to them. She said. I understand more than you know. Be oppressed, enslave, you named it. Revenge seems like a good idea at first, but\u2026. Will it be worth it in the end? The people here were horrible\u2026. You say. Hmph. This town  already belongs to my children and i. Now the humans will be our slaves. All of the young men shall be slaves of my girls. All of the finest men shall be my own personal slaves\u2026. Like you. She said. \u2026.Do we really have to go down this road? You say. (Words won\u2019t fix this. She\u2019s in too deep in anger.) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaha\u2026. Do you intend to fight? A mere human thinks he can challenge the ant queen? She said. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re bad. You have the right to do this. You say. Then why do you stand against me? She said. Someone has to. Plus, do you know what will happen if you take over this castle? Every all over, freedom armies will come to free their own. And when that happens, it\u2019s all-out war. You say. \u2026. So I should silently swallow my anger and pretend as  if the unjust acting towards my family never happened? You dare feel pity for the assailant and lecture the victim? She said. You\u2019re in the victim shoes right now.  Me standing here does make me the bad guy, but you can\u2019t be the good guy every time\u2026.. But when today is over, you\u2019ll be the source of new founded hatred. Repeating the cycle of retaliation.  I\u2019ll stop you in your tracks. You say. Haha\u2026.. I would love to see that bold face of yours twisting in agony. Please, would you be so kind as to show it to me!? She said. I\u2019ll show you something. You say. You attack her. You may pour your seed on my chest. She said. Queen ant presses her breast onto your groin. You dodge and counter her with a kick. You attack her. After you do, you see an after image of luka. I got here just in time! Luka said. You got here pretty quick. You say. Oh, another human? Ant queen said. Did you at least try to talk her down? Luka said. Yeah, but it didn\u2019t work. You say. Then let\u2019s go. Luka said. You both attack together. No man can endure the mouth of a queen. She said. Queen ant\u2019s tongue shoots towards luka\u2019s penis. Her tongue runs all over luka\u2019s penis. She sucks on the tip of luka\u2019s penis. You attack. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. Now, I shall steal your heart. She said. The queen ant\u2019s eyes shine with a mysterious light. You both avoid looking. You both attack. I shall allow you to taste my breast. She said. The queen ant presses her breast onto luka\u2019s groin. Let\u2019s end this! You say. You hit her hard in the stomach. Luka jumps off your back and comes down hard on her head. Urgh\u2026 What power\u2026. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve lost ant queen. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka brings his sword to the ant queen\u2019s neck, and put the tip to her chin. \u2026..Just stop this already. Don\u2019t make me seal you. Luka said. \u2026..I don\u2019t plan on begging for my life, neither stop my revenge. I won\u2019t stop until I rule over this town and enslave all the humans. She said. As luka\u2019s about to swing, you grab his arm. Wait! Alice said. Alice bursts into the room, along with her is the king, who she\u2019s carrying by the neck. Luka, when you\u2019re done here, meet me outside the castle. I\u2019m done here. You say. You head out and wait outside the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The grangold king reminds me of someone from final fantasy.) he said.(Bartz?) You say. (Yep.) he said. You wait for 30 minutes until luka and alice show up. So did the ant queen forgive the king? You say. Yeah. Everything worked. The queen ant and the grangold king are working together to rebuild the town. Luka said. Well, that\u2019s good. Where to now? You say. Alright, let\u2019s go to succubus village. Luka said. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Damn pervert. Alice said.  That\u2019s not it! I can\u2019t just leave a village about to be attacked alone! Luka said. You glare angrily at luka. You three head to succubus village, to your dismay and with alice\u2019s distrustful gaze for the whole trip.</span></div></div>",

You clench you\u2019re fist tight enough to where blood leaks through your fingers. Uh\u2026. Are you ok? Luka said. Yeah. Peachy. You say.  Uh\u2026.. Ok, how about I do the talking around here?

Hey, what\u2019s with this kid? This bar ain\u2019t a playground!  One guy said.The beer is tasting like crap because of you. Get out! A soldier said. Boy, get out of this village quickly.

Every 100 years, succubi attack this village in a large. It\u2019s called the purple Sabbath. And it\u2019s going to happen tonight. She said. Yes. We came to this village to defend it against that. Luka said. Hehe\u2026 That will be a big help. We can always use more strong men\u2026 She said. Ye\u2026. Yes\u2026. Thank you. Luka said. I\u2019ll be looking forward to it, mr. cute hero. She said. Le\u2026. Leave it to us\u2026 Luka said. You grab luka by the neck and leave. You\u2019re hopeless with women. You say. The soothsayer said the same thing. Kind of. Luka said. I\u2019ll be at the bar. I\u2019ll visit you at the inn later. You say. You head for the bar and drink 3 glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh. Of all the places. To be. Here. You say. Sounds like somebody\u2019s in a bad mood today. A voice said. You know that voice. I don\u2019t like it here. The minute luka said we were coming here, I really wanted to rip his throat out. You say. Still going to use that thing I gave you? He said. I\u2019m tempted not to. Just for making me come here. Maybe getting ripped apart by the monster lord is what he needs. You say. That\u2019s cold. Even for traveling buddies. So. What are you going to do now that you\u2019re here? He said. Personally, get the hell out of here. I don\u2019t want anything to do with a succubus. You say. What happened that made you hate succubi? He said. I don\u2019t hate them in particular. I just don\u2019t like how they fight. Got raped? He said. No, but I can always smell them I never forgot the smell of one. I can smell it now. I want to get out of here. You say. Could it be\u2026\u2026 That you\u2019re\u2026.. Afraid? Or that succubi are your limits? He said. No! I\u2019m not afraid! You say Fear is normal in humans. We all go around fearing something.  Maybe for you, it\u2019s succubi. He said. To hell with fear. I\u2019m not scared of anything. And I know my limits. I\u2026.. just want to get out of this town\u2026\u2026 But\u2026\u2026. If I leave luka and something bad happens to him, I\u2019ll never forgive myself. You say. It\u2019s all about choices in life. You pick one and deal with the repercussions later. Luka made his choice of coming here. Now you make yours. Will you leave him here for your own peace of mind? Or will you deal with your problems and stand beside as he deals with succubi tonight. The choice is yours. He said. You chug the whole glass of beer down. I know what I have to do. You say. When you turn your head around, he\u2019s gone. Whoever that person is, needs to show himself soon. You say. You get up and head for the inn. You find the room luka and alice are in. Look, I know you don\u2019t want to be here when the succubi come. So if you just want to stay in here\u2026.. Luka said. No. I know what to do. I just\u2026.. lost faith in myself. But\u2026.. I picked myself up. So when the purple Sabbath starts, I\u2019ll be there for you. You say. That\u2019s nice to know. Thanks. Luka said. So we just wait here until night? You say. Don\u2019t have a choice. Luka said. As usual. I don\u2019t care about this. \u2026..I\u2019ll give you a word of advice. It seems you think the succubi will attack from the outside. But the most troublesome part of the purple sabbath is the succubization of humans. Alice said. Succcubization\u2026? You mean women will turn into succubi? Luka said. \u2026..That\u2019s right. When the purple moon is full, women who hold potential will turn into succubi one after another. Alice said. Great. Just great. You say. So they aren\u2019t going to attack from outside? Luka said. Eveyone seems to imagine, an army of them descending on the city or something. But\u2026. To welcome their new companions, there\u2019re some senior succubi that  conceal themselves in the village beforehand. Following their guidance, the newborns go wild. That\u2019s the real purpose of the purple Sabbath. Alice said. Senior succubi hid in the village beforehand\u2026? But I didn\u2019t see anything when I was walking around\u2026 Luka said. You never cease to amaze me\u2026 Alice said. Oh\u2026. Thank you\u2026 Luka said. I don\u2019t think that was a compliment. You say. Anyway, I warned you. Until everything is selttled, I\u2019ll hide myself. Alice said. Saying that, alice vanishes. So just wait till night? You say. I guess so. Can\u2019t do anything else. Luka said. You both wait till night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka. Luka! Wake up! You say. Huh? What? Crap! It\u2019s midnight already!? Luka said. He jumps out of the bed in a panic. The atmosphere is strange around here. The air is heavy and unpleasant. Luka said. You sniff the air. They\u2019re here. In the village. You say. Crap! Come on! Luka said. You and luka leave the inn and rush into the street. Nothing is out of the ordinary, but a sweet fragrance is in the air. Luka said. I know that smell too well. You say. Where\u2019s the villagers? Luka said. You both take it slow as you walk through the streets. *Sniff * *sniff* That way. From the bar. You say. What\u2019s going on in there? Luka said. You both run into the bar. You burst down the door. Damn. Luka said. There\u2019s bodies all over, half naked and exhausted. You say. Look. There\u2019s one. Luka said. (Damn. She\u2019s raping the hell out of him.) He said. Already finish? That\u2019s not fair having an orgasm before I do. She said. The prostitute slowly stands up. Looking around, her gaze lands on you both. Oh\u2026. It\u2019s the hero from before. And his friend. I think I\u2019ll devour you next. I\u2019ll let you both join the other food collected on the ground here.  She said. She turned into one? Luka said. She\u2019s\u2026. covered in semen. This is disgusting. I don\u2019t want to touch her. You say. They gave me so much of their semen. There\u2019s so much in my pussy, I can\u2019t eat it fast enough!  I forced them all in here, and made them fill me up. She said. S\u2026.stay back! Luka said. You\u2019re eyes turn optical. I\u2019ll squeeze out your semen too. I\u2019ll absorb everything from you until you\u2019re left dry. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka attacks. You hit here hard. I\u2019ll make you cover my breast with your semen as well. She squeezes luka\u2019s penis between her semen covered breast. Here I go! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. You kick her. My customers all loved it when I gave them this service! She said. She grabs hold of luka\u2019s penis with her semen covered hands. Her extremely skilled hands strokes luka\u2019s penis. You both attack together. Haha, my handjob technique is amazing! She said. She tries to grab a hold of you, but you sidestep her and punch her hard in the face. Luka! You say. You hit her hard in the stomach. While kneeled over, luka jumps off the wall and comes down hard on her skull. The power that I just abtained\u2026. No! She said. Her tail and wings vanish as the girl hits the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne less succubus. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to normal. She\u2019s unconscious, but alive. You say. And these guys? Luka said. They\u2019re still alive. But worn out like a tire. What do we do? You say. They\u2019re already exhausted. They should be fine. This strange feeling in the wind. Another one. Luka said. I smell another one. We should split up and deal with them. You say. You sure? Luka said. Yeah. You say. You both leave the bar. You head left and luka goes right. Where are you? You say. You follow the smell. You can\u2019t be serious. You say. You disappear and reappear behind the succubus and knock her out. Trying to sneak up on me. Rookie. You say. You see luka. This whole village is infested with succubi. There\u2019s too many for just the both of us. Luka said. So alice was right. High level succubi did sneak in. If we find them, take them out, this will all end. You say. But we don\u2019t know where they are. Luka said. Luka, use your head a bit more. You say. What? He said. The chief. She\u2019s the succubus. Along with the soothsayer. You say. The chief and the soothsayer are  succubi? Luka said. Yes. I can smell them, plus succubi all have the same eye color. Well, not all of them do. You say. You\u2019re positive it the chief and soothsayer? Luka said. I was listening to your conversation with the soothsayer about the purple Sabbath. She knew too much about it. And the chief, the way she eyed us was a dead giveaway. You say. Now that you say it, the soothsayer did know a lot more than anyone else in the village about the purple sabbath. Luka said. Exactly. They should both be at the chief\u2019s house. You say. Let\u2019s go! Luka said. </span></div></div>",

Where are you!? Get out here! Luka shouted. Hehe, you made it all the way here, did you? I knew you both where different from those other soldiers. The chief said. Drop the act. We know already. So why don\u2019t you just show us who you really are? You say. Hehe, so you noticed. You not like the others. She said. The chief and the soothsayer turn into succubus. Told you. The soothsayer knew too much about the purple Sabbath. You say. Hehe\u2026 We\u2019re not humans who have been turned into succubi. We were both born succubi. The soothsayer said. Our family has passed down the chief position from generation to generation. Every 100 years, we spread our seductive power into the village to turn the village into succubi. That\u2019s the purple Sabbath. The chiefs said. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening! Luka said. From the get-go, it was all the chief. That\u2019s why no succubi come from the outside. You say. Witch\u2026. Go ahead with the ceremony preparation. I\u2019ll deal with these two. The chief said. Got it, I\u2019ll leave this to you. We\u2019ll need these two boy\u2019s semen for the ceremony\u2026. So don\u2019t squeeze them completely dry. The witch said. Hehe\u2026. I know. I\u2019ll just get a taste of them. The chief said. Then, i shall see you soon. The witch said.  The witch leaves through a door on the other side. What are you planning? I\u2019m not 100% how this works, but I know something different about this purple sabbath. You say. Hehe\u2026 This year\u2019s purple Sabbath is not just to make more allies\u2026 It\u2019s a ceremony to bring back the legendary succubus Lilith, sealed 500 years ago. The chief said. Legendary succubus Lilith!? Luka said. We succubi have no permanent home\u2026 But Lilith can lead us to the promise land! It\u2019s the wish of all succubi to bring Lilith back. When she comes back, we can make all humans intolivestock for semen cultivation. She said. Cultivation? Like crops? Which you harvest!? You say. We won\u2019t let that happen! Luka said. Your eyes turn optical. But you know\u2026. You both look really delicious. She said. She seductively licks her lips. She told me not to\u2026.. But I\u2019m going to squeeze you dry. Two boy\u2019s amount won\u2019t change the revival of Lilith. She said. Guh\u2026.! Luka said. Sweet pheromones fill the air round her. A smell you thought you long forgot. (High ranking succubus.) You thought. Hehe\u2026. I\u2019m going to rape you now. But which one will I make come until not a single drop is left? She said. You won\u2019t get the chance. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and luka attack together. Here\u2026 My hands will feel amazing. She said. The succubus grabs luka\u2019s penis, and skillfully uses all ten fingers to cares him. Her skilled fingers run over every inch of his penis. Here I go! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. You attack her. Just lay back and let my mouth bring you to heaven. She said. She grabs luka\u2019s penis and violently suck it. You attack her. Luka attacks her. Hehe\u2026 I made you wait, didn\u2019t i. It\u2019s time to rape you. I\u2019ll squeeze out your semen until you\u2019re left dry\u2026 She said. The succubus throws luka down to the ground, and gets on top of him. Get raped by a succubus is a dream, isn\u2019t it. Now let me show you heaven. She said.  With the power of earth, luka pushes her off him. Ara\u2026 too bad. Being raped by me is the highest pleasure, you know\u2026.? She said. You take luka\u2019s sword and disappear. You reappear behind her and deliver a power back slash. You hand luka his sword back. Moving like a powerful gale, luka thrusts his sword forward as fast as lightning. Melt in my kiss\u2026 She said. She leans toward you, but you punch her back. Time to end this. You say. You hit her hard in the stomach. Luka runs up the wall and comes down hard on her head. How could I be beaten by a human\u2026!? She said. The succubus turns into a bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright. Now to stop the ceremony. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhew\u2026. She was strong. Luka said. I expected nothing less. You say. No time to celebrate. We have to stop that ritual! Luka said. Luka kicks the door, but it doesn\u2019t budge. Like this. You say. You kick the door down. Put your back into it next time. You say. You both rush into the room. Oh\u2026.? How are you here? The witch said. Give up, we already defeated the village chief! I won\u2019t let you revive Lilith! Luka said. Hehe\u2026 But she\u2019s already almost revived. Thanks to the chief, plenty of soldiers came to this village to \u201chelp\u201d us. She said. Cry wolf and people will show up. You say. So it was all a fake cry for help. Attract soldiers with a problem and they come to protect the village. Luka said. All we need is energy from five more men\u2026 it will be rough on you, but I\u2019ll try to get it all from both of you. She said. We refuse! I\u2019ll stop you before she\u2019s revived! Luka said. Luka takes out his sword. Could it be\u2026. You think I\u2019m weak? In prowess of magical power\u2026. I\u2019m far above the village chief! She said. We\u2019ll see about that. You say. Poerful magic fills the room, stemming  from the witch. It\u2019s so thick with her power, even her gloves and hat is floating around her\u2026 (Is that\u2026..a giant tongue coming out of her hat? Is it alive?) Luka thought. I\u2019ll squeeze out all your energy and give it to lilith\u2019s revival. It will feel really good, so work hard to revive her! She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you look at her, heather\u2019s face flashes before your eyes. (Ugh! Not again. Not now\u2026.) You thought. Then it disappears. (What the\u2026. Never mind. I need to focus.) You say. Your eyes turn optical. Luka attacks. You attack her. This hat is full of power\u2026. She said. The hat flies onto luka\u2019s groin. Tiny feelers stimulate luka\u2019s penis. You both attack together. Now, become mine! She said. The succubus witch\u2019s eyes shine with a mysterious light. A gust of wind blocks luka\u2019s view. You negate it with the optical eyes. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. Just as you\u2019re about to attack, heather\u2019s face appears again. (No! Get out of my head!) You thought. You attack her. You want me to rape you now, don\u2019t you? I\u2019ll squeeze it all out, just lay back and give it to me! She said. The witch forces you to the ground, and jumps on top of you. Now, just behave yourself. I\u2019ll make this feel really good\u2026She said. You\u2019re about to push her off you, when you see heather again. You never did have his strength. You just as cute as him though. Right up until he died. She said. Bitch! You say. You push her off you. What is this power!? A power even I don\u2019t recognize\u2026? She said. Heather walks around you. You know you couldn\u2019t beat me. I\u2019ve proven it time and time again. I could have easily taken your life without even trying. I only spared you to have more fun. She said. I killed you\u2026. You say. When she touches your face, you feel all your power disappears and your eyes return to normal. Poor boy. You thought you did. She said. She strokes your cheek. Just like your father. Cute, but blind to what\u2019s really going on. If only he saw things my way. You\u2019d be my child. And we\u2019d rule over everything. She said. Then she disappears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink a couple of times. Hey! Hey! Luka shouted. Luka? You say. What the hell happened!? I had to fight her alone! Luka said. I..... blacked out. Is she sealed? You say. No. She did something before I could. She used some kind of spell\u2026 Transfer her power to Lilith\u2026. It can\u2019t be!? Luka said. A heavy atmosphere fills the room. She must have given all her energy! Luka said. Hehe. Tehehehe. You both heard. The laughter of two women is heard throughout the room. Two women? You say. Then a magic square takes form on the base of the floor. It\u2019s\u2026.growing. You say. Then you both see who\u2019s behind the laughter. Two women in a seductive embrace. Is\u2026 This her? Why are there two? You say. I don\u2019t know? Luka said. Hehehehe\u2026 It\u2019s been 500 years since we last set foot on this world, hasn\u2019t it sister? one said. That\u2019s right, lilm\u2026. This world is filled with energetic young men\u2026. It\u2019s unbearable! The other said. Luka\u2026..? You say. I\u2019m as lost as you. Luka said. Hehe\u2026.. Two delicious smelling boys are here, sister. Lilith said. They look absolutely delectable, sister. I want to play with them, and absorb their energy badly\u2026. Lilm said. Guh\u2026.! If it\u2019s going this way, then we\u2019ll seal you again! Luka said. Luka points his sword to them. As soon as he did, their eyes widen in surprise. Sister\u2026. That sword the boy is holding\u2026. Could it be\u2026? Lilm said. Angel halo\u2026 there\u2019s no mistake\u2026 A wielder of that accused sword is standing in our way again. Lilith said. Now that you mention it, that boy does look familiar\u2026. Just like that man that sealed us 500 years ago\u2026 Lilm said. (500 years ago? Previous owner of this sword?) Luka said. Sister, looking at this boy is making me remember the anger and pain of the last 500 years\u2026. Lilm said. Yes\u2026 let\u2019s show this boy the grudge we\u2019ve held for the last half millennium. Lilith said. We\u2019ll use or magic to force you to come over and over again\u2026 Lilm said. We\u2019ll violate you until you lose your sanity\u2026. Your mind will be drowned under the pleasure only a succubus can give. Lilith said. We\u2019ll squeeze you dry, and show you heaven\u2026. Lilm said. Writhing in pleasure filled agony, you\u2019ll die with a smile on your face\u2026. Lilith said. They don\u2019t like you very much luka. You say. I get that feeling. Here they come! Luka said. The sister approach you both with a seductive smile on their faces.</span></div></div>",

Lilim said. Lilith and lilim press their breast together, with luka\u2019s penis between them. The two sisters rub their breast together, massaging luka\u2019s penis. You attack. Then luka attacks. Lilim, let\u2019s tickle his penis. Lilith said. Hehe, his face will glaze over in pleasure. Lilim said. One of lilith\u2019s small fingers gently tickles the tip of luka\u2019s penis. Lilim gently runs a finger up and down the back of luka\u2019s penis. Here I go! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. You attack. Lilim, he\u2019s quiet cute, isn\u2019t he? Lilith said. He is, sister. Lilim said. (I think they are ignoring us.) He said. (They\u2019re focused on luka out of some grudge. I doubt they even remember me.) You say. (I hate being ignored.) he said. Make sure you rub in rhythm with me. Lilith said. I\u2019ll be sure to match you, sister. Lilim said.

Lilim said. Hehe\u2026 it looks like you enjoyed the feeling of having your power taken from you\u2026 Lilith said. (I\u2019m not done yet!) Luka thought. Luka attacks. Let\u2019s show him a little bit of our power, sister. Lilith said. Powered up with the energy we took from him, too! Lilim said. Thousands of tentacles come out of the magic square and surround luka. Not happening! You say. You push luka out of the way. The tentacles massage every inch of your body. Guh\u2026! You say. Taking the brunt of that for him\u2026.. You must be the best of friends. Lilith said. Why didn\u2019t you let me take that!? Luka said. For starters, if that hit you, you\u2019d be on your last leg. And second, you still don\u2019t know how strong I am. You say. You stand up like nothing is wrong. To take that\u2026.. And still be standing. You must have incredible strength. Lilim said. I\u2019m not so normal person. In fact, I\u2019m far from it\u2026\u2026  Let\u2019s end this. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Luka, remember what happen to your sword when I fought granberia? You say. Uh\u2026. Yeah. It was on fire. Black fire. Luka said. If I do that to your sword. You won\u2019t get frighten? You say. Maybe not 100% frighten. Luka said. Good enough for me. You say. You concentrate and luka\u2019s sword catches fire. Luka stares in amazement. Whoa. This is\u2026.. Luka said. Amazed later. Attack now! You say. R\u2026. Right. Luka attacks with all his might with his sword, dealing a devastating blow. D\u2026. Defeated again? Lilith said. Not again\u2026. Lilim said. The two girls vanish, their energy disappearing back into the magic square they came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat power\u2026.. was incredible. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes return to normal and the fire on luka\u2019s sword goes away. We\u2026. Did it. Luka said. Yeah\u2026.. Ugh. You say. You fall on one knee. You ok? Luka said. Yeah. It just takes a lot of concentration to put the fire on your sword. It took so much, it gave me a headache. I\u2019ll be fine in a couple of hours. You feel it in the wind, right? The atmosphere and the heavy air over the village is gone. You say.  Yeah. It looked like defeating the high ranking succubi and Lilith and lilim did the trick. Luka said. Just one thing. The men here\u2026\u2026 the ones that were sucked dry\u2026.. You say. Crap! They looked weak and close to death. We got to help them or they\u2019ll die. Luka said. You and luka rush out of the chief\u2019s house.  What do we do? You say. Maybe we should gather them all in one place. Then\u2026. Then what? How do you heal someone who has been drained by a succubus? Luka said. Usually a couple of days of rest. If you\u2019re strong enough to withstand them. But these guys weren\u2019t. We need a plan. And fast. You say. What are you doing, you idiot? Do you honestly think you can rescue a hundred people by yourself? Alice said. Do you plan on lending a hand or be a bitch? You say. Alice\u2026. Help us out! This doesn\u2019t invole fighting monsters, so you can help out. Help us carry them. Luka said. \u2026..That sounds like it\u2019s too much effort. But perhaps  I should heal those near death. Alice said. \u201cPerhaps\u201d? You say. Y\u2026. You can do that? Luka said. You idiot. I\u2019m the monster lord. Doesn\u2019t mean anything if you can\u2019t back it up. You interrupt. \u2026\u2026Sharing some vitality with weakling like this shouldn\u2019t take much effort. Alice said. I\u2019ll share some of my own energy with you weaklings\u2026. The radient light that has faded. Shine again! Haa! She said. A bright light fills the village, almost blinding in its glow the warm light fills the village for a few moments before fading. Hmph. Maybe she\u2019s good for something. You say. You can feel the life in the village being restored. Along with something else. Not good. You say. What\u2026. Oh no! Why\u2019d you unsealed all the succubi, too!? Luk said. \u2026..Oops. Alice said. Now everything we did was for nothing! Do we have to fight them all over!? Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..That won\u2019t be necessary. Our dreams have already been denied. The succubus said. The legendary succubus Lilith was defeated by a human again. It appears as if there is no promised land for us after all\u2026 The witch said. It\u2019s as you see, my friends of this new era. We were unable to defeat this hero\u2026 We are far too weak to be a savior. Lilith said. Sister\u2026 Even in this new era, must we walk the lands again with no place to call home? Lilim said. (What should I do? They don\u2019t want to fight anymore.) Luka thought. (Why do I feel like we just walked all over someone\u2019s dream?) You thought. (We can\u2019t just start fighting again with this depressed mood. Everyone\u2019s all sad.) He said. \u2026..Are succubi really that driven into a corner? They can\u2019t settle anywhere, and forced to wander from place to place? Luka said. Succubi cannot exist without humans. Yet human villages do not accept us, and won\u2019t let us live with them. Tons of men agree to let us live with them\u2026 \u2026..but the problem is the women. Most human female are completely hostile towards us. They will never let succubi to live in the same town they do. The succubus said. I can sort of see why\u2026 Luka said. I see it perfectly. You say. That\u2019s why we have no choice but to hide our true selves and live hidden in towns. If we don\u2019t, we would be forced to endlessly be on the move, never able to settle down. But us succubi wish for a place to live, a place to call home\u2026 A paradise where we can live, without starvation\u2026 A wonderful succubus village, where we can harvest men like livestock\u2026 the witch say. When you say men and livestock in same sentence as that, it sounds wrong. You say. From generation to generation, we\u2019ve been planning to make our dream come true. Hundreds of years until the day where we could take over this village.  We aren\u2019t dreaming too big\u2026 All we desire is a small, nice little village. With men as live stock. Is that too much to ask\u2026? The witch said. Oh man. I\u2019m going to hate myself in the morning. You said generation to generation of succubi have been chief here or something like that? You say. Yes. The succubus said. And no women live in this village. And there are a good size of men in this village.  So from where I stand, you already have this village you wanted. You say. He\u2019s\u2026. Right. There\u2019s no human females in this village that doesn\u2019t want us in this village. The witch said. Oh boy. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you and luka get ready to head out. But not before the men and succubi come to see you off. I heard that you two are on a journey for coexistence between humans and monsters. Is that why you came to this village to help build this utopia for us? The succubus said. Err\u2026. Well\u2026 Luka said. Thank you for helping us create a place where we can live! The witch said. Even though we were in control of this village for so long, we still couldn\u2019t freely ask for human cooperation. Lilith said. Look sister, immigrants from all over are here to give us their energy. Lilim said. Well\u2026.. that\u2019s great. Can we get the hell out of here? You say. If you\u2019re ever nearby, please stop in to visit. We\u2019ll always be happy to give you a warm welcome\u2026. The succubus said. Of course, you both are welcome to live her, too\u2026 I\u2019d be happy to give you a taste of heaven every day\u2026. The witch said. Let\u2019s go! We\u2019re leaving! Right now! You say. You both quickly leave the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s never go there again. Where to now? You say. Let\u2019s go to lady\u2019s village. That story is really bugging me. Luka said. I said not to go near that village\u2026\u2026 but when do you listen to my warnings? Alice said. If you\u2019re saying that, then something has to be going on there. Luka said.Stop trying to sound smart. Anyway, I won\u2019t get involved in this. I don\u2019t have a reason to stick my neck out on this. Alice said. I can\u2019t leave something dangerous there after finding out about it\u2026 Luka said. (it\u2019s like a soap opera.) He said. Sheesh\u2026. Off to see if you can cheat death again. That death wish is going to come true one day, you know. Alice said. I don\u2019t have a death wish. Luka said. Luka, if alice said don\u2019t go, then maybe, for once, we should listen to her. You say What!? You\u2019re agreeing\u2026.. With alice!? Luka said. Yes it\u2019s crazy. I know, but alice is the monster lord and if she says not to go there, then maybe something is there that\u2019s way out of our hands. You say. But the story I heard\u2026. Luka said. Maybe it is true, then again, how do you know if the person who told you it was lying? For all we know, the males could live there. I know you want to fix this, but there are times when you have to admit that you can\u2019t solve everything. I say we don\u2019t go. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does luka chose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thanks for the concern, but my mind\u2019s made up about it. And if alice told me not to, then something must be going on there. Luka said. Well, just in case you\u2019re in too deep, I\u2019ll come with you. You say. Then it\u2019s settled. Let\u2019s go. Luka said. (You were testing him. To see if he had the brass to go through with it.) he said. (Oh yeah. Sometimes having a death wish is a good thing.) You said. You all travel to lady\u2019s village. This is lady\u2019s village? You say. Looks like it. And look, refined ladies are all over talking to each other. Luka said. Not what I was expecting. This isn\u2019t a place where male adventures would go missing.  You say. What do you think alice? Alice? Luka said. She\u2019s gone. You said. She usually gone quickly, but not that quick. Luka said. There\u2019s just something about this village\u2026.. I can\u2019t put my finger on it just yet. You say. Should we ask around for information? Luka said. You do that. I like get it on my own first. You say. Ok\u2026. Luka said. Luka goes around asking the women what happens to the males never returning. ( A village, in the middle of this place, only with women. I like to jump to that conclusion, but not yet. I don\u2019t like over exaggerating.) You thought. You thoughts are interrupted when luka returns. Figured it out? Luka said. I have one conclusion, but I don\u2019t have enough evidence to back it up. You say. Well, a girl whose mother is the lord here, has invited me to her house. Maybe if we asked her. He said. Maybe\u2026. You say. You and luka head for the lord\u2019s house. Huge place. They really like to show off. You say. It wouldn\u2019t seem right to live low style as a lord. Luka said. As you make it to the door, you stop. You go inside. I wasn\u2019t invited. If anything happens, I\u2019ll come running. You say. Ok. I guess. Luka said. Luka enters the house. ( I really want to jump to it, but I\u2019ve jump to conclusions before and they\u2019ve been wrong. Male travelers going missing when they came here. A village fill of beautiful women.) You say. (Do what you\u2019ve done before. Go with your guts. If you didn\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t have all these powers, and I wouldn\u2019t have been formed.) He said. (Go with my guts\u2026.. Maybe jumping to conclusions this time might work.) You say. After 10 minutes of waiting, luka comes out. Did she confirmed the rumor? You say. She said it was a just a rumor. Luka said. You both head for the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see alice, but she looks odd. You must have noticed it by now\u2026. Alice said. Of course. There are no men here. Luka said. So you did notice. Not a single man in a village is strange. Alice said. This place isn\u2019t normal. Far from it. You say. \u2026..I think we should examine it more closely. Luka said. As luka goes up to one of the women, you piece it all together. (This village is\u2026..) Luka! Get away from her! You say. Huh? Luka said. Luka sees the woman\u2019s lower half turn into a monster. Whoa! Luka said. Your eyes turn optical. You disappear and reappear behind her with luka\u2019s sword in your hand. You deliver a powerful slash from behind. The woman turns into a beetle. When did you\u2026.. Never mind. Luka said. You hand him his sword. This village isn\u2019t human. It\u2019s a monster village. You say. That explains why no males and the male adventures go missing. Luka said. This village is going to be on high alert soon. We won\u2019t be able to handle a village worth. You say. Then we do what we always do. Take out the leader. Luka said. Wasn\u2019t the lord here named Cassandra? Didn\u2019t alice say not to fight her? You say. Yes, but we got to try it. If we leave, the number will get higher and higher. Luka said. Worth a shot. You say. You and luka rush towards the house. Can they really take on Cassandra at their current level? Alice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both get to the mansion and charge through the door. Hahaha, I knew it! You came back! I thought it would end up like this. A girl said. A lone girl is waiting in the parlor. (She has a carefree look, but is she a monster?) You thought. Are you\u2026. A monster too? Luka said. That\u2019s right. Come on. Let\u2019s go. Emily will see how strong you really are. She said. Have you been eating humans too? Luka said. Hahaha, of course! I\u2019ve teased and eaten plenty of men already! I wrap these tentacles of mine around them, and squeeze out their semen. And they go mad with pleasure. She said. (Ask a question, get an answer. The problem with asking questions is that you never like the answer you get.) You say. (Never did like questions.) He said. You know, Emily\u2026.. Emily is really interested in you. What does your penis feel like? How much semen will come out if Emily plays with it? What kind of moan will you make? How your semen will taste? Emily wants to find out everything! She said. (I\u2019m already annoyed of her for talking in the 3rd person.) he said.  You and luka attack together. Fill emily\u2019s mouth. She said. Emily sucks luka\u2019s penis into her mouth, and intensely sucks on him. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. You attack her. It\u2019s ok to cover my hand in semen. She said. Emily grabs luka\u2019s penis, and strokes him up and down. You and luka attack together. Emily is really skilled at handjobs, isn\u2019t she? Emily grabs luka\u2019s penis, and strokes him up and down. Luka looks at you and you both nod. You both move like a powerful gale and luka thrusts his sword and you thrust your knife as fast as lightning. E\u2026. Emily lost\u2026? She said. Emily turns into a tiny octopus<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, now for Cassandra. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh!  How could you turn Emily into this?! She said. Alright, now\u2026. There\u2019s just me left, isn\u2019t that right? A voice said interrupting luka. You see a noble woman walk into the room. The atmosphere gets tense as she steps into the room. You\u2019re the one behind everything here! Luka yells. Yes\u2026 My family has always lived in this village, disguised as humans. Every human that came to visit, we feed on. I cannot tell you how many hundreds we\u2019ve feed on. Cassandra said. T..... That\u2019s unforgivable! Luka said. 9Strght evil.) You said. (More like incarnate.) He said. But you both look quite delicious. The ones who caught alice\u2019s eye\u2026. The highest food I could savor. She said. I think she means you, luka. You say. Lucky me. He said. Liquid starts to ooze from Cassandra\u2019s body, as her dress starts to melt and change shape. Her clothes vanish, showing her true form. (So this is what she really looks like.) you thought. Mother, before that\u2026 Use your magic to turn me back. Emily will fight with mother! Emily said. The sealed Emily bounces to cassandra\u2019s feet, but her mother looks at her with cold eyes. \u2026.I\u2019ve told this to you many times before, Emily\u2026. This world runs on survival of the fittest. Those deemed  unfit will be nothing but food for the victors. She said. M.... Mother...? Emily said. Emily's sealed body starts to sink into Cassandra\u2019s body. No\u2026.! Mother! Emily. Emily\u2019s creams in hooror as she\u2019s quickly sucked inside. After only seconds, she can\u2019t be heard anymore. Bitch. You say. You\u2026.! Wasn\u2019t Emily your daughter!? Luka said. Yes\u2026 Of course she was. She was a daughter born from my body, so I just returned her back to me. Survival of the fittest\u2026. The weak should just be eaten by the strong. A daughter who can\u2019t understand how the world works is not necessary. She said. The world doesn\u2019t run on survival of the fittest. Only bullies and dictators run on that. You say. I won\u2019t forgive you! Luka said. When did I ask for your forgiveness? Why should Cassandra mereneid need anything from a human!?She said.  When we kick your ass. You say. The liquid dropping from her body is slowly disintegrating everything it touches.  It spreads to the room covering and consuming everything it comes in contact with. Hehehe\u2026.. This room is no different than my body itself now. Why not just surrender now and save yourself the pain? She said. Guh\u2026.. Wh\u2026. What power\u2026. Luka said. (This stuff is made up of the same thing her body is made up of. What does it do?) You thought. (Can we win against someone this strong?) Luka said. Hehe\u2026. Resisting as I prey on you won\u2019t make end any faster.  I\u2019ll slowly indulge in your body, dissolving and digesting you piece by piece\u2026 Until your final moments, you\u2019ll be drowning in me, begging for more. She said. Talk is cheap. You haven't proven anything yet.You say.</span></div></div>",

Cassandra\u2019s sticky flesh skirt extends, covering luka\u2019s lower body. It squirms around luka\u2019s penis. Luka attacks again. You stand there. This hand is more than you deserve. Casandra grabs luka\u2019s penis. Her sticky hands stroke him up and down.  Luka attacks. This hand is more than you deserve. She grabs luka penis, but he dodges it. Drown in my flesh\u2026 Cassandra\u2019s flesh skirt grows, wrapping around luka\u2019s body. Her flesh coils around his lower body up to his shoulders, squirming the whole time. Hehe, how pitful looking I\u2019ll slowly dissolve you into nothing\u2026 She said. With the power of earth, luka struggles and breaks free. One of the spirits power. That must have been from alice. Luka attacks. My flesh will finish you. She said.  Cassandra\u2019s stick flesh pours over you and luka. (It\u2019s corrosive. I can feel it eating at me slowly.  So while we fight her, we\u2019re slowly being eaten. It\u2019s like she\u2019s an amoeba. Divide her stick flesh parts into multiple to surround her food. If that connection was cut off\u2026..) You thought. Your eyes turn optical. When you look at it, the burning stops and it falls harmlessly on the ground. (got it.) you thought. Guh\u2026. What power\u2026. Luka said. Do you understand my strength now? It\u2019s too late to beg for forgiveness! She said. I\u2026. can\u2019t take her attacks anymore. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Luka. Stand aside. You say. You step in front of luka. What\u2026. Are you doing? Luka said. What I always do. You say. You can\u2019t beat me. You should just surrender now. She said. As if. You say. She\u2019s\u2026.. tough. We might have jumped in too deep. Luka said. That\u2019s what we heroes do. You say. Are you next? I was going to save you for last, but since you insist, I\u2019ll dissolve you first. She said. Don\u2019t count on it. You say. No\u2026.. She\u2019s too strong. She\u2019ll kill you. Luka said. Trust me luka. Have I ever let you down before? You say. No. Luka said. Then trust me. 8 minutes. That\u2019s all the time I need. You say.  A\u2026.. Alright. Just\u2026.. be careful. Luka said. If I was careful, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today. You say. Your eyes turn optical. Hahaha\u2026\u2026 You think you stand a better chance? She said. I said it would only take 8 minutes. Shit. Maybe not even that long. You say. Then come and prove it. Entertain me for as long as you can hold out. I\u2019ll be sure to enjoy every second as I dissolve you away. She said. Soak in the ecstasy of my body. She said. Cassandra\u2019s flesh skirt grows, wrapping around your lower body. You look at the flesh and it moves away from your body. What!? She said. I\u2019m not going to react to such amateur moves. You say. \u201cAmateur!?\u201d She said. Her stick skirt wraps around your lower half. And again, you look at it and it moves off your body. What\u2019s going on here!? She said. Pitiful. You say. Ok. How about this? She said. Cassandra\u2019s stick flesh wraps around your body up to your shoulders. Hehehe, let\u2019s see if you can escape. She said. Rookie. You say. You look at it and Cassandra loses her hold and drops you. How\u2019s he not being touched or un harmed!? Cassandra said. Whoa. He\u2019s on a hold different plane. Luka said. And here I thought I would have at least a good time. But this is a disappointment. You say.  Stop screwing around. Alice said. You see alice. It\u2019d be boring not have fun with it. You say. You like to show off too much. Alice said. Nothing wrong with that. As long as you control the battle. You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlipheese\u2026 Cassandra said. I tried to warn you not to come here\u2026.. But still, you have improved, luka. To think you would last this long against Cassandra nereneid\u2026 Alice said. Who is she\u2026? Luka said. Must be someone of importance to be here. You say. I told you about the monster lord succession, didn\u2019t i? When my mother rose to the throne, Cassandra was the only one to challenge her. She lost to my mother I single combat\u2026 It was a close battle, they were both on the same footing. Alice said. \u2026. Yes, I was defeated by your mother in the past. But I\u2019m different now. I\u2019ve preyed on hundreds of men since then, storing and saving my power\u2026 I narrowly lost then, but as I am now, I would have a complete victory. Cassandra said. Hmph. How stupid Cassandra. \u201cin the past\u201d \u201cBut now\u201d Still haven\u2019t gotten over it, have you? Alice said. You\u2019re living in the past. That\u2019s not healthy. You say. As expected, you would never been fit to sit on the throne. Alice said. \u2026.The only one unfit for the monster lord throne was your mother, wasn\u2019t it? Casandra said. Ouch. You say. That foolish advocate for coexistence between man and monster. Then killed by those same humans who wanted to get along with. Ridiculous. Truly a disgrace, unfit to be called monster lord. Cassandra said.  (So alice\u2019s mother wanted the same thing?) Luka thought. It\u2019s just a rumor I\u2019ve heard\u2026. Is it true you\u2019re following that stupid woman\u2019s wish for coexistence? Cassandra said. Wh\u2026 What\u2019s going on alice!? Your dream is the same as mine!? Luka said. \u2026.hmph. Whenever you talk about your dream, it pisses me off. The thought that I could have the same ideal as an idiot like you\u2026 Alice said. Hurtful\u2026.Luka said. Luka! Duck! You shout. Huh? Oof! Luka said as he\u2019s knocked off his feet. What type of fool would have a conversation in front of an enemy? Did you think I\u2019d sit by and wait? Now little alipheses. What reason do you have for coming here? I know you\u2019re a sorry excuse for a monster lord, but I doubt you would travel here just to attack me. Cassandra said. I\u2019m just as surprised as you are. To think that idiot would be right for once. AS long as a monster like you exist, man and monster will forever be enemies!  As a monster lord, it falls to me to discipline trash like you! Alice said. A\u2026.Alice\u2026. No\u2026. Luka said. Luka, I know what you\u2019re thinking. So I\u2019m going to cut you off there. Sometimes it takes a monster to kill a monster. And alice is the perfect role to do it. You say. But\u2026. He said. Luka, you can\u2019t do everything yourself. Best to let someone else take over. Plus, this fight involves the previous gen monster lord. We have no right to interfere. You say. Living in peace with humans\u2026. It\u2019s been a while since I heard that laughable thing. Why should predators spare any thought for their prey? What kind of world do you think you live in, girl? Cassandra said. Cassandra\u2019s corrosive flesh flies towards alice. Guh\u2026! Alice said. Only the strong can survive in this world. Humans are nothing but prey to be devoured by stronger monsters. And weak monster\u2026 They too should be preyed upon by stronger monsters. No matter how hard you cry for that pathetic dream, you cannot change the truth of this world! Cassandra said. Her corrosive flesh swarms around alice\u2019s body. \u2026..Prepare yourself aliphesses. I shall ensure you receive no pleasure as I dissolve you. Feel the pain as your body melts into nothing. Cassandra said. A whirlpool of corrosive flesh crash on alice. I see\u2026.. so you can transform this flesh of yours, and increase it at will. Like that, you move your digestive organs outside of your own body and use it to start eating your prey as you fight. Alice said. That\u2019s right. Cassandra said. I see what you can do\u2026.. And I\u2019m not the only one who did, am I right? Alice said. You\u2019re damn right I realized it the minute she used it on me and luka. I already had her beat, but i wanted to enjoy myself first.  You say. In that case\u2026. Alice sid. Alice\u2019s eyes shine with a strange light. Wh\u2026. What!? Cassandra said. Her sticky boy starts to vibrate. No\u2026. No My control\u2026 Cassandra said. The corrosive flesh that was on alice drips off her body. If it\u2019s ok with you alice, I want to end her. I don\u2019t want to hear her speak anymore. You say. No. She\u2019s had enough. Alice said. You were careless. Now you die the same way the men you killed did. You say. No\u2026\u2026 this can\u2019t be\u2026..!!!! She said as she\u2019s dissolved away. The room changed back to normal. You grab luka and help him up. Let\u2019s go. You say. You three leave the village. At the entrance, there are no more monsters here. Ok, I know you want to ask her so I\u2019ll be over there waiting. You say. You leave the group and give them some time. After waiting a few minutes, alice and luka come to where you\u2019re at. Done? You say. Yeah. I realize alice is just like me! S\u2026. Shut up! Alice said. Well, that\u2019s all good. We too now? You say.</span></div></div>",

You get halfway, until night time hits and you three stop and make camp. As alice trains luka to use the power of water, you\u2019re in a tree thinking. After luka is done with his training for now, he calls up to you. Hey, You ok? Luka said. You jump down. You use the power of wind, didn\u2019t you? You say. Yeah. It felt depressing and I thought you might have a problem. Luka said. \u2026\u2026.You might not understand, but I know how tenacious you are so I\u2019ll tell you. Have you ever stopped  and wondered if something is your fault? That you caused it? You say. Can\u2019t say that I have. Luka said. Well, I thought that once. I did something and\u2026\u2026.someone got hurt. Badly. You say. What\u2019d you do? Luka said. There\u2019s a saying. It\u2019s called: never negotiate with terrorist. Let\u2019s just say I didn\u2019t listen and something bad happened to someone close to me. You say. What was it? Luka said. I\u2026 don\u2019t want to talk about it. It\u2019s a sore subject. You say. But maybe talking about it will make you feel better. I was never for talking about problems. I\u2019m more towards action than words. You say. Well, I know I\u2019m not going to get any more out of you. Luka said. Wait. Luka. Do me a favor. You say. What? He said. If you see weird marking on my arm. Tell me right away. You say. Weird marking? Like what? He said. Don\u2019t question it. Just tell me if you see them on my arm, okay? You say. Yeah, sure. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, you\u2019re up early with luka. Alice\u2019s still asleep? You say. Yeah. I tried to wake her, but she won\u2019t. Luka said. Hmmm\u2026\u2026 Do we still have some left over from last night? You say. Some. Luka said. Let me have it. You say. Luka reaches into his backpack and gives you what he made last night. Don\u2019t know where you go this fish from, but it\u2019s grilled and it should work. You say. You dangle the fish over alice\u2019s nose. Her body perks up and you lead her to a tree. What are you doing? Luka said. Waking her up. You say. Is this safe? Luka said. No, but it will be funny. If I know anything about snakes, is that she will attack in 3.2.1. You say. You pull the fish out of the way and alice hits her head hard on the tree. Ow! Alice said. Hahahahahaha! You say. You jerk! What\u2019s wrong with you!? I almost split my head in two! Alice said. Had to wake you up somehow. And your obsession with food worked against you. You say. Rrgh\u2026..! Alice said. Oi, oi. How about we get moving before the two of you clash again? Luka said. If we do, I\u2019d come out on top. You say. You wish. Alice said. I got the time. Want to go another round? You say. No. Not now. Luka said. As Luka, alice, and you make your way to the volcano, you see alice looking at you. Is this the best time alice? You say. \u2026\u2026.How many? Alice said. How many what? Luka said. 3. You say. That scar over your eye.... How\u2019d that happen? She said. In a fight. You say. Does it hurt? Luka said. No. The skin rebuild, but it didn\u2019t go away. Next. You say. You don\u2019t fight seriously? Why? Alice said. If luka fought you when you first saw him, would you even try? You say. No. Alice said. H\u2026 Hey\u2026 Luka said. Last one. You say. I smell a high concentration of magic from you. And you prefer to be a physical fighter. Why is that? Alice said. It\u2019s not magic. I just have a lot of skills. You say. That doesn\u2019t answer my question. She said. It\u2019s not magic. You say. Whoa. Ok. I think that\u2019s enough for now. Luka said. Yeah. I agree. You say. You three keep going. As you walk, you see luka staring at your neck. Go ahead and ask. You say. Uh\u2026.. you saw? He said. You\u2019re not as discreet as alice. You say.  \u2026\u2026That chian around your neck. What is it? He said. You pull out the dog tag. It\u2019s a keepsake from s certain someone. You say. Your mom? Dad? He said. \u2026\u2026..No. It\u2019s from a friend. You say. It says Arif. Is that your name? He said. No. that\u2019s the name of my friend. He\u2019s\u2026.. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Let\u2019s just keep going. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou three get to the volcano. It\u2019s hot. Luka said. This volcano must be active. I don\u2019t know why salamander chose this place. You say. Must feel comfortable for her. She is a fire spirit. Luka said. Salamander is a famous as a powerful spirit among monsters. So it\u2019s common knowledge that she resides here.  Many monsters using cursed swords spirits come here to seek her guidance\u2026 But nearly every one of them turns away after stepping inside the volcano. Alice said. I see why. It\u2019s like the sun in here. You say. We should go before this intense heat kills us. Luka said. Way ahead of you. You say. You three keep traveling through the volcano.  As you three walk, you sense something. Heads up. You say. Luka pulls out his sword. You see it\u2019s a basilisk.  Oh, humans? How rare. I\u2019m gonna enjoy playing with ya\u2026 She said. A basilisk? Luka said. Careful here. Not only are they powerful, but they can also petrify. He said. Noted. You say. I\u2019m gonna turn ya to stone, and make a nice toy out of you both. I\u2019ll turn everything but your penis to stone, and rape you. Or\u2026. Should I petrify your penis too so it won\u2019t ever get soft?  Heh, heh\u2026. Which do ya want? She said. Neither! You both said. You both attack together. I\u201dll work that dick of yours. She said. The basilisk grabs luka\u2019s penis with her strange feeling hands, and strokes him. Here I go! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. You attack. My tits are nice and soft, ya know? She said. The basilisk slowly pumps luka\u2019s penis between her huge breast. Luka attacks. You attack also. Let me show ya something special. I can turn something to stone by licking it. She said. The basilisk runs her tongue all over luka\u2019s penis. Ah\u2026\u2026Ahhhh! Luka said. Where she lick turns part of luka\u2019s penis to stone.  You and luka attack together. I\u2019ll squezze out all that semen of yours with my tits! She said. She slowly pumps luka\u2019s penis between her huge breast.  The power of earth infuses luka\u2019s body as he jumps in the air. Luka slams down, shaking the earth itself as he lands. You stumble a little as he lands. My hands feels great. She said. She grabs luka\u2019s penis with her strange feeling hands. Moving like a powerful gale, luka thrust his sword forward as fast as lightning. How could I lose to kids like this\u2026!? She said. The basilisk turns into a chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not being turn to stone today. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was fun. You say. Fun? It was difficult\u2026\u2026 Uh\u2026..Dude. Luka said. What? You say. Your arm\u2026. He said. You look at your left arm and see it\u2019s petrified. Wow. Hey. Want to see a trick? You say. A trick? Luka said. You bash your left arm on the wall and it shatters. Whoa! What\u2019d you do that for!? Luka said. Wait. You say. In seconds, your left arm regenerates. H\u2026. How\u2019d you do that!? He said. My cells can regenerate themselves. I can even be decapitated and my head will grow back. Wow\u2026\u2026 Well that must be a neat power. Luka said. Did you hear that? You say. You both hear a loud groan. What was that? Luka said. It\u2019s rare for humans to be here. All of the monsters are starving for a taste of a male. She said. So basically we\u2019re like chum in a shark tank. You say. So we\u2019re meat here. We should really get salamander fast. Anyway, your next opponent sounds like a tough one. Your only chance of winning is to use the power of water. Alice said. My only chances\u2026\u2026. If I can\u2019t then\u2026.. Luka said. Alice vanishes without another word. Thanks for the pep talk. You say. Must be really powerful\u2026.. Luka said with a low voice. Luka, no matter what, I\u2019ll be right behind you in this fight. You say. That\u2019s makes me feel a little better. The owner of the voice gets closer. It\u2019s a dragon girl. A\u2026. Dragon!? Luka said. By the look on your face, we\u2019re standing in front of a legendary monster. You say. Yeah. Flames that can turn to anyone to ash, scales that can deflect any weapons, and claws that can tear any armor to shreds\u2026. Luka said. Oh, a human? Two of them? What rare prey\u2026. She said. Guh\u2026.! Luka said. He takes a step back. Hehe\u2026 There\u2019s no need to be afraid. I won\u2019t tear you apart with these claws, or burn  you with my flames. There\u2019s no need for me to fight seriously against a tiny beings like you. Just come a little closer, so I can lovingly caress you\u2026. She said. I have a bad feeling about this. You say.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You attack her, but you see it did nothing.  Foolish man. That won\u2019t work. She said. (Guess I\u2019ll have to power up.) You thought. A thin wall of water surrounds luka. Come inside my mouth when you can\u2019t take it any more\u2026. She said. The dragon girl sucks on luka\u2019s penis with her giant mouth. You power up a little. Luka attacks. It\u2019s fine to cover me in semen\u2026. She said. She squeezes luka\u2019s penis between her soft breast. Luka attacks, but it doesn\u2019t do much. It\u2019s time to prey on you\u2026\u2026 She said. The dragon girl opens her giant mouth and bits down on luka. Luka\u2019s being sucked into the dragon girls mouth. I\u2019ll devour you like this\u2026. First, I\u2019ll suck you dry\u2026 She said. Luka struggles, but can\u2019t break free. I\u2019ll suck on you until nothing is left\u2026  Hehe\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll enjoy this. She said. Her female upper body hugs luka inside her giant mouth, running her fingers over his body. You reach into her mouth, grab luka and pull him out of there. Oh man. Maybe I should have used gnome first. Luka said. Yeah, maybe. You say. Ohh. Such strength to pull your friend away. You must be a little stronger. You deserve more attention first. She said. Touch me and I\u2019ll rip off all of your claws. You say. (My regular hits probably won\u2019t cut it. My knife won\u2019t do jack. Maybe to beat monster, I have to become one. At least my arms.) You thought. You concentrate and your arms bulk up and your fingernails turn to claws.(I\u2019m using my anger to turn my arms, but holding back the rest of it is tough.) You thought. You attack her hard. She stagers a little. I was right. You are a little bit stronger.  But I still don\u2019t think I should get serious. She said. You attack again. It ok to cover my in semen. She said. She tries to squeeze you, but you dodge it. You counter attack. (it\u2019s getting harder to hold it back. I have to do something fast.) you thought. You attack her, but she anticipates it and blocks with her claws. She blows a light power stream of fire at you. It hits and knocks you  in the air and you hit the ground hard. Your arms return to normal. Oh my. I was holding back to. She said. You lie there in pain. Hehe. I think I\u2019ll taste you first before I have him. She said. Guh\u2026..! Luka said. (What should I do? He was taken out in minutes. And he\u2019s stronger than me. If he can\u2019t beat her, then what chance do I have?) Luka thought. Just come and walk into my mouth. It will be a pleasant experience. She said. N\u2026.. No! I still have fight in me! I\u2019ll defeat you somehow! Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka thinks for a for a minute.(The power of water\u2019s my only chance, at least by what alice said. It\u2019s easier said than done, but if I don\u2019t try something, we both are going to be dead. I guess just keep attacking!) Luka thought. Luka attacks. While lying there, you smile. When luka attacks hits, your previous attack takes effect. Guh\u2026..! She said. Luka\u2019s attack tripled when he hits. You get up. Heh heh. You say. Was that your doing? Luka said. Oh yeah. I always have a plan. You say. Could at least next time tell me? He said. \u2026..How dare you attempt to seal me. I don\u2019 care about your semen any longer! I will crush you and turn you to ashes! She said. So she\u2019s finally getting serious. You say. The power coming off her is a lot more intense than before. She\u2019s too powerful\u2026. We can\u2019t win regularly. Luka said. Luka. Remember alice\u2019s warning and training. You say. Luka closes his eyes and entrust his heart to the flow. (You feel it?) you said. (yeah. He\u2019s finally done it. Should we join him?) He said. (No. let him do this.) you say. .\u2026What\u2019s wrong!? Giving up already!? She said. You wish. You say. She attacks luka. Luka dodges to the side. (He sees it. The flow.) You thought. She attacks again. Luka dodges again.(He let the wave formed on her fangs  and it pushed him aside.) You thought. What the!? How did you avoid my attack!? She said. (So that training paid off. Maybe alice isn\u2019t a bad teacher after all.) You thought. Why can\u2019t I hit him!? She said. Attacking faster isn\u2019t going to help. He\u2019s dodging you like a pro. You say. Luka is beside you when he pulls out his sword and let the flow of water guild his sword. What the\u2026? She said. Luka felt the sword connect to the unguarded part of her body.  I\u2026. Impossible\u2026! My thick scales\u2026.. Cut through like paper!? H\u2026 How can such a thin arm\u2026? She said. I didn\u2019t cut you with power, I just followed the flow. Luka said. That doesn\u2019t make sense! Aghhhh! Then how about this!?  She said. Luka senses another powerful wave and cuts through it. Ridiculous! You can\u2019t cut flames! She said. No, but he can cut you. You say. Luka lets the flow guild his sword. Impossible\u2026. Just who are you\u2026.!? She said. Luka opens his eyes. The dragon girl turns into a giant lizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this is the power of water\u2026.? Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was\u2026..epic, luka. You acted like you\u2019ve been doing this for a long time. So how\u2019d it feel? You say. I felt\u2026.. connected to everything around me. Luka said. Did you see me? You say. No. I only felt her. He said. Probally because I didn\u2019t attack. I\u2019ll be the first to admit it. You did well out there. You say. So\u2026.. you think I\u2019m getting better? Luka said. Better? No. Improving? Yes. You say. Alice. You\u2019re back. You say. \u2026..Not bad. You didn\u2019t even break concentration like I thought you would. She said. Alice. When you were training luka, were you enjoying hitting him? You say. I was getting some satisfaction out of it. She said. I knew you were abusing the training. Luka said. Well, I guess without it, luka wouldn\u2019t have unlocked it. You say. Be thankful idiot. She said. Yes, thank you\u2026 Luka said. Not much of a thank you when forced, but ok. You say. You hear that? Luka said. Another one? You say. No\u2026 She\u2019s\u2026. Alice said. Radiating magical power all around her, a powerful looking monster appears. (She\u2019s not a normal monster.) You thought. Are you salamander!? Luka said.  Indeed, I\u2019m the flame spirit salamander. I know that you came to me seeking power. In addition, you already borrowed the power of sylph, gnome, and undine. She said. That speeds it up. Please, lend me your power. Luka said. I\u2019ll give you the same response as the others. Show me your power. She said. I got it. A challenge. Luka said. He pulls out his sword. Luka, I\u2019ll give you a warning. Salamander is granberia\u2019s instructor. Alice said. Ehhhhh!? Then this is going to be impossible, isn\u2019t it? Luka said. Hm\u2026. That\u2019s quite an old story. Granberia is already far more powerful than me. In other words\u2026. If you can\u2019t beat me, then there\u2019s no chance you can ever defeat granberia! Salamander said. \u2026..I got it! Here I go. Luka said. Good luck luka! You say. (You really think he can win?) he said.(She\u2019s a flame spirit. So it might be tough, but I know he has a chance. But I\u2019m more worried about him taking on granberia. She trained her and granberia\u2019s 2x as strong as salamander. He\u2019s going to face granberia. The question is, will he be strong enough by then?) You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Start off strong.) Luka thought. Here I go! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. Always attack the weak point! She said. Salamander\u2019s hot fist shoots towards luka\u2019s groin. Salamander grabs luka\u2019s penis, stroking it with her hot hand. She strokes him faster. Luka attacks. That\u2019s a nice gaze\u2026. But how do your abilities compare? She said. Luka attacks again. Hm, it seems you have some skill\u2026 She said. Luka steps in and thrusts his sword like lightning. I\u2019m good at restraining move, too... Salamander said. Salamander rushes forward and hugs luka, forcing his face into her breast. Hah! Chock on my breast! She said. She squeezes luka\u2019s head between her breast. She tightens her arm, hugging luka even tighter. Using the power of earth, luka breaks free. It seems you can use gnome\u2019s power. She said. (So what did you come to?) he said. (her moves are kind of like wrestling and binding her opponent in holds. It\u2019s what I expected from a fire spirit.) you say.( I think she\u2019s setting him up and trying to take him out in one big move.) He said. (We\u2019ll just have to watch and see.) You say. Here I come! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. It\u2019s about to get a little violent! She said. Salamander jumps at luka and grabs her head between her thighs and flings him to the ground. She\u2019s sitting on top of luka\u2019s with his head between her thighs. Hah! Take it! She said. Salamander squeezes luka\u2019s head between her thighs. She squeezes even tighter, increasing the pressure. (is she trying to decapitate him?) he said. With the power of earth, luka breaks free. Luka attacks. \u2026..Well? You are able to use the power of water, right? Salamander said. We\u2026. Well\u2026 Luka said. I saw the fight with the dragon girl. At the same time, you gave your heart over to the flow. You need to take undine\u2019s power inside you, and project your inner self into the world around you. I can\u2019t lend my power to one who cannot even do that. She said. Take the flow into my heart\u2026.! Luka said. Luka entrust his heart to the flow of water. Heh, so you can use it, can you? Then dodge this. Salamander said.  Her hot fist shoots towards luka\u2019s groin, but luka dodges it. \u2026.I see, good. It doesn\u2019t look like my attacks will hit you as you are now. Then try attacking. Nothing special. Just something normal. She said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes, following the flow towards his opponent. \u2026..good, that\u2019s it. When you\u2019re connected to the world, both your attacks and evasion are unmatched. But enough talking. The fight continues. She said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes, following the flow towards his opponent. This technique is both a bind and a throw. She said. Salamander jumps at luka, but he dodges it. Ah\u2026. It went away\u2026. Luka said. Seems like you understand now. The longer you use it, the more concentration it cost. She said. \u2026.I get it. Luka said. Hm\u2026 So I\u2019m already teaching you, am i? \u2026..You pass, luka. I\u2019ll entrust my fire to you. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s all of the spirits. Luka said. </span></div></div>",

She holds out her palm towards luka. With a flash of light, she\u2019s gone. Feel any different? You say. My body feels like it\u2019s on fire. This must be salamander\u2019s power taking hold of me. You finally got salamander\u2019s power? Alice said. Yes, I now have all four spirits. Luka said. Hate to cut the victory short, but did anyone else hear that? You say. The ground starts to shake and vibrate, as if an earthquake was going on. What the hell!? Is the volcano erupting? Luka said. No, if it was, we\u2019d be dead since we\u2019re inside. You say. This feeling is\u2026 Alice said. Suddenly, the ceiling above you crashes to the floor. Who the hell did that? You say. After a few seconds, a flash of green comes after the debris. Granberia!? It can\u2019t be. Luka said. (She\u2019s in a league of her own.) he said. (The presence from her is far greater than the dragon girl. She\u2019s not a normal monster.) You say. \u2026..It has been a while, boy.  It seems you\u2019ve progressed almost twenty years in the short amount of time since we parted ways. Granberia said. Wh\u2026.why did you come here\u2026.? Luka said. \u2026..I came here to challenge you to a fight. She said. Granberia brandishes  her sword, shouting that at luka. This is all of a sudden, granberia. Are you ignoring my decree and attacking heroes without provocation first? Alice said. \u2026B\u2026But Alipheese\u2026. \u201cHeroes\u201d are simply disgusting soldiers of ilias! But the boy in front of me is different than those mass produced heroes! One who I\u2019ve been searching for\u2026..one worthy to cross blades with! Granberia said. I see\u2026 Alice said. \u2026.Luka. It looks like granberia doesn\u2019t care about either heroes or the monster lord at the moment. She seems to think nothing but of fighting you as a warrior. What are you going to do? Alice said. Of course. I accept your challenge! Luka said. Now show me, boy! Fight with everything you have right from the start! Granberia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What do you think his chances are?) He said. (Slightly higher than last time. I\u2019m going to stay out of this, but if push comes to shove, then I\u2019ll step in.) You say. (Hmph\u2026\u2026 If it was up to me, I\u2019d let the kid get owned.) he said. (And that why you don\u2019t have any social skills.) you say. Take the flow into my heart\u2026..! Luka said. You can tell is using his serene mind. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been waiting for! Granberia said. She steps forward, and slashes out with her giant sword. Luka dodges it. Oho? I see\u2026 She said. I see it\u2026.Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes, following the flow towards his opponent. Taking the fast attack, granberia jumps back in surprise. P\u2026powerful! How can such an arm attack with such force\u2026.? She said. Maybe my wait and see attitude is no longer necessary. Very well, I\u2019ll take this fight seriously! She said. You feel a powerful force around. \u2026.What!? no way! Luka said. (Granberia just entered serene mind. This might be trouble.) You say. (What do you think is stronger: His or hers?) he said. (hers. By a long shot.) You say. Aren\u2019t you the swordswoman of fire!? Why would you use a water ability!? Luka said. Having a serene mind is natural for a warrior. She said. Swinging down the flow, granberia\u2019s sword flashes towards luka.The attack grazes luka. (He wasn\u2019t able to dodge it fully.) you thought. Guh\u2026.! I didn\u2019t think you could use that skill\u2026 Luka said. Heh, that\u2019s what I was going to say.To think you could master this as a human. In fact\u2026. I only manged to master it 20 years ago. She said. (20 years ago? So she\u2019s not ancient?) He said. Granberia, how old are you\u2026? Luka said. I\u2019ll be 25 this year. But no more talking during our battle! She said. Then\u2026. You mastered it when you were 5 years old!? Luka said. (She must be a prodigy.) You though. No more words! We\u2019ll speak with our blades! She said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes, following the flow towards his opponent. That sharp attack, I couldn\u2019t avoid. Granberia said. Blood drips from her cheek. The only person to cause physical haem and make me bleed was your friend there, but also you. It feels great to fight someone good. My pulse is racing, my spirt is burning! She said. Following the flow, granberia\u2019s sword slams down. The attack grazes against luka. Guh\u2026..! Luka said. (This is starting to get one sided. If this keeps up\u2026.) You thought. \u2026.It\u2019s time to settle this battle. I\u2019ll show you my ultimate move! Granberia said. She holds up her sword, and starts to concentrate her power. That\u2019s not good. You say. Guh! Her ultimate move!? Luka said. (Wait. Her ultimate move is\u2026\u2026 If luka can remember and do his\u2026.. )you thought. Here I go! Luka said. Vaporizing rebellion sword! Granberia said. Luka and granberia unleash their most powerful attacks at the same time! Their swords clash together. Luka\u2019s body is thrown into the air, then crash to the ground. Luka! You say. You check on him. Guh\u2026.! Vaporizing rebellion sword\u2026. My skill doesn\u2019t even compare to hers. Luka said. Wonderful\u2026 Inflicting a wound upon me even as taking my attack. Granberia said. She wasn\u2019t uninjured, but luka\u2019s are far worst. Can you stand? You say. Ugh\u2026. I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s my lost. Luka said.  Now then\u2026 what to do with the loser\u2026? Granberia said. Grnberia\u2026. Luka just obtain salamander\u2019s power. Naturally, he has no idea how to use it. Once he\u2019s able to control all four spirits\u2026. Of course, he will grow far stronger. Alice said. Spare him\u2026. Is that an order? Granberia said. \u2026.it\u2019s nothing more than a fact. You were the winner, so it\u2019s your call. Alice said. Granberia calmly puts her sword away. It\u2019s like she was planning on this from the start. \u2026I\u2019ll be waiting at the monster lord\u2019s castle. She said. After saying that, granberia vanishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmph\u2026. It looks like I didn\u2019t need to jump in like that. She was planning that all along. Alice said. Luka grumbles as he tries to get up, but can\u2019t. She beat you good. Those look severe. You say. With body that beat up, holding a sword would be impossible.  Alice said. So how long do you think he needs? You say. A normal person, a full month. Luka, about half a month. Alice said. A\u2026. A half month\u2026? My journey will have to be put on hold for that long\u2026? Luka said. Alice coild her tail around luka. No complaining. You still have your life. First we should return back to town. Gold port is the closest location. Alice said. Ah\u2026. Yeah\u2026. Sorry for troubling you. Luka said. \u2026..Sheesh, really. After all the trouble you put me through, you owe me a feast\u2026 Alice said. Of food or semen? You say. I\u2019ll let your imagination have at it. Alice sid. Holding luka\u2019s body in the air with her tail. Alice carries him out of the volcano, with you behind her.</span></div></div>",

The next morning, you see luka waking up. Hey, he\u2019s not dead.. You say. Where am i? Luka said. A inn at Gold port. You say. What a strange dream\u2026. Luka said. What are you muttering about, you idiot? Do you not realize your own injuries? Laceration, burns, a fever\u2026. An ordinary person would have died a long time ago. Alice said. If you\u2019re staring at me with scary eyes like that\u2026. It must have been bad. Luka said. Bad? You were a walking corpse. You say. Luka raises himself from the bed. \u2026..it looks like that good night\u2019s sleep helped out a lot. Luka said. \u2026.The hell it did! You won\u2019t move for days, and a full recovery will take half a month! Alice said. But\u2026. Look\u2026. I\u2019m already fine. Luka said. He waves his arms around. Looks fine to me. You say. Y\u2026 You\u2019re cured\u2026 What the hell is your body made of\u2026? I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with you\u2026 Alice said. Oi, oi\u2026. Stop looking at me like I\u2019m some kind of freak! Luka said. She\u2019s calling you a freak. That\u2019s funny. You say. I got all four of the spirits. Does that mean I\u2019m on the same level at the four heavenly knights? Luka sid. Don\u2019t be in such a rush, you idiot. You have the potential for it. Whether you can use it, or it kills you, is up to you. Besides, you don\u2019t even know how to use the power of fire yet. Alice said. The power of fire, eh? Luka said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026.Well, I\u2019ll give you praise. Good job on being able to attain a serene mind. As a reward, I\u2019ll teach you a new skill. Alice said. Could it be one that uses the power of water!? Luka said. \u2026..yes, that\u2019s right. Now that you mastered that state of mind, you should be able to use it. Listen, first you need to put your sword back into your sheathe. Then entrusting your heart to the flow, you draw it and strike forward in the blink of an eye. It\u2019s the ultimate attack that can only be used with a serene state of mind. Alice sid. Hmmm\u2026. I see\u2026. That sounds surprisingly simple\u2026 Luka said. Luka puts his sword back in his sheathe. Then\u2026 Like this? Luka said. Flowing the flow around him, luka\u2019s sword flashes out. Wah!! Alice said. At the same time alice falls backwards\u2026 You turn around to see the sword and stop it with one hand. What the hell are you doing!? Trying to kill me!? Alice said. S\u2026sorry\u2026 I didn\u2019t think it would reach that far\u2026 Luka said. Luka sees you stop the sword with one hand. H\u2026. how\u2019d you stop that with one hand? Luka said.  two things: One. Watch where and who you swing that at. Two: You\u2019re not the only one who had special training. You say. You see it also left a huge gash in the wall. You let go of the sword and see it left a huge cut on your hand. Hmph\u2026 You say. It\u2019s because of that special training that you were able to master this attack quickly. An attack unmatched in speed that can only be performed with a serene state of mind\u2026 Alice said. Ok, so what now? You say. Well, I guess we try to find a ship that sailing to that dangerous continent. Luka said. I doubt ships would sail there, but no harm in looking for one. You say. Alright, let\u2019s go! Luka said. You three leave the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look around, you see it\u2019s busy like all cities. So what\u2019s next sit here and twiddle our thumbs? You say. As you look around, you see something. (is that\u2026..) you thought. Hey. I\u2019ll be right back. You say. You saw something? Luka said. Yeah. It won\u2019t be long. You say. You leave and try to find what you saw. (I\u2019m sure I saw her.) You say. You see it again and follow  it ,but you lose it. Damn, thought I had her. And when did it get desolate? You say. Poor boy. Still blind even when it\u2019s right in front of you. A voice said. I knew it wasn\u2019t by mistake. You say. Out of nowhere, heather appears in front of you. Heather. You say. You can\u2019t stay away from danger, can you? She said. If it\u2019s not dangerous, then it\u2019s boring. Why are you haunting me? You say. Such a cute face with all that power, but a small brain. You didn\u2019t kill me, remember. You need to be dead to haunt someone. She said. I had 3 chances to do it to, but I let you live. I\u2019m starting to regret it. You say. I knew you couldn\u2019t. We have something special between us. She said. There\u2019s nothing between us.You said. Really? She said, putting her arms around you. She pulls you in for a kiss, but you push her off you. Get off me! This explains why i'm experiencing these hallucination. You said. I didn't curse you with hallucinations. She said. What?! These visions.... It's not you?! You said. No. You're doing it to yourself. She said. What!?! You said. Your conscious. You can\u2019t let go of the past and are remembering all the horrible acts you've done. She said. Horrible acts....?  (All the money I've taken.People i've killed.) You said. You're not like Luke. You have a conscious. And it's weighing down on your fractured mind. You're going to have to do something about it. Or You're going to kill yourself. She said. She puts her arms around you. And that would make me sad. I'd be out one handsome boy. She said as she vanishes. Then it\u2019s like everybody in the city just came back. (Did that really happen? Or was it all in my head? More importantly, Can I really let go of the past? All the things that i've done?) You thought. You head out of the port and into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand on the tree limb. Let go of the past? Can I really do that? I\u2019ve done a lot of things I\u2019m not proud of, but\u2026 You say. (No point in crying over it now. We've killed, kidnapped, and everything for money and just because. And life goes on.) He said. (.....Is it really that easy?) You thought.  You can hear footsteps. Must be luka. You say. You jump down in front of him. Wah! He said. You look like you seen a ghost. You say. I wasn\u2019t expecting you to jump down in front of me. What have you been doing? He said. Clearing my head. Look. I don\u2019t care what we\u2019re doing or going as long as I\u2019m moving and doing something. You say. Uh\u2026.. Ok. We were heading back for port Natalia. He said. Fine by me. You say. You three head back to port Natalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiding in the horse carriage, you three quickly get back to port Natalia. This is Meia\u2019s house isn\u2019t it\u2026.? Meia! Are you home!? Luka said. Luka knocks on the mermaid\u2019s door. Who is it? Ah it\u2019s you. She said with a smile. Why if it isn\u2019t the hero! Come in, come in! She said. Ah\u2026. Thanks\u2026. Luka said. (Slightly forceful. Isn\u2019t she?) He said. So what did you stop by for? She said. Ah\u2026 I was wondering if I could borrow the ball of guidance again. I need to get to the bottom of the sea\u2026 Luka said. Oh, I\u2019ll just give it to you. I don\u2019t need it anymore. She said. Meia takes out the ball of guidance form her closet and hands it to luka. Hmph. We\u2019re done here. Let\u2019s hurry up and go. Alice said. No need to stay here anymore. You say. Oi, that\u2019s pretty rude. Luka said. Oh, I\u2019m sorry, Did you want another blowjob from the mermaid? Alice said.  N\u2026.n\u2026.no! Err how do you know about that!? Luka said. Seems like someone\u2019s keeping tabs on you luka. You say. Oh my. If you want one, you just need to ask. Meia said.  N\u2026No thanks! Let\u2019s go you two, we\u2019re done here! Luka said. Now who\u2019s being rude? You say. Thank you very much! Goodbye! Luka said. Luka bolts out of the house.  Ah, I remember this beach. Luka said. Yeah. And there\u2019s your imprint when you landed face first from being thrown by the kraken. You say. Yeah. Nostalgic. Except the face first to the ground part. Luka said. Well, you remember how to use that thing? You say. Yeah. Luka said. Luka hold up the ball of guidance. Just like before a dazzling light shoots into the water, down into the depths of the sea. Here we go again\u2026.. You say. Alright\u2026.. Let\u2019s go. Luka said. You both dive into the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time around, you both are not attacked and make you way to the bottom. You both reach the shrine and just as before, the kraken is there. Oh, you two are\u2026. \u2026.Ah, of course, The hero and the silver haired monster that I married. She said. Heh heh heh. You say. No! That\u2019s wrong! Alice said. She must be senile. You mutter to luka. Sheesh\u2026. Next time you say something that stupid, I\u2019ll deep fry you. Alice said. Cannibalism. And she\u2019d do it to. You say. Alice\u2019s stomach might give. Luka said. What stomach? She\u2019s a bottom less pit. You say. Ah\u2026. Ah, that\u2019s right\u2026. Forgive me, your majesty. So what business do you have here today? The kraken said.  I came here to borrow the blue orb. Luka said. Hrrm\u2026 The orb is a treasure to this shrine. But you came all this way here before for the sake of a man and monster getting married, didn\u2019t you? As queen of the southern seas, I must repay that. I\u2019ll let you borrow the blue orb. She said. The kraken hands luka the blue orb. Shiny. You say. I\u2019m not doing this as a favor. I\u2019m also trusting you with it. A time when monsters and humans don\u2019t hate each other\u2026.. I believe both you and the monster lord are capable of changing something. The kraken said. I\u2019ll make use of this orb just for that sake! Luka said. I\u2019m expecting great things from you, human. Just like the monster lord. She said. You three leave the underwater shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn land, you look at the orb. I wouldn\u2019t misuse that luka. You say. I know. Next is the silver orb, in the bottom of the north sea. I heard we could get there from here also. Luka said. He raises the ball up and a dazzling light shoot out into the sea. Let\u2019s go! Luka said. Just to let you know, I\u2019m not a fan of water. You say. You three head into the light, and make your way down.</span></div></div>",

Luka said. If we encounter one, maybe alice will just deep fry them. You say. \u2026\u2026.Hmph. Alice said. You three reach the bottom of the sea and find the temple. There. You say. You both head inside. It looks just the same. Luka said. And look another kraken. You say. Luka sees the  huge monster, with the aggressive looking body. You think she will just hand it over? Luka said. I don\u2019t think so. Think of it like this. You think if you had an orb like those, you\u2019d let them out of your sights? You say. No. He said.  \u2026. I am the ruler of these seas, poseioness.  And you must be the thieves who came for the orb? She said. Eh\u2026. No. Luka said. Jumping the gun again? Great. You say. She suddenly attacks you both before you two could say anything.  Thieves who came to take the orb\u2026 I\u2019ll give you a punishment fit for your crime. So prepare yourself! She said. Luka, we\u2019re not getting that thing unless we knock her around a bit. You say. Grr\u2026. Guess there\u2019s no other option! Luka said as he pulls out his sword. You attack her. You see luka uses his serene mind. Writhe in my tentacles. Possidoness said. Her tentacles caress luka\u2019s body. Luka dodges it. You attack her. Luka\u2019s sword flashes, following the flow towards his opponent. My tentacles will play with you\u2026. She said. Her tentacles caress your body, but you dodge it. You grab your knife and look at luka. It\u2019s like he knows what you\u2019re thinking. Luka sheaths his sword, and rests his hands on the hilt and drawing it in a fluid slash, he slices straight with you following his lead.  Feel my thunder! She said. Possidoness raises her three pronged spear, bringing down a crash of thunder! Agh! Luka said. Oh, did that shirt of yours protect you and only made you paralyzed? She said. Hah\u2026. Now you look like a fish on a cutting board. She said. Hehe, I\u2019ll play with you nice and carefully\u2026. She said. As her tentacles head for luka, you push him out of the way and slash the tentacles with your knife.  Ohhhh? She said. Luka! You say. He shakes it off. I\u2019m good! He said. Luka! Let\u2019s finish this! You say. You say. Right! Luka said. You\u2019re eyes turn optical and you and luka rush forward and slice right through her. What skill\u2026 it\u2019s my loss. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre all of the sea monsters senile? Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe didn\u2019t come to steal the orb Just\u2026. I know luka. Why you came here, and everything She interrupts. Eh\u2026.? Luka said. I got a message from the queen of the southern sea about a hero and his companion.\u201dHelp him if you can\u201d it said. But I wanted to test you myself. So I decided to have a quick bout with you both. She said. So you didn\u2019t think we were thieves? You say. Of cours\u2026. If I defeated you, I never would have recognize you both. I would have just punish you as a simple thief. She said. (Cynical bitch.) he said. But your sword showed me your power. You are a superior warrior, and are worthy of the silver orb. She said. She holds out the orb. This is what you wanted. Now take it. She said. Th\u2026. Thank you! Luka said. Luka takes the orb. And alipheese, it has been a while. She said. Hmph\u2026 Thank you for guarding these northern seas. Alice said. Ah\u2026. Thank you for your kind words, your majesty. Possidoness said. This is quite weird. You mutter. I know. I keep forgetting she\u2019s the monster lord and all that. Luka said. Hero luka. I expect great things from you. I pray you bring some light to this world of strife. Never let your sword waver and stray from your path. She said. Y\u2026 yes! Luka said.You three leave the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on land, you look at the orb. Not to sound like a thief, but how much do you think these will be worth? You say. Uhhhh\u2026. I don\u2019t know. Alice? Luka said. \u2026\u2026.Just selling one of these orbs will make you the richest person in the world. She said. Damn. You say. Let\u2019s head back to port gold. Luka said. You three head back to the port.  When you get there, luka approaches a mysterious woman. Hehe so you came. I\u2019ve been looking for a hero like you for a long time\u2026 A talented warrior\u2026.. And you\u2019re interested in captain Selene, right\u2026.? She said. Yes\u2026. Luka said. I\u2019m selene. And you three? She said. Err\u2026. I\u2019m hero apprentice luka. Luka said. \u2026..The traveling gourmand, Alice. Alice said. Glutton would be a better word. You say. And you? Selene said. You give her a fake name. Then, would you come to my house\u2026? We can talk some more there. She said. S\u2026 Sure\u2026 Luka said. You three follow her to her house. As soon as you\u2019re inside, she starts talking. I want you to come on the ocean with me, and help me look for captain Selene\u2019s ship. I\u2019ve already prepared a ship. She said. Look for captain selene\u2019s ship with you\u2026? Luka said. This sounds like it\u2019s going to be a pain\u2026.Alice said. Alice, this lemon juice is delicious. Luka said.  I am thirsty. Alice said. \u2026.I understand your request. But selena, why are you looking for selena? Do you admire her? Or her treasure? Luka said. \u2026\u2026I\u2019m captain selena\u2019s granddaughter. She said. Eh\u2026!? Luka said. When captain selene was in port here, she gave birth to a girl. That girl was my mother\u2026 \u2026..Keep this a secret, or there will be a lot of trouble for me. She said. G\u2026 Got it. Luka said. I have a clue about selene\u2019s location. A letter she wrote to her lover in this town\u2026 In other words, a letter to my grandfather. She sent a letter by carrier pigeon every month. All the way until her voyage met with disaster.  She said. You still have those letters? Luka said. Yes\u2026. I kept them all. We can figure out the steps of her voyage by the letters. She said. After saying that, she opens up a sea chart. There are multiple lines and points marked by ink. I\u2019ve filled in the points of her voyage on this chart. Her last voyage seemed to be headed towards a certain undersea cave\u2026  It\u2019s about one week southwest of gold port\u2026 This letter from her talks about how happy she was to arrive at the cave. She said. So she got to her destination of her last voyage\u2026? Luka said. She got to the bottom of the cave to her goal. The golden calamity box. She wrote that she was going to open the box that night\u2026 And that\u2019s when the letters stop. She said. What does it mean\u2026.?  It can\u2019t be a random accident on the sea. Luka said. You hear alice mutter something to herself. Anyway,,, So you think selene\u2019s ship sank the last letter came from? Luka said. It may not have sunk, and is still sitting there\u2026..It\u2019s worth going. Selene said. She folds the map up. You wanted the purple orb, right? It\u2019s mentioned it all in her letters. She always kept it in the captain\u2019s quarters, and enjoyed looking at its beauty. She said. So selene did have the orb\u2026 But what are you after, selena? It\u2019s not just to find your grandmother\u2019s grave\u2026.. Right? Luka said. The calamity box\u2026. I can\u2019t allow the contents to come out of that box. The dangers she set loose must be sealed back to the bottom of the sea again\u2026 She said. After saying that selena stands up. \u2026..That\u2019s it for the discussion. Do you understand what I\u2019m after? I already told you that I prepared the ship. I want you onboard as a bodyguard. As a reward, you\u2019ll get the purple orb. Assuming we get there safely. So\u2026 What do you say? You in? She said. \u2026..Of course I\u2019m in. Luka said. Alright then, Let\u2019s head to the port right now. Everything\u2019s already prepared, so we just need to set out. She said. Everything\u2019s all set? Luka said. I was going to set out after speaking with you. Even if you said no. She said. Oh\u2026. Luka said. You three follow her to the port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ship, you see all the sailors are young females. (it\u2019s more like a cruise ship.) he said. No issues here, Boss! One pirate said. Man, haven\u2019t seen a wind this good in a long time!This is lookin good for us! Another pirate said. It\u2019s been a long time since we last voyage. I hope your sense haven\u2019t dulled. Selena said. (Like mother, like granddaughter.) He said. Hehe surprised? I\u2019m the captain of this pirate ship. Selena said. I\u2026. See. Luka said. \u2026.We have a reason not to fight. So we\u2019ll leave all the fighting to you and your friend. She said. G\u2026 Got it. Luka said. The ship gets underway and sets sail.</span></div></div>",

I think this is all strange. You say. Strange how? Luka said. Selena said dangers from that calamity box. How else would she know about that? You say. Insight? Luka said. Oh please. Plus no reason for fighting. Look around luka. Do these girls literally need us as bodyguards? You say. No not really. They do look capable of fending for themselves. Luka said. I don\u2019t like going head first into a situation without all the facts. I have a hunch about selena, but I need more information before I prove it. You said. Are you always like this with people? Luka said. No. Just people I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never trusted people I don\u2019t know unless they\u2019ve been vouched for. Remember luka, never trust the first thing someone tells you until it\u2019s been proven. Otherwise you\u2019ll get yourself hurt. Or worse. You say. Luka pauses for a minute. Is\u2026.. Is that a song? Luka said. You hear a sweet singing voice drifting across the sea. Luka. Don\u2019t listen to that song. You say. This song\u2026.. A siren is coming. A pirate said. \u2026.Everyone, run into the ship. This is a job for luka, right? Selena said. Y\u2026 yes! Luka said. You and luka rush to the bow of the ship. You see the siren. There. You say. I thought this ship had nothing but woman\u2026 But then I spot two very high quality looking piece of meat\u2026 She said. Piece of meat? Do you want to be shark food?  Luka. You say. Yeah. Watch our step here. He said. I\u2019ll indulge in your semen\u2026. Get drunk on my voice, and soar in the pleasure. She said. You and luka attack together. Hehe. They\u2019re nice and soft\u2026. She said. She sandwiches luka\u2019s penis between her breast, but luka dodges. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. When he\u2019s done, you come through and hit her. My wings feel good, don\u2019t they? She said. She strokes luka\u2019s penis with her feathers. Luka! You say. Right! He said. You grab luka\u2019s sword and disappear and reappeared behind the siren and slash her from behind. How could a human\u2026!? She said. The siren turns into a seagull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think we might be the perfect team. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not like the sirens I fight. You say. You\u2019ve fought sirens before? Luka said. Well\u2026.Not the type you know of. You say. You\u2019re both pretty good. As expected of the hero I was waiting for. Selena said. Ah\u2026N\u2026.No\u2026. It wasn\u2019t much\u2026 Luka said. Don\u2019t get a big head luka. You say. It doesn\u2019t look like any more sirens are around. A pirate said. Alright then, continue on course to the west! Another said. The sail went on. No monsters attacked while the ship kept going, It will take a few days until the ship reached its destination. Luka spent the days relaxing, but you spent them pacing.  Finally we get there tomorrow. You say. You\u2019re on the deck with luka and alice, along with the cold sea breeze.  \u2026.I\u2019m all fidgety for some reason. Alice said. What\u2019s wrong? Are you cold? Luka said. She\u2019s probably not use to being on water. You say. Fidgety\u2026. Alice said. This might be difficult id selene\u2019s ship has sunk. We might have to go back and return with a salvage ship\u2026 Luka said. That won\u2019t be necessary. That ship is still floating on the sea. Selena  said. Selena appears on the deck all of a sudden. Didn\u2019t captain selene open the box 50 years ago? Nothing bad has happened yet. Luka said.  If that\u2019s true, it would be good\u2026. But\u2026.. You three should return to sleep soon. We\u2019ll finally be at selene\u2019s location tomorrow\u2026 Selena said. Saying that, she returns to her cabin. Frigidity\u2026. Alice said. I\u2019m worried about that girl. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoss, I see it! Selene\u2019s ship! A pirate said. Luka, can you wake up? Selena said. Ah\u2026.Uhhhhh. Luka said. You both hurry up to the deck. That\u2019s selene\u2019s ship? The hull of the ship is half rotted and there\u2019s a huge torn sail. Plus a strange fog all over. You and luka feel that this ship is eerie\u2026. Bring us to the side! Selena said. Aye sir! A pirate said. The pirates bring the boat to the side, and throw ropes to the abandon ship. It\u2019s dangerous, so we should only let a few board the ship. Luka, you\u2019re coming aren\u2019t you? Selena said. Of course! Alice\u2026. It\u2019s a ghost ship, you don\u2019t have to come. Luka said. W\u2026. Who\u2019s scare? This is nothing! I\u2019m coming! Slice said. Alice shouts that and timidly moves toward the ship. Your knees are shaking. You say. You al move towards the ghost ship. Is this a barrier? Alice said. A barrier? Luka said. It seems to be quite a powerful barrier against evil\u2026 Even now, it\u2019s still effective. Alice said. Meaning meant to keep people out. Or keep something in. You say. We got through it\u2026. Luka said. It seems to be designed not to keep evil out\u2026 But keep evil in.  This must be how it stayed lost for so long\u2026 Alice said. What do you mean? Who would put up this barrier? Luka said. Captain selene. Selena said. After opening up the calamity box and waking it up\u2026. Selene used a treasure she found by chance, the jewel of the rotten world. She used it to create a barrier to separate this ship from the outside world. She said. What do you mean? And how do you know what she did\u2026? Luka said. I told you. You mutter. \u2026.I\u2019ll tell you later. Selene said.  You and luka turn your heads for a moment and alice and selena are gone. Where\u2026. Did they go? You say.  I don\u2019t know, but we can\u2019t stay here. Let\u2019s go down below. Luka said. You both head down the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you both reach the bottom of the stairs, you hear a scream from the deck. Alice!? Luka said Alice speeds towards luka, crying. What\u2019s wrong? Luka said. Se\u2026se\u2026.se\u2026 Alice said. Alice hides behind luka, pressing her face against his back as her tail flies all over the place in terror. This is a sight\u2026. You say. Alice. Where is selena? Luka said. Sh\u2026.She\u2019s\u2026..That\u2026..That\u2026.! Alice said. I have no idea what you\u2019re saying. Did you leave her behind? Luka said. N\u2026.No\u2026.She\u2026.g\u2026.!! Alice said. \u2026..I\u2019m right here. Selena said. Selena slowly walks towards us as if nothing is wrong. What happened selena? Luka said. That young monster seems terrified. More importantly luka. The thing I\u2019m after is past this door. She said. Is there a monster in there. You only referred  to it as thing or that. Luka said. Yes\u2026. A legendary, horrible monster. It was all selene could do to sela it. But that was 50 years ago. The seal has lost its power,and is about to be broken again\u2026 We can\u2019t let it out. Luka\u2026 you must\u2026\u2026.She said before vanishing into thin air. I knew it. She was a ghost. You say. We can\u2019t leave it alone. Let\u2019s go alice. Luka said. Alice silently turns her head in side to side in horror. Luka takes her hand and you three open the door walk through. Three powerful looking monster are in here. They almost look like flies\u2026Oh\u2026. You\u2019re the little soldier that pirate brought. You seem quite delicious for a hero\u2026 Beelzebub 1 said. Hehe\u2026. But he\u2019s awfully cute. The face just makes me want to tease him\u2026 Beelzebub 2 said. In the end, humans are only tools for us to use lay eggs. Their only worth lies in the semen we can wring out. Beelzebub 3 said. Wh\u2026..Who the hell are you\u2026.? Luka said. The queens of flies. Alice said. Queens of flies? You say. There was agiant island in this area 1,000 of years ago. A race of fly type monsters lived there, known for being both incredibly powerful and incredible evil\u2026. Thus, Alipheese the first subdued them and sealed them in a box\u2026 The calamity boxt. The legend of how it must never be open seems  to have turned it into some sort of legendary treasure to be found. The sealed queen of flies. Beelzebub\u2026. The three standing right in front of us\u2026 Alice said. You\u2026. Seem to be a blood relative of the monster lord. How amusing\u2026. It seems like our time for revenge has come at last. Beelzebub 1 said. So all three of them are the Queen of the flies? \u2026..Alice step back. Luka said. \u2026.What are you talking about? Do you think these three will be any trouble for me? Alice said. But you\u2019re still shivering like crazy. Luka said. Aw how cute. Look at her, shrinking in fear just from the sight of us. Beelzebub1  said.  \u2026..It seems though the current monster lord is a coward. Taking control of the outside world might be easier than we thought. Beelzebub 3 said. You\u2019re wrong! Alice isn\u2019t afraid of you! Anyway Alice, I\u2019ll fight the! Luka said. G\u2026.. Got it I\u2019ll leave this in your hands. Alice said. Alice vanishes after saying that.  You\u2019re not going to make me sit on the sidelines also? You say. Heh. I thought that at first, but I think I might need a hand. Luka said. I take back my previous words. You seem to be quiet powerful\u2026 Beelzebub a said. That pirate girl gave us quite the present. A powerful boy like this will let us create a strong army of flies\u2026. Come here and make children with us, boy. Our army of daughters will take over the world\u2026 Beelzebud B said. We\u2019ll make this world into a paradise for flies. All we require is your semen. Beelzebud C said. No way! You both say. Oh my, how brave. We\u2019ll have to teach these boys that there only use is for reproduction.  Beelzebud A said. Really? Then come and try it! You say.</span></div></div>",

The beelzebud each suck on luka\u2019s penis, but like water, he dodges. I\u2019ll cut you down\u2026. Luka said. Luka sheaths his sword and rests his hand on the hilt. Drawing it in a fluid motion, he cuts down everything in his path. \u2026..Caught you. Beelzebud c said. She  grabs luka, but he dodges. You attack. Shall I have a taste of your semen? Beelzebud a said. I\u2019ll suck it hard. Beelzebud b said. Each of the beelzbud suck on luka\u2019s penis. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. Hehe\u2026. I\u2019ll hug you. Beelzebud b said. She grabs luka, but he evades her. Luka looks at you and nods. You grab his sword and disappear and reappear behind them and swing the sword as hard as you can. You reappear next to luka and toss him his sword. Now, come\u2026. Beelzebub a said. Dye our breast with your semen. Beelzebud c said. The beelzebud sandwich luka\u2019s penis between their multiple breast. You and luka attack together. Catch him\u2026. Beelzebud a said. She grabs luka. My breast feel amazing. Writh in pleasure.  Hehe\u2026. What a cute face. I\u2019ll enjoy watching it change. She said. Guh\u2026..! Damn you! Luka said. Luka struggles intensely and breaks free. What an interesting human. It looks like humans evolved a little. She said. Here I go! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. You attack. Now, come\u2026.. beelzebud a said. Dye our breast with your semen. The beelzebud sandwich you, but you dodge it. You and luka attack together. \u2026\u2026Got you. Beelzebud c said. She grabs you. Now, come on my breast. She said. You power your way free. Such strange power\u2026.. I want to suck out that power too. She said. Luka! You say. Right! He said. Luka jumps into the air, while you cut through beelzebud a. Luka comes down hard on her skull. H\u2026\u2026how could \u2026.. I thought they were weak. Beelzebud a said. She turns into a fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhhh, her carlessnes got her sealed Beelzebud b said. It seems they won\u2019t become ours quietly. We have no chose. We were initially trying to keep you alive. Beelzebud c said. Power begins to radiate from the beelzebud. (So they were holding back\u2026.) he said. (And so are we.) You say. You power up. Whoa\u2026. Seems like this is about to get serious. Luka said. As he shields his face. \u2026..Sheesh. How long are you two planning on playing with them? Alice said. A\u2026. Alice..?! Luka said. She suddenly moves next to luka. Standing by his side. Are you planning on fighting\u2026? I thought you said you were never going to help me\u2026. Luka said. Alipheese the first sealed these monsters herself. It\u2019s the role of the monster lord to keep them sealed! So I\u2019ll fight! But don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s your role to fight monsters too, luka! Alice said. G\u2026Got it! Luka said. Big words coming from someone who was just cowering in the corner. Beelzebud b said. The current monster lord seems to be a failure.  She\u2019ll be no match for us. Beelzebud c said. Take a look at the power of darkness! Power radiates from alice as she attacks the beelzebuds. Taste our might! Beelzebud c said. Your body will be smashed! Beelzebud b said. The collision of magical power hits alice. Tremble before the might of the monster lord! Alice said. Power radiates from alice as she attacks the beelzebuds. What is this power\u2026.? Beelzebud b said.  Beelzebud b was killed. No\u2026.. how is that cowering fool so powerful? Beelzebud c said. Aren\u2019t you the one who\u2019s cowering, you idiot? You\u2019re next! You\u2019ll see you friend in hell in a moment. Alice said. More like right now! You say. You pull out your knife and it glows purple and in a blink of an eye, you\u2019re already behind her. At first it looks like nothing happened, but a sharp light across her midsection flashes as she\u2019s cut in two. Is\u2026..Is this the power of a human and a monser lord\u2026.? She said. Beelzebud c was killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody is stronger than the monster lord. Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary monsters that were sealed in ancient time\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s true they were strong\u2026.. but they weren\u2019t nearly as powerful as the four heavenly knights. Luka said. Their true horror is in their reproductive ability. If they multiplied to 10,000 or 1,000,000 strong, they could easily overwhelm the world. Alice said. That would be bad\u2026. Luka said. Luka. I found the orb. You say. Really? He said. Yeah. Here. You say. You hand it to luka. Alright! We got what we came here for. Luka said. The beelzebud are gone now, too. They won\u2019t be able to harm the world now. Alice said. The three of you leave selene\u2019s ship.  Crossing back over to selena\u2019s ship, you both see her waiting for you both on the deck. But it isn\u2019t her alone. All of the pirates are waiting for you both. Thank you, hero luka. Thanks to you, those horrible abomination have been destroyed. Selena said.  Selena\u2026. Just what are you\u2026? Luka said. Luka, I told you a small lie\u2026 I\u2019m not captain selene\u2019s granddaughter\u2026. \u2026.. I am captain selene. She said. Eh\u2026.? But\u2026.captain selene\u2019s already\u2026\u2026 Luka said. They aren\u2019t actually alive luka. They\u2019re ghost. Like I told you. You say. I\u2026..No, we aren\u2019t living humans. As soon as we open that box fifty years ago, our lives were lost. But  having released the queen of flies, dooming the world\u2026 We were so full of regret, we were unable to move on to the next world. She said. I see\u2026. Luka said. But\u2026 Now we have no more regrets. Thank you luka. I wish you luck on your journey to come\u2026 She said. We can start out final journey without any regrets now, too\u2026  A pirate said. Thank you, hero. Another said.  Saying thanks, selene and her crew slowly vanish. So was this ship haunted this who time? You say.  I think so. It\u2019s I funny, alice? \u2026.Alice? Luka said. You both look back at alice. With her eyes frozen open, it seems like she has fainted while still standing up. And she\u2019s the monster lord? You ask. I guess all the previous monster lords had a weakness. Luka said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship sails back to gold port, almost like it was being controlled by an invisible power. Alright. Where to now? You say. I\u2019m concerned about sera. She was kidnapped this time for real. Let\u2019s go to sebasa castle. Hmph. That girl again? Whatever. Do what you want. Alice said. Let\u2019s go before sour puss here ruins everything. You say. You both head to sebasa with an angry alice. Thank you for coming, hero luka. I believe you have already heard, but sera has been kidnapped by monsters again. The king said. What happened? Luka said. It was a few days agao. She went outside to practice her swordsplay, and never came back.  According to her guards, it was like she vanish like smoke. Then after a while, this came. He said. The king holds out a letter. A letter? Luka said. Probably a ransom note. You say. No. it\u2019s not a ransom note. Apparently whoever has sera wants every human to leave for her safe return. Luka said. Alice suddenly snatches the letter and starts sniffing it. \u2026..it smells like elves. And a small hint of fairy. Whoever wrote this letter must be a high ranking monster, too. My guess\u2026\u2026 Queen class. Alice said. A queen elf\u2026.? Luka said. This just got interesting.  So what are you going to, king? She stated her terms. You say. \u2026.As the king, I cannot grant that request. Sabasa is our homeland. He said. But the princess\u2026.. Luka said. \u2026\u2026I am the king of this entire region. I can\u2019t force all of my citizens to suffer for the sake of my own family. He said. B\u2026..But\u2026! Luka said. Calm down, you idiot. Think about why you were called here. Alice said. \u2026..That right. Hero luka. I wish to ask for your assistance in rescuing my daughter. He said. Of course I\u2019ll help you. But\u2026..do you have any idea where she could be? Luka said. We have a lead based on our extensive intelligence gathering. There\u2019s a small island to the west of here called \u201cFairy island.\u201d It\u2019s an isolated island filled with elves and fairies\u2026 it seems sara was taken there. He said. Fairy island\u2026 Luka said. I\u2019ll arrange for a ship to land you on the island. He said. Well, at least we have transportation. You say. Yes, I\u2019m counting on you. He said. You and luka hurry out of the audience hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright then, I\u2019ll wait here until you came back. The captain said. This shouldn\u2019t take long. How dangerous can elves and fairies be? You say as you step off the ship. \u2026..I feel an enormous power coming from the center. Luka said. Then let\u2019s go. The quicker, the better. You say. You both venture deep within the forest.</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s make this interesting. You say. Interesting? Luka said. You jump down onto the ground. Yay. Whoever rescues sara first gets all the fame and glory with it. You say. Is this some sort of hidden lesson here? Luka said. No. Just a challenge to see if you can beat me. You say. So first rescue sara wins. And that person get all the recognition? Luka said. All of it. And the reward if the king gives one. You in? You say. You\u2019re on! Luka said.(Are you going to throw this as well?) He said. (No. I\u2019m going to see if he\u2019s opportunist.) you say. ( you know you could just ask) He said. (Then where\u2019s the fun in that?) You say. You both head deeper into the forest.  You both come to a clearing and the atmosphere is heavy. In the clearing you see two powerful monsters. One\u2019s an elf and the other a fairy. In a nerby tree, you spot sara. Luka, you came to save me!? Sara said. Wait a moment, sara. First, I need to deal with these two\u2026 Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I have not met you before\u2026 I am the queen elf, who will unite all elves of the world. She said. And I\u2019m the queen fairy, the most powerful fairy. Hehehe\u2026\u2026nice to meet you. The other said. Both queens\u2026.. Luka said. ( An elf and fairy. Elves don\u2019t fight and fairies are push over. When will there be a challenge? I have more fun pulling my teeth out.) he said. Why would you two kidnap the princess? Just what are you planning? Luka said. \u2026.Long ago, our brethren lived in the sabasa region. However when humans moved in, they stole our homeland. The queen elf said. We don\u2019t like fighting. So we continued to avoid fighting with the humans as they took more and more land. Until we were driven to this island. The queen fairy said. We were mistaken. But we realized our foolishness too late. Even if we disliked fighting, we should have protected our homeland! The queen elf said. Sabasa was ours to begin with. The time for us to reclaim it has come. The queen fairy said. So you took sara hostage, and are trying to make the king leave!? Luka said. That\u2019s not why we kidnapped her. That letter was just for us to have a little fun making him squirm. Our true purpose is to make sara into a monster. The queen elf said. Wh\u2026.What!? Luka said. Wait, what do you mean!? Sara said. Is that even possible? You say. With our power, it would be simple to turn a single human into a monster. We\u2019ll turn the king\u2019s only daughter into one of us\u2026 Then when the king dies, the inheritance will pass to her. After sara, we\u2019ll turn everyone in the castle into a monster, one by one. We\u2019ll reclaim our homeland without shedding a single drop of blood. She said. (That\u2019s boring. Where\u2019s the excitement in a fight without bloodshed?) He said. N\u2026. No way\u2026. Luka said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s true us humans were clearly in the wrong\u2026. But what you\u2019re trying to do is just insane! Why can\u2019t we settle this peacefully? There doesn\u2019t need to be any hostages taking or fighting\u2026.. If we just talked about it\u2026.. Sara said. Talk it over with humans? Those same humans who praise IIias and desire our destruction? Don\u2019t test my patience with foolish jokes. There\u2019s no way humans would ever deal with us fairly. The queen elf said. That\u2019s wrong! My father would definitely listen to monsters\u2026. Sara said. \u2026..Please, cease that foolish prattling. The queen fairy said. The queen fairy snaps her fingers, causing ivy around sara to grow and force itself into her mouth. (I could have been wrong about the fairies.) You thought. That\u2019s the end of this discussion. Princess, I\u2019m going to turn you into a monster now. Queen fairy, I leave these two humans heroes to you. The queen elf said. Of course\u2026. Sara has quite the potential in her. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing her when she\u2019s reborn. Queen fairy said. The queen fairy stands between you both and the queen elf. Step aside! I won\u2019t let you turn her into a monster! Luka said. Hehe, I won\u2019t let you disturb her. Sara will become one us\u2026. Queen fairy said. You notice the flowers and ivy on the nearby trees and plants start to grow. (She\u2019s controlling the plants? I didn\u2019t know fairies could.) You say. You\u2026.. Can control the plant? Luka said. All fairies are able to converse with plants. As the queen, I can even freely control them\u2026 I\u2019ll show you the anger of the forest! The sorrow of being isolated on a tiny island! She said. You attack. Here I go! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. These flowers are more than enough\u2026. She said. Responding to her voice, beautiful flowers sprout up all around luka\u2019s body. But he moves like the wind and dodges. You and luka attack together. The ivy shall overcome you. She said. Responding to her voice, ivy grows all around luka and caresses every inch of his body. Gnome, lend me your power\u2026.! Luka said. With the power of earth in him, luka comes down hard on the queen fairy\u2019s skull, shaking the earth itself as he lands. You attack. Deriving pleasure even from this\u2026.. Men are pathetic. She said. Responding to her voice, ivy grows around luka and stimulates him. You both attack together. I\u2019ll squeeze out all of your semen! She said. A huge rafflesia grows under luka, and binds his lower body. A different rafflesia sucks in his penis. That rafflesia has the power to suck out male semen. You semen will be sucked out and used to nourish the forest\u2026 She said. With Gnome\u2019s power\u2026.! Luka said. He struggles intensely and breaks free. How can a human use the power of earth\u2026.? She said. You attack. Give your semen to the forest. She said. Responding to her, a hole opens at the end of a giant branch of ivy. You grab your knife, dodge and slice through the ivy branch. This is getting dull. Luka! You say. Right! He said. Luka jumps up high in the air. You slice through the queen fairy and luka comes down hard on her skull. How\u2026.. could I lose\u2026.? She said. The queen fairy turns into a butterfly.<br>\r\nThat\u2019s one queen down\u2026. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, I  defeated her!. Luka said. Impossible\u2026. The queen fairy fell to humans? The princess hasn\u2019t been turned into a monster yet\u2026 But I have no choice. The queen elf said. She moves away from sara and moves closer to you both. Then I\u2019ll be your opponent. I dislike violence\u2026. But I have no choice. She said. Won\u2019t you just stop this already? Even you know this is a huge mistake, right? Luka said. Yes\u2026 This method is a mistake We\u2019re repeating the same mistake you humans made long ago. But\u2026.. we are monster, you are humans. We\u2019re destined to fight and hate each other. She said. \u2026.No.  I know that\u2019s wrong for sure. I don\u2019t deny that we humans were wrong. I don\u2019t deny the pain you went through\u2026. But I\u2019ll never accept that! Humans and monsters aren\u2019t fated to always hate each other! Luka said. We never attested to understand humans. And you never attempted to understand us. But it\u2019s too far past the point of discussing things with each other. She said. But we don\u2019t have to fight! Luka said. I don\u2019t intend to waste time in a pointless argument. We never intended to compromise with humans anymore. She said. (She hates humans too much to be reasoned with.) You thought. I\u2019ll show you both the anger we harbor for you invading humans. I\u2019ll humiliate and degrade you, strip away all dignity you had as a human. Prepare yourself, humans. I\u2019m going to take everything from you both. She said. That doesn\u2019t sound good\u2026.. You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both attack together. You\u2019ll melt in my mouth. She said. She sucks on luka\u2019s penis like it was a piece of candy. You throw your knife at her and disappear. It fazes right through her and you reappear behind her. She looks over herself and not a scratch on her. Then a bright flash cuts through her. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. Can you endure this? She said. She grabs luka\u2019s penis and slowly strokes it. Luka jumps into the air and crash down on her skull, shaking the earth as he lands. Drown in my chest. She said. She sandwiches luka\u2019s penis between her breasts. You and luka attack together. No man can last more than a second between my breast. She said. She sandwich luka\u2019s penis. Here I go! Luka said His sword flashes like a frenzied star. You attack. Shall I turn you into my puppet? She said. The queen elf eyes flash. You\u2019re eyes turn optical, keeping you safe. Ugh\u2026.. What? Luka said. You can\u2019t ignore my orders any more. There\u2019s only one thing left for a boy like you. She said. She starts fingering herself. You\u2019re going to put your penis in here.  I\u2019ll slowly suck out all of your energy. The succubus skill, energy drain. Since I\u2019m the queen elf, using a skill like that will be easy\u2026 She said. When she said succubus, everything for you dot serious.  N\u2026. No way. Luka said. Now, force yourself into me. She said. Y\u2026 yes\u2026. Ahh\u2026 He said. Luka! Don\u2019t do it! You say. Luka slowly walks towards her. Ahhh\u2026\u2026 No\u2026. Must\u2026\u2026not do it\u2026..! he said. You aren\u2019t allow to defy me. Now, put it in. She said. (Only one thing to do.) You thought. You focus. Luka. Stop! You say. Luka stops dead in his tracks. Huh? He said. Impossible\u2026\u2026. Obey me human! She said. I won\u2019t let you! You say. Luka turn around. You say. Luka slowly turns around. How are you doing this!? She said. Does it matter? I\u2019m not letting you rape him! You say. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re doing it\u2026\u2026 But my will won\u2019t be denied! She said. Luka starts walking towards her. H\u2026. Help me! Luka said. </span></div></div>",

He said. Your eyes turn red. You look at luka then the elf queen. Submit. You say. Ugh\u2026. Y\u2026.yes. She said. Both luka and the elf queen surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody can ever match me. Nobody. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou return to normal. Luka. You say. Ow\u2026.. My head feels like it was used for a drum. Did we beat her? Luka said. Yeah. You say.  The elf queen is on her knees and she looks like she\u2019s no going to fight anymore. Why aren\u2019t you even willing to try to discussing with humans? Luka said. \u2026..How can we discuss anything with barbarians!? She said. Are you at least willing to try? You think all humans are stupid and can\u2019t understand you? You say. Do you think humans can ever understand our pain!? She said. If you look down on them and treat them as weak, inferior beings\u2026 You\u2019ll never be able to understand them. It\u2019s true what happened to you is horrible\u2026.. But there has to be another way than this. It\u2019s come to this because you were unwilling to look at humans as equals. You need to discuss this as equals and come to agreement\u2026 Luka said. Why would they even accep our negotiation!? We\u2019re just monsters to be destroyed, right!? That\u2019s what your precious llias order! She said. No! I want humans and monsters to live in peace! Luka said. Silence! In the end, you\u2019re just another barbaric human thrusting your view by force! She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation\u2019s cut short by a loud nioise. Then it goes quiet, bring an eerie feeling along too. Wh\u2026. What is it!? More of them? Luka said. What is this!? Did you do something to the island!? The queen elf said.  You look around, until you sniff the air. *sniff* *sniff* That smell\u2026.. Where is it coming from? You say. Luka and queen elf look at sara, still tried in the tree. I thought I stop the ritual! Luka said. This\u2026. This isn\u2019t possible\u2026. That power\u2026 It\u2019s the same as a queen class monster\u2026 How can a human who just became a monster be this powerful!?  It must be\u2026. Blood from a powerful monster already flowing through her veins. I woke it up\u2026Queen elf said.  Sphinx\u2026. Sara is descended from spinx\u2026 Luka said. The smell gets stronger. It\u2019s sara! You say. You see her body change in front of all of you. Ah\u2026\u2026 What happened to me? I feel so\u2026\u2026weird. Power coursing through me. I feel \u2026..strong\u2026 But I feel so thirsty\u2026. I so hungry. She said. She looks around until she spots luka and you. Ah\u2026 it\u2019s luka\u2026 You look so\u2026.. so delicious. I want to eat\u2026. Hey\u2026 Luka\u2026. I want to eat your energy so badly\u2026 Sara said. Guh\u2026.! Luka said. (That must be powerful monster blood in her veins to turn her into a queen class succubus.) He said. Get away, queen elf! You\u2019re too tired to protect yourself! Luka said. Why are you protecting me\u2026? I\u2019m a monster, an enemy to humans. She said. I believe a time will come when humans and monsters understand each other and live in peace. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll always fight to protect humans and monsters both! Luka said. Luka takes out his sword. Aha\u2026. Luka\u2026. Are you going to fight me\u2026? That\u2019s good\u2026\u2026.I\u2026..I want to mess you up. I\u2026.. I want to rape you\u2026 .Violate you\u2026.. suck out your semen\u2026 My  pussy is aching\u2026. I want your semen so bad luka\u2026. Sara said. Your eyes turn optical. I know how you feel about succubus, but remember, this is sara. We need to seal her power, not kill her. Luka said. I\u2019ll try to keep my power in check. But if push comes to shove, I won\u2019t hold back. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and luka attack together. I\u2026..i want to tease your penis. Sara said. She grabs hold of luka\u2019s penis and strokes him. But luka dodges. You attack her. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. i\u2026.i want to feel luka\u2019s semen on my chest. Sara said. She squeezes her breast hoard on luka\u2019s penis. You hit her in the stomach, then luka comes down hard on sara\u2019s skull. You\u2019re energy\u2026\u2026It\u2019s tremendous\u2026.. I\u2019ll suck you dry. She said.  Sara pushes you to the ground and is on top of you. I\u2019m going to swallow your penis with my pussy. She said. Get off me!! You say.  You punch her off you. So rough\u2026.. She said. You start to build up the power, but remember what luka said. You attack her. Luka attacks also. Do you like my tail? She said. Her tail shoots towards luka and violently sucks on his penis. Dodge this! Luka said. Luka steps forward like thunder and stabs his sword like lightning. Aha\u2026. What am I doing? Sara said. The magical power in sara fades, turning her back to a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara! Are you ok? Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check her. She\u2019s alive. Unconscious, but alive. You say. Luka turns back to the queen elf. \u2026..I see. You wield your sword for monsters and humans to coexist in peace. That sincere feeling of yours\u2026.. it certainly reached me\u2026  But\u2026. Does your human goddess recognize it? Will Ilias ever allow monsters and humans to coexist? She said. W\u2026well\u2026. Luka said. You yourself already realize that she won\u2019t. Even though you know that, you ignore that fact and still go on. She said. Just because some said it\u2019s impossible, doesn\u2019t mean you have to listen. You say.  \u2026\u2026.Doesn\u2019t that mean you also betrayed the monster lord? You think she\u2019d allow you to take a human hostage? Luka said. \u2026\u2026then it seems we are both betraying our leaders. But\u2026. The monster lord doesn\u2019t understand our pain. That foolish way of pacifism only leads to hardship. She said. And you think kidnapping and turning everybody into a monster is a better way? You say. \u2026.I get it. You don\u2019t understand anything. Luka said. What do you mean I don\u2019t understand anything? She said. You don\u2019t  know anything about the monster lord. You\u2019re happy being the victim. You\u2019re using that as an excuse  for all your actions and blame other for them! You\u2019re not even trying to understand either humans or the monster lord! You\u2019re using them both as objects to hate and blame your problems on! Luka said. Quiet! She said. The elf queen pulls out a dagger and hold it to sara\u2019s throat.  If you continue this impudence, I\u2019ll end this girl\u2019s life. She said. C\u2026Coward\u2026 Luka said. We can\u2019t run anymore. Our only chance is to take sabasa! She said. \u2026.Stop it already! The monster lord does want you to do this! Luka said. If the  monster lord is unable to understand our pain and sorrow\u2026. The they don\u2019t deserve to be our leader! She said. Treason. You say. As she says that, the earth shakes underneath you all. Again!? What now!? Luka said. Luka, this pressure\u2026. You say. I know. He said. Queen of eleves\u2026\u2026 Should I take that statement as a decleration of rebellion? A voice said. Y\u2026 You\u2026 Luka said. \u2026.No matter the reason, I won\u2019t allow anyone rebel against the monster lord. Granberia said.  Granberia? Luka said. (Lap dog.) he said. It can\u2019t be\u2026. A heavenly knight\u2026 Queen elf said. She drops her knife and edges away. Why are you here? You say. Just a coincidence. I did not come her for the both you. I heard that the queen elf and fairy were meeting together, so I came to take a look. Disgraceful. Taking a human hostage. And now that I\u2019ve heard of your intent to rebel, I can\u2019t stay silent any longer. She said. N\u2026.No!  I was just\u2026. Silence\u2026. Prepare yourself. Granberia interrupts. Granberia takes a swing at the queen elf. \u2026.Stop! Sara said. Right before her sword hits the queen elf, sara jumps in front of her. Granberia\u2019s sword stops mid swing, inches from sara\u2019s face. \u2026.Daughter of the human royal family. Why do you protect her? This is the monster who was about to kill you. Granberia. You\u2019re both subjects of the monster lord, right? The monster lord doesn\u2019t want her subordinates killing each other\u2026 I think\u2026. Sara said. \u2026..that\u2019s true. This would make the monster lord depressed. Maybe I was a little quick to force. Granberia said. She puts her sword away. Queen of the elves\u2026.. Let me make sure of this. Are you planning on rebelling against the  monster lord? Granberia said. \u2026. I never had intention of treason against her. I was just despairing  over her inability to understand our pain. \u2026That\u2019s all. She said. Understood\u2026 Then I acknowledge you weren\u2019t planning to commit treason. But I\u2019ll say this\u2026\u2026 the monster lord understands your pain well. And she\u2019s working to lighten that pain. Granberia said. It\u2019s we humans who didn\u2019t understand your pain\u2026 But we never intended to abuse you. I\u2019m sure my father feels the same way\u2026 if you would just sit down and talk with us, I\u2019m sure we can find a solution. I\u2019ll help in any way I can. Sara said. \u2026..that\u2019s right, Humans made mistakes, but they aren\u2019t as stupid you seem to believe. If both sides put away their weapons and talk, something can be achieved.  But first, you have to be willing to understand humans\u2026 I\u2019ll work on getting humans to understand monsters better. Luka said. \u2026..I\u2019m still not agreeing with anything. But if you\u2019re willing to go all the way. It may be worth waiting a while longer. And if the monster lord hasn\u2019t abandon us\u2026Then we shall believe it will work. She said.  Thanks you for believing in us. Luka said. \u2026..I don\u2019t know abouth the future, but we shall wait for now. Neither fairies nor eleven will attack humans. I was saved from death by this human princess. I cannot repay that favor by harming other humans. She said. (So are we done here?) he said.( I think so.) You said. Then please watch and wait\u2026 We won\u2019t disappoint. Luka said. Yes, I\u2019ll help too. I\u2019m sure the people of sabasa will understand, too! Sara said. I will believe\u2026.. And wait. For humans to accept us. Until that day comes, I shall attempt to understand humans better. The queen elf said. You getting this from the queen elf? Luka said. What? You say. Something about a black alice. Luka said. \u2026..I\u2019ve troubled you three for quite a lot. I\u2019d love to meet the three of you again, when humans and monsters are living in peace. The queen elf said. Saying that, the queen elf vanish.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But there have been too many rebels lately. To make matters worse, that\u201dBlack Alice\u201d Is pulling strings behind the scene. Granberia said. Who\u2019s this black alice? Luka said. As you know, Alipheese is taking steps towards achieving peace with humans. But there are many monster who are unhappy with this. There\u2019s a rumor going that one in particular is calling out to others, gathering allies. Her name\u2019s Black Alice. I don\u2019t know what kind of monster she is, but she\u2019s incredibly arrogant. Only the monster lord is able to assume the name \u201cAlice.\u201d She said. So there\u2019s a monster doing that? I forgot to thank you. \u2026..Thanks Granberia. Luka said. Hmph\u2026. I had no intention of helping you. I just couldn\u2019t stand to see a monster taking a human hostage. But\u2026.. Maybe I did meddle too much. She said. Granberia\u2026. You\u2019ve changed. Luka said. I changed? I should say the same too you, luka. She said. I have? Luka said. \u2026\u2026I still wish to cross swords with you. Not as a monster and human, but as fellow warriors. Both giving it everything we have\u2026.. I\u2019ll be waiting, in the monster lord castle! And I better see you there too. We still have matters to settle! She said. I\u2019ll be there. I\u2019d love to see how far you came in your swords play. You say. Then she vanishes. She really wants to cross swords with you. You say. And I saw a fire in her eyes when she was talking with you. Luka said. Yeah. I have that effect on people. I\u2019m heading back to the ship, you can stay here if you want. You say. Hey wait up. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in sabasa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait outside the castle. So did you tell the king what sara decided to do? You say. Yeah. I told him that sara chased after Granberia of her own free will. Luka said. Well, you did tell me she was into her. You say. Yeah, she is. Luka said. I went and found alice, told her everything. She said the only thing she could have done was to make her ideal true. She\u2019ll even lend you a hand in it. You say. You sure this is the same alice? Luka said. yes. You say. Wow. So alice giving me a hand. Ehehe\u2026.. hahahaha! Luka said. Ok, you\u2019re laugh is borderline madman. You say. Sorry. It\u2019s just really nice that lice is starting to help out more. Luka said. Yeah. So where to now? You say. Let\u2019s get to that shrine. We have all the orbs. Luka said. You, luka, and alice head to the shrine with the six orbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou three come across a small shrine. Just walk right in\u2026? No guards or anything? Luka said. Well, have one orb guarded by the kraken and another by her twin. Do you really think someone would get those two orbs? You say. No. But there isn\u2019t an egg. Luka said. Nonono\u2026. There aren\u2019t any guards, but there is an egg! Where did it go!? Alice said. Alice searches frantically for the egg. Did it already hatch? You say. No, that can\u2019t be\u2026. It will never hatch without the six orbs\u2026  Alice said. Then where\u2026..hmmm? Luka said. You jump into the bushes. A few seconds and after a few punches are heard, you toss the person out of the bushes. A human? Luka said. The guy you knock out lands barley conscious at luka. The egg is not here. This creep and his goons hauled the egg back to their HQ. You say. How\u2019d you figure that out? I didn\u2019t even hear any talking. Luka said. Hey. Alice isn\u2019t the only one with special eyes in this group. You say. Man, If they break the egg\u2026. Luka said. Don\u2019t worry. Humans can\u2019t break the egg. Alice said. Well, that\u2019s reassuring.  Anyway, we need that egg. Luka said. Are you going to Illias kreuz HQ for the egg? Alice said. We came all this way for it. You say. Yeah. We need that egg. Luka said. \u2026\u2026I feel nervous about you going there. How about I go instead? Alice said. What do you think\u2019s going to happen? They\u2019re just hooligans. Luka said. \u2026..you\u2019re not acting lik you usually do. That\u2019s what makes me uneasy. I doubt those guys have actually killed at least one real monster. You say. \u2026.Don\u2019t worry. My father is my father. This isn\u2019t about him. Luka said. If you say so\u2026. Alice said. Her sad face doesn\u2019t brighten up. Leaving the shrine, the three of you head for Illias kreuz HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making your way to the HQ, you see two guards. You knock out the guards. Go on, you two handle Lazarus. I\u2019ll stay here and look out for more of them. You say. Ok, I guess\u2026\u2026 Come on alice. Luka said. Luka and alice enter the HQ. After waiting a long time, you see alice pulling luka by the hand out of the headquarters. That can't be good. You say. You follow them to the top of a hill overlooking gold port. </span></div></div>",

Wasn\u2019t he your fathers best friend? You say. Yeah. When I heard it, I was inches away from killing him. \u2026\u2026.I wonder if humans and monster ever can understand each other? Luka said. \u2026..What\u2019s wrong? That\u2019s a strange remark coming from you. Alice said. We both couldn\u2019t put aside our differences\u2026 It even got to a point where I wanted to kill him. If fellow humans are able to get to that point, then humans and monsters\u2026. Luka said depressed. \u2026\u2026You both know how I followed my mother\u2019s last wish and became a hero and how the village hated me. I swallowed my feeling and became a hero.I believe in coexistence and set out on this adventure\u2026. All just to atone for my father did. I didn\u2019t even know what the hell coexistence really was. They were just empty words\u2026 I wasn\u2019t thinking seriously about anything. Damnit. It\u2019s just like you said alice. I was only fooling myself, and masking my true self\u2026.  Now that the mask is off\u2026..  Luka said. \u2026..No, your mask hasn\u2019t come off yet. Luka, you are a true hero. Alice said. Eh\u2026.? Luka said. It\u2019s true you\u2019re an idiot, na\u00efve, and you rush into things without thinking them through\u2026 You\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes swinging that sword of yours around, too. \u2026\u2026But what have you been doing up until now? It hasn\u2019t been due to anger or despair like you\u2019re feeling right now. It hasn\u2019t been some \u2018mask\u201d you wore over your true feelings. Those actions all came from your heart\u2026 You\u2019re true self. Alice said. That\u2019s\u2026.. Luka said. You never allowed anyone to terrorize someone else.Every time you came across someone acting cruel, you got angry and rushed in. You can\u2019t stand seeing weak people bullied or persecuted\u2026. Because you were persecuted yourself. That\u2019s you\u2019re true self that has influenced everything you\u2019ve done until now. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone in the world with a more hero-like motive than you. Alice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so\u2026.. If I had killed Lazarus\u2026.. Luka said. \u2026..Even if I didn\u2019t stop you, you\u2019d stop yourself before it was too late. Alice said. Alice sits down next to luka. Even if you couldn\u2019t understand lazrus\u2026. You and I understand each other. Or am I imagining this. Alice said. Alice\u2026 Luka said. Just because humans can\u2019t always reach each other, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible for humans to reach monsters. There will be humans  who won\u2019t get along. There will be monster who won\u2019t get along. It isn\u2019t a simple story with a sudden ending.You\u2019ll have to think about how it will start and continue on. I understand you, a human. But lazarus, another huma, can\u2019t. Then how about monsters? The four heavenly knights and I know each other. But among the rest us, there are many who don\u2019t understand me or my action. Just like lazarus and you. It\u2019s the difference in the way of thinking. But just because the races are different, doesn\u2019t mean everything is different. Alice said. So\u2026.. Is coexistence  just an illusion? Luka said. Even if it\u2019s an illusion, it\u2019s important to try. Alice said. I see\u2026. That\u2019s right. Something changed in him. But knowing that he wasn\u2019t another death in the cycle between man and monster. I\u2019ll inherit his dying wish!  I\u2019ll take pride in his belief and push myself forward! Luka said. \u2026..Whew, that\u2019s the luka I know. You aren\u2019t suited  for sulking and depression. Alice said. Hehe, thanks\u2026 hey, alice\u2026. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlipheese the 15th\u2026 My mother was looking for peace. She became more and more anxious as the strife became worse. In the end, she decided to end the fighting with her own life. Alice said. She thought her death would end all the fighting? You say. Yes. Then appearing before her was a hero. That was your father, with Lazarus and their friends. Alice said. My father made it to the monster lord\u2019s castle\u2026? Luka said. At that time, my mother put me in a jail. It was a strong prison, augmented with sealing magic. As my mother was dying\u2026. It seems as though she told your father her intentions. With her sacrifice, she wanted peace\u2026. According to lazarus, it seems like it shifted their hearts after learning why she did it\u2026 But\u2026.. I broke the seal holding me, and rushed to my mother\u2019s side. She must have miscalculated my magical power\u2026 When I saw her lifeless body, I couldn\u2019t contain myself. When I pulled myself back together\u2026. There were two more corpse in front of me. I took two lives\u2026 Right after my mother sacrificed  herself for peace, I trampled on everything she wished for. Alice said. That\u2019s not it\u2026. You didn\u2019t know what you were doing at that time, right? If you apologize to Lazarus\u2026 Luka said. \u2026..Apologize for killing his friends right in front of him!? Do you think he would even accept that!? Do you think  I could take away all his pain and hatred with some simple words!? An apology would just make him suffer and get even angrier! In the end I killed his friends! There is no way of apologize for that.The only thing I can do is keep acting like the cold monster lord so he can keep hating me! She said venting her anger. Then she calms down after a few seconds. Always\u2026. I\u2019ve always regretted what I did If I never did that\u2026. My mother\u2019s ideal might already have come true\u2026 Alice said. \u2026.It wasn\u2019t your fault alice. It was a horrible accident. Luka said. That\u2019s why\u2026. I\u2019ll atone. For destroying my mother\u2019s wish. Alice said. It isn\u2019t atonement\u2026. You\u2019re inheriting her will. Negative thinking like that will get you killed, so that way of thinking is better. Didn\u2019t you tell me something like that before, Alice? Luka said. My\u2026. My mother\u2019s will\u2026. Luka said. I want a world where humans and monsters can coexist together\u2026. I\u2019m following that will of my dead father\u2026.. And my own wish. Alice\u2026. You\u2019re following the wish of your mother, too. Let\u2019s do our best together, and continue on! Luka said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdiot\u2026 Don\u2019t group me together with you. You\u2026.. you idiot\u2026. Alice said. Alice closes her eyes and gently buries her head in luka\u2019s chest. But only for a moment. She quickly snaps back up and goes back to her usual look.  Hmph\u2026. The monster lord can\u2019t be cheered up by a hero. Don\u2019t get the wrong idea, you idiot. Alice said. Same here\u2026.. I can\u2019t be a hero who was cheered up by the monster lord! Luka said. It seems everything is all better now. You say. Alice, why did you decide to travel around the world? Luka said. I wanted to believe in my mother\u2019s dream, but I didn\u2019t think it was possible. The fighting was getting heated, and the slightest spark could set things off. If humans ever attack us, I would have to confront them.  It wouldn\u2019t be small fights, it would be all out war.  I wanted to see the world before that happens. Alice said. So what were you looking for? The good in humans? You say. No, the opposite. Humans are dirty creature that should be oppressed\u2026. They\u2019re evil, so they have to be destroyed\u2026. I was looking for a reason to believe that\u2026. But it seems like I found the opposite\u2026 Even though Illias kruez is in the world, there are people who want to accept monsters. That just may make it possible for us to coexist in peace\u2026 Alice said. It\u2019s possible. You say. It can be done. Luka said. I believe in you.  But\u2026\u2026you\u2019re going to the monster lord\u2019s castle now. Do you realize how dangerous it will be? Alice said. Yeah\u2026. It won\u2019t be easy. Luka said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour journey may end at any point. But you\u2019re still a virgin, aren\u2019t you? It\u2019s too pitiful to die without ever knowing the taste of a woman\u2026 So I\u2019ll teach you the pleasure of a woman. Alice said. N\u2026 No! I can\u2019t break the prohibition! Luka said. Sheesh\u2026. Then how about this form? If I\u2019m in a human form, then you\u2019re not having sex with a monster, right? Alice said. You\u2019re just splitting hairs. Luka said. You should know the taste of a woman if you want to grow stronger. The monsters on the dangerous continent know many powerful sex techniques. Just think of this as training. She said. W\u2026 we can\u2019t\u2026. Ahhh. Luka said.</span></div></div>",

You head back to Illias kruez HQ. You place all the orbs in postion and wait until luka and alice are done. You wait until tomorrow morning. About time you two showed up. I thought you went for round two. I already put the orbs in place. You say. Wow. They\u2019re bright. What\u2019s next. Luka said. Next, is  the hatching ritual. Two need to do the incantation. Ah. Alice said. Slice suddenly stiffs up. What? Luka said. The ceremony requires magical power from two monsters\u2026 Alice said. Why didn\u2019t you mention that earlier? Luka said. I forgot all about that part. I can do one half, but the other half\u2026\u2026 Alice said. Won\u2019t we have to find a nerby monster? Luka said. No need, I\u2019ll do it. You say. You? Alice said. I\u2019m  stronger than any monster. Hell I might as well be classified as one. And we don\u2019t want to waste time, do we? You say. You are strong enough\u2026\u2026but the ritual consumes a huge amount of energy.  Alice said. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be fine. You say. Face toward the egg and repeat my words. Alice said. \u2026\u2026Listen, child of the holy bird who has yet to hatch in this world. \u2026..One who\u2019s wings are free to soar over the sky\u2026. You both said. Energy begins to fill the room.  Now awake, Garuda! You both said. As you both shout towards the egg, a crack appears from the egg, shooting forth dazzling light. As the light fades, a giant monster is in the center of the room. Wah! It\u2019s huge! Luka said. Hmm, it looks like she hatched without any trouble. She also sees us as her parents, so she\u2019ll do anything we say. Alice said. She\u2019s cute in a way. By the way, you said it would consume an enormous amount of energy? Are you both alright? Luka said. Hmph, that wasn\u2019t anything? Alice said. That wasn\u2019t even a handful of my energy. You say. Alright. Let\u2019s go. Luka said. Galda cries out and extends her wings. Alright, I\u2019m getting on. Alice said. Alice gently jumps on Galda\u2019s back. You jump on her back too. Come on luka. You say. Is this safe? Can\u2019t we get thrown off.? Luka said. Relax. Alice said she was a legendary bird. You say. galda, take me to hellgondo. Alice said. You and luka grab hold of galda as she flies into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey luka! I see your house from here! You say. Hey, how far is the north continent? You say. From gold port\u2026. About an hour. Alice said. Anybody got cards for the trip? You say. After a while, luka asks you a question. Hey. He said. What? You say. I was wondering\u2026\u2026 You heard all about me and alice and our parents\u2026\u2026 but what about you? Luka said. My parents\u2026.? You say. Yeah. Luka said. You hesitate then answer.  I never met them. You say. You never met your parents? Luka said. No. But when I ask my father close friend, he gave me the answer to way happen. He said. What happen? Luka said. \u2026\u2026 I tell you when we\u2019re on the ground. You say. Then  you see the continent. Hey, I think we\u2019re here. You say. Galda. Land. Alice said.Kwah! Galda said. She lands on the ground. You jump off galda. This is heelgondo? You say. Ahh\u2026.. My birthplace\u2026. Alice said. Then galda takes off. Where are we? You say. The southern tip of the continent. If we head straight north, we\u2019ll reach the monster lord\u2019s castle in a few days. But there\u2019s a place I want to go before that. Alice said. Where? Luka said. \u2026.Remina. Alice said. Remina? Luka said. Something happened there\u2026. I want to see for myself. Alice said. There\u2019s also a place here on the map called sealed sinners prison. Alice, do you have a prison for monster? Luka said. I\u2019m not positive,but\u2026\u2026 Humans who commited serious crimes in the past had their souls sealed there by Illias. It\u2019s said she put them there to make sure their souls would never no peace. Alice said. To make sure they never had peace\u2026..? Just what did they do? Luka said. What is the worst out of the 5 commandments? You say. You don\u2019t think they would raise their swords against Illias? Luka said. It\u2019s the worse crime you could do to a goddess. You say. Mind if we stop by? Luka said. What have we come all this way for, you idiot? Are you really going to make a side trip just to satisfy your own curiosity? Alice said. It\u2019s more important than just curiosity\u2026. I almost feel like I have to go. Luka said. Ok, we\u2019re to first? You say. Let\u2019s head to remina. Luka said. You three head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter trekking the long way, you see ruins, toppled building and a pile of bones. This place looks ancient. You say. You walk into town. You look at a bone. Long bone. Lamia. You say. That proves it. Monsters were killed here. You say. Luka. Something\u2019s here. Alice said. I feel it too. Luka said. Then a strange creature jumps out a ruin. A chimera! You say.  It looks like a collection of random creature. Luka said. \u2026..I don\u2019t recognize this monster. Alice said. Human\u2026.. Monster\u2026.. Eliminate. It said. A giant claw shoots past your head. This thing is strong. Alice said. There\u2019s more of them. Luka said. Hundreds of them. They\u2019re swarming us. Luka said. This isn\u2019t the time to lose focus. Alice said. She punches one. Carried forward by the momentum, the two of them break through a nearby  building. Luka looks for you and sees you killing one with ease. Damn. Luka said. You grab one chimaera by the horns and throw her to the ground and then slice her guts open. You punch another, stunning it. You jump sideways and cut off her tail. Then jump on her back and cut her head off. You violently kill 4 more until you see no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody can kill like me. You say.<br>\r\nYou hear more fighting. You race towards the noise and find 4 lifeless corpses. Then a chimera flies towards you. Then you feel an ominous presence. Luka! You say. You race towards luka\u2019s postion. You find him and see another one of those plant things. Like from the forest of spirits. Rrgh. You say You build up lightning in your hand. Luka sees you\u2019re behind her and she hasn\u2019t notice. The lightning turns black and you rush towards her. Luka steps in like thunder and stabs the chimera dryan. You both hit right through her, crossing each other. The chimera dryan dissipates into particles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre there no end to them? Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere\u2019s alice? Luka said. I thought I was following her. You say. Then alice appears in front of you both. Covered in blood from head to tail. Wah! You\u2019re covered in blood. Both of you are. Luka said. It\u2019s there blood. They couldn\u2019t touch me. Alice said. They were nothing. You say. Just what\u2019s going on here. Those strange monsters and the woman. Luka said. That feather\u2026. Alice said. She snatches away the feather. I found it. I wonder if it came from a harpy. Luka said. No, that wouldn\u2019t have last for thirty years. This radiance won\u2019t fade for a century\u2026.. It\u2019s an Angel feather. She said. An Angel!? Why would that be here? Luka said. There\u2019s no reason to hang around here much longer. More of those strange creature are likely to show up\u2026.. Let\u2019s leave. Alice said. But\u2026.. I still haven\u2019t figured this out yet. Luka said. Figure it out later when we\u2019re not standing in the middle of warzone. You say. You won\u2019t figure out anything by standing here. Unless you want to fight more of those strange creatures. Alice said. Well\u2026 Did you figure something out? Luka said. \u2026..It doesn\u2019t concern you. Alice said. What\u2019s with that? Luka said. You came this far for peace, right? Alice said. Yes\u2026 Luka said. Then only focus on human coexistence with monsters in the future. This town was destroyed decades ago. It doesn\u2019t concern you right now. Alice said. (Angel feather, lamia bone, weird monsters showing up. There\u2019s a conspiracy in the works.) you thought. \u2026.You\u2019re a hero, right? Then you shouldn\u2019t know. No\u2026. You don\u2019t need to know. Alice said. \u2026..I\u2019m not a hero. I\u2019m a fake, unbaptized one. Luka said. I agree with alice. If she wanted us to know, she\u2019d told us. We need to go. Now. You say. You three leave Remina with more doubts than before.</span></div></div>",

But not even monsters visit there. Just what about it is making you so interested? Alice said. I don\u2019t even know myself. Luka said. Sheesh. Even after making it all the way here, you\u2019re still going on stupid side quests. Alice said. You both head towards the sealed sinners prison. You feel a powerful presence. Luka. You say. I know. Luka said. You both get ready. You see it\u2019s a behemoth. What are humans doing here? Ah, did ya come here just to be fucked by me by any chance? She said. A\u2026. A behemoth!? Luka said. This place is dangerous. You say. That\u2019s some great timing ya got there. I was just getting into my breeding phase, and it looks like both of ya could have some good sperm\u2026 She said. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. You attack. How about I crush that penis of yours between my breast? She said. She squeezes luka\u2019s penis between her breast. Luka attacks. Dodge this! You say. Your knife radiates purple and you cut down everything in your path. I\u2019ll suck your cock!  She said. She uses her mouth to pump luka\u2019s penis like a piston. Infuse my sword with the flames of hell itself! Luka said. Licks of flames run up and down luka\u2019s sword. Whoa. You say. Here I go1 Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. How can humans have such power!? She said. The behemoth is sealed between a mix of a lion and a rhino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monsters here are strong. Luka said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen\u2019d you learn to use salamander? You say. When fighting the chimeras. I think we\u2019re almost there. Luka said. You both keep going. So this is sealed sinners prison\u2026? Luka said. An Alter with a broken stone monument in the middle. Seems like something your goddess would have built. You say. Only criminals were sealed here? Luka said. Yes\u2026. Though their bodies rotted away, their souls are stuck here. Unable to talk or communicate with the living world, nor able to turn towards the world of the dead. Alice said. i\u2026. I wonder what that huge criminal\u2019s name was\u2026.? Luka said. Luka looks at the monument. \u2026..Heinrich hein!? Luka said. Isn\u2019t he the legendary hero of so many stories? You say. Yes! But it can\u2019t be the same Heinrich. It must be someone else. Heinrich defeated the evil monster lord and brought peace to the world. If this is the same Heinrich\u2026\u2026 Then how can he be sealed here as a criminal!? Luka said. Luka\u2026. In the human stories, what is said to have happen to Heinrich? Alice said. After he defeated the monster lord, it said Illias led him to heaven\u2026Luka said. That\u2019s pretty vague for an ending. Almost like a fairy tale. That sounds like something  appended to the story since nobody knew what happened to him. Alice said. Was this an act of monsters\u2026.? Illas couldn\u2019t have sealed the hero Heinrich, so was it the next monster lord\u2026? Luka said. I haven\u2019t heard of anything like that. Besies\u2026 this strong seal is undoubtedly Illias\u2019s work. Alice said. Well at least he\u2019s not alone. Other people\u2019s names are on here. You say. A crime so serious that she would make sure he never had peace\u2026 I can only think of one thing that would bring that from her. Alice said. Rebelling against Illias\u2026Luka said. The worst of the five commandments. You say. That can\u2019t be\u2026. Just what happened? Luka said. \u2026.There\u2019s quite a lot of troubling issues here. But standing here and thinking about them until we\u2019re senile won\u2019t solve anything. Besides, you can\u2019t dilly-dally here forever, can you? Alice said. Yeah, that\u2019s right. Luka said. As you three leave the prison, you and luka look back at it. You sure you\u2019re goddess is good? You say. From all the stuff I\u2019ve seen and heard, I don\u2019t know any more. Luka said. You three leave the prison. Aright. Let\u2019s go to the monster lord\u2019s castle. Luka said. Finally\u2026. You say. It will be the end of your journey. Do you have anything else to do? Alice said. No. Let\u2019s go. Luka said. I don\u2019t think the fights there will be easy. You say. I\u2019ve been ready for this from the start! Luka said. You three head towards the castle. As night falls, you and luka set up camp. \u2026\u2026this is the last training I\u2019ll be having with you. Alice said. R\u2026. Right. Luka said. You watch as Alice tells luka what the move is and how it\u2019s done. Combing all of the four elements, luka swings his sword downward. The ground splits in two with flames raging around the fissure, and cold gusts of wind blowing around the area. That\u2026.. Was incredible. Luka said. This destructive force\u2026. That wasn\u2019t as powerful as I was hoping for. The earlier power of your attributed was overwritten by the later ones\u2026 As far I can see, wind was a five, earth was a seven, water was a nine, and fire was a ten.  \u2026..With poor balance like that, it won\u2019t go so well. Alice said.  It looked powerful by the size the hole is. You say. The power of this ability is amplified by each spirit imbued in it. But if all four were at a power of ten, it wouldn\u2019t be ten times four for forty\u2026 it would be ten to the forth power for 10,000\u2026 Alice said. That\u2019s\u2026..powerful. you say. This is the ultimate skill, Quadruple Giga. Alice said. A powerful attack like that must take a long time to build. You say. Yes. It would take a few minutes to build. No monster would wait around for you to use. Alice said. As luka and alice converse more, you think about the current move.( A powerful move like that huh? Combining all four elements and with a high damage output. Seeing that move is cool.) You thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you three arrive at the castle. This is it\u2026. You say. Not as fearful as I thought. Quite elegant and not terrifying. Luka said. Well, this is where alice and her subordinates live. You say. Good point. Let\u2019s go. Luka said. No\u2026.. this is where we part. Alice said. Why? Luka said. I\u2019m the monster lord, and I live here. It wouldn\u2019t do for me to accompany the hero as he enters. She said. I guess that makes since. Then we\u2019ll go in alone. Luka said. Well then, luka\u2026. Make sure you finish your duty as a hero. No matter how difficult it gets. Alice said. \u2026.Eh? Y\u2026.yeah.. Luka said. Saying that Alice vanishes. Alright. Let\u2019s go. You ready? You say. Yeah. Luka said. You both enter the palace. Are we going the right way? You say. I think\u2026.. Luka said. Luka, wait. You say. What? He said. I need to know how you want to handle this. Do you want me by your side? Or do you want to handle this alone? You say. As helpful as it would be, I want to handle this alone. I have to stop the heavenly knight myself. Convince tammao and Alma Elma to stop doing things that harm humans\u2026. As for Erubetie, I\u2019ll have to show her a new way for us to coexist together\u2026And to accept granberia\u2019s challenge as a fellow warrior\u2026 Luka said. Personally, I don\u2019t like the idea, but it\u2019s your call. You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..Show yourself! Luka said. An succubus comes out of hiding. Your eyes instantly turn optical. You both won\u2019t go any further, you delicious looking boys\u2026 She said. Rgh! You say. If you don\u2019t resist, I can give you an amazing orgasm\u2026 You\u2019ll both be able to die in ecstasy\u2026 She said. Sorry, but I\u2019m going to get through here no matter what! Luka said. Oh? You\u2019re going to resist? I\u2019m the highest class of succubus, you know\u2026? I\u2019ll let you realize yourself just what that means as I drain you both dry! She said. Really? Come prove it!</span></div></div>",

She squeezes luka\u2019s penis between her breast. You both attack together. Melt away in my kiss\u2026. She said. She kisses you, but you kick her back. Ugh! Keep your lips to yourself! You say. Luka jumps up and comes down hard with the power of earth on the succubus\u2019s skull. You attack. Doesn\u2019t it feel good to melt in my mouth? She said. She sucks on luka\u2019s penis. You and luka attack together. How are humans so powerful\u2026..? She said. The succubus was sealed into the form of a bat.<br>\r\nI expected nothing less. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhew\u2026. Luka said.  That was\u2026..kinda fun. You say. You and luka rush through the halls. Are even going the right way? You say. I think so. We\u2019ve been going straight this whole time. You\u2019d think it wouldn\u2019t be hard to find four powerful monsters. Luka said. I just hope we don\u2019t run into more monsters than we have to. You say. \u2026\u2026There\u2019s no need to worry about that. Those ladies are all waiting in the deepest part of the castle. A voice said. Wh\u2026. Who\u2019s there!? Luka said. A kitsune appears. Who are you? Luka said. I am called yao. The right hand of Tammo, I\u2019m the strongest soldier of the kitsune race. Besides Tammo, of course. She said. Eight tails. You must be strong. You say. Hehe, why not indulge yourself in my sexual skills? I\u2019d be glad to squeeze out as much semen as you\u2019d like\u2026 She said. You and luka attack together. I\u2019ll rub you with this soft hands of mine\u2026 She said.Yao grabs luka\u2019s penis with her soft hands.  You look at luka and he nods. He jumps up and while yao is focused on him, you hit her hard causing her to kneel over and luka comes down hard on her skull. Oh my, you both are a pretty good team. She said. We noticed\u2026. Luka said. In that case, wait a moment, I\u2019ll lead one of you to heaven. She said. Yao begins to concentrate her magical power. Not good. Luka said. Your penis will love my tail\u2026 I\u2019ll make sure to play with it until it explodes in joy. She said. Yao\u2019s eight tails shoot towards you. You smile. Gotcha. You say. While she\u2019s focused on you, you nod to luka to attack. Luka steps in like thunder and stabs as fast as lightning. How could I make such a blunder\u2026?She said. Yao is sealed into the form of a fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you planned. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many steps do you think ahead? Luka said. A lot. I knew she\u2019d go for me. You say. Strong monsters left and right\u2026 But we knew that when we walked in. Luka said. Let\u2019s keep going. We\u2019re bound to reach the top sooner or later. You say. You both keep going. You know, besides the monsters and stuff, this is actually a nice place. I wouldn\u2019t mind have one as a vacation place. You say. Vacation? I wouldn\u2019t mind living in a place like this. Minus the monsters. Luka said. This room is huge\u2026. Are we there yet? You say. Hopefully\u2026. Luka said. You feel that? You say. Yeah. A surge of intense magic. Luka said. You both look around, until luka spots a small shadow. S\u2026 Show yourself!?  Luka said. Wah! He saw me! A voice said. A small monster timidly steps out of hiding. Wah! Heroes!? What should I do\u2026? I wasn\u2019t able to run away\u2026. The imp said. An imp\u2026? Couldn\u2019t have been from her. Luka said. If we lose to an imp, we don\u2019t deserve to be here. You say. What should I do\u2026.? I could never beat a hero who manage to make it all the way here\u2026 h\u2026 hey\u2026. I\u2019m really weak\u2026.s\u2026.so you aren\u2019t going to kill me\u2026. Right? She said. Maybe. All depends. You say. No. We\u2019d never kill or hurt a monster who doesn\u2019t bother humans. Luka said.Oh,no that means you\u2019re going to kill me\u2026. I\u2019ve teased a lot of humans before\u2026. She said. Get lost imp, before I lost my patience. You say. Wah! She said. She runs away. Hmph. You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026.That\u2019s one way to do it. Luka said. She\u2019s a resident here. Let\u2019s go. Luka said. As soon as you both start walking. The ceiling  in front of you both falls to the floor, and a gigantic monster following the debris. That\u2019s quite an entrance. You say. Wh\u2026.. What the hell is this!? Luka said. He steps back . Some kind of weird combination on monsters and tentacles. You say.(I also feel no emotion from the thing. What is it?) You thought.  Wawawa! It\u2019s going berserk! Tammo said. T\u2026. tammo? Luka said. This Giganto weapon is a biological weapon created 1,000 years ago during the great monster wars. It was too powerful, so it has been sealed all this time. \u2026..A \u2026.A biological weapon!? Luka said. With that\u2026. I\u2019m off! Tammo said. She does a quick backflip off the giganto weapon\u2019s back and vanishes from view. The thing turns its eyes slowly to you both. Targets obtained. Destroy. It said. Guh\u2026.!  Luka said. You just stand there. So basically that thing is supposed to be the ultimate weapon? You say. I\u2026.think so. Luka said. That title is already taken. You say.(By us.) He said. You and luka both attack. Target lock. Tentacles deploy. It said. It\u2019s tentacles dance around the room.  You both dodge them. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. You breath in and out. Flames ready. It said. It sprays crimson flames in front of it. You dodge it and luka scrambles to dodge it. Dodge this\u2026. You say. You firmly grab your knife and swing it. Created a purple wave of energy. Luka comes down hard on its skull. Attack d. Destroy area. Giganto\u2019s loud roar causes nearby walls to crumble. You dodge the debris, but not luka. He\u2019s stunned. Activate semen extraction container. It said. Its tail opens, revealing a strange hole. You push luka out the way and grab your knife and slice at it. I\u2019ll show you who really is the ultimate weapon! You say. You build up energy and lightning forms on both of your hands.  The lightning turns black and you rush it. You hit her with your left hand, going through her you run up the wall and come down hard on its back. Whoa\u2026..! Luka said in amazement. When the dust clears, he sees you sitting on the things back, smoking a cigarette. It\u2019s lonely at the top. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow\u2026\u2026 Luka said. You see it\u2019s still moving. Damage taken. Entering crisis mode. Begin self-preservation routine. It said. What? Luka said. Begin regeneration. It said. It start healing it-self. Damage restored. Break crisis mode. Resume normal operation. No way! Luka said.(So it can regenerate. We\u2019ll have to attack faster than it can regen.) You thought. You build up energy and lightning forms in your hands and it turns black. Lend me your power, salamander! Vaporizing rebellion sword! Luka said. You and luka attacks both hit the thing. Critical damage taken. Reactor shutdown. Abort. It said. The giganto weapon is sealed into a form similar to a lion.<br>\r\nThis power\u2026.Luka said. Whew\u2026. We manage to beat her somehow\u2026 Luka said. (maybe it\u2019s not lonely at the top anymore\u2026.) You thought. Luka. That was epic. You say. Thanks\u2026. What was she? Luka said. I don\u2019t know. You say. Well, we can\u2019t keep worrying about it. We need to keep moving. Luka said. You both keep walking. Luka\u2026. You say. What? He said. Take this. You say. You give him your lucky coin. A coin? He said. It\u2019s my lucky coin. You say. Lucky coin\u2026\u2026 has it worked before? He said. I\u2019m standing in front of you, aren\u2019t i? You say. Good point. \u2026..Thanks. Luka said.  You both keep walking down the hall until you both make it into a huge room. Right in the middle, all of the four heavenly knights are waiting. Welcome luka-boy! I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d really make it here. Alma Elma said. Oho, you defeated the giganto weapon? I\u2019m surprised myself. Tammo said. So you wasted all your time coming here just to be disposed by us\u2026 You\u2019re a strange one indeed. Erubetie said. (Luka wants to deal with them himself. I really don\u2019t want him to\u2026\u2026But if he wants to, then I won\u2019t stand in his way.) You thought.  \u2026..I didn\u2019t come here just to fight you.  I just want you to stop harassing humans. I think that that would best for relations between humans and monsters\u2026. Luka said. Sorry, but I can\u2019t do that. If we don\u2019t threaten humans with our power every so often, they\u2019ll eventually start going around killing weaker monsters everywhere. Alma Elma said. Humans look on us with nothing but hostility. As long as that hated is there, we\u2019ll be forced to use our power. Tammo said. After all the torment humans put us through, how can you say that now? Erubetie said. I think you\u2019re just wasting your time here luka. You say. I was hoping  we could solve this by talking. But if not, I knew I\u2019d have to resort to this\u2026 Luka said. He calmly pulls out his sword. You\u2019ll only recognize those that are powerful, right? Then I\u2019ll surpass all of you! I\u2019ll defeat you, and make you accept coexistence! Luka said. That\u2019s right. Defeating us is one way for us to be persuaded. If you can really defeat me, I\u2019ll think about it. Alma Elma said. Luka looks at you. I already know. All you. You say. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So I\u2019ll be your first opponent. Just like I said, I want to play with you\u2026 With my hands\u2026 With my mouth\u2026..With my breast\u2026. With my pussy. I want to feel luka-boy\u2019s penis with every part of my body. Alma Elma. Said. (I\u2019m already tired of her.) You thought. Guh\u2026.! Luka said. By the way, I heard you awoke to a serene mind\u2026 I wonder which of us is faster? Don\u2019t you just want to find out? She said As usual, always playing around. But that isn\u2019t a skill to use right from the start! It takes a lot of concentration! Luka said. I don\u2019t like difficult strategies like that. Let\u2019s ignore all that and just go right to the fun. She said. Fine. Luka said. Luka goes into serene mind. Hmmm\u2026. So that\u2019s it? You look funny swaying like that. Let me try. She said. She quickly grabs luka\u2019s penis and strokes it. Luka can\u2019t even dodge it in time. Ah\u2026.! Luka said. Oh my\u2026. It seems my wind is faster than your water. Even if you can read the flow of my movement, it doesn\u2019t help if I can still move faster than you. Our speeds are too different, so you\u2019ll never be able to evade me. She said. No\u2026.No way. Luka said. (Just as I feared. She\u2019s still faster than him. I hope he knows what he\u2019s doing.) You say. You feel a powerful wind. You\u2019re a lot better than you were before\u2026. But you can\u2019t use that wind of yours well, luka-boy. Can\u2019t you hear the wind crying\u2026? It wants to play with you so badly, but you\u2019re ignoring it. She said.(She\u2019s right. You can\u2019t control wind. Only play with it.) You thought. Then you feel an even more powerful wind. Like a gale. I\u2026..Incredible\u2026 this is the true power of the wind\u2026! Luka said. Then shall we see who\u2019s faster? I want to see if luka-boy is just as quick as I expect. She said. She reaches out towards luka\u2019s penis, but luka dodges it. Hehe\u2026.. Seems like we\u2019re even. She said.(I don\u2019t get it. Why is she teaching him?) You thought. Luka attack and hits Alma Elma. Ouch\u2026. You hit me\u2026.? Not bad, luka-boy. You seem to be just as strong as I am now. She said. Alma Elma laughs, and dusts the dirt off her mantel. Oh well\u2026. There\u2019s three more after me, so I\u2019ll give this victory to you. She said. (Again? What\u2019s with her?) You thought. \u2026..You always surrender quickly, Alma. Luka said. Oh, is that so\u2026.? She said. \u2026Before the fight, you said you would be my \u201cfirst opponent.\u201d Someone planning on winning wouldn\u2019t have said \u201cfirst.\u201d Were you planning on losing straight from the start? To surrender whenever you saw a chance to do it? You\u2019re always playing around, never taking anything seriously\u2026. Your wind is empty and has no meaning. Even though you\u2019re strong, why are you so scared of fighting? Do you hate it that much? Luka said. \u2026\u2026.What are you trying say, luka-boy? She said. \u2026..I won\u2019t accept a victory like that. I must make you accept me! That\u2019s why I\u2019m fighting!  So you have to fight seriously too, Alma! I won\u2019t let you cut any corner out of this! Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm\u2026 Aren\u2019t you the little hero. You\u2019ve become something great, luka-boy\u2026 \u2026..No, hero luka. She said. Alma calmly takes off her clothes. If you\u2019re going to go that far, shall I fight you seriously? Me as the queen succubus, and you as the hero!? She said. Just as I wanted. Come! Luka said. As soon as she took her clothes off, an over powering sweet smell filled the air. (I hate this smell.) You thought. Your eyes turn optical to negate the sweet smell. Moving like a powerful gale, luka thrust his sword forward as fast as lightning. I\u2019ll make you with in ecstasy with my tail. She said.Her coils around luka\u2019s penis. Now\u2026.. I\u2019m going to devour that penis of yours with my tail. I\u2019ll suck on it so hard until you\u2019ll be left completely  dry\u2026 She said. The tip of Alma\u2019s tail opens, sucking in luka\u2019s penis. Hehe, it feels good, doesn\u2019t it? She said. Grrr\u2026..! Luka said. With the power of earth flowing in him, luka struggles intensely and breaks free. It looks like you\u2019re capable of using the power of earth. But not as well as tammo. She said. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. My breast bring a dream like pleasure with them. Alma squeezes luka\u2019s penis between her large breast. The marshmallow like feeling surrounds luka from every direction. Alma slowly squeeze  her breast around luka\u2019s penis. Luka attacks. I\u2019ll suck you into submission. She said. Alma strokes luka\u2019s penis. But he dodges it. Here I go! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. My hand skills will make you writhe. She said. All ten of her fingers grabs luka\u2019s peins. Her fingers climb up luka\u2019s pinis like a snake. Her ten fingers stroke luka\u2019s penis. Luka attacks. I\u2019ll suck you into submission. She said.  Alma sucks violently on luka\u2019s penis. Her tongue liks up and down luka\u2019s penis. Luka jumps up and comes down hard with the power of earth, shaking the ground. Drown in my breast. She said. Alma squeezes luka\u2019s penis between her large breast. The marshmallow like feeling surrounds luka from every direction. Dodge this! Luka said. Moving like a powerful gale, luka thrust his sword fast as lightning. It's my lost this time. I fought seriously as the queen succubus. Alma said. She drops to her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Impressive.) You thought. Hehe\u2026. The loser has no choice but to follow the winner. Humans and monsters coexistence\u2026.. That\u2019s why you\u2019re wielding your blade, right? She said. Yes, that\u2019s right. I want you to help think of a way that doesn\u2019t involve terrorizing people\u2026 Luka said. I got it. I\u2019ll obey\u2026 Besides, it\u2019s not like I particularly hold any dislike of humans. I\u2019d be so sad if the coliseum would go away. And I love human men so much. She said. I believe in you. Luka said. (That makes one of us.) You thought. You\u2019re quite something to defeat Alma Elma\u2026 But do you think you can deal with me? Tammo said. Tammo quickly bounces up, taking Alma\u2019s place. (This is a prime example of looks can be deceiving. She\u2019s small, but the power coming from her is nothing to joke about.) You said. (I still say we could take her.) He said. You\u2019re next Tammo? Don\u2019t hold anything back! Luka said. The moon is the source of the kitsune tace\u2019s power. And today is a full moon! My tiny body is full of the power of the earth. Do you seriously think you can damage me? She said. I\u2019ll do more than damage you! I\u2019ll surpass you! Luka said. Ha! She said. Tammo steps forward and punches with the weight of the earth behind her. Guha\u2026.! Luka said. It\u2019s not over yet! She said. Guh\u2026.! Luka said. (He can\u2019t take another\u2026.) You thought. Orya! She said. Tammo dashes toward luka, and jumps into the air. But he dodges it. The moment Tammo lands headfirst on the floor, the floor cracks and splinters. What a hard head\u2026. Luka said. Luka quietly meditates. Ha! She said. Tammo\u2019s tail suddenly grows as she swings it towards luka. But he dodges again. Her tail missing luka, it hits a pillar, instantly turning it into rubble and bring down a section of the ceiling. What power! Luka said. Take this! Luka said. Luka attack, but it has no effect. My attack didn\u2019t work!? Luka said. My powered up body is the same as a mountain. There\u2019s no way a weak attack would even make me flinch. She said. (This might be bad.) You thought. Haha, watch out! She said. Tammo curls into a ball, and rools towards luka, but he dodges again. You sidestep the rolling Tammo and she slams into the wall and brings it down with her. \u2026.Excuse me, little Tammo? \u2026.Would you please stop destroying the castle. \u2026.Just who do you think is going to fix this? Erubetie said. Why,luka of course. After I defeat him, he\u2019ll be my slave. I\u2019ll make him repair it. She said. Ehh!? Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka attacks again, but tammo takes no damage. Quit moving around! She said. Tammo\u2019s tail coils around luka\u2019s body. Guh\u2026..! Luka said. Caught you. Now that you\u2019re like this, you have no chance of victory. Give up. She said. W\u2026.Who would ever\u2026.Give up!? Luka said. Luka struggles but can\u2019t break free. You\u2019ll never defeat my tail with power of that level. If you don\u2019t use gnome\u2019s power to its full extent, this will be you end\u2026 She said. Her tail coils tighter around luka. \u2026.Fufu, are you going to give up from this? What a disappointing hero\u2026. She said. Luka keeps struggling, but still can\u2019t get free. You won\u2019t escape\u2026. If you don\u2019t surrender, I\u2019ll just keep making it tighter and tighter\u2026 She said. Her tail coils even tighter. \u2026..Did you forget what I said before? The image you  have is the most important part of controlling the power of earth. If you had only imagine yourself as a giant mountain, you could have escape from this easily\u2026. She said. Even if you say that, i\u2026. That kind of image\u2026.. Luka said. Luka struggles weakly. Even your struggling\u2019s getting weaker. She said.  Her tail gets tighter around luka. Oho\u2026.? Are you about to give up? She said. I\u2026.It\u2019s impossible\u2026. Luka said. \u2026.just what\u2019s impossible, you idiot? You\u2019re the man that moody gnome accepted as her master. And the hero that Alipheese the sixteenth accepted. \u2026..Think back. Just who are you? Why did you come here? Was your resolve this easily shattered? She said. \u2026..i\u2026\u2026I\u2026..I\u2019m a hero! I came here to stop the hatred between humans and monsters from getting worse! Haaaaaa! Luka said. With power coursing through him, luka rips off the tail binding him. Ah! My fluffy tail! She said. With s tiny brush of magical power, a new tail takes its place. \u2026..Hmph, that was quite something. But was that just an accident!? She said. Tammo steps forward, punching with the qeight of earth behind her, but luka takes no damage. This power\u2026.! Luka said. Hmmm\u2026..It looks like my brute force attacks won\u2019t work any longer. Oh well, it looks like I have to resort to pleasure attacks.  She said. She takes off her clothes, exposing her naked body.</span></div></div>",

I had almost forgotten what it was like to take damage. There\u2019s no more going easy then. From here on out, I\u2019m serious! She said. Let\u2019s go! Luka said. Take this! Luka said. Luka attacks. I\u2019ll suck on I as fast I can. She said. Tammo greedily sucks on luka\u2019s penis. Luka attacks. My tongue can overwhelm any man. She said. Tammo jumps onto luka and licks his penis all over. Dodge this! Luka said. Luka moves as fast as a gale and thrust his sword as fast as lightning. My tongue can overwhelm any man. She said. She jumps onto luka and licks his penis all over. Luka attacks. I\u2019ll wrap my nine tails around it. She said. Her nine tails shoot towards luka, but he moves like the wind and dodges. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. I\u2019ll tickle the tip. She said. Her tiny skilled hands fondle luka\u2019s penis. Luka jumps up into the air and comes down hard on tammo\u2019s skull. Ha! She said. Tammo jumps on luka, but he dodges her. An opening! Luka said. Luka scores a critical hit on her from behind. (That\u2019s the way to do it!) You thought. Fufu\u2026. Can you endure my mouth? She said. She greedily sucks on luka\u2019s penis. Dodge this! Luka said. Luka moves as fast as a gale and thrusts as fast as lightning. Can you withstand my tails? She said. All nine of her tails wrap around luka\u2019s penis. Her fluffy tail squeezes around luka\u2019s penis. Almost faster than the wind, the fluffy tail pumps him like a piston. Ahhh\u2026\u2026 Luka said. Already at your limit? Be happy\u2026.. for you\u2019ll be driven into a world of pleasure\u2026. She said. Not as long as I can hold my sword! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. Hrm\u2026.. To think I\u2019d be push into a corner\u2026\u2026 Oh well, it\u2019s time for a bold move! She said. Tammo\u2019s tail shoots up, and cracks the ceiling. What are you doing!? Luka said. As the dust fades, moonlight flows into the room. I\u2019ll show you my secret skill! She said. Tammo\u2019s nine tails spread out Each of them begins to shine as they absorb the moonlight. (This can\u2019t be good! I can\u2019t let that hit me!) Luka thought. Luka takes a defensive stance. Here it comes, my ultimate attack! She said. The tips of tammo\u2019s tail come together, and point at luka. Luka dodges the beam of light. I\u2026. I dodged it. He said. You\u2019re standing in the direction of the beam of light. Unfazed, you deflect it to hit the wall behind you. Hrm\u2026 it missed\u2026 Tammo said. She falls to the ground. Let\u2019s finish this! Luka said. Luka jumps into the air and comes down hard on tammo\u2019s skull with the power of earth. I give up\u2026. I can\u2019t fight any longer. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo down. On a roll! Luka said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErhg\u2026.. you\u2019ve really become quite strong. I can stand against you any longer. Tammo said. She bows her small head. (Hard to believe this girl almost destroyed the castle.) You thought. Is that true\u2026..? if you haven\u2019t used your full power\u2026\u2026 Luka said. In my village, humans and monsters are on good terms. Betting  on your dream doesn\u2019t sound too bad. She said. \u2026.yes, I\u2019ll be counting on you. Luka said. \u2026.Well, granberia? Are you going next? Erubetie said. \u2026.no, you first.  Granberia said. So you plan on being last\u2026. But I\u2019m afraid your turn will never come. Erubetie said. Erubetie moves in front of luka. I\u2019m different from tammo and Alma Elma. There will be no foolish attempt at training you. Nor will I be a fool and try to do anything less than crush you. She said. (I don\u2019t like where this fight might lead\u2026. She hates humans with a passion and if she\u2019s beaten by a human\u2026.. who knows what she\u2019ll do\u2026.) You thought. \u2026\u2026I\u2019ll never go easy on one of you intruding humans. You humans, who have caused so much harm to us slimes, are unforgivable. I\u2019ll wrap all the humans in my body and melt them away\u2026 Starting with you. She said. Dodge this! Luka said. Luka moves like a gale and thrust his sword as fast as lightning. I\u2019ll use my slime to play with it\u2026. She said. Erubetie\u2019s slime sticks to luka\u2019s penis, but he dodges it.  Here I come! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. Fill my slime with your semen\u2026. She said. Her slime sticks to luka\u2019s penis, but he dodges it. You speak of coexisting with humans\u2026. But do you simply not realize how long we have suffered at the hands of humans? Undine, whom you begged for power from\u2026 She herself was driven to the edge as the area humans took up continued to grow. Along with us slime, there are many other monsters suffering the same fate\u2026 As you humans grow, we die! Is that that what you mean by coexisting!? Erubetie said. \u2026..Humans don\u2019t understand monsters at all yet. The overwhelming  majority don\u2019t even know the trouble they are causing you.  But as we come to understand each other\u2026. Understand what!? If they are ignoring our pains, then why should we care about theirs!? We shall instill fear in them, and show them the pains they showed us! Then we shall see just how long they can remain ignorant of our suffering!  Erubetie interrupts. Luka attacks. Feel my slime over your body. She said. Her slime squirms all over luka\u2019s body. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. Erubetie\u2026. Have you ever tried appealing to humans directly? Telling them just how much your race has suffered? Luka said. What could humans possibly understand about our pains? She said. They\u2019ll understand\u2026 humans aren\u2019t stupid. If they know the pain you\u2019re in, many will come to your aid! If a step is never taken to resolving the problem, how can you expect it to ever get better!? Luka said. Luka attacks. I\u2019ll torture it with a mix of pleasure\u2026 She said. Her slime flows over luka\u2019s penis. Understanding\u2026. Coexistence\u2026. I\u2019m sick of those hypocritical words! Is that why you fight? So you can overlook your own hypocrisy!? She said. If I am\u2026. Then you\u2019re a hypocrite too, Erubetie. You\u2019re acting the victim, and looking down on humans at the same time\u2026. Abandoning all attempts at an peaceful solution, and moving down a path of violence and fear.  Charging forth and fighting for the sake of the victim, you\u2019re creating even more victims! How is that anything but hypocrisy? Luka said. Humans would- You think so little of humans. You believe them to be beneath you, and you\u2019re unwilling to try to even try! Luka said.  Luka attacks.  Feel my slime over your body. Her slime squirms all over luka\u2019s body. \u2026\u2026There are humans just like you. They consider monsters things just to be destroyed. There was a man who said much the same\u2026. That humans would never be able to understand monsters. As long as they were more powerful than us, we could never live side by side with them. Luka said. \u2026.he sounds like a smart man. Humans should be scared of us. We\u2019ll educate them with fear! Until it\u2019s ingrained in humanity\u2019s mind that they shouldn\u2019t trifle with us! She said. Educate by fear\u2026.? That\u2019s the reason humans are fighting monsters because they fear them!  As long as humans are afraid of you, they\u2019ll never understand you! All you\u2019re doing is prolonging the suffering on both sides! Luka said. Luka attacks. I\u2019ll use my slime to play with you\u2026 She said. Her slime sticks to luka\u2019s penis. Here I go! Luka said. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. Erubetie\u2026. The reason you hate humans so much is because you know nothing about them. If we can come together in coexistence, everything will be much better\u2026.. The only reason this unhappy reality exist tight now is because we aren\u2019t living in peace. Your race has been forced into a corner\u2026. Surly you must recognize that your path isn\u2019t working?  Luka said. But i\u2026. I cannot forgive humans\u2026  Humans have tortured my race for so long\u2026 So\u2026. I\u2019ll\u2026! She said. So you want revenge? That\u2019s your reason, isn\u2019t it? Where do that get you? After you get your revenge, the humans are just going to fight back and get revenge too! All you\u2019re doing is creating more misfortune and hatred! Luka said. If that\u2019s how it ends, then so be it! My belief in ruling humans by fear will not change! She said. If you\u2019re going to go that far\u2026.. Then I\u2019ll stop you! Luka said. Luka attacks. How long can you endure my slime? She said.  Her slime sticks to luka\u2019s penis, but he dodges it. No matter what you say\u2026 I\u2019ll never live in peace with humans! Get use to humans? Understanding humans? I can\u2019t do that! She said. (Who\u2019s she trying to convince? Us or herself?) You thought.Luka attacks. Do you honestly think you have driven me into a corner? That you could beat the queen of slime with a sword!? She said. Erubetie divides herself. Guh\u2026. Which one is the real one? Luka said. None is an illusion or a fake. I can simply divide my body itself as freely as I wish\u2026 She said. N\u2026. No way\u2026.! Luka said.</span></div></div>",

(those flames\u2026\u2026 Are those the fire of purgatory?) You thought. Luka\u2019s sword flashes like a frenzied star. Ah\u2026.. Erubetie\u2019s bodies falls one after the other. As they come together to form a single body, you both can tell she\u2019s taken serious damage. \u2026\u2026It\u2019s not over yet. For the sake of my race, I will not lose\u2026.. I cannot lose! She said. Slime spreads out, wrapping around luka. What are you doing!? You don\u2019t have the enegy to keep fighting, right!? Luka said. I said it\u2019s not over yet\u2026. I\u2019m going to blow myself up, with you right here next to me\u2026 She said. Wh\u2026.. What did you say!? Luka said. Are you crazy!? You say. Luka hits her. It\u2019s no use, I\u2019ll never let you go! This isn\u2019t just some self-destruction, it\u2019s my ultimate skill, designed to turn every part of my body into pure energy. At this point blank range, not a single cell of you will remain\u2026 She said.  You plan on taking everyone in this castle!? You\u2019ll kill innocents! You say. That\u2019s right. What are you thinking!? Alma Elma said. Quit that right now! Tammo said. \u2026\u2026Leave this continent quickly. This explosion will cause a chain reaction, and annihilate the whole continent. Erubetie said. Luka struggles, but can\u2019t break free. I won\u2019t let go\u2026\u2026 Never! Haha, let\u2019s count down together, luka. We\u2019ll meet oblivion together. She said. Energy fills the room as the reaction begins inside her body. (How can we stop a reaction of this magnitude!?) You thought. Stop it Erubetie! What do you think this is going to solve!? We\u2019ll both just die meaningless deaths! Even worse, you\u2019ll kill thousands of innocents! Luka said. You want to hate humans this badly that you\u2019ll destroy yourself!? You say. Do you want to kill me that badly!? Is this the conclusion you\u2019ve come to!? Getting other innocents involved, and dying a meaningless death\u2026.. Luka said. And if it is? She said. Then you\u2019ll be just the same as those you hate! No\u2026. you\u2019ll be far worse! You realize it yourself, right!? This won\u2019t solve anything! Luka said. Yes\u2026. It won\u2019t solve anything \u2026\u2026Indeed, it is pointless. She said. Erubetie slowly stops her reaction, and lets luka go. (That\u2026\u2026 Was close.) You thought \u2026\u2026Did my words reach you, erbetie\u2026?  Not at all. But there is one thing I realized\u2026 Nobody would benefit if we killed each other here. \u2026\u2026.This useless fight is over. Graberia will dispose of you. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey Erubetie\u2026.. Coexistence doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re forced to live together in the same place. If the two sides negotiate, habitation zones can be set up to ensure that your race\u2019s homeland never get polluted. As long as we live in peace and understanding, I\u2019m sure it can work out. Both sides just have to respect the other\u2019s wishes. I think that would be the best thing for our world\u2026. Luka said. (Chose your words here, luka.) You thought. First, I\u2019ll appeal to humanity, That your race has been driven into a corner, and are suffering. I\u2019m sure if I talk to the right people, they\u2019ll help. Luka said. Hmph, I\u2019m not expecting much. She said. Saying that, Erubetie moves away. (That one has a heart of stone. Three down\u2026\u2026. All that leaves is her.) You thought. (She sucked the fun out of this by making it personal.) he said. Just you\u2026. Luka said. Yes. I\u2019m last. She said. Granberia quietly steps in front of luka, blocking the large door behind her. Past here is the monster lord\u2019s throne\u2026 As you know, Alipheese is not there. Thus\u2026..your purpose will be achieve if you defeat me. She said. Yes\u2026.. Just one more thing to accomplish. Luka said. (You think she\u2019d challenge us after luka wins?) he said. (I wouldn\u2019t be surprise. She wanted to take me and luka on separately. I just hope luka doesn\u2019t beat her too bad, then I\u2019ll have no fun at all.) You said. This is it, Granberia! You\u2019ll have to stop attacking humans once I win! Luka said. Yes, attack me with everything you\u2019ve got! Show me everything you can do! She said. I\u2019d show you even if you didn\u2019t ask\u2026 All the power I\u2019ve gained along the way. Luka said. Calm my heart\u2026\u2026 Luka said.A serene state of mind\u2026. it is impressive to have reached that state in such a short time. However! She said. Granberia quickly steps forward, and aims a powerful slash at luka\u2019s neck. Agh! Luka said. Your heart isn\u2019t yet on my level. Your serene mind still has patches of fog in it! You can\u2019t be done yet. I\u2019ll defeat every spirit you have! She said. Gnome, infuse me with the unmoving power of the earth! Luka said. Hmph. She said. Granberia swings down her sword. Guh\u2026.! I thought that would bounce off\u2026..Luka said.  You may have heard it from alipheese already\u2026. But I competed for the monster lord\u2019s throne in the last selection.  At that time, most of my sword attacks were nullified by the power of earth\u2026 I realized how much training I still lacked. She said. (This woman must train 24/7.) you thought. I trained so as to never suffer that humiliation again! Now my sword can cut through even a mountain! Don\u2019t think that defense will protect you from my blade! She said. Sylph, rage around as you please! Luka said. I see, those are some impressive movement\u2026. But\u2026.! She said. Granberia steps in like thunder, and quickly thrust. Guh\u2026..! Luka said. Your speed is indeed impressive\u2026. But in the end, you\u2019re still human. Even If you\u2019re quick, I can see the flow of your heart before you even start to move! She said. (I have to say, I\u2019m impressed by granberia. She might finally be what I\u2019ve been looking for a long time. A challenge.) you thought. Show me the power of your spirits Show me everything you have! She said. Salamander, purify everything  with the fires of purgatory! Luka said. Licks of flames run up and down luka\u2019s sword.  Such a nostalgic flame\u2026. Hold that flame in your blade, and hit me with your best skill! No\u2026. the skill you coiped from me! She said. I\u2019ll purify you with the flames of purgatory! Luka said. Burning with the flames of purgatory, Luka attacks in a whirlwind of fire! Hm\u2026.That\u2019s it!? She said. Granberia\u2019s sword flashes like a shooting star. Luka\u2019s attack is countered by granberia. N\u2026. No way! Luka said. In the end, it\u2019s still a copy of my skill\u2026 Though I have to say, it isn\u2019t weak by any means. It may be a weaker copy, but it\u2019s still my skill\u2026 You are likely the only human swordsman in the world capable of using it. She said. (Her power is overwhelming. Everything luka does, she does it better. He better call on all four of the spirits to their maximum just to stand a chance.) You thought. When you close your eyes, you felt something. (W\u2026..what was that? D\u2026..Did luka just enter serene mind? It feels\u2026\u2026more powerful than before.) You thought. ( I think the fighting has just started.) He said. Luka\u2019s attacks in a whirlwind of fire. Splendid! Granberia said. (She wasn\u2019t able to dodge it. Now it\u2019s a fight.) You thought. Can you keep up with my movement!? She said. Granberia steps in like thunder, and quickly thrust, but luka dodges.  Luka jumps up and comes down hard with his sword on her skull with the power of earth. Ha! She said. Granberia cuts down everything in her path. Luka attacks. \u2026.I grow tired of this bout. Let\u2019s decided this with one move. She said. You mean\u2026\u2026 Luka said. Deciding victory with one attack. Isn\u2019t that the way of a warrior? She said. But that takes too long to prepare, I don\u2019t care, I\u2019ll defeat it. She said. Just do it luka! You say. Luka summons all of the spirits power into his sword. His sword has all of the four spirits power flowing through it. Here I go! Luka said. Luka and granberia attack each other at the same time. The power to crush anything slams into granberia. Splendid\u2026\u2026 She said. Granberia falls to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2026. won? Luka said.  Yes\u2026. It\u2019s my lost. That was truly a wonderful attack. She said. Granberia lets out a sigh and gets up. Amazing\u2026.. you say. (Hmph!) he said. As luka talks to them, you feel an incredible magical power flood the room. This power\u2026. Her majesty?  Alma said. Alipheese\u2026.? She returned!? Granberia said. Then an amplified voice rings out of the hallway.  Welcome luka, victor over my four heavenly knights\u2026. No\u2026 Welcome hero. Now, appear before me! The monster lord who rules over the monster domain! Alice said. (She really getting into character.) He said. Wh\u2026..what are you atalking about!? Alice!? Luka said. The huge door behind the four knights slowly opens. \u2026.Alice!? Luka said. Wait, luka! Tammo said. He runs through ignoring tammo\u2019s shout. Luka! You say. You run behind him, but the door quickly shuts in front of you! Dammit! Luka! You say. Do the right thing luka. By you, not by Illias. You mumble.</span></div></div>",

I hope he doesn\u2019t do something crazy.) You said. (Like you.) He said. (When I do something crazy, there\u2019s a reason behind it. Luka just head first in there.) You said. (Again, Like you.) He said. After what seemed like a long time, you feel something like a holy presence. Then after a few minutes, the holy feeling turns to dark anger, and you feel the castle violently shake. You feel something and it feels divine. No.... You say. You see angels everywhere. Then luka and alice show up. Luka, what happened in there!? You say. I\u2019ll explain later. Right now, where in trouble. Luka said. I\u2019m seeing angles and those chimeras all over. You say. This must be how Remina fell. Luka said. Angels and chimera attacking monsters\u2026.. Did your goddess come down and declare full blown war? You say. Yes. Alice said. Great\u2026.. A war against the heavens\u2026.You say. Those monsters look strange\u2026.. Luka said. Illias must have created them. Alice said. No\u2026.That isn\u2019t right. Those chimera\u2019s are my work. A strange woman said. Y\u2026. you\u2019re\u2026. Luka said. My name is promestien, the seeker of wisdom. She said. And the one who gave fire to humans\u2026. You say. Yes, that\u2019s correct. She said. I see\u2026. So you were an angel That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t sense anything from you. What are those strange creatures? Why did you make them\u2026.? Alice said. They are called chimeric monsters, whom I created by dark magic\u2026 the fruits of the research Illias instructed me to perform. She said. The monster hating Illias ordered you to create monsters\u2026? A god ignoring their own beliefs. Alice said. You ground dwellers are unable to understand divine providence. The truth of this world is too difficult for you to understand. She said. A fallen angel giving us a lecture about the world\u2026. Heh. You say. Anyway, I brought my masterpieces to assault the castle to defeat the four heavenly knights and the monster lord. \u2026..And a hero, it seems. She said. Neither alice, the four heavenly knights, or I will ever lose to you! Luka said. Hehe\u2026.. Is that so? She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second she starts laughing, a shadow of somebody hits a nearby wall. You see it\u2019s granberia. Guh\u2026! She said. Granberia\u2019s on one knee, struggling to stand up. The one who throw her steps forward. The feeling you\u2019re getting from this chimeric monster is on a whole different plane. The strongest cursed swordswoman among monsters, Granberia\u2026. Was that truly the extent of your power? She said. She was already hurt after the fight with you, luka. You say. Kyaa! A voice said. Alma suddenly slams into a nearby wall. Ouch ouch ouch\u2026. Even though I was already tired\u2026. That sure hurt\u2026 She said. Alma shakily gets back to her feet as she dust off her mantle. Are they being pushed this hard? You say. They\u2019re more that two here. Luka said. Five more? They look like they mean business. You say. These chimeras were created just to deal with the four heavenly knights. I analyzed everything anout them, to ensure they were all able to defeat them. Promestien said. \u2026\u2026heh, so there you have it. Unmodified monsters like you\u2026. There\u2019s no way you could compare to us. Arc-en-ciel said. Sooooo\u2026.. You\u2019re all going to have to die now! Ah\u2026 But we\u2019ll rape the hero and his friend instead. Rapunzel said. Aha\u2026. I want to rape him too. Cupid said. A hero who turns his blade in treason against Illias\u2026. As punishment, a continual rape of 20,000 is sufficient. A Valkyrie said. Guh\u2026.! Luka said. We\u2019re outnumbered here. You say. In that case, take out the leader! Luka said. As he takes his stance and swings for promestein. Her speed drastically increase, dodging his attack. Did she just\u2026..? You say. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re unique in using the power of the spirits. I\u2019ve already analyzed that power, and are mass producing reproductions. She said. The spirits as well\u2026. Luka said. Hmph. Don\u2019t be scared, luka. You\u2019ve already overcome many difficult situations already. Alice said. Alice\u2026. Luka said. I told you at the start that we were not allies. But that changes now. You and me are allies who share the same will! Alice said. It\u2019ll take more than a few angels and chimeras to stop us! You say. \u2026..yeah, you\u2019re right! Luka said. Let\u2019s go luka! Don\u2019t slack off! That goes double for you! Alice said. Trust me, I won\u2019t be shown up in battle by you. You say. You three charged into the fray. Luka, I\u2019ll take the chimeric monster! You attack the angels! Alice said. Right! Luka said. Mind if I lend a hand? You say. Any help I can get. Luka said. Let\u2019s do this! You say. You attack, but you phase right through her. What the?! Why did I phase through her?!  You say. You can\u2019t hit her! She\u2019s immune to all earthly damage. Luka said. Shit! Now you tell me! You say. Luka sword lashes like a frenzied star. Wait!  What!? She said. Cupid vanishes. Is she dead? You say. I don\u2019t know. Look out! Luka said. Huh? You say. You turn around and get impaled by a Valkyries sword in the stomach. You feel a whole lot of blood lost. Luka swings his sword and the Valkyrie backs off. Why\u2026.. did that hurt so much? You say. Heavenly weapon. Luka said. When luka looks at you, he sees black marks on your body. What\u2026. Happened to you? The black marks spread all over your body. You stand up move so fast  that it felt like time stood still. You hit her hard. It does damage. H\u2026. How did a human touch the pure body of an angel? She said. You charge her and she swings her sword. Time slows down and you move behind her and slash her on the neck. Time speeds up. No\u2026.. this can\u2019t be\u2026.. I\u2019m an angel of war. I can\u2019t be beaten by a human. She said. Time to send you to hell! You say. You hit the ground and a dark red circle forms underneath the Valkyrie. What is this!? She said. Then hands grab the Valkyrie and drag her into the ground as she screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody is better than me. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka stares at you in disbelief and a little bit of fear. Then the marks go away and you fall on one knee. Sheesh, so you both took out both cupid and Valkyrie? And to think subjugation of the lower is supposed to be the angels in the north role. Promestien said. In the next moment, a divine light fills the hall.  A holy aura fills the room\u2026. \u2026.I received permission from eden for my advent to the lower world. I shall face the disgraced heroes. A voice said. A pure white angel descends down the beam right in front of you both.  An arch angel!? An angel of that class descending to the human world\u2026.!?  Alice said. You both get a powerful feeling from her. You try to stand up, but are exhausted. You are the disgrace hero luka. I see\u2026.. you do indeed have physical power beyond reason. And so does your friend here. It is dangerous to even allow a soul such as you two to participate in the Samsara of reincarnation. I must violate the both of your bodies, and suck up your spirit. Luka calms himself, but has a worried look on his face when he sees you still on one knee. I\u2019m fine. Beat her. You say. Since you\u2019re the weakest, I\u2019ll take your soul first. She said. As she flies towards you, luka blocks her. You\u2019ll have to fight me first. Luka said. I\u2019m not going to be looked down on. You say as you stand beside luka. Such a fiery spirit. She said. You both attack together. There\u2019s no greater luxury than the mouth of an angel. She said. Ariel sucks diligently sucks on luka\u2019s penis. Are you sure you can fight? That wound looks serious. Luka said. Don\u2019t worry about me\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve been in worse situations. You say.(But why hasn\u2019t the wound healed? It should have been healed by now.) You thought. Here I go! Luka said. His sword flashes like a frenzied star. You attack. My oral technique is unmatched. She said. Ariel sucks gently on luka\u2019s penis. You both attack together. (I can\u2019t keep up. Blood lost.) You thought. You fall on one knee again. Already done? She said. N\u2026. Not yet! You say. You nod at luka and you both calm your hearts. A serene state of mind\u2026.. I know that trick. You synchronize yourself with the air around you, seeing the enemy\u2019s movements as waves through it. It almost like you can see the future of their actions, and dodge their blows. So if I control my thirst for blood and intent to the maximum, you won\u2019t be able to do anything. She said. Guh\u2026.. you know how to beat the skill? Luka said. I am one of the few angels who survived the fight with heinrich. I am fully aware of that skill\u2019s weak points. She said. \u2026..The hero heinrich? Luka said. You and luka both attack. Now take the wrath of the heavens! She said.  An electric current fires from ariel\u2019s arm into your body. You sense the energy and dodge it. You both attack. I\u2019ll use these breast to stimulate you. She said. She sandwiches luka\u2019s between her breast.  You firmly grab your knife handle and swing it, creating a purple wave that hits her.  Luka rests his hand on the hilt, drawing a fluid slash. What strength\u2026. Eden\u2019s concerns\u2026..were correct\u2026.! Ariel fades into particles, and vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe won\u2026. Somehow. Luka said. </span></div></div>",

Promestein looks up to the ceiling, and starts talking. \u2026..Don\u2019t pretend you can\u2019t hear me, Eden. I told you to leave the hero to me first. She said. You pant hard. After beating the last of the chimeric beast, alice stands next to luka. Is there no end to them? You say. The gaping wound finally is healed. (Finally.) You thought. Not unless we take out the leader. Alice said. Oh, this looks interesting. Then I\u2019ll be the monster lord\u2019s opponent. Arc-en-ciel said. Promistein waves her hand at the eager Arc-en-ciel. No\u2026. There are already counter measures in place for the monster lord and hero. Your interference is not necessary.  Promistein said. \u2026..Countermeasures? I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re planning, but you\u2019re underestimating me! Alice said. As alice leaps towards promistein, she reads her attack. \u2026..Monster lord, you will have the same fate as the dark god and the six ancestors. Promistein said. The moment slice\u2019s blow was about to hit promistein, A magic seal appears on alice, stopping her. Wh\u2026.! What is this!? Alice said. An intense electricity fills the air as the magic seal flickers. That a powerful seal. You say. Capture complete\u2026\u2026 Now for the transfer. Promistein said. In the next moment, alice was gone. What happened to alice!? Luka said. What did you do with her? You say. Do you both remember that barrier? You should have seen something similar in the basement at grangold. She said. Where the ant queen was sealed at? Luka said. It is the same magic. You say. This is the most powerful seal barrier that exists. A seal I researched from ancient times, called the Six ancestors\u2019 great seal. The ultimate seal, used to seal the dark god alipheese and the six ancestors. It took several hundred years to reproduce it. She said. Dark god? You say. The ancient dark god known as the first monster lord. And the ancestors of all monsters, the six great monsters. It is the ultimate seal. There\u2019s no way the inferior current alipheese could fight it. She said. So that\u2019s why you experimented on the queen ant! To test it on alice! Luka said. Not quite. That was a low model, with low output. It would do nothing more than hold her for a short while. But this complete version\u2026 The power to maintain itself is supplied by the one it is sealing. She said. So where did alice go!? Luka said. Haha\u2026. Do you think I would tell you that easily? She said. Then I\u2019ll force it out of you! Luka said. Luka charges at her. Luka, no! You say. I said countermeasures\u2026. That includes you too.  I prepared a separate seal. Just for you\u2026 A wide area seal, operating now! She said. Guh\u2026.! Luka said. He braces himself, but nothing happened. What happened\u2026.. ? Did it fail? Luka said. Did you not notice something unusual with your body? She said. Unusual? What are \u2026\u2026!? Sylph? Gnome? Undine? Salamander? What did you do, promestein? Luka said.  I developed a special seal against the elements of the four spirits that covers the whole world. It works basically the same way as a seal against evil, only more targeted\u2026  She said. Sealed throughout the whole world!? Luka said. The spirits are almost akin to a force of nature itself. To seal them, it had to be deployed across the entire world. It was quite bothersome to set up, but it seems to be worth it. Now you\u2019re just a kid who\u2019s decent with a sword. She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next moment, a chimeric beast jumps at luka. Guh\u2026.! Luka said. Luka thrust, but he doesn\u2019t have a fraction of his past speed. The chimeric beast dodges his thrust and slashes at him with its nail. He parry the nail with his sword, but can\u2019t stop the momentum. Barley guarding, he crashes to the floor. With that, your power was completely blocked.  Now even a single beast is more than your match. \u2026\u2026But you\u2019re not completely worthless. The fact that the spirits responded to you to begin with is very interesting. She said. You help luka up, but chimeric beast surrounds you both. I think there\u2019s no way out of this. Luka said. (the heavenly knights being pushed hard, the spirits are gone, and so is alice. We\u2019re in deep shit.) You thought. (Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s time to throw in the towel?) He said. (No. I just need to think for a few minutes.) You said. You should just surrender now. I promise to keep you alive for 100 years if you do. I\u2019ll give you plenty of pleasure as a guinea pig. It\u2019s not a bad deal, is it? She said. Grrrr\u2026..! Luka\u2026.. You said. Remind me to thank you later on\u2026.. Luka mutters. For what? You say. This\u2026.. We\u2019re not surrendering! No matter what, we will fight to the end! Very well, then you\u2019ll come with us by force. Until only your brains, spine and genitals are left, I\u2019ll continue to experiment on you. Amphisbaena, cut off their limbs. She said. Hehe, what a wonderful task\u2026. Leave it to me. She said. Amphisbaena flashes her sharp sickle in front of you both, and steps closer. Your eyes turn optical and luka readys his sword. But before anyone can attack, a large vibration rocks the hall. What the fuck was that!? You say.  A huge monster smashes through the nearby wall. It\u2019s the giganto weapon\u2026.. With tammo riding on her back. Did I make it in time? Hahaha! She said. Tammo directs the giganto weapon, charging right into the chimeric beasts surrounding you both. The huge monster lashes out with her gigantic nails and tails, swatting all of them away. One after the other, the beast are thrown into the wall. Wahwahwah! Woah, girl, woah!  Tammo said. How\u2019d she fix that thing? I thought we killed it. You say. Giganto weapon. A relic from the sacred monster wars. I wasn\u2019t aware of anyone with the knowledge to restart this being, but me. Promestien said. Tammo tumbles of the monster. She\u2019s lost control of that thing. You say. \u2026.Why is that thing coming here? I\u2019ll pass on that kind of opponent. Hainuwele said. Then I\u2019ll play with it\u2026.. Are-en-ciel said. She takes a step forward. With one hand, she stops the charging giganto weapon. Forcibly grbbing hold of the giganto weapon, Arc-en-ciel tosses her over, and slams her gigantic body into the floor. The floor itself fractures into thousands of tiny cracks as the force of impact causes the whole castle to shake. What are these things? You say. N\u2026. No way\u2026 Luka said. As she kicks the thing,, cracks line the floor, and start spreading to the walls with each blow. She\u2019s going to bring this place down. Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..it\u2019s over. How disappointing. She said. (She owned that thing in seconds.) You said. (\u2026\u2026.Move.) He said. You feel your body forcibly taken over. This is the ancient ultimate weapon, produced during the sacred monster wars? Were the fighters back then of such low quality that this was considered powerful? She said.  Don\u2019t say that, Arc-en-ciel. The power she held back then doesn\u2019t even compare to today. Just getting her to operate after 1,000 years of inactivity is impressive.  That wasn\u2019t even a shadow of her true power. Promestien said. I see\u2026. Truly a pity. Too bad, I wanted to fight the so called ultimate weapon with her full power. Arc-en-ciel said. (They don\u2019t know that he holds that title. I don\u2019t know who to be more scared of: The five chimeras. Or him.) Luka thought. These five chimeras are the ultimate in hand made beings, using the pinnacle of my technology. Next doll\u2026. The ultimate chimeras. There probably is no worldly opponent that can stand up to these five\u2026 Not even the four heavenly knights. Promestein said. Hmph\u2026. He said. \u2026..Now then, it seems things are done here. Take the disgrace hero as a sample, and mop up the last of the monsters. Make sure to rid everything in this castle. She said. The remaning chimeric beasts impatianly move closer, but Tammo steps in their way. I\u2019m not letting you have all the fun. He said. \u2026\u2026these artificial monster\u2019s brains are those taken from beast monster\u2019s aren\u2019t they? Tammo said. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s the most cost effective way when considering mass production. Promestien said. If they have brains of beasts\u2026. They know what will happen if they cross me. Tammo said. Your eyes shine red and have an evil grin on your face. The chimera beast suddenly appears as if they are terrified.  What\u2019s wrong? Not going to attack? Tammo said. What happen to all of that courage they had? He said. Oh\u2026. These two seem more interesting.  I\u2019d like to face these two. No\u2026. Arc-en-ciel, we\u2019re falling back. Promistien said. Arc-en-ciel\u2019s face turns into one of  disgust. \u2026.You can\u2019t be serious!? She said. That\u2019s right. Run away like cowards. He said. The monster lord\u2019s power was sealed, and the hero was sterilized. We\u2019ve already accomplish our goals. Promistien said. I do not like this\u2026. But you\u2019re my creator. I simply obey. Arc-en-ciel said. Puppet. He said. You\u2019ve escaped with your life\u2026. For now. Promistien said. She turns around and walks away. The chimeric beast all follow after her. Wait! What happened to alice!? Luka said. If you want to know, come after  me. But if you don\u2019t hurry, you may never see your dear minster lord again. Promestien said as she leaves. Guh\u2026Wait! Luka said. Do not give in to her provocations! Tammo said. Luka ignores her and runs off. Damn kid will get killed if I don\u2019t go after him. He said. He goes after him.</span></div></div>",

Where is luka? Remina! You say. You hurried over to remina to catch up to luka. Luka! Where are you? you shout. you look all around, but can't find him. Damn. Where'd he go? you say. You look at the ground and notice a hatch that looks out of place. .....A hatch? Here. Could luka..... You say. You open the hatch and climb down. Whoa all these sci-fi stuff. Promistien has been a busy fallen angel. You say. You hear an alarm go off. Shit, if luka was discovered.... You rush around, looking for him. What is this place? You say. You look and see monsters that looked like they have been experimented on. These monster seem to be have been combined with others. Experimentation. Life being toyed with. you say angrily. You look on the ground and see a pool of gooey liquid. One of these monster must have gotten out. Luka was here for sure. I must be getting close to him. You say. You walk on and see broken machine, doors. This can\u2019t be luka\u2019s work. Someone here wanted to be found out. You say. You see a few of these experimental monster are out, but don\u2019t attack you. You go in deeper. You examine a wrecked door. The entrances here are no more than waist height. It can\u2019t be tammo, she\u2019s at the castle. You say. (I do feel a low power in here. Could it be\u2026..)  you thought. If I follow the path of destruction, I should reach the center of it. You say. You follow the destruction. The damage gets worse and worse. Some here was mad as hell. You say. You feel the energy. Uh\u2026.! A huge energy source. I\u2019m getting closer to it. Luka, you better not have do anything stupid until I get there. You say. Then you stop. The huge source of energy is gone. You say. You run ahead. You get to the source, but no one is there. Damn! Am I too late? You say. You look around and see a hole in the ceiling. You can see signs of battles. You look around. Tammo was here. So was luka\u2026\u2026 and alice. So my hunch was right. You say. You jump through the hole. Where is he? You say. Hey! A voice said. You see it\u2019s Tammo. Tammo. Where\u2019s luka? You say.  Him and alice rushed off to his home village. She said. Why? You say. Human village all over are being attacked by angels and chimeras. She said. What!? You say. Ilias plans on wiping out humanity and creating the world anew. She said. Not on my watch! I have to get to luka! You say. Wait, you\u2019ll probably be killed trying to get there. Plus, they took galda so you have no way to get there. She said. So what do I do? Just stand here and wait until all of humanity is dead? You say. No. I know you won\u2019t let this happen, but rushing in will not do you any good. She said. \u2026\u2026you\u2019re right. Luka\u2026\u2026 So what about you? You say. Me? I\u2019m going after the monster lord. She said. You think you can handle going there yourself? You say. Haha\u2026\u2026 have you forgotten who I am? She said. No. Not at all. You say. Then tammo vanishes. I\u2019m not going to sit around as humanity dies. You say. Your eyes turn optical and you disappear. You reappear in a forest. If I\u2019m correct, I\u2019m in the second half of the continent. Luka can handle the first. I\u2019ll start with grand noah. You say. You head to grand noah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see it\u2019s under siege. You rush to find the queen, beating up a couple of monsters on the way. You rescue a soldier from being killed. Where\u2019s the queen? You say. Ah\u2026. You were the one that was in the arena. The queen is safe, but some powerful monsters got past. Can you give a hand? He said. Yes. Which way? You say. He points towards the way. You rush there you cut down a few of them. You see two monsters crumpled on the floor in front of the door leading to the queen\u2019s palace. Minotar! Dallahan! You say. Oh, the hero\u2019s friend has arrive. The lamiaroid said. Queen\u2026\u2026 must\u2026\u2026 protect\u2026.. Dallahan said. Right! If you want to get to the queen you\u2019ll have to go through me! You say. (Half lamia, half robotic.) You thought. Oh\u2026.. I\u2019ve heard the rumors of the hero and his friend, but you are cuter than I\u2019d imagine. And you look delicious. She said. She looks at you with a weird smile. Maybe it\u2019s fine to give the queen to her. I see better prey right in front of me. She said. Her? So someone else is here? You say. Ahaha\u2026. Just think of me right now. I\u2019ll squeeze out your semen with every function I have. You\u2019ll get to feel how wonderful each one is as I make you come over and over again\u2026 She said. Just try it! You say. You attack. I have a lot of confidence in my tail. She said. Her tail tries to coil around you, but you grab it, pull her towards you and punch her in the face. You throw your knife and it phases through her. You disappear and reappear behind her. Time catches up and a bright flash cuts through her. \u2026..I was inferior\u2026.? So I\u2019m the decoy\u2026. So she\u2019ll win after all. She said. Lamiaroid dies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGot to save the queen! You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was she referring to? You say. No\u2026. It can\u2019t be. Dullahan said. Despite her damaged body dullahan jumps up and opens the door. No\u2026.. Her majesty\u2026\u2026 She was in this room\u2026 She said. There\u2019s a note in the chair. You say. \u201cif you want the queen, come to the colosseum alone, hero luka.\u201d Was written.  Whoever has the queen wants to fight luka. You say. What a blunder\u2026. Dallahan said. We are at war, but the person who wrote this is someone driven by honor. They wouldn\u2019t leave a note otherwise. She must be that good. You say. I must go aid her majesty! Dallahan said. No. You\u2019re too banged up. She wants luka, but he probably won\u2019t be here for a long time and we don\u2019t have that kind of time to burn. I\u2019ll do it You say. \u2026\u2026I saw you in the tournament last time you were here. Maybe you can save the queen\u2026\u2026 She said. You rush to the colosseum. You get there and enter the arena. You see the queen is handcuffed in the stands. \u2026\u2026Who are you? You\u2019re not luka. A voice said. You look up and see a monster standing on top of a pillar. She jumps down in front of you. Are you the one who took the queen? You say. Yes. I\u2019m knightroid. A part machine stalwart follower of Arc-en-ciel! She said. (She looks light on her feet.) you thought. I asked for luka. Where is he? She said. Luka doesn\u2019t deal with kidnappers. I handle the trash that deserves cleaning. You say. I gave a challenge to luka. And in return, I get a random human? She said. Believe me lady, I\u2019m no random human. How about you fight me instead? You say. You? Why would I waste my time with you? She said. Because I\u2019m luka\u2019s friend. And if he\u2019s as good as you heard, just imagine me? You say. \u2026\u2026.Hmmmm. She said. Let\u2019s make this interesting. If I win, the queen goes free. You say. And if I win? She said. Then you get rape and kill me. Like you would do with luka. You say. \u2026\u2026..Alright. I accept. I could use a sparring partner while I wait. She said. You do know how the rules in a colosseum works, right? Two go in, one come out. You say. Yes. Now come and show me if you are as good as you say you are. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attack her. This move will crush you! She said. She moves as fast as gale and quickly thrust light lightning, but you dodge her. Huh? She said. You roundhouse kick her. Sent her into the wall. Heh. Is it over already? You say. She charges as fast as a gale through the dust, but you punch her in the face when she gets close. Hnoh. You say. Maybe I underestimated you. I didn\u2019t give you enough credit before. But now I\u2019m serious! She said. Then come and show me your fighter spirit. You say. I\u2019ll crush you! She said. She jumps up high and tries to crush your skull with her sword, but you catch her sword and toss her aside. You charge her and try to punch her, but she sidesteps you. You smile. Huh? She said. You disappear and reappear above her. What!? She said. You crash down on her with your knife aimed at her heart, but she blocks it with her spear. She pushes you away. You throw your knife, but she dodges it. Ha! She said. You charge her and punch her, but she blocks it with her spear. You smile. Huh? She said. Then she felt something impale her in the back. She turns her head and sees it\u2019s your knife. But\u2026.. How? I evade it. She said. You lose. You say. You kick her hard into the wall that your knife plunges deep into her skin, and piercing her heart. I regret nothing\u2026\u2026 I gave everything I had. But\u2026. Arc-en-ciel is much stronger than me. She said as she falls to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is how a fight in the coliseum should be. You say.</span></div></div>",

Looks like your restraints are gone. It must have been a released when Knightroid was defeated. You say.  You escort the queen to her palace. Your friends with luka, yes? She said. Yes. You say. Thank you for saving me and my people As a queen, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. She said. No, it was nothing. The monster attacking fled once they knew there leader is dead. You say. You bow your head to the queen. Can you do something for me queen? You say. What is it? She said. If luka comes here, tell him I\u2019ll be at yamatai village. You say. Yes. You have my word. She said. You leave Grand Noah and head to yamatai village. You get there and see it\u2019s in chaos. Villagers attempting to run back and barricade themselves in their homes. This is not good!  There are so many. Find the leader! You say. You save a couple of villagers from some lamias. Y\u2026. You! I remember you! The village elder said. Elder! Which shrine is the main one? You say. I\u2026..think the snake one. He said. You quickly rush towards the snake shine. You open the door and see naked villagers all over. What happened here? You say. You step in and check the pulse of one villager. He\u2019s alive, but very faint. You say (Someone must have tasted them and squeezed them dry.) you thought. Sir, did you see who did this? You say. M\u2026..m\u2026\u2026.m\u2026\u2026Miko\u2026.. He said. Miko? She must be strong to do all this. You say. Hehe, oh don\u2019t complement me like that. I am the tenacious miko lamia who left them like that. A voice said. You see her behind you. Hehe\u2026.. A good one came right to me. I\u2019ll squeeze out all your semen, too.  I hate killing, so I won\u2019t kill you. I\u2019ll just weaken you with pleasure, and leave you unable to do anything else but offer semen. She said. Fat chance! You say. (Lamias are no joke. I better watch myself here.) You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attack her. Just lay back and feel my hands\u2026.. She said. All ten of her fingers stroke you, but you grab both of her arms and kick her back. Oh my. Such violence. She said. I\u2019ve gotten this far without being rape, I\u2019m not about to be raped now! You disappear and reappear behind her and slash her from behind. Stop moving! She said. She coils around you. Guh\u2026.! You say. She tightens her grip on you. Hehe, I\u2019ll squeeze you into submission. She said. She tightens her hold on you. Get off me! You say. You break free and grab your knife and slice her down her tail. You grab her as she tries to slither away and you hold her by her hair and are about to go for the kill, but you stop and just smash her face into the ground. Master shirohebe\u2026.. Forgive me. My power\u2026\u2026. Was not enough\u2026. She said before she passes into unconsciousness.<br>\r\nBe glad I didn\u2019t kill you\u2026.. you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirohebe\u2026\u2026. Must be the leader.  But wasn\u2019t she for coexistence? You say. You head for shirohebe shirne. Out of my way! You say. You beat up some monsters. On the way to the shirne, you see two familiar monsters. Isn\u2019t that the goblin girl and the cat. They\u2019re in trouble! You say.  You jump in and kill the swarming chimeric beasts. You two alright? You say. The hero from before! Thank you! Goblin girl said. Unyaa\u2026. Nekomata said.  Save the hugs and kisses for later, we got company! You say. More chimeric beast. You kill a couple of them, but more of them come. Argh! There\u2019s too many of them! You say. (I can\u2019t fight while looking after them\u2026\u2026. Unless\u2026..) You thought. (No.) He said. (Just do it\u2026.. We can\u2019t waste time.) You say. (Fine.) He said. Your body is taken over. I\u2026\u2026 I won\u2019t run away\u2026.. I\u2019ll protect me friend. Goblin girl said. Goblin! He said. Huh? She said. He grabs the goblin girl by the arm and stares at goblin girl. Wh\u2026..what the\u2026..? I\u2026\u2026 I feel strength! She said. Power starts radiating from her tiny body. No\u2026\u2026 it isn\u2019t able to all fit in her small body.  Uoooo! She said. Goblin girl\u2019s body suddenly expands, changing her appearance more closely matching the huge strength radiating from her. He lets go of her arm. (I hate awakening people\u2019s potential power. What happened to doing it yourself?) he thought.  A chimeric beast jumps at goblin girl. Too slow\u2026.. I\u2019ll bring you down! She said. With a single, powerful slash, Goblin girl splits the large chimeric beast in half. (You own me.) He said. You take back your body. Can you and nekomata handle this while I go after shirohebi? You say. Yes, leave it to us! She said. Nya! Nekomata said. You head towards shirohebi shrine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing through a tori, you run inside the shrine. Sitting there with a glare in her eyes is a regal, powerful looking monster. You\u2019re not the same lamia I saw last time I was here. You said. \u2026\u2026Indeed, I am the new ruler of yamatai village, Shirohebe. You have been something of a nuisance here\u2026..  She said. If by nuisance, you mean saving people, then yes. Now, who\u2019s really pulling strings here? There\u2019s no way you could have done this alone. You say. Hehe\u2026.. Why would I give that information to you? She said. Because it could be the difference between if I let you live. I don\u2019t know who is pulling the strings, but I know a war is being fought. Do you really think Illias will let you rule? You say. I won\u2019t forgive a nuisance like you. I\u2019ll squeeze you dry. No\u2026\u2026 Prey as good as you shouldn\u2019t be squeezed and thrown away. I\u2019ll keep you as my toy\u2026\u2026forever. She said. You\u2019re drunk on power. It\u2019s time for you to come off your high horse. Willingly or knocked off! You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attack her. I\u2019ll take a good suck on your penis. She said. You knee her in the chin when she gets close. Not toady! You say. You attack her. I shall give you comfort with my breast. You dodge her and step on her tail. Guh\u2026..! She said. You stab her in the back. My\u2026..Power\u2026.! Black Alice\u2026.. This wasn\u2019t what you promised! She said. Shirohebi falls on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s all? Can you really call yourself a lamia? You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look outside and see the attacking monsters dispersing. Ok. You say. You look and see another lamia laying in a crimpled heap. That\u2019s the one from last time. You say. You wake her up. Ugh\u2026\u2026 My mistake\u2026\u2026 My sister\u2026..She said. Right there. I didn\u2019t kill her. Just sent her into shock.  You say. Thank you for stopping her. She said. You\u2019re welcome. What are you going to do with her? She\u2019s not sealed. You say. I\u2019m going to keep her in a safe place where she won\u2019t harm anyone. She said. I\u2019ll leave you to decide her punishment. You say. You leave the shrine. You see all the people clamoring around the nekomata and goblin girl. You see the goblin girl shrink back to her original size. Oh, ms. Shirohebi. Can you relay a massage for me? You say. Yes. What is it? She said. If luka comes here, tell him I went to plansect village. You said. I will make sure he receives it. She said. Thank you mam. You say. You leave and head for plansect village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m getting close, I\u2019ve seen those strange trees before. You say. You feel a strange presence. Show yourselves! I know you\u2019re there. No use hiding. You say. You see two familiar monster appears . Mosquito girl? Alra? You say. Ah! The hero from before! Please, help us! Mosquito girl said. Our pursuer is already here! Alra said. Whoa, whoa!  Slow down you two. What happened? You say. (they look terrified.) You thought. You feel the presence of another monster. You see it\u2019s a walraune. Found you\u2026.. Eh? Why is a human here?  An order to dispose of a human wasn\u2019t given\u2026\u2026 Now, please hand over those two. If you do, I\u2019ll overlook you this time. She said. And what will happen to them? You say.  For the insect, I\u2019ll slowly suck up her nutrients as food, nice and slowly. For Arum\u2026.. Dince she\u2019s a traitor who went to the insects, I\u2019ll dispose of her. She said. Your eyes turn optical. Leave. Forget you ever saw us. You say. Yes, master. She said. Walraune vanishes. T\u2026. thank you. But most of our friends have been captured. Mosquito girl said. Please, help them! If they don\u2019t escape, they\u2019ll be tortured. Alra said. What\u2019s going on here? I thought everyone was on good terms now. You say. A little while ago, a party led by queen alraune came to the village. They said they had something important to tell us, so we welcomed them in, but\u2026.. Alra said. What? You say. Queen alraune has turn into a tyrant. She wants to wipe out all the insect monsters. She said. I thought we settled this. You say. The group that the queen led here is attacking everyone. Both insects, and those of us plants that sided with coexistence. She said. Was she always like this? You say. No. She was a calm, gentle monster, but something has corrupted her. Alra said.(Could this be that black alice I heard about?) You thought. Is she still in the forest? You ask. Yes\u2026. She caught lots of my brethren. Alra said. Lots of insects were caught to be sucked up for nutrients. They all need help, too. Mosquito girl said. Alright. I\u2019ll save them. You say.  We\u2019ll help to protect our friends as much as we can, and try to distract the pursuers. Mosquito girl said. The plant family will do our best to help, too! Queen Alraune\u2019s conduct is not what we believe in any longer! Alra said. Ok, I\u2019m going to queen alrune. You say. Please, rescue everyone. Alra said. You each part in different ways, and you rush to queen alrune.</span></div></div>",

Then you grip your head. This\u2026\u2026 Pain\u2026.. You say. Then the world around you changed. This is\u2026\u2026 You say. You see you\u2019re on the roof of the palace. Remember this. Tom said. Tom appears out of nowhere. What does this have to do with anything? You say. You don\u2019t remember? Have you forgotten? This was the day you challenged Kyle and his elites to a 5 on 1. He said. What does this have to do with me? You say. You gave them 3 days to prepare for the fight, and you didn\u2019t tell any of us about it. Had to find out about it AFTER you won. He said. It was between me and them. You say. Did you even consider telling us so we could help? He said. I challenged them so I could show them that no matter what they did, I\u2019m always better than them. You say. Do you really care about anyone but yourself? Did you only have us around to use as a buffer between you and them? He said. I did not use anyone as a buffer and I do care about others. You say. Then why go it alone? Why do you have to go and do everything by yourself? And don\u2019t say it\u2019s to protect us. He said. Because\u2026\u2026 You say. Uh-hun. Keep this death wish, and it will be given to you. He said as he disappears. Then everything returns to normal. (The hallucination is trying to destroy me. I got to find a way to stop it before it kills me or makes me kill myself.) you thought. You keep walking through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(You fought the elites 5v1\u2026..and came out on top.) He said. (Yeah.) You say. (Why did the good stuff happen when I\u2019m gone?) He said. ( It wasn\u2019t hard. After I won, everyone saw me different. Even my friends.) You say. (So you just up and decided to fight them 5v1.) He said. (Kind of. Kyle hinted at it and I declared it. I\u2019ve fought against four of them. Koyuki was second in command, so only she was the one who I never fought until then. She lasted longer than anyone of them and she even\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll let you surf my memories.) You say. (She didn\u2019t\u2026\u2026 and you\u2026\u2026) He said. (Yep. 500ft tall and still kick her ass.) You say. (So no one messes with us now?) he said.(Not anymore. Noone wants to fight a person who can beat up a 500ft giantess.) You say. (So our lives will be boring from now on.) He said. (We still have luke to try and beat.) You say.( Only him as an exception.) He said. As you walk through the forest, you feel something strange. What\u2019s this feeling? I\u2019ve never felt something like this before. You say. (It\u2019s like something is slowly turning this forest in the wrong direction.) You thought. You think for a second until it hits you. (Now I remember this feeling\u2026\u2026. No. Whoever is behind this\u2026\u2026.) You say. You rush through the forest. You reach plan village and see a horrible sight. You see monsters covered in ivy and being drained of their energy all over the place. Even alra priestess. And standing in the center of it all was Queen alraune. Oh my\u2026.. What business does a human have here? There\u2019s no way you wandered here by mistake, is there? She said. (As I feared, she\u2019s been brainwashed. The only way to snap a person out of it is to take out the caster, but who could do brainwashing on a queen class monster? The monsters here don\u2019t have much time. I need to beat this queen fast.) You thought. I\u2019m going to have to knock you out for a while. You say. Boy\u2026.. Appearing out of nowhere, and saying such strange things. I\u2019ll suck up your nutrients for that. She said. Quivering with desire, the queen moves towards you as she accepts your challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attack her. Dye this hand white\u2026. She said. She tries to grab your penis, but you dodge her and axe kick on the head. Can you keep up? You say. Your eyes turn optical and you disappear and reappear behind her. In the next second, a bright flash cuts through queen alruane. This ivy will massage you\u2026. She said. Countless branches of ivy race towards you. You grab your knife and start cutting the branches. You attack her. This flower will suck up your semen with delight. She said. Petals try to wrap around you, but you burn each and every one of them. You attack here. Let me give you a gentle hug. Immerse yourself in the pleasure of my petals. She said. She hugs you with her voluptuous body. Petals wrap around your lower body, encasing it in a flower. Isn\u2019t being embraced the best? You should climax while you taste sweet pleasure. She said. Grrrr\u2026\u2026! You say. You power your way free. Oh, you escaped before I could suck you. She said. Don\u2019t blink\u2026.. You say. You disappear and reappear above her and hit her hard on the skull. Urhg\u2026.. I\u2026.. What was i\u2026. She said.   Queen alraune falters, as the dimness in her fades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I got her back to her senses. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen alraune, are you free? You say. Yes, my sanity has returned to me. I\u2019ve done a horrible thing\u2026 She said. The magic energy pouring out of her is far different now than it was before.( Ok, this feeling is calm and benevolent.) You thought. The monsters nearby are having their energy restored. If I reverse the absorption like this, nobody should lose their life\u2026. She said. Do you know what caused you to lose your mind? Someone had to have casted a very strong brainwashing on you. You say.  That person is very close still\u2026. Be on your guard! She said. As soon as she shouts that, a wicked aura oppress the air. Oh\u2026\u2026 Did you break through my fox technique? As expected of a queen\u2026. A voice said. (One of those dolls that attacked the castle. I think this one was called Tsukuyomi. She didn\u2019t show her skills at the castle, but she was the user of this technique.) You thought. You said that skill was fox. You\u2019re not a kitsune\u2026\u2026.. Unless\u2026\u2026 You say. Tammo\u2019s cells were used in the creation of my body. Her ceels were collected, combined and synthesized with machine technology, and lead to my creation as an artificial life form. She said. In other word, you\u2019re just clone of tammo. You say. But the plan has ended in complete failure. The brainwashed queen was supposed to destroy plansect through an internal war. It looks like I\u2019ll just have to kill everyone myself after all\u2026 that\u2019s so\u2026\u2026 boring. She said. You wanted us to kill each other without doing it yourself\u2026. I will never forgive you. Queen alraune said. (The queen is not happy, but this doll looks like it\u2019s hiding something.) You thought. Oh ho\u2026.. So you can\u2019t forgive me, huh? Tsukuyomi said. I will never let you harm my brethren again! I\u2019ll train some discipline into that body! Queen alraune said. Ivy grows from queen alraune, and wraps around tsukuyomi\u2019s body. Just surrender. That way I won\u2019t kill you. She said. My, my\u2026\u2026 Aren\u2019t you the kind one? As for me\u2026. Even if you surrender, you\u2019ll probably die anyway. Tsukuyomi said.  Power starts accumulate inside tsukuyomi\u2019s body. (Is that the power of earth?) You thought.  This power\u2026\u2026 Queen alraune said. taking a deep breath, tsukuyomi masses all of her power\u2026. And blows away the vines holding her, shredding them all into pieces. With the power of earth, no binding technique will work on me. Tsukuyomi said. With a quick dash, Tsukuyomi steps right next to the queen\u2019s face. And brings an earth infused punch racing towards her body. The fist lands right on her body. The incredible strength of the earth echoing through her body in one pulverizing wave. Ah\u2026\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u2026 Queen alraune said. (That hit looked like it destroyed every organ in her body.) You thought. With just a single blow, the queen collapses to the ground with a grunt. The monsters held by the ivy fall to the ground. Still weak, most of them are unconscious. M\u2026\u2026 My\u2026\u2026 Queen\u2026.. Alra priestess says. You rush to the queen\u2019s side with alra priestess. The hit was fatal. You say. You\u2019re going to pay for that! You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to attack Tsukuyomi, but an ivy root pulls you away and a huge petal surrounds her.  T\u2026.. this is my\u2026. Last\u2026. Queen alraune said.  Haha, what good will a few seconds do you? Surly you know well the power I hold in my body. Tsukuyomi said. All I need\u2026\u2026 is to stop your feet\u2026. For a few seconds\u2026 Then\u2026. Refine\u2026 She said. Refine? What are you going on about? Tsukuyomi said. What\u2019s she doing? You say. A cage of petals surrounds Tsukuyomi. (There\u2019s something not right about those petals.) You thought.  Is that poison? You say. Toxic gas pours out of the petals. The gas fades, and the petals rot away in only moments. I\u2026\u2026it ca\u2026\u2026.can\u2019t\u2026.p\u2026\u2026poison\u2026..m..m\u2026..me? Tsukuyomi isn\u2019t dead, but she\u2019s stumbling around, barely able to speak.  She\u2019s still alive!? You say. C\u2026.can\u2019t\u2026..see\u2026. Can\u2019t\u2026\u2026.n\u2026..neutralize\u2026\u2026quick \u2026\u2026enough\u2026.. She said. (She\u2019s weak! Now\u2019s my chance!) You say. You go for the killing blow, but a cloud of dust stops you when Tsukuyomi hit the dirt.  When the dust clears, she\u2019s gone. She got away. How could she move so quickly in her current state? Never mind that. The queen! You say.</span></div></div>",

You refused to wipe out the insects in exchange for queenship\u2026. You have the heart necessary for the queen of the next era\u2026.  Priestess\u2026\u2026 After this\u2026.. you\u2026..are\u2026.. She said. My queen ! Alra priestess said. You check her pulse. She\u2019s gone. You say. Alra priestess hold queen alraunes lifeless body. Even the surrounding insect monsters go silent at her death, her life traded to save the village. (Damnit! Why did it have to be her?) You thought. ( the cost of war\u2026\u2026)He said.  You saty for the mourning of her death. After the burial of the previous queen, the village finally calms down. Alra priestess, now queen priestess, bows her head to you. I can never thank you enough. I thank you for the efforts you made for this village from the bottom of my heart. Alra said. But we couldn\u2019t save queen alraune. You say. I was powerless to\u2026. No, I couldn\u2019t do nothing at all. I am pathetic. I do not have the right to be queen. Alra said. You did a good job as priestess. You can do a good job as a queen. All you need is confidence in yourself. The old queen had confidence in you. You\u2019re a reliable leader. Under pressure and bribes, you didn\u2019t go against what you thought was right. You say. We are not dumb enough to repeat the mistake of the past. Besides\u2026\u2026 I had no wish to be beaten up again by you or luka. She said. With that, alra priestess laughs. \u2026.But still, we must move forward. Though we are suffering from her lost, we will not waste the queen alrune\u2019s death. Alra said. Right. If you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate to ask. I\u2019ll do whatever I can. You say. I will. She said. Anyways, I better get going. There\u2019s still places in trouble that need help. You say. There are many who need your power now, I am sure. Thank you again for now, and in the future. Alra said. yes! You do your best too, queen. You say. With that, you leave and head for grandgold castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to grangold castle and see it\u2019s already in turmoil. You rush into the city. You see spider type monsters are attacking, with ant girls valiantly defending. Spider monsters are strong, but I don\u2019t think they have the numbers to match the ant girls. Where\u2019s the grangold king and queen ant? You say.You say. You look up and see a shadow flying between building, like something soaring through the air. (Flying spider!) He said. The shadow races down into the fray below. Hehe, how pathetic. Insects fighting each other. After losing your queen, you\u2019re just pitiful prey. She said. Get the enemy. An ant girl said. The nearby ant girls rush to attack her, but stop and start twitching in place. Suddenly, all of the other ant girls start to squirms where they stand. (it\u2019s a spider web.) you thought. You\u2019re already in my territory. Even if you struggle, my sticky threads won\u2019t let you move\u2026 She said. (All of those ant girls caught by a single spider monster.) You thought. You poor insect monsters\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll prey on you slowly, one by one\u2026\u2026 She said. \u2026\u2026That\u2019s enough! You say. You jump right into the fight. You\u2019re fighting me now! You say. Oh\u2026.. You\u2019re friends with the disgraced hero. More appetizing prey has come right into my web. But I know you\u2019ve beaten many monsters up until now, so I\u2019ll fight you on my territory with my best abilities. She said. Suddenly, the space around you changes. In the next moment, you\u2019re standing in the middle of a gloomy cave. Where are we? You say. In a confined space like this, a spider monster can show there true strength. I\u2019ll suck you dry nice and slowly as you twitch in my web. She said. Don\u2019t think just because you have the home field advantage, you\u2019ll win. You say. You attack her. Does this feel good? She said. Tsuchigumo uses her eight legs and massages you, but you dodge her. (Tight area. Time to get aerobic.) You thought. You jump from wall to wall and come down hard on her skull. I see\u2026\u2026 I may have underestimated you. She said. Let\u2019s see how you do now that where both on even ground! You say. You attack.  I\u2019ll cover your penis with the silk in my mouth. She said. When she gets close to you, you knee her on the chin, stunning her. While she\u2019s stun, you run up the cave wall, and hit her hard on the head. I\u2019ve got no time for you. I\u2019ve got better things to do. You say. You hit her hard and she hits the cave wall. No\u2026. A human like this exist? She said. tsuchigumo falls unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time to celebrate. Got to save the king. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe space around you flickers and changes. Suddenly, you\u2019re back in grangold. Anybody hurt? You say. You slice open the cobweb, freeing the ant girls. Enemy caught queen. Please aid. Grangold king caught too. Eaten soon. The ant girl said. Not only the king, but the ant queen. The situation got more serious. Leave it to me. I\u2019ll save them. You guys evacuate the citizens. You say. Humans. We will evacuate them. The ant girls said. You leave to find the king.  They wouldn\u2019t be in the castle. It\u2019s still under repair from the last battle. Maybe something smaller like a warehouse. You say. You try to find it, taking down any spider monster in your way. These spider monsters must not be well liked, even among other monsters. From what I\u2019ve seen, they prey on humans and monsters. You say. You look around for a warehouse, but can\u2019t find it. Damnit! You say. Then you feel a very powerful energy. Not as high as a queen, but a lot more stronger than a grunt. This way\u2026. You say. You follow the energy and it leads you to the warehouse. This is it\u2026\u2026 You say. The warehouse you step into is covered in webs. Right in the middle, you see the grangold king and the ant queen bound up in the spider silk. And you see a high ranking spider monster. You must be the soon to be spider queen? You say. Hehehe\u2026\u2026 Good job getting here. Although I was expecting the disgraced hero. And the human pet monster lord. She said. Heh. You\u2019re pretty cruel. Let me guess. You\u2019re one of those monsters who want to dominate humans. Use the rich quality ones as livestock and toss out the inferior ones. Am I right? You ask. Yes. She said. typical. And something also tells me that you stopped licking someone\u2019s boot and finally shown your real colors. You say. Haha\u2026.. keep on prattling. I\u2019ll suck your bodily fluids dry like everyone else. She said. The atmosphere around you changes, like before.  This place is like your heart. Dark, damp, cold, and alone. You say. Human\u2026.. I\u2019ll swallow you whole with my vagina. After that, I\u2019ll completely devour you. She said. I\u2019ve faced a lot of monsters and not a single one has tried to. Since you have capture the ant queen, you must not be a complete waste of time. So do you think you can entertain me? Or perhaps do what you said and rape me and devour me? Because many have tried and many have failed. Surly a spider can succeed where others failed. You say. A cocky one\u2026\u2026. I like that energy you have. As a small show of respect for that, I\u2019ll rape you before I devour you. You\u2019ll cry out in pleasure soon enough. Be happy\u2026.. For you will taste heaven before hell. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes turn optical and you attack. Slip into a dream of ecstasy. She said. you knee her in the chin and she stumbles back. You take this opportunity and climb up the wall and you come down hard on her skull. I\u2019ll suck you dry. She said. you smile when she gets close. You sucker punch her and jump on her back. Get off me! She said. You hit her repeatedly until she tosses you off. You attack her. I\u2019ll show you some love with my foot. She said. You grab her spider\u2019s leg and toss her to the ground. Then you jump up into and knee her right  on her chest. This can\u2019t be\u2026.. how could my ambition end here!? She said. Time to go to sleep. You say. You hit her hard on the head, knocking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat takes care of the princess. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking care of the spider princess, the barrier fades. At the same time, the webbing that was holding the king and queen crumbles and fades  away. Urgh\u2026.. What happened to us? Are we safe? The grangold king said. Looks like the spider princess subordinates are heading for the hills. You say. (Although the damage to the town is high.) You thought.</span></div></div>",

Who\u2019s going to host it?) He said. (I don\u2019t know, but I do know that we really do need to unify our forces if we want a chance at fighting back.) You say.(I didn\u2019t think the ant queen was so negative. Not towards the summit, but for coexistence from all of this.) He said. (Hard to look at it when a city\u2019s been through 2 hits.) You said. (We already know who\u2019s pulling the strings.) He said. (yeah, but something doesn\u2019t seem right. If those angels have our number, why haven\u2019t they attacked yet. Or promistein with her dolls, she could romp right through us. Something\u2019s not right here. I think\u2026\u2026) You said. (You don\u2019t think that promistien is going to turn on Illias?) He said. (Not her. Who has the most to gain by seeing all this death and destruction?) You say. (That black alice\u2026\u2026) He said. ( I think so\u2026\u2026. I\u2019ve never seen her, but I\u2019m sure luka and alice have. But at any rate, we need to pool our forces, otherwise, we don\u2019t stand a ghost of a chance. You say. You keep walking through the forest until you see a town. A town in trouble. Let\u2019s go. You say. Then you smell the air. Oh shit. Please don\u2019t let this\u2026\u2026 You say. You sniff the air again. Yes it is. Succubus village. Aw shit. Of all the places\u2026\u2026 you said. ( We could let luka handle this.) He said. I really want to, but\u2026\u2026 I\u2026\u2026. I can\u2019t turn my back on this. Even though the damn village is crawling with them, they look like they need help. You say. You reluctantly head into the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and see the men of the village are all laying on the ground moaning. What happened here? You say. You check one. He\u2019s not moaning from pain or pleasure\u2026\u2026 You say. All of the males villages face are red and they look excited. (What\u2019s going on here?) You thought. You look up in the sky and see a magic circle in the sky. That\u2019s not a normal cloud formation. You say. (It must be the cause for this.) You say. That must by the cause of this, but why haven\u2019t I been affected.? You say. (Too strong for weak barriers.) He said. You\u2019re eyes turn optical. I need to find whoever did this. And get the hell out of this town. You say. You try to feel the energy, but the magic circle is blocking you from finding it. Damn magic circle. Huh? You say. You finally sense the energy. From the mayor\u2019s house. You say. You rush down the main street. You kick the door open and see a powerful looking succubus. That\u2019s far enough! You say. You stop her just before Eva she kick the succubus. (This power\u2026\u2026 She\u2019s the one who put up that barrier.) You thought. Heh\u2026.. A human who hasn\u2019t been picked clean. You\u2019re friends with the disgraced hero. She said. Eva looks you up and down with a leering smile. Good\u2026. I\u2019ll suck up all your semen. I\u2019ll drink it all until you\u2019re a dried up husk. She said. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m just going to sit back and let you! I\u2019m going to tear you down! You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attack her. I\u2019ll milk it out with my own hands. She said. When Eva tries to grab your penis, you grab her arm and toss her, but she quickly grabs you before you could and holds you tightly. Now you can\u2019t escape. I\u2019ll squeeze out your semen as you cry out in pleasure. She said. Get the hell off me! You say. You power your way free. You\u2019re a lot stronger than I thought. She said. You attack her. Now it\u2019s time to prey on you. She said. Eva pushes you down and grabs hold of you. You\u2019re at my mercy now. Submit and I\u2019ll make you see heaven slowly. She said. Never! You say. You hit her hard, causing her to get off you. You attack her, but she dodges you. You disappear and reappear behind her and brutally kick her from behind. Cover my hands with your semen. She said. She tries to grab your penis, but you grab her arm and this time when she tries to grab you, you anticipated it and let go of her. You go for an attack, but she grabs you and looks hypnotically at you as she kiss you. You slowly stop struggling. Now your semen is mine. Just lay there and let it all come out. She said. Not\u2026\u2026now\u2026\u2026..not Ever! You say. You punch her off you and brutally finish her with a punch violent punch to the heart. No\u2026\u2026 Why Me!? She said. Eva collapses on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will NEVER lose to a succubus! You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barrier isn\u2019t down yet. I still feel the energy. You say. You step outside and see it\u2019s still in the air. Grr\u2026\u2026! That bitch is knocked out cold, but the damn thing is still in the air! How do I bring it down? You say. You get an idea. (Luke said the optical eyes can manipulate or break any seal. I hope he\u2019s right.) You thought. Your eyes turn optical and you concentrate on the seal. (The seal is strong! But I\u2019m going to break it! You say. You power up and concentrate your power on the seal. After a few seconds, the seal slowly disappears. Huff\u2026\u2026. Huff\u2026..huff\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s gone. You say. With the barrier gone, all of the villagers return to their senses in moments. You quickly leave the village. (I\u2019m not sticking around here.) You thought. You start walking to the next destination. The next place is gold port. That\u2019s were Illias kruz hq is at. Then the volcano. I\u2019ll let luka deal with these two place. This is a job for him and him only. You say. (So where do we go?) he said. (Back to the monster lord\u2019s castle. Luka would probably head back there when he\u2019s done. Plus he must be wondering if we\u2019re still alive just as much as I\u2019m worried about him.) You say. (We didn\u2019t face any angels, so we\u2019re ok.) He said. (Yeah. Plus, I don\u2019t want to use\u2026\u2026. That ever again.) You said. You disappear and reappear back on hellgondo and head for the monster lord\u2019s castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get there, you wait for luka and alice to come back. While you wait, you take think about the coming events. Fighting a goddess. A tall order. Won\u2019t be easy. Fighting angels won\u2019t be easy either. Luka\u2019s the only one who can take them. You say.(But I can too\u2026\u2026. But only if I use it. And I don\u2019t want to use it.)You thought. (you might not have a choice one day. Only that power will make you harm angels.) He said. ( I know, but\u2026\u2026 you saw what happened and what I did.) You said. (Yes, I saw. The power is terrifying as it is strong, but it could be the only thing for now if we get into a fight with angels.) he said. (I know. I just don\u2019t want to use. The thought of her being right just boils my blood.) You thought. (Her being right should be the farthest from your mind. I\u2019m not going to die just so you can prove a point to her.) He said. (You\u2019re right. I can\u2019t be caught up with her.it is the only way I can hurt them. That valkyrie almost killed me. If it wasn\u2019t for that power, I\u2019d be dead. Ok, I\u2019ll use it next time I come across an angel.) You thought. After an hour of waiting, you see it getting dark. You walk into one of the guest rooms and see luka. Luka? You say. Hey, you finally made it back. He said. back? I\u2019ve been here for an hour. I was waiting on you. You say. You were? I didn\u2019t see you here. He said. I was waiting were you fought the knights. Anyway, you look\u2026\u2026 different. I also feel a new kind of power within you. And around you. You say. Fighting angels will do that. You kind of look worn out. He said. Yeah, I am. Fill me in when the sun comes up. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, luka tells you everything. That\u2019s\u2026\u2026 a lot of work to do. But I didn\u2019t expect anything less. You say. We got a lot to do and tammo already told us what to do. Luka said. A drain lab, bio lab, sinner\u2019s prison. And by what you told me what we need to do. This won\u2019t be easy. I hope you can keep up luka. You say. You\u2019re forgetting who you\u2019re talking to. Alright, let\u2019s head to the drain lab. We got to rescue those prisoners. Luka said. Yes\u2026 As the monster lord, I\u2019ll do everything I can do to assist as well. Alice said. No offense, but what can you do in that small state of yours? Coil around the enemy\u2019s leg? You joke. Hrn\u2026\u2026 Alice said. Nothing changes between you two. Luka said as Galda flies towards the drain lab.  </span></div></div>",

Luka, is this hatch the entrance? Alice said. Yes\u2026. It looks similar to the hatch that led to promistien\u2019s other laboratory. Luka said. The one you rushed into without me. You said. I said I was sorry. He said. Looks like it\u2019s locked. Alice, would you like the honor? You ask. \u2026..hah! She said. Alice slams her fist into the lock and opening the hatch. We\u2019re in. You say. So much for stealth. Luka said. If we\u2019re going to invade, we do it head on from the front! Plus, it\u2019s not your style to be sneaky. Alice said. She\u2019s right. You\u2019ve always rushed into a place head first. Why be sneaky now? You say. We can still be gentle\u2026.. Luka grumbles. You three jump into the hatch. Inside the hatch is a lift, which you three ride deep underground. Where are the prisoners? You say. According to the queen elf, she witnessed at least one hundred being brought here to the island. It would be very difficult to walk them out unnoticed. Alice said. So that means\u2026\u2026 You say with an excited smile. We should rampage as loud as possible, and take advantage of the confusion. She said. that proves why all of the doors in promistiens lab were all broken. You still have a lot of power\u2026\u2026 For someone in a little lamia\u2019s body. You say. I can still fight. Just not as powerful as I would be in my original body. She said. So where do we begin? Luka said. Alice pulls out a map from her breast pocket. Tammo also found a map on one of the disks. There looks to be two housing units in this facility. Alice said. We\u2019ll have to check both, then. We\u2019ll have to rescue as many as possible. Luka said. then let\u2019s start with the closest one first. If we go straight down this passage\u2026\u2026 Alice said. You three advance slowly, wary of any incoming enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout meeting any guards, you three make it to the first large room. Machinery line the walls of the huge, dome shaped room. Ugh\u2026.. This looks wrong. You say. In the center of the room, a strange oval is sitting with a woman\u2019s body and angel wings on top. I think someone\u2019s in that thing. You say. It\u2019s\u2026.. It\u2019s a living human! Isn\u2019t this thing a\u2026\u2026. an angel!? Luka said. It doesn\u2019t look like an angel any more. It\u2019s been modified. You say. This is horrible\u2026. There are more than fifty of these things. Luka said. Whoever did this is going to pay! You say. Are humans that lowly to promistien!? Luka said. Destroy every one of them, and rescue the humans inside!  Alice said. You\u2019re about to open up one, until one of the pods block you. Why are humans walking around? A sample that escaped from a plant? She said. Sample? I\u2019m a human being, dammit! You say. They can move on their own\u2026.? Luka said. If you have high quality semen, you belong here. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be returned to the other room to be squeezed and disposed of. \u2026..Now, come back inside. Spry your semen all over our eggs. She said. \u2026\u2026we\u2019re not an escaped sample!  We came here to rescue everyone! Luka said. Oh, intruders?  Then I\u2019ll take you inside first, and decide your punishment later\u2026. She said. ( She\u2019s an angel, but I can get her attention.) you thought. Luka attacks. You attack, but your attack bounces off. Now for intense stimulation\u2026. She said. She tries to stroke your penis, but you dodge her. (Wait. I wonder if\u2026.) You say. You look at luka and nod. You build up energy in your hand while luka holds her off. Then you throw it at her. When it touches her, it disappears and a bright light shines from inside her and she vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems like I can do something against angels. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s gone. You say. It doesn\u2019t look like they can move while harvesting semen. Let\u2019s destroy them all, and free those inside! Alice said. Yeah! Luka said. You three break one the drain plants one by one, rescuing the men inside.  That\u2019s all of them. You say. T\u2026. thank you\u2026. But where\u2019s my brother? I don\u2019t see him\u2026 A boy said. My son\u2026 Where\u2019s my son? A man said. Luka, you think\u2026\u2026 You say. They\u2019re in the other room. Luka said. then let\u2019s go get them! You say. Alice\u2026.. Can you escort these people above ground?  We\u2019ll head towards the other room. Luka said. Splitting up behind enemy lines? But I can\u2019t deny that we have to hurry and rescue them\u2026  Don\u2019t do something reckless, luka. Alice said. You three split into two groups. You two head to the second room. Is this it? Luka said. Without running into a guard, you both reach the second room. Where is everyone? Are we too late? You say. No. Look. All of these men are being squeezed to death by that thing. Luka said. You build up energy in your arm and it turns to lightning. You run around the room killing all of the drainroids. That\u2019s all of them. All of you, go! You say. All of the men in here run out of the room. That should be all of them. Now to bring this place down. You say. I can\u2019t just let you do as you please\u2026.. Their semen is precious strategic resource. A voice said. Who is it!? Luka said. Her voice is coming over a speaker. You say. I am laplace. The one in charge of this drain lab. I cannot let the both of you go\u2026. She said. Then a door opens\u2026  A strange monster walks into the room. What is that!? Luka said. It\u2019s not a chimeric monster. You say. You use the optical eyes. Ugh\u2026\u2026 th\u2026\u2026that thing is a human female. You say. What!? How can a human female be turned into that sort of monster!?  Luka said. No, she\u2019s completely human. You say. But\u2026.. Human? Look at her! Luka said. I don\u2019t believe it myself, but her genes are 100% human! She\u2019s a full blooded human female! You say. That\u2019s impossible! Luka said. We can\u2019t discuss it. If she\u2019s human, then she wouldn\u2019t want to be like this. She\u2019d want us to kill her. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA previous generation humans\u2026.. Can i\u2026.. prey on these males? She said. S\u2026.. She can speak!? Luka said. I don\u2019t see a mouth on her. You say. Of course she can speak. The next generation of humans, created to populate the world after the recreation. That is who this replicant is. Laplace said. She\u2019s the next generation of humans!? Luka said. \u2026.Replicant, mate with these two humans. Get a good taste of how the 1st generation bred. Laplace said. Understood. She said. Guh\u2026.! Luka said. You both get into a fighting stance.</span></div></div>",

Replicant\u2019s tentacles comes for you, but you grab the tentacle, pull her towards you and punch her in the face. You attack. You see luka is waiting. I\u2019ll use my chest this time. She said.  The replicant squeezes luk\u2019s penis between her unique breast.  My mother is the sar of the morning, the child of dawn. The star thrown to earth shall obtain victory! Luka said. You see a dazzling star fall into hell. To a previous generation human\u2026.!? She said. Replicant is sealed into the form a small creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the new generation of humans? Luka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n( Was that a star? A star fell out of the sky and landed on earth. What happened to luka? I knew something was different about him. He\u2019s learned new skills. Luka\u2019s gotten more dangerous. In fact, I sense the same holy energy from him when an angel appears. Could he be\u2026\u2026?) You thought. Oh my, did you defeat the replicant? The only thing that can make a previous generation human strong is the intermingling of angel blood, isn\u2019t it? Laplace said. Are you going to send out more? Face us yourself! Luka said. \u2026\u2026That was my intention all along. I\u2019ll face you myself. She said. The floor opens up, and a strange pedestal-like device appears. A girl emerges from the center of it. At the same time, pipes and cords coming from the wall go into her body. A strange semen processing equipment extends from the wall and extra body parts. This is the first time an outsider has seen my body. I\u2019m the manager for this drain lab, laplace. She said. (I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s a cyborg or an android.) You thought. N\u2026. No way. You\u2019re whole body is a machine!? Luka said. (Cyborg.) You thought. I sense no life in you. Are you a complete machine? Luka said. Yes. I am the first ever cyborg created from complete scratch. I am a complete machine. There is no living part in my body. My brain and operating system is link to this lab. Everything here is under my control. She said. The machine on the walls move as she speaks. ( Wait. If she controls everything here, then she must also control the detonating sequence.) You said. (Detonating sequence?) He said. (You really think promistien would let any outsider in and take this place over?) You said. ( I thought I tried to be optimistic at the end of this fight, but not anymore.) he said. In other words, you\u2019re the drain lab itself. Luka said. Despite your dimwitted look, You\u2019re pretty smart.  I am the drain lab. She said. Luka! Let\u2019s end this quick. We\u2019ve got other things to do! You say. You\u2019re right! We can\u2019t waste time here! He said. I\u2019d say no holding back! Finish this in one go! You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(if it\u2019s possible, I\u2019ve got to cancel that destruction sequence. The information from this lab can vital to us.) you thought. You build up energy in your arm and it turns to lightning. You charge through laplace. Luka does a deadly sword dance that does massive damage. Charge complete. Booting up artificial genitals. She said. Not good. You say. I shall take your freedom. Even the most powerful monster cannot match my horsepower. She said. laplace body slams luka, but he blinks out of existence and reappears right behind laplace and impales her from behind. Then a star falls into hell. Your eyes turn optical. You grip your knife handle firmly and swing it. A powerful purple slash cuts through laplace. Luka\u2019s sword shines brightly and cuts through space and time. (This girl is tough and I don\u2019t see a control panel on her.) You thought. You get an idea. You  disappear and reappear behind her. You see a panel on the back of her head. (there!) You thought. Luka! You say. You build up energy and attack and luka moves as fast as a gale and attacks. It can\u2019t be\u2026.. In the end, it was just as promistien said. Laplace said. Laplace loses the will to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for that control panel. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move behind laplace. Dammit. Sealed shut. Haa! You say. You punch the small panel open. Bingo. Now to override the sequence. You say.  Laplace, answer me this\u2026\u2026 if you yourself are the drain lab, didn\u2019t you notice intruders. Why did you let us go so far? Why not fight us directly? Luka said. \u2026..unknown. I cannot explain my reasoning. She said. hero luka, answer my question\u2026.. If I was human\u2026. Could I have lived with other humans? She said. If you were human\u2026..? That\u2019s not the right question, laplace. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re human or not. If you want to live peacefully with human, all you need is to do it. Luka said.  \u2026\u2026..This battle was worth it. Just to hear those words. \u2026\u2026.Luka, you and your friend escape from this place right now. This drain lab will explode in five minutes. She said. Destroyed!? Y\u2026. You can\u2019t! Luka said. (Damn! Better work fast!) You thought.  This is a secret lab. It must be done. There is no stopping promistine\u2019s self-destruction. To which your friend was trying to override. She said. So there\u2019s no stopping it? You say. No. if this lab was to fall into enemy hands, too much information would be released. She said. Fuck! Luka! Let\u2019s go! You say. But to exchange your own life for it!? Luka said. I am the AI of this drain lab. I didn\u2019t have much of a life to begin with. As you have the power of an angel in you , you should already know that. I am a mere program. She said. B\u2026.. but\u2026. Luka said. Come on! Let\u2019s go! You say. You forcibly drag luka and you both run out of the lab. You both reach the outside world. Just as soon as you both made it, a powerful explosion comes from underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s gone\u2026\u2026. And so is the information that could have given us an edge, Dammit. You say. It seems that you\u2019re all finish. Alice said. \u2026\u2026yes, the drain lab is gone. No more prisoners will be brought here\u2026\u2026 But\u2026. Luka said. I saw the exchange. The life of a machine\u2026.. Seems to have its own type of suffering  to it. Alice said. I\u2019m sure she wanted to join everyone, and live in peace\u2026. Luka said. It was a cruel thing, giving her the freedom of thought like that. I don\u2019t know what promistien intended to do with that. Alice said.  But let\u2019s look on the bright side, we saved a lot of people today and the drain lab is gone. We caused heavy damage to the enemy. You say. \u2026..yeah. Let\u2019s move on. We still have a lot more to do\u2026. Luka said. Where to? You say. The biolab. The device that put the seal on alice. Luka said. Do we have to? I kind of like her like this. You say. Alice glares angrily at you as galda flies towards the forest of spirits. Galda lands in an area in the north of the forest of spirits that tammo showed her. Here? You say. I don\u2019t know\u2026.. nanabi said it was. Luka said. I do smell magic here\u2026.. But it\u2019s too difficult to find the specific spot. Alice said. maybe it\u2019s invisible and only she know. I don\u2019t want to ask, but alice? You say. Me neither, but maybe she knows something. Alice said. it doesn\u2019t look like we have a choice. Get out here. Luka said. There\u2019s a shadow watching from the trees. You three noticed it when you landed . And it\u2019s someone you guys know all too well. \u2026\u2026\u2026..Nya! A voice said. We already know you\u2019re there, chrome. Are you going to give up and help us!? Or do you want to be punished again!? Alice said. Chrome sheepishly comes out from hiding in the trees. What are you doing here? You say. As you three seem to already know, there\u2019s an important facility for the heavens here\u2026. The one in charge here is my sister. She said. You have a sister? You say. La croix,eh Luka said. Who? You say. A powerful necromancer with an army of zombies. If she\u2019s here defending it, this won\u2019t be easy. Luka said. You were given technology by promistien too, weren\u2019t you? I think you better tell us everything you know now. Alice said. As I said, she just gave me stuff without asking anything in return. I didn\u2019t even know who she was. And to think my sister was one of her subordinates\u2026. I knew there was a small facility nearby, I thought it was just some sort of communication hub for them\u2026. I snuck in there to see if I could find anything interesting. And that\u2019s when I found out that it was a bio lab my sister was managing.  It appears to have facilities to study both living and dead bodies and some sort of sealing device. That\u2019s what you guys are looking for, isn\u2019t it? She said. A sealing device\u2026. We\u2019re in the right place. Alice said.  Now, I think we can make a trade. Chrome said. A trade? Should we even consider her trade? She experimented on dead people and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s stop doing it. You say. Let\u2019s  hear her out first. Alice said. Thanks, You three don\u2019t know where the biolab is, do you? But I know where it is, and how to get inside. So in trade\u2026\u2026 You want us to take you to your sister? Alice interrupt.  T\u2026.. that\u2019s right. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not powerless myself! Chrome said. Not from how we last saw each other. You say. But infiltrating that place alone\u2026.. makes me uneasy. She said. So she says\u2026.What do you two think? Alice said. I say we go it alone. We don\u2019t need her slowing us down. You say. \u2026\u2026.What are you going to do when you see your sister? Luka said. I\u2019ll convince her to stop her treachery, and stop what she\u2019s doing. If she won\u2019t listen\u2026\u2026. Then by my own hand, I\u2019ll\u2026. She said. \u2026.Can you do it\u2026..? Alice said.  A practitioner of our own family who went of the path\u2026.. A traitor. Those of us in the same profession need to deal with our own. I\u2019ve been prepared for this. She said. She meant are you strong enough to do it\u2026.. You say. How rude\u2026.. I\u2019m plenty strong myself! I\u2019ll show you my horrifying power in the next fight! She said. We got it, we got it. Just show us how to get inside. Luka said. The entrance to the biolab is right in front of you! Though you can\u2019t see it\u2026. Spi! Rit! Open it up! Chrome said. Ahaha, got it! Spi said.  Alright, here we go\u2026. Rit said. Chrome and her two ghost make a strange hand gesture together. Suddenly, a huge mansion appears before everyone\u2019s eyes. It was in front of us. Shall we? You say. You four head into the mansion.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s one of the secret arts handed down in the artiste family. My sister learned them all when she was very young. \u2026..Anyway, make sure you keep your promise. Now, escort me to my sister! Chrome said. Yeah, we know. Luka said. this mansion is pretty gothic and dark. A nice place to do experiments. Kind of like chrome. You say. Chrome\u2019s sister must like a place like this. Luka said. Wait. I hear something behind this door. Chrome suddenly smashed open the door, and charges in.  A zombie angel\u2026. How tasteless, sister! Chrome said. She opens the coffin she was carrying, releasing a zombie with some powerful weapons. (is that a\u2026. gatling gun? And a rocket launcher on that zombie?)  You said. (I like chome.) he said. The giant zombie points the huge weapon towards the zombie angel. \u2026.get her, fredrika! Chrome said. Without showing any mercy, frederika blasts the zombie angel with bullets. Littered with holes, the zombie angel collapse to the floor. \u2026..See. I\u2019m plenty powerful, aren\u2019t i? She said. Chrome puffs out her small chest with pride. Two things: one, having your pet kill your enemy for you doesn\u2019t make you powerful. Two, Weapons on a zombie? You say. \u2026\u2026Didn\u2019t you promise not to use frederika again? Luka said. Listen to me, frederika wanted this\u2026. Chrome said. She wanted this? You and luka said. To protect everyone\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s what frederika herself wanted. To protect those she cared about from beyond the grave. Even if it means me using her body. I accepted her desire, and augmented her body again to be a super powerful zombie! Chrome said. You are a psychopath that needs to be locked up. You say. All joking aside\u2026. My zombie research wasn\u2019t going all too well. I had originally planned for frederika to be the ultimate zombie. But with her soul resisting it, she was unable to use any sort of advance techniques. Chome said. The one you fought, luka. You say. But after the remodeling with her desiring it, she\u2019s totally different. Since her soul itself desired power, her body easily accepted all sorts of treatment and advancement. Holding the desire to protect those she holds dear\u2026. She was reborn as frederika mark 2, now truly the ultimate of zombies!! Chrome said.  You\u2019re having too much fun. You say. (Don\u2019t you feel angry by this?) He said. (I am, but we might need all the help we can get. Plus, chrome\u2019s not the only one with powerful weapons.) You said. (You mean the one we made?) he said. (yeah.) you said. \u2026..Let\u2019s go find to the underground prison first. After that, we can look for the sealing device\u2026  Alice said. Do not forget to bring me to my sister\u2026 Chrome said. you four leave the horrible laboratory And head further inside. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this\u2026..A dining room? Where\u2019s the entrance to the underground prison? Luka said. A huge banquet is laid out on the dining table. You know it\u2019s a trap, but you don\u2019t know about alice since she\u2019s a glutton for food. This looks delicious! Alice said. (I bet you 5 hours of freedom that alice falls for it.) he said. (8 if luka also falls for it too.) You say. \u2026\u2026Well wait. Even I think this trap is too obvious Surly a trap this obvious must be a trick. There must be something else in here. Therefore she wouldn\u2019t have bothered actually putting a trap on the expected, and instead has something else.  So the food should be trap free. Alice said. Mumbling to herself, Alice suddenly rushes towards the table of food. As soon as she touches the food, the floor underneath her drops away. Impossible! A trap!? Uwaaa!!! Alice said.  She actually fell for that? !? Luka said. Luka jumps out to catch her, but the floor underneath him falls at the same time. Eh, here too!? Uwaaa\u2026.. Luka said. Idiots! Chome said. Thus they all fall below. I\u2019m surrounded by idiots. You say. (I\u2019ll let you know when I want my 8 hours.) He said. You jump to the door on the other side and open  it. You walk down a long hall. You hold onto your left leg where you\u2019re keeping your secret weapon. (I built this just in case I faced what I faced again back at chrome\u2019s. I hope the bullets work.) you thought. You get to the end of the hall and stand in front of a door. You know what will be behind this door. You power up to the point luke told you only if a fight is very serious or very fun. You muscle\u2019s buff up, your speed and agility increase, and your hair gets a little darker. You kick the door open. It was a light kick, but the doors fly off the hinges and get lodge into the wall. You see luka fighting what looks to be a limia. A very very powerful lamia. (Her mother.) You thought.  You quickly step in front of luka. Is this seriously the best you can do, luka? You say. A\u2026. About time you got here. This isn\u2019t a regular type of undead monster. It\u2019s alice\u2019s mother. He said. Alipheese the fifthtenth\u2026\u2026That\u2019s still not an excuse. If you can beat alice, then you should have little to no problem beating her mother. You say. It\u2019s not the same kind of power. He said. Take a seat luka. You look like you need it. You say. But\u2026.. Luka said. What did I tell you about trusting me? You say. \u2026\u2026..Fine. Luka said. You gave luka a hard time, but let\u2019s see how you do against a real fighter! You say. Oh, another human? You look tough. You\u2019ll be my opponent? She said. You bet. You say. Very well. Show me how strong you are! She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attack her, but she blocks with her tail. Gotcha! You say.  You grab her tail and slam her into the ground. You jump up into the air and go for a punch to her rib section, but she moves out of the way. You hit the ground, cause a massive crater to form when you landed. You attack her, but she expected you to and coils around you. A tentacle opens up. Shall I have my tentacles suck you until  you dry up? Or perhaps I should finish you off all at once? She said. Grrr\u2026..! You break free. Keep your mitts to yourself! You say.  You hit her hard. She stumbles back a little. You use this chance and rush towards her. She moves out of the way. No you don\u2019t! you say. You step on her tail, stopping her from moving. You pull her towards you and punch her. She crash into the wall.  I see\u2026.. You are strong. I was playing around\u2026\u2026 Shall I start fighting for real? She said. just don\u2019t disappoint me..... You say.  I\u2019ll have you offer up all your semen to my breast\u2026 She said. Alipheese sandwiches your penis, but she walk right into your trap. You wanted her close to you. You knee her in the forehead which stuns her You hold your hand to her body. Just when you\u2019re about to blast her, her tail coils around your leg and throws you off balance. I got you now! She said. She snaps the bone in your leg. Argh! You say. Then she coils around you again. This time you won\u2019t escape. A tentacle opens up. . Who said anything about escaping? Luka! Now! You say. Huh? She said. Luka does a deadly sword dance which hits the both of you. The damage causes her to lose her grip on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body starts healing and all the damage you\u2019ve taken is gone. She\u2019s strong. Luka said. it\u2019s almost time for the curtain call. You seem to have enjoyed the show, though! La croix said. Alipheese tail looms near you both. Ha! A voice said. suddenly, a small shadow darts between you both. Propelling herself off the ceiling, alice slams against alipheese, knocking her back. Oho\u2026.. Who\u2019s this? Alipheese said. Alice. You said. \u2026\u2026You seem to have been a little too  impatient  to win, luka. I know what you were trying to do\u2026 but I\u2019ve resolved myself for this. Leave her to me. Alice said. Luka\u2026\u2026 leave it to alice. You say. \u2026\u2026.Ok. Luka said. Haha\u2026. Are you finish talking? So you are my opponent? Alipheese said. She lashes out with a powerful tail attack. \u2026\u2026Let\u2019s take this somewhere else. There are too many spectators here. Alice said. Alice grabs her tail and direct the blow to the ground. Causing a huge hole. Still holding onto her tail, alice drags alipheese down with her into the underground area.</span></div></div>",

La croix said. \u2026..What\u2019s interesting? Luka said. you\u2019re not going anywhere unless you beat us? You say. Ah\u2026.. the hero is still here? Sorry, but my attention is need elsewhere. I apologize for the rerun, but you\u2019ll need to deal with the previous play again. She said. You see a queen harpy and Scylla appears from a coffin. This time, I\u2019ll wrap you in my tentacles\u2026.. Queen Scylla said. Luka\u2026.. You say.  Luka slashes through the tentacle, their tips falling to the floor. Your sword skills are superb. But I can regenerate my tentacles in no time. She said. Can you regenerate your body itself? Luka said. Queen scylla\u2019s body tears open. This can\u2019t\u2026.. be. She said. her torn body fades away into particles. In a single blow? She still had some built up damage from the last battle., but\u2026 .. No, your damage should be even higher! Especially after battling with alipheese the fifteenth\u2026.. La croix said. la croix\u2026. We\u2019ve fought queen after queen already. One who was kidnapping humans to repopulate her race. One who promoted racial violence to eradicate another neighboring race. One who erupted in anger at her daughters being enslaved. Two, cornered by humans, who began to fight back\u2026 One who was overcome with grief at losing her lover\u2026 One, overcome by ambition and greed, who wanted to rule\u2026. Luka said. One who sacrificed herself  to save her fellow monsters\u2026. Their motives and reason were different, good and bad. You say. But we fought every one of them, all incredibly powerful. Luka said. \u2026.Go, queen harpy. Send that hero to oblivion. La croix said.  Hmph, with ease\u2026 Queen harpy said. But\u2026.. These undead shells? Luka said. He avoided her wing attack and counter with a deep slash through her body. Queen harpy fades away into particles, returning to a corpse.  \u2026\u2026Weak. They don\u2019t compare to the other Queens we\u2019ve fought. Luka said These queens are just puppets without a soul. Take that away and leave them as husk and what do you have? Nothing. You just stripped them of the power that makes them strong! You say. What\u2019s with this strength!? \u2026..Come, titania, Kill him! La croix said. This is the power you stole from them! Luka said. He steps forward and stab titatia, returning her to a corpse before she can even come out of the coffin. Emotion\u2026.. heart\u2026..Soul\u2026. The driver of power for those that are living. You took it, and weekend all of them! Luka said. You call this art? Ultimate technique? All you did was kill them and chain them down. You say. Guh\u2026. Get out here, Cirque du croix! Destroy them, you three! La croix said. Are those the monsters from alice\u2019s stories every time you learned a new move? You say. Yeah. Luka said. As he points his sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirome\u2026. Chome said as she runs up the stairs. \u2026.What, chrome? Why did you come here? La croix said.  \u2026..I wanted to ask you one more time. Is my sister shirome really never coming back? Chrome said. I told you already\u2026.. Shirome is dead. I am la croix. She said. I see\u2026. Then it\u2019s my job as an Artiste to kill any outside our family who use our techniques! La croix! You have been judge unworthy of our family secrets! Chrome said. Chrome, do you really think you can do that? La croix said. Luka\u2026. Leave the three cirque de croix monsters to me. Chrmoe said. One against three!? Are you sure? Luka said. Don\u2019t worry\u2026.. I\u2019m not alone! Chrome said. Frederika, spi, and rit all emerge from her coffin. You challenge my orchestra with that rabble? You still have much to learn. La croix said. What are you looking at, la croix? Luka said. You\u2019re fighting us now. You say. Do you think to overwhelm me with your words, disgraced hero? She said La croix\u2019s cold eyes bore into luka. I agree with you on one point, la croix. It\u2019s time to close the curtain on this overdrawn play. You say. If you think I am weaker than my own slaves, you are sorely mistaken. My own body has been strengthen. She said. \u2026..I\u2019m tired of hearing that. You remodeled your own body or something, Right? You types are always the same. You don\u2019t respect anything in this world! Even your own bodyies are toys! Luka said. So? Even replacing my own body is a necessary step to push forward my studies. People like you would never understand. She said. Damn right we don\u2019t understand. You say. And we don\u2019t want to! This\u2026..ends\u2026..here! Luka said. You both attack together. Don\u2019t underestimate my oral techniques. La croix said. La croix sucks on luka penis hard, her cheeks rubbing against his glands.  You build up power in your arm and lightning starts forming. You charge through la croix. Luka attacks. My fingers are quite nimble from practicing my art. She said. la croix strokes luka\u2019s penis with her nimble fingers. Luka! You say. Right! He said. You punch la croix in the gut and luka comes down hard on her skull with when she kneels over. Grrr\u2026.. I don\u2019t know if we are doing damage to her. Luka said. this body is quite something. Both of your semen will make excellent samples, too. La croix said. In the middle of the battle, la croix looks over to where chrome is fighting. Tch\u2026.. They\u2019re struggling against chrome? She said. you underestimated me sister. Another one of your failures. Fredrika, now! Chrome said. Capture, start! She said. Guh, Let go! What are you doing!? Fernadez said. Fernadez is bound by frederika\u2019s sturdy limbs\u2026 Spi slowly slips inside her body. So you didn\u2019t give her anti hacking measures, sister? Did you think so highly of yourself, that you thought no one else could match your controlling skills? Chrome said.  Impossible\u2026..You\u2019re rewriting her control!?  La croix said. Your orders, master chrome? Fernadez said. Master chrome? You say. What? It has a nice ring to it. \u2026..Your master commands you! Take down that mermaid! She said. Understood master! Fernadez said. Guh\u2026. She\u2019s being controlled by the enemy! Roza said. Hmph, maybe you have some skills, Chrome. You said. The fights are far from over. And so is ours. Luka said. Right. Let\u2019s finish this\u2026. You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both attack together. Men love large breast, don\u2019t they? She said.La croix massages luka\u2019s penis between her large breast. It\u2019s time to finish this\u2026.. You say. You reach for your secret weapon. (If my prediction is correct\u2026..) You thought. You aim the gun at la croix and the bullet hits right on the forehead. What was that? She said. When la croix tries to move, she can\u2019t. What!? Why can\u2019t I move!? She said. Alright. It worked. You said. What\u2019d you do? Luka said. After you told me what happened at gold port, I went there to find one of the roids you said you fought. I found one in perfect condition. I took her weapon and redesigned it to my liking. The bullets only work on non- humans. The bullet sends a frequency to the monsters brain that tells them not to move. You say. What made you think of building that? Luka said. Just in case we come across something we faced like we did with chrome. It\u2019s perfect for against zombies since it stops them. And it seems to work good on la croix. In fact, I was planning on this and it all unfolded just how I planned. You say. Y\u2026.You! How could a human think so far ahead in time!? La croix said. luka! Shut her up. You say. Luka\u2019s sword shines brightly when he attacks la croix. Gah\u2026..! Can this body not last any longer\u2026.? She said.  La croix staggers back, and falls down. Her bandages tear open, revealing her abdomen. Her\u2026..body\u2026.. You say. Her abdomen is empty, not even internal organs. Luka said. Then how is she even alive? You say. \u2026\u2026I told you. Shirome is dead. I am undead\u2026. I\u2019m controlling my own corpse. She said. La croix loses the will to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou power down and return to normal. Luka\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m going to find that sealing device. You wrap up here. You say. You start looking for the sealing device. You head towards the basement. This place is just like the one in grangold. A large device is in the center room, with machinery lining the walls. Just like the one to seal the queen ant. You say. (All I have to do is destroy this device.) You thought. You punch it, but you pass right through it. No way! You said. (it must be made of pure angel energy. I can\u2019t touch it.) You said. (So we came all this way for nothing?) he said. (there aren\u2019t even those disks here. La croix expected us. But we know where this things is and it doesn\u2019t look like they can move it. It wasn\u2019t a total useless trip. But I we need to tell luka.) You say.  You leave the sealing device room.</span></div></div>",

Alice said. yeah. My fist just past right through it. I doubt luka's angel halo could do better. But they won't be able to move the device. So we know where it's at. you say. So we didn\u2019t come all this way for nothing at least\u2026\u2026. Chrome, what will you do now? Luka said. I\u2019ll continue my research, and hone my crafts. Even if the monster lord is angry at me, I\u2019ll keep trying to restore the honor of the artiste family\u2026 She said. \u2026\u2026I\u2019ll exempt you from the artiste ban in the monster lord\u2019s castle. You did your duty well in this incident. Alice said. She can have people banned from the castle? You said. I was just as surprised as you are. Luka said. Monster lord\u2026.  Chrome said. \u2026..But necromancy is forbidden it is absolutely forbidden, especially in front of me. Alice said. Something\u2019s never change.  I know of the three major techniques passed down the artiste family. Zombie arts, necromancy\u2026.. And doll making. Alice said. Doll making!? You and luka said. I have no issue with your doll making arts\u2026 In my position as monster lord, I grant you full license to pursue that avenue of dark magic study. Alice said.  I\u2019ll be on galda if you need me. You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later. Where to now? You say. The sealed sinners prison. Luka said. Hm\u2026\u2026Finally time for a big job. Once we get the data, we\u2019ll head right back to my castle. Alice said. (You worried. I feel it.) he said. (Yeah. You know Illias will send who knows how many angels to stop us. And only one of powers can help, but\u2026\u2026) You said. (Are you still unsure?) he said. (Yes\u2026. Last time I was able to only focus on Valkyrie. But what if I loss control. I haven\u2019t mastered that power.) you said. *Sigh* What\u2019s wrong? Alice said. Nothing. You say.  Galda files to sealed sinners prison.  The atmosphere here feels as strange as before\u2026. Luka said. Yeah. Heinrich is sealed here. You say. You look around. There is a strong barrier here. You two feel it? You say. Yes. I can feel it in my skin. Alice said. yes. Luka said. So\u2026\u2026how do we get the data here? You say. Alice pulls out a blank disk. Holding the disk in her left hand, she puts her right hand on the monument. Alright, here I go\u2026 I\u2019m starting the data transfer now! Alice said. The moment alice summons some power to start the procedure, white lightning flashes in the area. A white holy aura descends and flows from the monument to the disk. Guh\u2026.. This is difficult. And it seems like it will take a while too. I can\u2019t move like this, and is it\u2019s interrupted, we\u2019ll have to start all over. \u2026.You both know what that means. Alice said. Yes, leave it to us! Luka said. You both stand close to the stationary alice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute goes by, Luka sighs. This is strange. It\u2019s a perfect opportunity. I don\u2019t sense any monsters or angels. You? Luka said. \u2026\u2026.yes. And she\u2019s right in front of us. You say. Oh my, so you knew I was here this hold time. A voice said. A girl holding a teddy bear in her arms appears. Black alice\u2026.! Luka said. (So this is black alice. She looks like a woman from the colonial America times with that dress. But I feel a great power from her.) You thought. Hehehe\u2026. Will you play with me for a little? I\u2019d really love to see that power of yours. She said. Black alice stands before luka with a thin smile on her face. \u2026.Alice, how much longer!? Luka said. I\u2019m going as fast as I can, but I still need five more minutes. Hold her off somehow! Alice said. Got it, then I\u2019ll hold her back! Luka said. he points his sword at her. \u2026..You really do look like hienrich. I only intended to play a little bit here\u2026. \u2026.But should I just break you instead? She said. guh\u2026.? Luka said.  Shall we dance? It takes two to tango\u2026\u2026 But the moment you misstep\u2026.. It will be your end. Black alice said. You stay on the sidelines and watch. (Something\u2019s not right here. What\u2019s going on?) You thought. As you watch the fight, you feel a faint energy. Multiple faint energy. (It can\u2019t be\u2026.. No. ) You thought. \u2026\u2026..I see\u2026\u2026 You\u2019re quite skilled. It looks like the heinrich bloodline hasn\u2019t weakened over the years. Black alice said. black alice suddenly stops attacking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you doing\u2026..? Luka said. I\u2019ve got a good grasp on your power.  It would be a killjoy to interfere too much right now. She said. Black alice\u2019s eyes narrow as she looks to her side. \u2026.. It\u2019s not polite to peep you know? Is there something strange about me that fascinates you so? She said. Countless angels start to appear, one after another. ( So I was right. Angels were coming.)You thought. \u2026\u2026Did you think we trusted you, former monster lord? You\u2019re here to involve the disgraced hero in some fashion, and interfere with plans. \u2026\u2026That\u2019s what master Eden believes. Chamaeru said. (the blue haired angel must be the boss of this pack.) you thought. \u2026..You\u2019re making me feel sad. I devoted myself to Illias. If I\u2019m so untrustworthy, then I guess I have to hand over his disposal to you. Black alice said. Good. Leave him to us. Chamaeru said. guh\u2026.? Luka said. Angels surround luka from all sides. They don\u2019t look like low levels\u2026..Powerful ones left and right. This horde is serious.  (Fuck the consequence! I\u2019m\u2026\u2026Guh!) You thought. You see a bronze sword in your chest. Ugh! Angel bitch! You said. Illias knows of your power. You\u2019d only get in the way. She said. She pulls the sword out of your chest. You fall to the Ground. No!!!! Luka said. hehe\u2026.. I want to play again, so good luck. Next time, we\u2019ll keep going until you\u2019re exhausted\u2026. Black alice said before she vanishes with a strange smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrgh, I still need more time! Can you do something, luka? Alice said. there\u2019s so many\u2026.. And there are realy strong one\u2019s mixed in, too. \u2026.But I\u2019ll do something! Luka said. preparing himself, luka takes hold of his sword. Then he feel a  soft wave of light from the monument. W\u2026.What the? Luka said. is this a soul\u2026.? It can\u2019t be Illias\u2019s sealing\u2026\u2026 is breaking? Chamaeru said. The light coming off the monument slowly takes human form. The soul solidifies in the shape of a young man. It looks like the seal is weakening. Thanks to you two, I was able to get free. He said. Then luka feels a violent energy. He  looks and sees you standing up and black marks on your body. The hole in your chest closes up. (His energy is violent, but the way he look is calmer than last time. Maybe all this holy energy is affecting him.) Luka thought. Whatever they are doing seems to have weakened the seal. Now some random ghost are walking around. Chamaeru said. before the angel finishes her sentence, heinrich\u2019s spectral blade flashes out and back to his sheathe.  Sheesh\u2026. Only five hundred years go by, and I\u2019m already unknown to these young angels. Heinrich said. Hmph. Who cares about the dead? Chamaeru said. Splitting open, she fades away into particles with a look of surprise. Impossible\u2026.. How did a ghost cut apart an angel\u2019s body!? A veteran angel said. And in a single slash!? Who is this ghost!? Another veteran said. One\u2026. Two\u2026..Three\u2026.. twenty? A small number to send against me\u2026. Heinrich said. he raise his spectral sword high again slashing back and forth like an intense meteor shower, he cuts apart the surprised angels. Well, that\u2019s just it, isn\u2019t it? Five hundred years really dulls your skills. Heinrich said. Y\u2026.You! An angel cries out in surprise. The second you sensed a holy energy. You attack and killed an angel with one blow! Him too!? An angel said. You\u2019re all going to die! You say. This can\u2019t be! Everyone attack them both all at once! A veteran angel said. Sheesh, fighting off this many one by one would be a pain in the neck. But since I\u2019m a soul, I guess I have no neck, do i? Luka, let me borrow your body for a second. Heinrich said. Eh\u2026? Luka said. Without warning heinrich moves into luka\u2019s body. What are you doing? Luka said. Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t get a scratch on your body. Leave this to me and enjoy the show. Heinrich said. the angels heinrich kills turn to particles, while the one\u2019s you kill are dragged into hell. An angel shoot a arrow at you, but you move so quickly, you leave an after image and punch her so hard, she\u2019s sent back flying to heaven. You hear a growl. You put your hand on the ground and summon bloodhound.  A  dark and red dog with very sharp fangs and claws jumps out of the dark circle and pounces onto an angel and kills her. You, heinrich and bloodhound kill the remaining angels until only one big one left. The fire in your stomach forms and travels up your throat and you breath it out at the angel and heinrich does the quadruple giga. The traces of all the angels are gone. Bloodhound disappears and you return to normal and pass out.</span></div></div>",

Luka said. Galda flies back to the monster lord\u2019s castle. As soon as you three returned, Luka and alice head to the conference room. When you get to the door, you stop. What\u2019s wrong? Luka said. I don\u2019t belong in there. You say. What do you mean? He said. This isn\u2019t my story, it\u2019s yours. I\u2019d really love to put my brain to the test, but this is something for you. Not me. You say. You mean attacking Illias\u2026.. he said. Yeah. I\u2019d love to plan, but\u2026\u2026This time\u2026\u2026. I think I\u2019ll just be the grunt and wait to be told where to go. I\u2019ll be somewhere else. Come see me if you want to talk. You say. \u2026\u2026.ok, I guess. Luka said. You leave and go waiting for luka in the guess room. (The power\u2026\u2026.) he said. (I witnessed it. It\u2019s like my body just move and fought on its own. And to see bloodhound again\u2026..) You said. After a few minutes, luka walk in. Fill me in. You say. Luka tells you everything. So you\u2019re going to be the main force. And the knights are going to go to each of these towers the keep the gate to heaven lock, disable it, and open the gate. You say. Pretty much. Luka said. Ok. You\u2019re going to have to conserve energy\u2026\u2026but I want to fight you. You say. Me? Luka said. Yes. It\u2019s been a long time since we went at each other. I want to see this power you have for myself. Plus, I\u2019m looking to make it 4-0. You say. You kept count? Luka said. yes. You say. Fine. It\u2019s going to be 3-1. Luka said. Bold words, but not now. Let\u2019s go see the castle first. You said. I already talk to granberia, tammo, and Alma. I was going to see Erubetie, but I thought I might see you first. He said. Shit. Is that a good idea? You say. She\u2019s not hostile anymore towards humans. She took humans to Undine spring for shelter when they were attacked. Luka said. Ok. I might as well join. You say. You both head to Erubetie\u2019s room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026.Did you need something from me? She said. (She\u2019s not hostile and I don\u2019t see that death look in her eyes.) You thought. Just cheaking in. Luka said you got hurt when fighting Amphisbene. You ok? You say. \u2026\u2026.yes. I\u2019m fine. \u2026..Thanks for your concern. She said. Are going to be able to take her on again if you see her? You say. I found out something during our fight\u2026. I think that maybe\u2026. She said.  is there a chance of winning\u2026? Luka said. No. The question should be is the solution life threatening? You say.  Erubetie falls silent. Whatever it is, it\u2019d better not cost your life. You say. \u2026\u2026I can\u2019t guarantee that. She said. You don\u2019t need anything else? She said. No. That was all. Luka said. You and luka quickly leave. Didn\u2019t you plan on fighting the knights also? Luka said. Yeah, but I\u2019ll do it after we deal with Illias. You say. You and luka head back to his guest room. So tomorrow\u2019s the final battle. Everyone has their part to play. You say. Yeah. What are you going to do? Luka said. \u2026\u2026.I\u2019ve got to deal with something personal first. Then if I\u2019m\u2026\u2026.when I\u2019m stable\u2026\u2026 Then I\u2019ll come help you out. Just try not to get killed. We\u2019ve come too far now. You say. About that power you\u2026\u2026.used on the angels\u2026.. Luka said. Ah, I knew that question was coming. You say. You take a quick swig of from your canteen. Alright\u2026\u2026.. I\u2019ve kept you in the dark for too long. You want to know about that power I used on the angels? You say. Well\u2026\u2026. Maybe? He said. I\u2019ll take that as yes. \u2026\u2026..what do you think of when you hear the word witch? You say. Witch? Uh\u2026..old, wrinkled, caldron, magic. He said. Only one was that. More like an age from 18 to 35, powerful, summoning creatures, and all that. You said. You got that power from a witch? He said. No. My mother\u2026\u2026was a witch. My originally power is my own, but the marks you see on me are witch marks of a siren. You say. A siren? He said. Yes. A very powerful and dangerous witch. They destroy their enemies with ease. Anyone who face them is bound to die. And get this, my mother was a siren. You say. So if your mother is a siren, doesn\u2019t that make you\u2026\u2026 Luka said. A witch? No. A male witch is called a wizard. I prefer neither. And the surprises don\u2019t stop. My father\u2026\u2026he\u2026..fought and killed witches. You say. By how you explained it, witches seemed unstoppable. Luka said. But he knew where to hit, when to hit, and how to kill them. But for some reason, he and my mother found interest in each other and had a son. Me. You say. So how did you get those marks? He said. technically, only females  become witches and a few become sirens, but I don\u2019t know how I got it. But I don\u2019t want to use it. I basically do the things that do. And I want nothing to do with a witch. You say. Like summoning creatures. Like the one you did. He said. Bloodhound? He\u2019s an exception. He only kills those who are hostile towards me. Other than him, I don\u2019t summon creatures. You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka\u2026. May I come in? Alice said. Alice knocks on the door as usual\u2026. And without waiting for a reply, moves inside. Rude. You say. What\u2019s wrong? Luka said. I\u2019m hungry\u2026.. Not this body, but my true body\u2026. The moment I return to my true body, I\u2019m attacked by hunger pains. If that happens during the final fight, then we\u2019ll be in trouble\u2026. Alice said. Ah\u2026..yeah that would be bad\u2026. Luka said. tammo gave me some advice\u2026. Return to my true body, and feast on some semen. Alice said. But can\u2019t you only return to your true body for a few seconds? Luka said. If I\u2019m sucking semen from a man during it, then I can maintain the form. So that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to quench my hunger. Alice said. you don\u2019t mean from me right now!? Luka said. You left the room as soon as alice said she was hungry. (Sometimes I just want to go home, but I have a conscious and can\u2019t leave this place.) you thought. (\u2026\u2026.how are you going to handle your dementia?) He said.( I don\u2019t have dementia. I\u2019m just haunted by my memories. And as much as I hate to admit that she\u2019s right. Heather is. If I don\u2019t let go of the past, I\u2019m going to continue being haunted by them until I live in the past, or kill myself to escape it.) You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning.<br>\r\nMorning already? I didn\u2019t get a wink of sleep. You say. You hop off the tree branch you were sleeping on. (I hope I\u2019m ready for this. Today\u2019s the big day.) You said. (You ready for this?) He said. (Yeah, but first\u2026\u2026) You said. You head into the forest and get on both knees and close your eyes. When you open your eyes, you see yourself staring back at you. You're not my dark half. You're me. And i know who and what i am. You said. .....Even if it make people hate you? He said. You can't make everyone happy. Life lesson number 3. But if i end up with eneimes on all sides, so be it. I won't let dementia ruin me. Survived too long to let that happen. You said. Then he vanishes in a puff of smoke and surrounds you. Then it's gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf nothing else, at least i'm true to myself. You said, standing up. (So no more visions?) he said. (Hard to say. Time will tell, but we've got somewhere to be.) You said. You rush to where luka is.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luka sees you approach him. S\u2026..are you finally\u2026.. Luka said. Yeah. I\u2019m good. I\u2019m all set for anything now. No interferences. You say. Nice to hear, but we have to wait until the knights are done. Then the door opens. Luka said. So how long will that take? You say. I don\u2019t know. We just have to hope they can get there and do their part. Luka said. That could take a long time. You brought a pack of cards? You say. No. I\u2026..left them at my village. I never thought this would happen. Luka said. Well, we could fight each other to past the time. You say. No, we\u2019d only be helping them by sparing with each other. Luka said. I haven\u2019t fought them. What do you think there chances are? You say. I believe in them. I know they can do it. Luka said. I hope so. You say. You said you were going to fight the knights after all this is over, right? Luka said. yeah. You say. You know granberia is going to fight you with everything she has. Luka said. I know. I saw from her fight with you. I just want to see their power for my own. Granberia probably will be the fun. And I\u2019m not looking forward to alma. You say. You hate succubus? He said. No. I don\u2019t hate them. I just don\u2019t want to be around them. The first monster I fought was a succubus. And something happened to me that has never happened before. You say. You lost? He said. No. I was\u2026\u2026scared. I felt fear for the first time. And every time I see a succubus, I remember that fear. Plus, that sweet the high ranking ones emit, irritates my nose. You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 15 minutes of waiting, you look at the gate and see it\u2019s opening. The gate\u2019s opening! You say. I feel\u2026.. the power of the spirits again! Luka said. Great. Maybe you can keep up with me now. You say. I should be saying that to you. He said. Don\u2019t get cocky just because you have the spirits on your side. I can still make you my whipping boy. You say. You two aren\u2019t going anywhere. A voice said. You see a doppelganger of you. A clone? With my voice, looks and everything? You say. Another one? Luka said. You aced a clone? Luka said. yes. Of myself. It knew everything I knew. Luka said.  Hmph. A copy will never beat the original. Luka! Go! You say. L\u2026 Leave you here!? Luka said. I\u2019ll be fine, luka. Luka, a lot of people are fight as we speak for you to bring down Illias. Everyone is counting on you to do it. Don\u2019t waste this opportunity! You say. \u2026\u2026.You better be right behind me. Luka said. Luka enter through the gate. You really think he can? The clone said. I know he can! And once I\u2019m done tearing you apart, I\u2019ll be right beside him! You say. You must have forgotten, I know everything you know, plus an advantage. He said. The clone\u2019s body starts to change from a he to a she. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been clone, but it will be the last! You say. I know everything you know! I have your power! I was created when you killed all those angels at sealed sinners prison! Do really think you or luka have a chance to win this war!? She said. We are! You say as you attack her. Both of you exchange blows. You and her clash on the ground and in the air. Then the clash ends with both of your fist hit each other. Shall we stop warming up and start for real? You say. Let\u2019s! She said. You both power up and clash again. You hit her a couple of time and she hits you a couple of times. You fire a purple beam at her and so does she, which stops your move. You charge her and punch her in the face. She rebounds and knees you in the chin. You both build up energy in your arms and lightning forms and charge at each other. The exchange in attacks blows you both back. As you get up, the doppelganger charges at you with her lightning arm. You barely had time to react and dodge. Whew\u2026.. You said. Heh. She said. You\u2019re hit by an enormous power out of nowhere and it sends you flying back. Got you! She said. She punches you hard which sends you into the air. She jumps up and with her lightning hand, hits you and sends you crashing down into the ground. Is he dead? She said. Your eyes shoot open and you kick her off you. You get up and your body heals itself. You are like me. You must have just come up with that move. You say. I know every move you know. I know all your skills and your ability to come up with a skills in the heat of combat. She said. Hmmmm\u2026. Maybe I can\u2019t defeat you\u2026.. You say. You finally realized it? She said. Your eyes turn red. I won\u2019t allow a clone to do me in. he said. W\u2026.. What?! What is this overwhelming power!? She said.  I will show the difference between the ordinal and a copy. He said. He moves so fast that time slowed down when he attacked. A simple attack won\u2019t work. She said. A didn\u2019t attack once. I attacked you twice. He said. What? She said. I moved so fast time stood still. That when you saw me in front of you it was an after image and I attacked you from behind.  He said. The doppelganger\u2019s body is split into two. N\u2026..No! My body!! She said. This is the difference between the original and a copy. He said. he blasts her with a red energy beam which explodes when it hits her, creating a dome shaped explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is only room for one\u2026.. He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regain control of your body. (thanks.) You said. (\u2026\u2026..don\u2019t mentioned.) He said. now to help luka. You say. You entered through the gate. So this is heaven? Sparkly and bright. Pretty, nice, and peaceful. And I\u2019m not dead. You said. (Even I feel calm. And that\u2019s a rarity. \u2026\u2026.There are no angels here. They must be concerned with the other fights on earth.) He said. (They are. Luka must have already deal with the guarding angels here. I don\u2019t feel promistien or black alice\u2019s energy anymore. Luka must have dealt with them.) luka should be here. I can feel his power level,and alice\u2019s and\u2026\u2026.Ugh! You say. (you feel it too. That\u2019s a power level of a god.) he said. (yeah. Luka and alice must already be fighting illias. They started without us.) You say. (You know what that means, right? No more holding back.)He said. (I feel another power level, but it\u2019s dropping.) He said. (that must be one of the knights. They came to help. I think that\u2019s\u2026\u2026granberia\u2019s power. It\u2019s dropping fast!) You said. (We better move then!) he said. You rush to the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue running down the sparking path that luka must have taken. You come across a pile of feathers. This must be the remains of an angel. Luka was here. I also feel dark energy. Alice is here. You say. (Let\u2019s not wait any longer! I want a piece of that goddess\u2019s power!) He said. And so do i! You say. You keep going.</span></div></div>",

You hurry to the battlezone. After a few minutes of running, you\u2019re getting closer to the battle. I\u2019m getting closer. I can feel them in the fight. I\u2019m almost there! You say. You continue to run. While running, you come across a puddle of goo. This must be the remains of promistien. I don\u2019t what to see what she turned into. You say. (You feel that power!?) he said. (Yes. I see them just ahead!) You say. You power up enough to where luka knows you\u2019re here. This power\u2026\u2026this energy\u2026\u2026 He\u2019s here! Luka said. You build up energy in your hand as you run and lightning forms and you hit Illias. You cut right through her. Started without me? I thought I said don\u2019t do anything stupid. You say. I didn\u2019t gauge that this would be stupid. Luka said. About time you got here. Alice said. Nice to see you in your normal body, alice. You say. So\u2026..you\u2019re the other human that I\u2019ve heard of. Illias said. Damn. This is Illias? Pretty ugly for a goddess. All those organs and stuff. You look like a monster more than a goddess. You say. I\u2019ll say. Alice said. Luka, let me have a little fun before we put the nail in this. You say. You think you can stand up to a goddess? She said. I\u2019ve met worse than you. And alice is as worse as it gets. You say. What did you say!? Alice said. You sure about this? Luka said. Yes, take a breather. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve fought seriously you freak of nature! You say. You attack her. Taste the wrath of a god. She said. A roar of thunder crashes down on all sinners. You use your arm as a lightning rod and turn the lightning to power your own. You charge at Illias with the amped lightning. Is that all the power a goddess have!? You say.  Even the poer of the dark god is mine! She said. Dark god\u2026.. What!? You say. The hellfire of the netherworld incinerates everything. Shit! You say. Your eyes quickly turn optical and black fire clashes with the hellfire, but the hellfire overpowers the black fire. Not good! You say. The hellfire overtakes you. No! Luka said. When the dust clears, luka see you with your guard up. That\u2026..hurt\u2026\u2026 You say. Now do you see? She said. to feel pain again\u2026.. It\u2019s been a long time. I wanted to see if you could bring me pain. You did. I could have easily dodge that hellfire, but I wanted to see if you could cause me pain. And you did. Now, no more playing around. I\u2019ll show you\u2026\u2026 My true power! You say. You power up to full power. The ground starts shaking as your power increase. N\u2026..No way! He\u2019s been hiding this enormous amount of power all this time!? How could he keep it all under wraps? Luka said. His power\u2026\u2026. It\u2019s rising more and more each second. Alice said. Your hair gets darker and your aura turns black. Then you reach full power. Haaaaaa\u2026\u2026 You say. His appearance hasn\u2019t change, but his power is\u2026\u2026 Luka said. It might be on the same level as Illias. Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow\u2026\u2026 Let\u2019s begin. You say. No power can rival that of a goddess! She said. You sound like a broken record. Come prove that no power is better than a goddess. You say. You attack with a punch. You force and speed behind it make Illias stumble back. There\u2019s no salvation for sinners. Illias said. A holy wave of ultimate destruction radiates outward from Ilias. You guard which lessen the damage. Can you withstand this? You say. You fire a black energy wave out of your hand.  It hits Illias and cause a mushroom cloud explosion. You\u2019re still standing\u2026\u2026. Maybe this won\u2019t be a waste of time. You say. Shall we take thing from the beginning? She said.  A wave of genesis power annihilates everything. You take the brunt of it. You call that power? You say. You hold two fingers up and a giant nova energy ball forms. Can you withstand\u2026\u2026. A super nova!? You say. You  throw it at Illias Not strong enough! She said. She uses her Big bang.  You power up and push the super nova into illias. The explosion is enormous. He\u2019s standing on even terms with Ilias! Luka said. I underestimated his power all this time\u2026.. Alice said.  You see Ilias is still standing. I won\u2019t let a human be my undoing! She said. Ilias\u2019s holy magic condense and explodes.  You stop time with the optical eyes and move behind Ilias. Be finish with your own power. You say. Ilias power implode inside her. Still alive? You\u2019re strong. You say. (My energy\u2026\u2026) you thought. You feel your energy dropping. (I haven\u2019t used my full power in a long time, I can\u2019t maintain it for a long time. I have enough for one more move.) You thought. You concentrate your power on Ilias.  (i might lose my eyes, but I have to do this move\u2026\u2026) you thought. A dark circle of black fire enclose on Ilias. W\u2026..What are you doing!? She said. Another ring of black fire encloses Ilias. I won\u2019t give you the chance! She said. her power starts radiating on her body. Got you! You say.  Dark bubble surrounds Ilias and when she lets out her power, the explosion in the bubble hurts on her. Then the bubble explodes in a fiery rage. You return to normal. That\u2019s it\u2026\u2026. I\u2019m tapped.  You say. Guh\u2026\u2026! Ilias said. N\u2026..no way! You say. I\u2019ll make sure you suffer in hell for hurting me! Ilias said. A roar of thunder crashes down on all sinners. You expected to be hit, but you see alice protect you. A \u2026..Alice? you say. Don\u2019t get any idea\u2019s\u2026\u2026 My body moved on its own. She said. Then luka step in. That\u2019s far enough. Luka said. No. i\u2026.can still fight. You say. You try to move, but your muscles flare up in pain. Gah! You say. Your body is too damage. Let us deal with this. Alice said. There is no salvation for sinners. Ilias said. A holy power radiates from Ilias body. You move alice and luka out of the way and take the hit. Argh!! You say. No!!! Luka said. You collapse on the ground. Ha\u2026\u2026..Hahahaha! That\u2019s one finally dead! Ilias said. you\u2019re going to pay for that! Alice said. No\u2026\u2026. Not yet! You say. You force yourself up. I\u2026..still\u2026\u2026.have power\u2026\u2026to fight\u2026.. You say. You attack. Die already! Evil will be purified by fire. Ilias holy power condense and explodes. You put your guard up, but you can\u2019t take it. You kneel over. That;s more than enough! Alice said. Yes! You\u2019ve done more than was asked from you! You have to fall back! Luka said. Fall back? \u2026..you mean run away\u2026..? You don\u2019t know me\u2026\u2026 luka. By now\u2026..you should now\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t run away\u2026\u2026 You say. A roar of thunder strikes all sinners. Gah! You say. You fall on one knee. This isn\u2019t the time for heroics! Alice said. neither of us want to see a friend die right in front of us! That includes you! Please fall back! Luka said. I\u2026..won\u2019t\u2026..run\u2026..from an enemy. I won\u2019t lose\u2026\u2026. You say. Your eyes turn red. I won\u2019t lose!!!! He said. He powers up to the max! His power\u2026\u2026. Luka said. It\u2019s 2x what it was before! Alice said. Round two, bitch! You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe attacks so fast that he left multiple after images of himself. So fast\u2026\u2026 Luka said. I am a god! She said. A devastating power of genesis explodes.  A big bang won\u2019t stop me! He said. He grabs the powerful giant ball of energy and kicks it away. H\u2026..How?! Ilias said. His power is beyond Ilias! Alice said. Are you two going to stand there or help? He said. R\u2026.Right! Luka said. (I thought you don\u2019t like help.) You said. (Like you said\u2026\u2026.this is his story. We\u2019re just lending a helping hand.) He said. Him and luka attack together. Burn to ashes! Alice said. Alice creates a storm of fire. Here I go! Luka said. Luka does a deadly dance with his sword of fire. He builds up energy in his both arms with lightning. He charges at Ilias and cuts through her and charge through her again from behind. I still have enough power to\u2026\u2026. Not anymore! He interrupts. He jumps on top of Ilias. This is a power I\u2019ve not used in a long time, but I\u2019ll use it once more! He said. He put his hand on Ilias\u2019s back. Seal of blaze! He said. A pentagon appears on Ilias\u2019s back. What have you done to me!? My power! She said. Your power is sealed off. Permanently! He said. He stabs Ilias in the back with your knife as he jumps off. With her power sealed off, we can finish this! He said. You\u2019re right. This ends now! Luka said. Luka, be careful! She doesn\u2019t have enough power left to launch any huge attacks. So in that case\u2026.. Alice said. yes\u2026. She\u2019ll try to disturb my heart. Luka said. we\u2019ve come too far just to fail. He said. You three are all that are left\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s time to end this fight. Ilias said. I agree\u2026. Let\u2019s end this! Alice said. This is the end. Our long adventure will be over! Luka said. It\u2019s time to wrap up this drawn out battle! He said. With everything on the line, you, alice, and luka stand ready for whatever comes next. The end is starting.</span></div></div>",

In the end, I\u2019ll at least send you off with a gentle embrace\u2026 Ilias gently embraces luka. I shall drain your energy until nothing is left.. Now, please meet your end in my embrace\u2026.. She said. Get off! Luka said. Luka\u2019s body is filled with the power of earth, giving him incredible strength. Luka breaks free. Don\u2019t you like my embrace? I intended to send you off in peace\u2026.. This is a shame. Ilias said.You attack. Luka moves as powerful as a gale and thrust his sword as fast as lightning. Burn to ashes! Alice said. Alice creates a storm of fire. I\u2019ll stroke you with my sacred wings\u2026. Ilias said. Ilias embraces luka in her sacred wings, and caresses his penis with her feathers. You shoot a purple beam of energy at ilias. Ha! Alice as she attacks. Have a taste of my feathers\u2026.. Ilias said. Ilias embraces luka in her sacred wings, and caresses his penis with her feathers, but luka dodges it. Your eyes turn optical and black fire swarms and burns Ilias. Can you survive the chill of death!? Alice said. Alice\u2019s magical power freezes the air. Luka attacks. Repent your sins in my embrace\u2026 Ilias said. Ilias embraces luka in her wings, but he dodges her. You and luka attack together. Feel the power of the monster lord! Alice said. Alice attacks with the power of darkness.  How\u2026.? How is a goddess being pushed into a corner like this!? Three surface dwellers are pushing me this far!? Ilias said. Ilias\u2026\u2026 We have a reason to defeat you. Quit thinking it\u2019s just the three of us bring you down! Everyone I have met\u2026. And everyone you have trampled on! All of their thoughts and hopes are imbedded in this blade! Luka said. We\u2019re not alone! All of the people we met are behind us! And you stand alone. All by yourself against the final battle. You\u2019re pitiful, Ilias! You say. Ilias\u2026. You\u2019ll lose for one reason alone! All because this idiot was spouting off those embarrassing speeches of coexistence all through the world!  Now face the results of those words! Alice said. You and luka attack together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI refuse. I will not accept this! I am a goddess! This cannot happen! Ilias said. She\u2019s summoning the last of her strength. She\u2019s planning on drawing this out. You say. Guh\u2026..! We can\u2019t lose! Luka said. Luka, use it! End it with quadruple Giga! Alice said. I can\u2019t! She\u2019ll attack me while I use it! Luka said. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll guard you! Just focus on using it! Alice said. I can\u2019t do that! Luka said. Luka, we won win this unless you use that move! We\u2019ll all die here if you don\u2019t use that move! You say. Don\u2019t misunderstand me. I\u2019m not planning on dying! We have to do it\u2026.. We have to win\u2026.. So we can live in a peaceful world! Alice said. then promise me you won\u2019t die! Luka said. yes\u2026.. I\u2019ll survive, for your sake! Alice said. Come, sylph1 Luka said. You\u2019d think I\u2019d give you a chance!? Ilias said. A roar of thunder crashes down!  But alice guards luka. Gah\u2026..! I won\u2019t let you interfere! Alice said. You attack Ilias. Come gnome! Luka said. then I\u2019ll destroy the spirits themselves! Illias said. A sacred wave of salvation tears apart everything, but alice guards luka. I told you, ilias\u2026. I won\u2019t let you lay a finger on luka! Alice said. Curse you, Monster lord Alipheese! Ilias said. Ilias attacks in a frenzied rage. You attacke Illias. You\u2019re still around, you pesky human!? Ilias said. A wave of salvation destroys everything. Argh! You say. You\u2019re sent flying back and hit the ground hard. No! Luka said. You slowly get up. As long\u2026\u2026as blood gets to my brain\u2026\u2026 I can still fight! You say. You hit Ilias again with crazy speed and power. Luka! You say. Right! Come, Undine! Luka said. You! The power of a goddess will erase you! Ilias said. A wave of creation energy radiates out from Ilias. But alice guards luka. What\u2019s wrong Ilias? You\u2019ll never defeat me, if that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got. Alice said. you suicidal, stubborn mortal! Ilias said. Come salamander! \u2026..Alright! It\u2019s done! Luka said. No, not yet! This technique is increased exponentially with the amount of attributes imbues into it! Earth, wind, fire, and water\u2026\u2026 it should also work with holy power! Alice said. I see\u2026. So imbue it with holy power as well! Luka said. he draws forth the holy aura from his body, and move it towards his blade. When the holy energy takes hold, the blade vibrates with power. And I\u2019ll add in the power of darkness! Alice said. Alice put her hand on luka\u2019s sword. As her power of darkness flows into the sword, the explosive power sings into the air. With six attributes imbedded in the blade, the sword is radiating with dazzling light. With the last of my power\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll contribute too\u2026\u2026. You say. You put your hand on the blade and the last of your power flows into the blade. Now with seven different attributes in the blade, the sword is shining in a very bright light. I am a god! You cannot defeat a god with that! Ilias said. (I need a loan.) You said. His power flows into you and you build up energy in your hand and a dark red lightning forms. The world itself trembles as Ilias approaches you three. With alice and luka hold the dazzling sword and your attack ready, you three charge forward. Here we go luka! This is the final blow! Alice said. \u2026..yes, let\u2019s finish this together! The end of our journey! Luka said. Both you and luka\u2019s attack hit Ilias and a you three are engulfed in a dazzling light\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 month later\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sitting in a tree near yamitai village. (You think luka\u2019s going to be ok?) He said. (Yeah. I left him a note for him to meet us a yamitai village when he wakes up.) you say. (time to go?) He said. (Yeah\u2026\u2026 Time to go home. But I want to say goodbye first.) You say. After a few minutes, you see luka and alice riding on galda. When he lands, you tell him you\u2019re leaving. \u2026\u2026.So you\u2019re leaving? Luka said. Yeah. I figured I\u2019ve done all I can. I think it\u2019s time for me to go now. You say. I thought you said said you were going to fight the heavenly knights. Luka said. I did. While you were sleeping. Although granberia did seem a little overzealous. And I fought alice. Who also seemed like seem to be wanting that for a long time. You say. I finally got to hit you. I was going to enjoy every second of it. Alice said. you don\u2019t want to stick around for a bit more? Luka said. nah. This is all your doing. I don\u2019t want to take a single thank you for it. Plus, I really need to slow down. You say. You sound like an old man. Alice said. How many adventures have you been on? Luka said. Counting the one to the monster lord\u2019s castle and bring down Ilias\u2026.. This is my fifth adventure. And I\u2019m only (Insert age here.). You say. You\u2019ve been on 5 adventure\u2019s and you\u2019re only that age!? Alice said. heh heh. When you get to know me, I\u2019m a very busy guy. You say. So where are you going? Luka said. I don\u2019t know. Time will tell. You say. But what about our fight? Luka said. Ahhhh\u2026\u2026 Maybe next time when I come to visit. We can have our fight. Plus, granberia wants hers. She really likes to test herself. You say. Well, if this is goodbye\u2026\u2026.Luka said. A handshake? That\u2019s not how friends say goodbye. You say. They don\u2019t? Luka said. Friends say goodbye with a high five! You say. Oh! Luka said. *High five* awwww, what the hell. You say. You bear hug luka for a few seconds then put him down. This might have been the most entertaining adventure I\u2019ve ever had. You say. Here\u2019s your lucky coin back. I forgot to give it to you. Luka said. keep it as a token for the all the fun times we had. You said. You look at alice. You\u2019re not going to miss me, alice? You say. \u2026\u2026\u2026You have a way to make a situation more fun. She said. I\u2019ll take that as yes. Knowing you, that\u2019s probably as good as it\u2019ll get. You say. I still remember you two didn\u2019t get along at all. Luka said. We still don\u2019t see eye to eye on things, but we did have one goal in common. Right snake boots? You say. \u2026\u2026\u2026We did have one goal in common. You barbarian. \u2026\u2026Maybe somethings don\u2019t change. Luka said. Anyway, I better get going. You should as well luka. A Everyone\u2019s waiting on you and the festivities were put on hold because of your nap. You should see the world now that all the fighting has stopped. You said. I will! See you soon! Luka said. You head off to a secluded area. Time to go home\u2026..you say. You activate the time travel device and head back to your time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive in o district. Home sweet home. I bet luke is going crazy trying to find me. You say. (I\u2019ve miss the smell of destroyed cars, toppled building and all the other stuff.) he said. (how long you think we\u2019ve been gone for?) you said. Then your data wrist goes off. It\u2019s dante. You said. You open a comms channel. Dante. You say. Sir! It\u2019s about time. I\u2019ve been trying to reach you for the past twelve hours. He said. (twelve hours? I thought maybe at least a 2 months and a half.) You thought. I\u2019m here dante. How\u2019s tom? You say. He\u2019s\u2026\u2026well\u2026\u2026 you\u2019ll have to see for yourself. He said. he\u2019s not dead is he? You say. No, but he\u2019s been beaten up pretty bad. Luke\u2019s been going nuts at us to try and find you. He said. tell luke to calm down and that I\u2019m on my way back. You say. You close the comms line. From fighting giantess, to witches, to monsters. What\u2019s next? You said. (Only one way to find out.) he said. Right! There is only one way to find out! You said. With high spirit, you rush to the HQ, hopeful that your next adventure will be just as if not more exciting as the last one.</span></div></div>",

Why is everyone here all depressed and stuff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think? It's because of these damn monster attacks sir!

But you know there is one last problem you must deal with before you can finally relax. There's an old saying about never cross a witch, but there's another saying as well. Revenge solves everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top a building in o district with a full moon in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's time to put an end to this..... I will make her pay for what she did. and others that stand in my way. Now if Alexia's information is right, one of them should be showing up. You say. You pull out your binoculars and look ahead. Sure enough, you saw one. A young witch, but you can make out her appearance yet. You see her mouth move like she's saying some enchantment. Then a building appears out of nowhere. There it is. The house that call home. Looks like a school. Maybe they train up and coming witches\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ll be sure to give them a stamp of approval for coming this far. You say. You check your equipment and gear. Everything\u2019s here. Arif\u2026\u2026.. I Will make them pay. You say. You hope off the building. You decide going through the front door wouldn\u2019t be the hottest idea, so you went around and found the back entrance. You use the armband and grow to 100ft. She\u2019s going to pay. Even if I take her to hell with me. You say determined. You enter the building. This must be storage. It\u2019s like a warehouse back here with little to no light. She must be up at the top. You say. You start walking. When you reach the door on the other side of the room, you see the door knob move. Thinking quickly, you hide in the darkness. The door opens and you see a witch. She looks to be 15 or so. She\u2019s wearing the same thing heather wears. Sanctuary. Finally. She said. She walks past you and sits on a crate  and props her feet up on another crate. (I have to get past her.) You thought. You move slowly and cautiously, not wanting to get her attention. You open the door slowly and quietly. You look back one last time and she hasn\u2019t seen you yet. You go through the door and close it quietly. Whew\u2026\u2026. You say. You look around. I must still be in storage. The building didn\u2019t look big from the outside. You say. You keep walking through until you come out of storage and in what looks like an auditorium. An auditorium? This has to be a school . You say. You look on the ground and see a big oval shaped ring. This isn\u2019t an auditorium. It\u2019s an arena. This must be where they duel one other. You say. You hear footsteps and quickly hid. You see it\u2019s another witch, but this one looks different. She\u2019s wearing a witch hat, a black dress, gloves, and is barefoot. She looks to be 18. You see her make a hand sign and out of nowhere comes a dark floating cloud which she sits on. There is no one good to duel against any more. I\u2019ve beaten everyone here except our superiors and the rookies don\u2019t even offer a challenge. What I wouldn\u2019t do for one good challenger. She said. While she was talking, you were moving to the door and just when you\u2019re about to open it, a magical seal appears on the door. Damn! You say. You quickly hide. I know you\u2019re here. No use of hiding. She said. A few seconds go by. Are you just going to hide? By hiding you show you\u2019re a coward. She said. (that magic seal won\u2019t go away unless I\u2019ve dealt with her.) You thought. Can you call yourself a man by hiding from me? She said. You move silently. If there\u2019s anything between your legs, you\u2019d show yourself. She said. You\u2019re right behind her. You\u2019re about to slit her throat, but she\u2019s gone. Huh? you say. You see a magic circle appear at your feet. You move before a you get engulfed by the beam. Oh\u2026.. you\u2019re fast. She said. You see her right behind you. A trespasser\u2026\u2026 Do you know what we do to people not allowed here? She said. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find out. You say. They\u2026\u2026disappear. She said. you mean killed. I know what you mean about that. You say. She starts eyeing you. It is true we kill trespassers\u2026\u2026.. But someone as handsome as you shouldn\u2019t be wasted. I\u2019ll make you my personal slave. She said. As if! You say. You take a fighting stance. Really? Do you know where we are? You\u2019re on our turf. Plus tonight\u2019s a full moon and that\u2019s when our magic\u2019s at our strongest. She said. She\u2019s right. You feel her power and it\u2019s very high. I\u2019m a man on a mission. And I will finish it. You say. You\u2019re mission will soon to be to please your new mistress. She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou personally know how dangerous fighting a witch can be, but this one looks low level, but she said that a witches power is increased when theirs a  full moon out so this might get difficult, so you\u2019re going to have to end this quickly before it gets drawn out. You charge at her and when you go to attack, she\u2019s already gone. Where\u2019d she go? You say. Are you that slow? She said. She\u2019s right behind you. You try to stab her, but she\u2019s gone again. (How is she moving that fast?) you thought. Now\u2026\u2026. How should I do this? She said. ( She\u2019s moving so fast. Her speed is insane. Wait. What did Alexia said was a common witch power?) You thought. (A witch can temporarily slow down time.) Alexia said. (A witch can stop time. If my theory is right\u2026\u2026) you thought. Your eyes turn optical. Maybe this\u2026.. She said. She holds out her hands and form a hand sign and her hands start glowing. She motions her hands a purple circle . Then energy balls start coming out of there. You move quickly to dodge them and close the distance to her. You go to attack her. Then she slows down time. (Come on.) you thought. The optical eyes cancel the effect and you hit her. Yes! You said. You gave her a bloody nose. Ow! That hurt! She said. You take the opportunity and punch her through the heart. There are\u2026\u2026a lot more here. More powerful than me\u2026\u2026. You\u2026\u2026.will\u2026\u2026.die here. She said before dying. You pull your arm out of her chest. The magical seal on the door disappears and you leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must be the main hall. You say. You look around and see a heavy looking door up the stairs. You walk up them and examine the door. She must be behind this, but it won\u2019t open up. It won\u2019t open until the moon light shines on the door. You say. You look at the light streaming in through the glass window above the entrance door. The moon isn\u2019t fully up yet, the light won\u2019t shine on the door for a while. So what do I do in the meantime? You said. Maybe house cleaning. Kill all of the witches here. Every single one has to be killed. And then her. There multiple doors here that should lead me to another area of this damn place. After all that, the moon light should be shining on the door when I\u2019m done. But which one? You say. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From left to right, work my way down. You say. You open the door and you walk down the hall. Killing her won\u2019t stop them completely. I got to bring this entire place down. Luckily I brought super charge  c4 that could level the empire state building in one go. You said. You open the door at the end of the hall way. This looks to be a lounge. A perfect spot for one of the charges. You say. You look down and see 3 witches down there. They look like the one I saw in storage. Rookies. The rookies must be from 15-18. I wonder\u2026\u2026 Can I take them all out silently? You say. You hid up in a dark corner. 1 walking around and the others are sitting down. Your close enough to hear their conversation. This is so unfair! Everyone else is out there doing their thing, and I\u2019m stuck on guard duty. Emily said. Calm down, Emily. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s any trying to get in here. Kelly said. yeah. Besides you really should enjoy the quiet while it lasts. Vanessa said. I hate quiet and boredom. Why do you think I\u2019m pacing back and forth? I\u2019d rather be doing something. Just to kill the boredom. Emily said. Well, if you\u2019re that bored, then go have fun with one of the prisoners. Kelly said. There is only one person I wanted and he\u2019s already taken. He gave me a broken rib, black eye, and dislocated my right arm. Emily said. You\u2019re still on that? Be glad that he\u2019s captured and not a problem. Vanessa said. If I could just have 5 minutes with him, I\u2019ll show him that you don\u2019t fuck with a witch! Emily said. Unfortunately for Emily, she walked to close to where you were and you take her down silently. You creep behind the two on the couch. Didn\u2019t he have a son? Vanessa said. Yeah. I wonder where he is? Kelly said. You grab both their heads and knock them together, knocking them out cold. Bitches\u2026.. You say. You pull out one of the charges and start setting it. Set. Now for the other. You say. Well, well. What do we have here? A creeper in the night? A voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see all the darkness around you gather right in front of you and takes the form of a woman. She looks exactly like heather, but instead of feeling the tauntful and seductive nature you feel, you feel a dark, evil, and mean feeling from this one. (She\u2019s a lot older. She must be a master.) You thought. And just what are you doing here? This isn\u2019t a place for you. She said. For me? You mean men? You say. Yes. Your kind don\u2019t last long here. She said. And neither does yours. Your kind took something from me, and I intend to make sure that your kind pays dearly for it. You say. So you\u2019re here for revenge. That\u2019s a first. \u2026\u2026Even though I enjoy making your kind suffer\u2026\u2026. She said. I can tell, by the look of you that you love dominating men. You said. I\u2019m a little nicer to those who give themselves over to me. She said. You mean willingly become a slave. You say. To be frank, yes. She said. So where are your slaves now? A stain on the carpet? Slowly being digested in your stomach? Locked up in a cage somewhere? You say. If you become mine, you\u2019ll find out for yourself. She said. She places her right foot forward. Kneel and kiss my boot. Prove your worth to me. She said. You\u2019d think I would. You haven\u2019t heard of me. I don\u2019t listen to anyone unless they can beat me in a fight. You say. So a little violence? Maybe a little pain will make you see it my way. She said. I don\u2019t plan on losing here. I\u2019ve got a job to do. And I will see it through. You say. What is your mission? She said. To avenge a friend of mine who died by one of your hands! You say. You\u2019re quest for revenge will be change to a quest of being an obedient servant to your new goddess. She said. A lot of people have tried, none have been successful. You say. Your eyes turn optical. (This won\u2019t be easy.) you thought. You attack her, but she\u2019s already gone. Where\u2019d she go? You say. You look around. Then you look behind you and she hits you in the chest. You go to attack her, but she\u2019s gone. (How is she moving so fast?) You thought. You look around again. This time she\u2019s right in front of you and hits you again. I\u2019m barely trying here and you\u2019re already sweating. She said. (There\u2019s no way she can move that fast, and if she could, I\u2019d be able to see here or at least where she\u2019s going to be. How come I can\u2019t keep track of here movement?) You say. You go to attack again and she\u2019s gone. You try feeling her energy, but you can\u2019t tell which direction she\u2019s coming from. She\u2019s everywhere. You say. Then you\u2019re hit from all around. You barely standing when she reappears in front of you. Still standing? You are a tough one. She said. (Not even my optical eyes can track her. How is she\u2026\u2026. Wait. It\u2019s darker in here than it should be.) You thought. You check your surrounding and see that the room is dim lilted. (When she showed herself, the room got darker. Could she be\u2026\u2026. Using the darkness of the area to get around?) you thought. You see the that fighting me is pointless\u2026\u2026 Just kneel before me. She said. (If she is using the darkness, then\u2026\u2026..) No. I can still win this. You said. You go to attack her and she\u2019s gone again. You quickly use 3 red flares and toss them around. The room gets bright and you see her. What!? She said. You quickly take the opportunity and pull out your knife and charge her. Don\u2019t think you\u2019ve won yet! She said. You charge her and at the same time slash through her and she uses her palm and hits your heart. After a few seconds, you hear a thud. You fall on both knees and start coughing up blood. She hit my heart. It\u2019s start getting harder to see. You said. Then you remember something. You pull out a syringe and inject it into your neck. The effects of it start working immediately. Thank you Jessica for making this stim. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly get up and see you cut her in half. When you go to her body, you see it start floating in the air and turn to a dark energy and it shoots straight into you head. What\u2026\u2026is happening!? You said. You grip your head. Then you see two people in your head. A tone muscled, yet gruff looking man and a tom boy looking, yet beautiful brunet woman with black marks all down her left side of her body standing next to each other. Then they are gone. Who were those two people? And why did that just happened? You said. You quickly get up and look around. I don\u2019t know what that was about, but I got a job to do. You say. You head back to the entrance. The moon light barely moved. I must haven\u2019t been in there long. To the next room. You say. You open and walk through the next door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You start walking until you see a 5 witches. 5 of them. They look advance. This is going to be tricky. You said. You jump down and sneak to a dark corner. You get a good look and them. Yep. They\u2019re advance alright. They\u2019re wearing the same thing as the first one I fought. You said. What\u2019s taking her so long? One witch said. The preparation takes time. Another said. Plus this has to go off with a hitch. With a full moon though, it shouldn\u2019t take long. The one on the right said. By the time she\u2019s finish, I\u2019m going to old and gray. Another witch said. If you live that long\u2026\u2026 You mutter. By why go through all this trouble just to bring him back? Doesn\u2019t she remember how much trouble he gave us? The one on the far left said. He\u2019s dead, but what she\u2019s doing is trying to bring his soul back. She wants to control him, but his body won\u2019t respond well without his soul. The one on the far right said. But why him? There are plenty of males out there and she chooses him? I don\u2019t understand. The middle one said. He must have beaten your head in more than you can remember. How many males do you think have courage or power like him? He didn\u2019t care about other males. He had power, but he didn\u2019t use it to help his own kind. The one on the right said. Didn\u2019t he have a son? The one on the left said. Yes, but he vanished before we could get him. I heard he had the power of\u2026\u2026.. Wait. You feel that? The one on the far right said. What? The one in the middle said. A small power. It\u2019s faint, but there. It\u2019s somewhere in here with us. She said. Whoever it is must be good at hiding it. I didn\u2019t sense a thing. The one on the far left said. I think I might now where. The one on the far right said. She holds her arm out to where you are. Ugh! You said. You can\u2019t control your body. (My body is acting on its on! Where the fuck is he!?) You said. You try to fight it, but can\u2019t. Your body moves out of your hiding spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn intruder\u2026..? When was the last time that happened. A witch said. It\u2019s been a long time. Another said. you try to reach for your smoke bomb, but your body doesn\u2019t respond. What should we do with him? The one on the far right said. I\u2019d say kill him. He\u2019s seen too much. The one in the middle said. Then who\u2019s going to clean up the blood and get rid of the body? The one on the far left said. What\u2019s the point of being a witch if you can\u2019t use magic? The middle one said. We could brainwash him into being  on personal slave. The one on the far right said. And who\u2019s going to explain this to her when she\u2019s sees him? The one on the far left said. Well, we have to do something. So it\u2019s either brainwash or kill. The far right said. I say kill. The middle one said. brainwash. The right one said. How much trouble is he worth? The left one said. If he can mask his energy, then he must be worth a lot. The middle one said. I\u2019ve always wanted a slave. She said. (where the fuck is he?) You thought. You look up to the glass sky window. Then it breaks. What the!? The middle witch said. You see your dark side jump down and takedown the 5 witches. I literally can\u2019t leave you by yourself. He said. Where were you!? You say. Well, you took your sweet ass time going through storage and in that first room that I got bored and went for a soda. Came back, and there you were, captured. He said. It\u2019s called stealth. You say. I don\u2019t see the point. You said it yourself that you came here to kill all of them. Why are you sneaking? He said. I don\u2019t want them to know I\u2019m here yet. You say. They already do. Besides, you know why we're here anyway. He said. .....I know. Just didn't think it'd be this difficult out the gate. You said. And where's the fun if it's easy? He said. Having my back against the wall two times in a row isn't something i like. You said. Keeps you on your toes. He said. A lot more than i'm use to. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I\u2019ve just thought of something. He said. You think? You said. Shut up and listen. If they are so dangerous, why not bring luke or the guys?  Or maybe Em? He said. Because luke would never sign off on this, he'd be ma as hell for going behind him and this it too personal for me to involve any of them. You said. You know luke is going to put two and two together and rush over here with them. He said. Which is why we need to do this before he does. You said. Killing all of them won\u2019t be easy. Plus not to mention her. He said. Which is why I prepared for this. I plan on getting revenge for Arif. One way or another. You say. \u2026\u2026\u2026Then just tell me this. Is this a one way trip? He said. That\u2019s still to be decided. Like I said. One way or another, I will make her pay! You said. *Sigh* Well, if it is, I\u2019m taking a couple of witches with me. He said.  he goes inside you. (Arif\u2026\u2026 You\u2019ll soon sleep easy. I\u2019ll make them all pay for what they did to you!) You thought. You put and set a charge in here and leave determined to avenge arif, or die trying.</span></div></div>",

It has the history of witches, witches training, different types of witches, summoning, ect. You say. You skim the book until you see something in there that gets your interest. This picture of a witch is a siren. Marks riddle half of the woman\u2019s body. By this book, it looks like sirens are the strongest among witches. Not only magical, but also physical hand to hand. You said. (Sue has those same markings.) He said. (That would explain all those times we fought.) You said. (But if they are the strongest, how come Sue didn't beat us?) He said. (She must haven't finished her training. When the markings appear on her, she becomes reckless. She doesn't think about her actions and just charge in; Hoping her brute force will be enough.) You said. (That will only get you so far.) He said. (I'm sorry, what? Did you just say that?) You said. (I'm not a brute. I can think of strategies as well, i just don't do so.) He said.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis book says powers of a siren varies. No two are the same. You said. (If Sue's anything to go off on, i better stay on my guard.) You thought. You head back to see if the door is open. The moon light barely moved. It\u2019s only 8:00pm. I guess it won\u2019t open up till midnight. You say. (So what are we going to do for four hours?) He said. (We\u2019re in a place full of witches. So there\u2019s a lot of things to do.) I better go. You said. You put the book down and head out. The moonlight has barely moved. This is going to be a while. You said. (Let's see what this place has to offer.) He said. You go into on of the doors at random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm. I think this might be a dormitory. You said. (They live here as well?) He said. (Might as well.) You said. (Going to be a field day if we're found out now.) He said. You walk silently pass each door; Not wanting to make any noise just in case someone was in them. Then you stop in front one. This one..... I feel an energy i recognize. You said. (You recognize?) he said. (Yeah....) You said. You open the door and the room empty. No one here. Good. You said. (So why do you recognize this energy?) He said. (Because it's Sue's.) You said. (Sue's?) He said. (This is her former room. Everything looks lefted as it was when she was here.) You said. (Think she left anything here?) He said. (One way to find out.) you said. You scour the room and find a journal. Another one of hers. She sure did like to write. You said. You open and read it and are astounded. T....this... You said. (Is this the same Sue we know? Because this is a describes a whole different Sue.) he said. (It has to be. Handwriting is the same.) You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My first spell didn't go too good. Blew my arm clean off. Didn't think that would happen, but got to start somewhere. On the bright side, i got my first slave today. He's absolutely terrified of me. And rightfully so. It's going to be fun putting the fear of God into him. And if he fucks up, he'll meet him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Man. Sue sounds like one of Kyle's enforcers.) He said. (It's get worse.) You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stop thinking about it. I killed my first slave. He begged and begged me not to. He even cried. Saying he'll do better. It was music to my ears. I still remember how i did it. I crushed his legs so he wouldn't run; Only leaving his top half. Then i put my foot on top of him. I could feel his weak struggles as he kissed my foot to earn a second chance. I just smiled and put all my weight on him until he exploded in a gory mess. What a rush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Holy.... This can't be Sue. There is a stark difference between her and what's written in this journal.) He said. (Don't want to believe it myself, but here it is in black and white. And this isn't the only time she talks about her killings.) You said. (The same Sue who risked her neck and all to save a man in trouble is the same one describing how she kills them.) He said. (And it's not just men either. Sue was a dangerous thing when she was here. What made her change?) You said. (I say we keep this.Leverage in case she gives us the third degree again.) He said. Right....You said. You stow away the journal for later and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head out and see one of the dorm doors cracked open. You peek inside and see no one. So you head inside. This rooms actually quite pleasant. Not as dark as Sue's. You said. You feel out the energy and it's warm, gentle one. This witch must have been a diamond in the rough. This one's not as ominous as. It's actually.....comforting. You said. (And warm. Even i feel at ease.) He said.  You look around and find a Yin-yang symbol poster. One of these? Guess they knew their where goodness and badness out there. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey! What are you doing in here!? A voice said. Shit....! You said. You quickly activate your gloved hand and it turns blue and you grab her head before she could react. Ugh..... Ohhhh.... She said, falling on her knees. Too....close. You said.</span></div></div>",

One week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the window into Jessica\u2019s house. Her house is huge. I just never paid attention. You said. You go around looking for Jessica when you come across a part of the house you never seen before. I\u2019ve never seen this part of the house before. She must work on her personal stuff here. You said. In this part of the house, it looks like a laboratory except without all the test tubes. How much do scientists make? You said. You keep walking until you find Jessica. But instead of her wearing her usual; scientist stuff, she\u2019s naked. \u2026\u2026I guess since she\u2019s here by herself, she can be naked. You said. She\u2019s sitting at her desk on her computer. So you walk towards her and start climbing her. You scale her until you reach her shoulder. Jessica feels something on her shoulder and reaches for what\u2019s there. She holds her hand in front of her and sees it\u2019s you. My little man came to see me! Jessica said. I already know the answer to this question, but Jessica, why are you naked? You say. Well, most of the times I work at home and alone, so since no one is here, I don\u2019t see the need to wear clothes. She said. Oh, ok.  You say. Jessica sees you not making eye contact with her and staring at her exposed breasts. Hehe, you like what you see? She said pushing them together. So\u2026\u2026 did you come to visit\u2026\u2026.or something more personal? She said seductively. \u2026\u2026.Jessica, can you build something for me? You said. I can build it, design it, take it apart. So basically I can build and take apart anything. She said. Can you build me a stun glove? You say. Hmmmm, when do you need it? She said. You don\u2019t pay attention to her. You\u2019re just staring at her giant breast. Hellooooo. Anyone home? She said. uh, whenever you you\u2019re done with it. You say. Hmmmm, I could have it done by the end of the week. I could start working on it now, but how about we get more\u2026\u2026\u2026 friendly with each other? She said letting the words roll off her tongue. No, I should really go. I have things to plan. You said. She blocks you with her hand. Aw, can\u2019t it wait? I can see it in your eyes you want. Plus, you still owe me for keeping secrets from me.She said. She blows you a kiss. I shouldn\u2019t I have to\u2026\u2026. You\u2019re cut off by the sight of her bouncing breast. Maybe I can stay. You quickly said.  I knew you\u2019d see it my way. She said. She grabs you and places you in her cleavage. This is where my little man belongs. So I know he\u2019s safe. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll put up with all that flirting as long as she keeps making me nice gear. You said. You leave the room randomly walk through the place. (You\u2019ve been quiet for a long time.) You said. ( I get the feeling that we\u2019ve being watched. No. It feels like someone is hunting us.) he said. (And you\u2019re being quiet about that?) You said. (I\u2019m just concerned.) he said. (Concerned? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re scared.) you said. (No. But what I\u2019ve seen so far give me pause. These witches are no joke.  Plus, there are multiple types of witches. No two are alike.) he said. You stop walking and look around. (I think you might be right about someone hunting us.) You said. You continue randomly walking around. There he is sister. Just as she predicted. A woman said. Good. Let kill him now. I want payback! Another woman said. Calm yourself, Lucy. We\u2019ll have our time with him. Right now, we wait and watch him. A third woman said. He\u2019s right here, in our domain. We can overcome him! Lucy said. Don\u2019t be rash sister. If you go at him, you\u2019ll loss for sure. We\u2019ll deal with him on our terms. And you\u2019ll have the honor of finishing him. The first one said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally come across a chamber. You see bottles everywhere. This must be where they do their potions. Good place to blow up. You said. You put and set one of the charges. You wait around. Hmmm, usually one or more attacks. Guess not this time. You said. You head back to the entrance. You check the time. 9:00pm. Only 3 more hours. You said. You start walking when you feel a presence then you jump up in the air, dodging a blast aimed at you. Man, I was hoping you\u2019d stand still. A voice said. You see it\u2019s the same girl you saw last month. So you came here. By yourself. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re just that brave or stupid. She said. I see you still need to learn manners. And a bath or shower wouldn\u2019t hurt you. That smell coming off you is horrid. You say. Very funny. Try saying something funny through broken lungs. She said. I don\u2019t have time to fight you. Plus, you might run off again just as soon as the fight starts. You said.  Why would i run when i have the home field advantage. She said. Won't do you any good. You said. You sound so confident in that. Why not come test that? She said. (That feeling is back. Can't turn back now.) You talk big. Come on and show it. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her focus and a purple energy shoots towards you. You disappear and reappear in a different place. Hold still! She said. You keep disappearing and reappearing in different spots until you reappear right on her shoulder. You pat her on the cheek. Keep trying. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get that accuracy in check. You say. Hearing your taunt made her mad and you disappear before she reaches you. I\u2019ll make you regret saying that! She said. She puts her hands on the ground and a very violent wave of dark energy comes at you. You just jump over it, but then it starts swirling around you. Unfazed, you simply disappear and reappear on her head. You know, there is this thing called shampoo. It\u2019s good for your hair. You said. You jump off her head and land gracefully on the ground. You\u2019re still not taking me seriously! Is this a game to you? She said. Maybe. I don\u2019t see a reason to. You say. You do know this is your life at stake? Death or enslavement are your only choices. She said. How about neither? you said.  You see her smile and start laughing. Very well..... I'll show you what happens when you don't take things seriously.  She said. A dark purple bubble appears around you and start floating in the air. Then your arms are shifted horizontal. Then they feel like they\u2019re being pulled. (What\u2019s she doing!?) You thought. Then your arms come out of socket.  You bite your tongue to stop from screaming. Let's see..... Should it be done quickly? Or slowly? She said.  Can\u2019t beat me with your hands, so you use magic? Coward. You said. Then both of your arms are ripped off. No scream of agony? Then maybe your legs next. She said. Is this really all the power you have? You must be the lowest of all the witches. And you\u2019re a siren to. You said. Such a mouth on you. I think a harsh lesson is in order. She said. You feel like you\u2019re going to explode on the inside. You wouldn't dare....! You said. I would. I'll string you back together. As my obedient little slave. She said, smiling. (Gotcha!) You thought. Your eyes turn optical and you focus on her. Then the pain stops. Then she feels like she\u2019s going to explode. Wh\u2026..what did you do to me!? She said. I used your anger against you. You said. Impossible\u2026\u2026 Could I have been in over my head? She said before bursting into a black fire. After a few seconds, you arms grow back and all of your gear appears on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a far distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still has it. That cocky attitude. Lucy said. yes, but his attitude is like that because it makes people underestimate him or overthink themselves people. He\u2019s still as good as him. Maybe even better. Another voice said. We\u2019ve waited long enough! His back is turned. Lucy said. Patience sister. His eyes are still in an optical state. He\u2019ll know you\u2019re coming at him. Another voice said. Those eyes aren\u2019t even his. I\u2019ll gouge them out of socket myself and it won\u2019t be quick neither. Lucy said. How he acquired the optical eyes is a mystery, but they aren\u2019t his. They must return to their rightful master. But let\u2019s let him have a few more minutes with them before you gouge them out lucy. The voice said. His death will not be a gently one to begin with. I\u2019ll make sure he begs me personally to end his suffering. Lucy said.</span></div></div>",

(I think that already has happened.) He said. (Shit.... Midnight is still a few hours away. Might not make it if this keeps up.) You said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook sharp guys, luke\u2019s coming out. Tom said. Does anybody still get scared of him or is it just me? Cody said. He\u2019s been a little bit easier to be around. Dante said. yeah, but he still looks like he has a stick up his ass. And when he gets it out, he tries to beat everyone with it. Dante said. Watch it, he might add your head to his collection. Bruce said. he wouldn\u2019t kill us, would he? Tom said. Well, that all depends on my mood. Luke said. H\u2026. How long where you there? Dante said. I just got here. Did anyone say something about a stick up my ass? Luke said. No. Everyone said. Good. Because I\u2019d hate for someone to get beat with said stick. Luke said. Uh, no one has a problem with that stick. Cody said nervously. Really? So no one has a problem with how i act? Luke said. No. Tom said. Really? No one? Luke said.  No your mood is perfect. Bruce said. Good. Well, I\u2019m going to go clean my collection of skulls. I hope to add a new one soon. Luke said as his gaze slowly turns to Dante. When luke close the door behind him, everyone breathe a sigh of relief. I don\u2019t know what scarier: preteen monsters or luke. Cody said. Luke. Hands down. Hank said. Yeah, luke is on another whole plane of scary. Cody said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to your pov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re walking down the halls of the building. Then when you look ahead, the world around you changes. I\u2019m outside? How\u2019d that happen? A witch trick? You said. You look around. This doesn\u2019t look like o district or m district. In fact, it looks like we're not even in the USA. You said.  You walk around and see two people. One person is hold the other forcefully and against his will. You\u2019re close enough to hear their conversation and not be seen. Is this how you treat one of your own? The second guy said. As long as I get paid. I was contracted to bring you back. But it didn\u2019t say what state I had to bring you back in. The first person said. So you\u2019re going to take me back just for money!? That\u2019s it? The second guy said. The person is willing to pay a lot for you and I plan on collecting. The first guy said. Rrgh. I hope you get yours one day, devil dog! You\u2019re going to cross the wrong person one day! The first guy said. Maybe, but it won\u2019t be today. Now. March! The first guy said. Then the two men disappear into the destroyed city. Devil dog? Why does that name sound familiar? You said. Then the world around you changes back. (What was that all about?) You thought. Die! A voice said. You move out of the way of the attack, grab the person\u2019s arm and force them to the ground and put your boot on her neck. Ugh. Another witch. You said. I\u2019m going to make you pay! She said. She fades away and reappears in front of you and impales you with her hand.  I\u2019ve waited years for this moment! She said. You kick her off you, but she charges at you again. You\u2019re both locked in a grapple hold. I\u2019m going to kill you! She said. You kick her strong enough to make her let go and you punch her in the face, which sends her into the wall. I won\u2019t stop until you\u2019re dead at my feet! She said. She comes at you again, but just when she\u2019s about to attack, she disappears. (She\u2019s angry at you for some reason. What did you do?) he said. (Nothing. But Alexia did mention that some won\u2019t be as welcoming as others.) You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback.  One week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re walking to a building and climb and enter the building. After some looking, you find Soya. Soya. You shout. She turns around and sees you and her face turns pale. W\u2026w\u2026..what do you want? A....and how did you find me? She said. The fear emanating off you gave you away. You said. Y......you've already killed my friends and the master. I haven\u2019t done anything bad. She said. Save your groveling. You said as you grow to 100ft. You get close to her and her breathing gets faster. You know soya, death comes in two ways: Slow or fast. You said as you break a vase. And you know I love killing you girls. Each and every one of you had it coming. You said as you break a table. And you did the unthinkable red head. You turn on your friends. You weren't there with them in the arena when they died. And you know what soya? You said. Wh\u2026.wh\u2026\u2026what? She said. I hate cowards who turn on their friends. You whisper in her ear. When she tries to hit you, you grab her hand and break it. What do you want? Are you here to kill me? Do it! Go ahead and get it over with! She said. No. I\u2019m not here to kill you. You\u2019re going to have to live with the fact that your friends are dead because of you. You could have save them. You could have killed me on that day. But you didn\u2019t. You hid like the coward you are. You said. What do you want!? Soya screamed. What do you know about heather? You said. The hooded woman? Nothing. She just appeared to us one day. I don\u2019t know anything. She didn\u2019t tell us anything about her. She just told us she had friends who had experience in killing males who are bothersome. Soya said. So if you don\u2019t know. Then you must know someone who does. You said. A girl. A long ago friend of mine. She lives in o district. She might know something about her. Her name is Alexia. She said. (Alexia. The girl I fought a long time ago.) you thought. That\u2019s all I know. She said. Then maybe I should give Alexia a visit. Oh. And by the way\u2026\u2026.You said. You punch soya in the nose, giving her a bloody nose. Don\u2019t ever think about attacking me. You said as you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to o district and go back to the building. You go in and make your way to were you fought Alexia. Alexia. You shout. Huh? What are you doing here? I thought you'd be basking in celebrity status. She said. Didn't take. Do you know this woman? You said, holding up a picture of Heather. I know her. I came across her multiple times. Name's Heather. She\u2019s a witch. She said. A witch? You said. Yes. And she\u2019s not alone. There are a whole bunch of witches. All powerful. Very dangerous and sadistic. Some will keep you as a slave. Others will kill you on the spot. She said. And where do I find them. You said. Find them? Why? You want to cross them? She said. I have my reason. You said. Their place is in o district. But you can\u2019t see it. Only a witch can. She said. Then I have a lot of planning to do then. You said as you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must be one of those that would kill me on the spot. But I can\u2019t dwell on it. I got an objective to reach before I confront her. You said. You walk back around until you come across a bunch of cells. This must be where they keep their captives. This is a perfect spot, but I got to make sure no one is here. Don\u2019t want any collateral damage. You said. (Collateral damage is the best damage.) he said. You check all of the cells and see no one is in any of them. Ok. Coast clear. Time to set the charge. You said. You find a good spot for the charge and set it. When you look back up into one of the cells, you see Chijinda sitting there. C....Chijinda!? You said. (Not again....) He said. You go to the cell bars. Chijinda..... How did- Wait. Chijinda's dead. T....this has to be an illusion, right? You said. You eyes go wide when he calls your name. Chijinda! You said. You bend the bars and rush inside. When you get close to him, he leaps up and pushes you against the wall. You left me.....to die by their hand....! You abandoned me....! He said. I.... i..... You said. Your dark half takes over and Chijinda disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTold you it was fake. He said, giving you back control. But it was so real. It felt like he was there.You said. You get your senses together and leave the area.  You walk a few feet and stop. You can sense a presence. You feel the presence get closer. You roundhouse kick  behind you and send whoever behind you back. You again? You said. it\u2019s the woman from last time. She wearing a black dress  and her eyes are glowing a bright yellow and she\u2019s looking at you with hatred. Keep staring and your eyes will fall out. You said. The sight of you smiling made her seethe with anger. I promise that you won\u2019t leave this place alive! I will make you pay for what you did! She said. I don\u2019t even know who the fuck you are or what I did to piss you off, but I came here with a purpose and a goal. And I will see that goal through. You said. And so do i! And I\u2019m looking right at it. I promised myself the next time I see you, I\u2019d make you pay! And now I get my chance. For what you did that day!  You will feel the true wrath of a witch! She said. The world around you two changes to outside with the moon shining bright. You can feel her power escalating and getting powerful. No matter how much you beg, your life will not be spared! She said. For starters, I don\u2019t know what I did to make you mad. Second, I don\u2019t beg. EVER! Third, a lot of witches said I wouldn\u2019t be leaving this place, and all of those witches are dead. If you think you can do the impossible and prove that theory, then come try it. You said. That cockiness of yours really drives me insane! I will make that the first thing I take from you! She said as she flies towards you and all you do is smile and fold your arms as she charges at you.</span></div></div>",

She grits her teeth and comes at you again and you disappear and reappear right behind her. Come on. Surly I\u2019m not moving that fast for you. You said. She comes at you again and you disappear. Is this how you fight? By running away? She said. You reappear right behind her. Well, here your chance. You said. When she goes to attack, you grab her arm. She attacks you with her other arm, but you grab that as well. You\u2019re not very strong for a witch, and I\u2019m still waiting on that wrath you said I\u2019d feel. You said. You shove her back. You have mock me for the last time! She said. She says some kind of enchantment. Then you\u2019re surrounded in darkness.  Where\u2019d she go? You said. You feel like something is trying to get into your head. You power up a little and just with a little power increase, the darkness clears and she appears right in front of you. Curse you! I How can you know fear anything? She said. trying to use my fears against me. I have no fears, yet I live them every day. You said. What\u2019s that? Some sort of riddle? She said. You can figure it out when you\u2019re dead. You said. I\u2019m not the one who\u2019s going to die! You are! She said. She whispers another enchantment and you can\u2019t move. Let\u2019s see you escape this. She said like she\u2019s already one. Maybe you\u2019ll finally be able to hit me. You said. Grrrr! I\u2019m going to take my time killing you! She said. when she gets close to you, she vanishes. You regain your movement and the surrounding area turns back into the hall ways. Hmph. Was all you said before moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes anyone knows where the commander is at? Tom said. He\u2019s probably out honing his skills to fight luke again. Dante said. he\u2019s going to run himself in the ground with all that. Bruce said. Luke must be a challenge to him. How many times has he beaten luke? Cody said. none. All the times luke won. And we watched. From a safe distance. Hank said. They\u2019re that closely matched? Tom said. Yeah, but luke\u2019s one second ahead of him. When they attack, luke hits first every time. Bruce said. How many times have they fought? Dante said. I lost count after 15. Cody said. I think they had about 49. Tom said. And luke\u2019s won all those forty nine times. Dante said. Maybe he thinks fifty will be his chance. Tom said. well, if they go at it again, I\u2019m making sure they take it far away. I was almost crushed by a building the last time. Dante said. Well, I hope he\u2019s back before luke knows he\u2019s gone for too long. Bruce said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to your pov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check the time. 10:30. That waste of time was actually helpful. You said. You keep going until you reach another arena. This one looks a lot bigger than the last one. Why would they need two arenas? You said. Before you even had time to think about it, you feel something pushed against you head. A blunt way to say hello. You said. We all have different ways of saying hello. This is just my way of saying hello to people who don\u2019t belong here. The mysterious voice said.  I sense a state of negotiation. If you wanted that, all you had to do was ask. I\u2019m a reasonable person. How about dropping whatever you have against my head down. I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a gun. You said.  You\u2019re not in a position to talk. Surrender This will go badly for you. She said. You were there for the first class of negotiation, but you seem to skip the second class. Give the person no other option but to surrender. You said. You knock whatever is against your head out of the person\u2019s hand and go to attack, but the person is already gone. (not again.) you thought. You hear the sound of high heels. You see what you knocked a gun on the ground, but it doesn\u2019t look like any gun you\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s bigger than a pistol, but smaller than a smg. She picks up the gun. Quick reflexes. She said before coming into full view. She looks to be wearing tight clothes like you'd see if you know bayonetta, but it doesn't hinder her movement. Blonde hair hair and ample breast. But you\u2019re going to need more than reflexes to beat me. She said.  This witch looks to be in her twenties.  Tch. Who said I had to beat you or want to fight you? You said. Oh, what happen to  the big bad man who walked in here? She said. He\u2019s gone. I\u2019ve only fought three witches. The rest run as soon as the fight starts. You said. Can you really blame them? You\u2019re practically famous. Not all of people want to be in a fight they know they won\u2019t win. She said. And what about you? Are you going to do the same? You said. Just like you, I don\u2019t fight people I think are a waste of time. She said. Good. Then we part ways. You said. \u2026\u2026\u2026But I can\u2019t just let you waltz around as you please. She said. So are we going to do this or not? You said. In due time. I think you need firsthand experience before you challenge me. She said. She jumps back and turns into a black wolf and run off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of witch was she? She didn\u2019t lack for confidence. You said. Really? Just up and let her walk away? A voice said. that thick accent. You said. You look up and see a woman on the support beams. Didn\u2019t you come here with mission? She said. The wardrobe for the witches might differ on what kind. She's wearing the same thing, except hers is a darker. You mumble. She lands a few feet from you. this witch is brunette and has d breast. You let here walk. Wasn\u2019t your mission kill everyone? She said. I heard about the rumors of Russians being around, but I thought they were just rumors. You said. You shouldn\u2019t believe all rumors. She said. \u041d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0442, \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043a \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0443.(but that doesn't mean I didn't prepare for it.) You said. So you know the mother language.  Very few does. She said. I\u2019ve worked with a few Russians here and there. You said. most men don\u2019t have the courage you do. Before we do this, I must know. What drives you to do the impossible and crazy? She said. two things: One, my friends. Two, the people I did tell what I\u2019m doing, I promised them I\u2019d be back. You said. (just promise me, you\u2019ll come back alive.) Mira\u2019s voice said in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash back. Earlier tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re in Mira\u2019s room. She\u2019s sound asleep. I better see her before I leave . You said. You climb up mira\u2019s bed with ease. You climb up her leg and make your way to her head. She turns herself on herself over on her left side. Lucky for you, you jump up at the right time. You keep going until you reach her head.  Her warm breath washes over you like a light breeze. You emotions swirl in you and you kiss her on the lips. You quickly regain your emotions and start leaving. Mira drowsily wakes up from her sleep and sits up right. She yawns like a grizzly bear and rubs her tired eyes. When she sees you about to jump, she holds her hand out and catches you. Instead of landing on the floor, you land on something soft. You see it\u2019s a hand. She\u2019s awake. You said lowly. She holds you a few feet from her face. When looking at her, you start doubting doing this, but Arif\u2019s death won\u2019t go unanswered. What\u2019s wrong, little guy? She said. \u2026\u2026.nothing. I\u2019m going out. You said. you sound sad. Did something happen? She said with concern. \u2026\u2026..No. nothing happen. You said. you\u2019re lying. You\u2019re eyes dart to the right when you lie. She said. Mira, I care about you too much to let you know. You said. And I care about you too. We\u2019ve known each other for a long time now. I care about you too much to let you risk your life. I\u2019d risk my own life before letting someone take yours. She said. Mira\u2026\u2026\u2026 we\u2019ve do know each other. But\u2026\u2026. The people I\u2019m going to see are very dangerous. The last thing I want is for you to be there. If you got hurt\u2026.. or worse. I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself. You said. Mira stays silent for a few seconds before speaking. \u2026\u2026.just tell me. Are these people dangerous? She said. Very. You said. Then promise me. Promise me you\u2019ll come back alive. You\u2019re a important part of me and Miley\u2019s lives. Just promise me you\u2019ll come back. She said. I will.  I promise I will come back. You said. When you leave and walk past Miley\u2019s door, you faintly here her talking in her sleep. Little brother\u2026\u2026.never leave me\u2026\u2026.Love you\u2026\u2026.. Won\u2019t let\u2026\u2026.anything happen to you. She said. I won\u2019t Miley. I will be back. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose two reasons are why I do the impossible. I care nothing for my life as long as my friends have theirs. You said. So all this for friends? Your life on line for friends? You being here and risk death or enslavement for friends? She said. Yeah. I would risk it for my friends. But I don\u2019t expect you to understand. A witch has no friends. So how about we cut the shit and do this? You said. very well. I hope  friends of yours appreciated your self sacrifice. Maybe since you know Russian language, I won't make you suffer too greatly. She said with a thick accent. I have a promise to fulfil, so nothing is going to stand between me and completing it. Plus, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll run away like all witches do. You said. Unlike my sisters, I don\u2019t run from fights. She said as she gets ready. I want this enjoyable. So don\u2019t die so quickly. She said. Believe me, I have no intention of dying here.  You said. You said behind her. You caught her off guard and give her a swift kick. She\u2019s pushed back half way across the room. Very underhanded. Ok, round one belongs to you. Ready for round two?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You both charge at each other. When you go to hit, you see she\u2019s already gone. (Not again with this.) you thought. You\u2019re eyes turn optical and you block a kick coming from behind. You slam her into the ground and throw her away. She start shooting both of her guns. (those things have a very high firing rate.) You thought. You side step all of the bullets coming your way. You disappear and reappear behind her and punch her. She does a flip in the air and lands a few feet away. Not bad. For a male\u2026.. She said. I\u2019m not even breaking a sweat. You said. Ok, hotshot let\u2019s see how you deal with this. She said. She stars running at you, jumps and turns into a white wolf. You weren\u2019t expecting this and get tackled to the ground. Luckily, you had your arms up and she only bit your arm and not your neck. She starts trying to bite you on the neck, but you hold her head back. You kick her off you and get up. She comes back at you fast, but you move out of the way in time. She comes so fast and bites you on your leg. She gathers some speed and comes at you again, but you wanted her to. You uppercut her and she\u2019s sent into the air and comes down hard. You make your way to her and try to break her neck, but she changes back to human. The sudden change makes you lose your grip and she get within your personally space. She moves her hand down your chest and moves her head closer to you. Not wanting her anywhere near you, you punch her away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more seconds and you\u2019d be mine. She said. Never. Not if you were the last woman on earth. You said. That\u2019s hurtful to say to a woman. I was hoping it wouldn\u2019t come to this, but maybe it will be good in long run. She said. With a snap of her fingers, a dark red circle appears on the ground. Coming out of the ground was a harpy. A harpy\u2026\u2026 how a hate them. Thy are so ugly, and you are no exception. You said. The harpy flies fast towards you. You move out of the way, grab its wings and force it to the ground. Then you rip off both of its wings. Very good. You did that in under ten seconds. She said. I don\u2019t have time for this. You said. how about something more serious. She said. She snaps her fingers and a hellhound comes out of the circle. It gets close to you and breaths fire at you. You guard and while you are, it bites you on both legs. When it comes back again, you use your left arm as a barrier and push it on the ground and snap it\u2019s neck. Huff\u2026..huff\u2026.huff\u2026\u2026 you said. Finish already? This fight lasted for 5 minutes. Longest fight I\u2019ve had. She said. She walks towards you and holds your chin with her hand. As reward for keeping me entertained, I won\u2019t kill you. She said. (Not yet\u2026..) you thought. Instead, I\u2019ll make you my obedient slave! But first, tell me you lost. She said. I\u2026..i\u2026..i\u2026.can\u2019t believe it. You said. yes. Say it. You know you want to be my slave. She said. i\u2026..i can\u2019t believe\u2026\u2026.how dumb witches are! You said. huh? Ugh! She said as you grab her throat. If it was that easy to beat me, I\u2019d already be dead. I already found a witches weak point. They see someone weak and helpless, they automatically jump onto it without a second thought. You said. very smart. You aren\u2019t like many men. But I\u2019m different from my sisters in a way. She said. She lean close and kisses you. The unexpected kiss makes you drop her.  What was that all about!? You said. Then you grab your head. I can turn anyone into my obedient slave with just a kiss. I knew you weren\u2019t exhausted. I just need to fall into your trap just so I could get close to you. She said. Your plan backfired and now this went from bad to worse for you. Now, kneel before your goddess. She said. You can feel your knees wanting to give, but you don\u2019t let them. Hmmm, still have will power. This never happen before. But this will be fun to watch. Struggle all you like, you\u2019ll soon give into me. Everyone eventually does. She said as she turns into a wolf and runs away. You keep fighting the control until it subsides. i\u2026\u2026was able to beat it back, but I can still feel it lingering inside me.  The only way to get rid of it is to take out the caster. You said. You follow the way she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile tracking her, you can hear her voice in your head. (yes, come and find me. Come to your queen and submit to me. Deep down you know you want to be my slave. You will kneel at my feet and be a good, obedient slave.) the voice said. You can feel it gets stronger. (It\u2019s taking over. I have to find her before I become a mindless puppet.) You thought. You keep going and the voice doesn\u2019t stop. (Yes, my slave. Come closer. You\u2019re almost there. Your mistress waits. ) She said. The control is getting stronger. You feel like doing nothing but serve her. I must be close. The control is getting stronger. At this rate, I will become her slave. Wait. That\u2019s it. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk some more until you see her standing in a big empty room. My slave has come. She said. I\u2019m nobody\u2019s slave. You said. Still have some fight. Your will is strong, but not strong enough. Come to me. She said. Your body responds to her command and starts going to her. Yes. That\u2019s it. Come to your queen. She said. You stop right in front of her. Kneel to me. She said. You fight against the control. Still resisting. I\u2019m impressed, but all who have been kissed by me become my slaves. She said. She snaps her fingers and you are pushed onto one knee. I see one was enough to break you. Another looks in order. She said. She holds your chin and give you a kiss, but this one lasts longer. Then she breaks it. The longer the kiss, the stronger my control is. Now. Stand. She said. You stand up. Good. Now. Kneel before me. She said. you fall on one knee. See how easy it is to just give in. She said. Yes\u2026\u2026 You said. Yes, mistress. She said. yes, mistress. You said. good boy. Now what to do with you? She said. She rolls some ideas off her tongue, but doesn\u2019t like them.  Let\u2019s try something simple. Kiss my boot. She said. You grab her boot. Yes, that\u2019s a good slave. She said. That\u2019s when your eyes turn red and you force her to the ground and thrust your arm through her heart. Phft\u2026\u2026How did\u2026\u2026.how did you\u2026..break my spell? She said. Like I said, bitch. I\u2019m nobody\u2019s slave. You said. You will is strong\u2026\u2026.but it\u2026\u2026won\u2019t be enough\u2026\u2026.you will die here\u2026..She said before you rip her heart out. (Was that necessary?) you said. (I don\u2019t kiss anyone\u2019s boot. Witch or not.) he said.  You regain control of your body. *clap*clap*clap. Bravo. You\u2019re still alive. A voice said. You turn around and see it\u2019s the same witch from earlier. You\u2019re not particularly sad you lost another one of your own. You said. oh, please. Don\u2019t try to use sentiment against me. I don\u2019t care how many of my sisters fall by your hand. As long as I kill the person who\u2019s doing it. She said. People like you make the world a dark place. You said. Then I must be doing something right. She said. You go to attack her, but she\u2019s gone. She jumped and landed a few feet from you. Relax, little man. I\u2019m not after you, yet. I\u2019m going to wait until you\u2019re at your weakest. Then we\u2019ll have our time. But, until then\u2026\u2026. Toddles! She said as she turns into a panther and runs away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t think witches care about each other that much. You said. You set a charge on the weakest support beam in the room and leave. </span></div></div>",

While walking through the hallways, the world around you changes.  What now? You said. You see you\u2019re outside of o district and see that guy again. Hey, he\u2019s from the last vision. You said. he\u2019s just walking randomly. You go after him. You stay a good distance from him. Then after a few minutes of following him, you see him look behind him and you hide. He sees no one followed him and you get a good look at his face. He\u2026\u2026he looks like me. You said. Then you see him kick down a huge door with ease and he disappears from sight. Then the world around you changes back to normal. What was that all about? That guy looked like me, but he looked accustomed to this world. You said. Hahahaha. A voice you know too well. Show yourself, Heather. Only a coward hides in the shadows. You said. You see her walk right out of the shadows. Just by looking at her makes your blood boil. You don\u2019t look happy to see me. Did I offend you? She said. you and that bitch killed Arif. You said angrily. He was willing to die. You and him had a friendship. And he died to make sure you got away. Plus, I didn\u2019t take his life. She said. If there was a problem that day, you two has could have taken it out on me. You didn\u2019t have to involve Arif! You said. You seriously think we were after you on that day? Hahaha. How is someone so stupid still even alive? She said. I don\u2019t care if you both were or not. A friend of mine died that day and I promised him to kill the one who did it to him. And I will do just that. Even if I have to mow you down to do it! You said. you power rise sharply from your anger. You think you can mow me down? How many times have you tried and failed? She said. I keep trying. That\u2019s the important part! You said as you charge her. When you hit her, your whole body just phase right through her. Huh? An illusion!? You said.  She walks towards you. I don\u2019t have time for your tricks heather! You said. You don\u2019t have to for long\u2026\u2026 She said. She moves her hand down your chest. We will dance soon enough. I just hope you can keep up, because this time\u2026\u2026. She said letting the words roll off her tongue. She shoves her hand through your stomach. I\u2019ll be playing for keeps\u2026\u2026. Her illusion said before disappearing. You see that there is no hole in you. It was all in your head.  Heather\u2026\u2026 I won\u2019t hesitate to kill you. Not again. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you regain your composure, you feel like something is crawling through your head. I said stay out of my head! You say. You power up and force out the person doing it. Oh, it\u2019s you again. You said. How can someone not have any fears? She said. You still haven\u2019t figured it out? I thought witches were supposed to be smart. You said. If you don\u2019t have any fears, then I\u2019ll make you feel fear! She said. I\u2019ve been waiting a while for that from you and still waiting. You said. One way or another, I will make you pay! She said. If you think you can, then come and prove it. I\u2019ll stand still as a tree for you. You say. Grrrr! I\u2019ve had enough of you! Your death will not be a pleasant one! She said. I don\u2019t know what I did to piss you off so much, but give it your best shot. Like I said. I won\u2019t even move for you so you can tell your friends, if you have any, that you got a hit. You said. You can see her anger is boiling over at your comments. You can see that her power is radiating around her. I\u2019ve had more than enough of your slick comments! She said. A dark purple circle appears right under you. You can\u2019t move your legs. I said I\u2019d stand still for you so you could attack me. You said. who said I was going to attack you? She said. You sense a presence behind you, but you can\u2019t move your legs to turn around. You grab the person\u2019s arm and toss them into her. You see the circle disappear, but before you could do anything, you see a dark beam going through your chest. A third\u2026..!? You said. Shhhhh. This won\u2019t hurt a bit. The voice behind you said. You can feel an arm going through where your heart is. You\u2019ve come a long way. The longest any male has gotten here. You should feel proud, but this is where it ends. She said. You should\u2026\u2026.know that\u2026\u2026me and death\u2026..don\u2019t go well together. You said. You power up. The sudden change makes her withdraw her hand. When you go to grab her, she gone and in front of you. The two gaping wounds quickly heal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRgh! Why don\u2019t you just die!? Lucy said. By the looks of the three, you can tell they are sisters by blood from them wearing the same clothes. (sisters by blood. You know how this ends.) He said. (Yeah. I know how it ends. I\u2019m still contemplating using it.) you said.  Still look the same. One of them said. (These witches act like they know you.) He said. (I don\u2019t like where this might be going.) You said.  Why are you still alive!? How are you not dead yet!? Lucy said. I don\u2019t even know what I did to piss you off so much, besides coming here and killing everyone. You said. You don\u2019t remember? One witch said. Remember what? I don\u2019t even remember meeting you three. You said. The day you killed my daughter! Lucy said. Your daughter? I\u2019ve killed a lot of people, but I think I would remember killing a witch. You said. I will never forget that day\u2026\u2026 The look you had when you took her life\u2026\u2026.. You have it now! I vowed the next time I saw you, I\u2019d kill you! Lucy said. Well, if I did kill your daughter, I wonder what stopped me from killing you, cause you certainly didn\u2019t stop me from killing your daughter that day, now did ya? You said. You will not speak of her! Lucy said. as lucy comes at you, you drop a smoke pellet, which you use to cover your escape. *cough, *cough. Run all you want. *Cough, Cough* We\u2019ll find you! Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to a secluded room. Your dark side comes out. You saw how it ended. He said. Yeah. Those three killed me. I saw it with my own eyes. They killed me. You said. So are we going to just let them? He said.  Everything I tried was countered. Well, except one. You said. You mean\u2026.. He said. Yeah. You said. You show him the bag of black pills. These were the only thing, but you know the cost. You said. Our inner evil. He said. I only use these as a very last resort. You said. is it the only way to? He said. It really is. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk. It's almost midnight and no phone in from him. Dante said. Maybe he's asleep? Tom said. Em or Kris would have told us. Well. Kris would. Em just....stares at us. Dante said.  You think he's in trouble? Hank said. I saw him deep in thought the other day. He looked like he was planning something out. Cody said. He also took a bunch of equipment. Flares, smoke bombs. Things you would take if you were infiltrating an area. Bruce said. Why would he do that? Dante said.  Hmmmm. He did mention someone died. Cody said. Did he say if he was close to the person? Hank said. No, but I heard him mumble that \u201cshe\u201d will pay. Cody said. \u201cshe?\u201d Who\u2019s she? Bruce said. Guys! Look what I found! Tom said. Tom shows everyone your dog tags. His dog tag! He\u2019d never take it off unless\u2026\u2026 He knows he\u2019s not coming back! Bruce said. Guys\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s not the only thing. Look outside. Cody said. Everyone sees that it got very dark real quick. It was a clear night. Now there are dark clouds. Cody said. You think he\u2026\u2026 Wait. Where are those pills!?! Dante said. They\u2019re not here! They\u2019re gone! Tom said. Then everyone puts 2 and 2 together. We got to tell luke. Hank said. Tell me what? Luke said, appearing out of nowhere. He\u2019s in trouble! His dog tags, the pills, the sudden change in the sky. He\u2019s doing something dangerous! Bruce said. The pills are gone!? Luke said. Yes. The one that makes anyone\u2019s inner evil come out. Tom said. Did he say where he was going? Anywhere? Luke said. No. He told us nothing. The only thing I heard him say is \u201cShe\u2019s\u201d going to pay. Cody say. She? Who\u2019s she? Luke said. That\u2019s what we don\u2019t know. Bruce said. (It can\u2019t be heather. He wouldn\u2019t go to this extent just for her.) Luke thought. Guys.  Purple lightning just flash through the sky. Dante said. He took one of those pills! I\u2019ve seen all this before. It was before he met any of you. When he uses his true full power, this happens. But he loses himself to his dark thoughts. Luke said. Wait. It might not be bad. He\u2019s not any more evil than kyle, is he? Tom said. His evil will make kyle look like a saint. Luke said. We need to get him. Is there any way to stop it? Hank said. We have to move now. It\u2019ll take some time for him to reach his full evil, but we have to go while it\u2019s still developing. Luke said. But we don\u2019t know where he is? Cody said. Em! Luke said. Em comes running and looks worried. Em, he's gone missing! He left his tags and taken one of the pills. He said. Em's eyes go wide. You can find him like it's nothing. I can't believe i'm saying this, but we need your smothering instincts to find him. He said. Em takes a moment to sense you out and feels your energy. She quickly runs out. Follow her! She'll lead us to him! He said. What about Kris and the others? Bruce said. I'll tell them where to meet us when we get there. Let's go! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to your pov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you\u2019re about to take the pill, your dark side stops you. You know doing that will do\u2026\u2026 you know.  Plus luke and the crew will be here in minutes. He said. I know. I\u2019m willing to live with it as long as the final act I do is a good one. And for the guys, I just need to slow them down. You said. You swallow the pill and your dark side goes back inside you. You instantly feel the effects. Your power shoots up to max and your attitude gets a little dark. Revenge\u2026\u2026 You said. You summon a clone of yourself. Find them. Slow them down for as long as you can. You said. He disappears. You summon another clone. Find the remaining witches\u2026\u2026.and kill them! You said. He disappears as well and you head back to the entrance.</span></div></div>",

Then after waiting an hour, you see the moon light shine on the heavy doors and they start opening. Then one of your clones come back. Are they all dead? You said. Every last one here. I even found three special ones. He said. He shows you three necklaces. I took these as a prize. He said. Good. As long as every single one is dead. Now go help your brother. You said. he disappears. Then you feel your head start hurting. The world around you changes. After regaining your focus, you see you\u2019re in o district. You see you\u2019re in front of a house. What are they trying to show me\u2026..? you said. You see that guy again, but also with a woman. She has the blood of a witch. Siren. You said. You see that the woman is holding something in her arms. Upon more observation, you see that it\u2019s a baby and that baby looks like you. (is that me?) You thought. Then the world changes back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mother was a witch? So does that make me part witch as well? You said.  You clothes suddenly change to a black shirt with a flaming skull on it, black trench coat, and black jeans. Your eyes red and optical. You walk through the heavy set of doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter passing through, you see a flight of stairs. So you climb them. You thought you heard a voice. It sounded familiar. Father? You said. You keep climbing the stairs until you reach the top. You open the two doors. You see a throne. This must be where she sits her fat ass. But where is she? You said. Then you feel a heavy presence. So you made it this far? I\u2019m surprised. A voice said. It\u2019s a voice you know all too well. Heather\u2026.. You said. I have to admit. I thought you\u2019d die on the first one. But again, you prove me wrong. She said. If I\u2019m impressing you, then I\u2019m doing something wrong. You said. You swing behind you, but she\u2019s already gone and in front of you. You look different. She said. Out of my way, heather. You said. Why rush? Let\u2019s spend some time together. You\u2026.and me. She said. She moves her hand down your chest. You can\u2019t say that you haven\u2019t thought about me. She said. I don\u2019t have time for affection. Especially from a witch. You said. Come now. You can\u2019t say that.  You don\u2019t know how good I can be\u2026. She said. I don\u2019t have time for love. I have my plans to accomplish and you witches would be a pain in the ass to deal with later. You said. And do you mind sharing those plans? With me? She said seductively. Yes. I mind. You are not in the plans. You said. Just tell me. Maybe I can lend a hand. And other things. She said. You smile. Ok. I\u2019ll tell you. Come closer. You said. You grab her and pull her closer to you. Oh. I like this. She said. You pull her hood off and brush back her long blond hair. My plans\u2026\u2026 You said. Yes? She said. \u2026..Involves me and you\u2026....You said.  I already like where this is going. She said. It involve me standing over your dead body\u2026\u2026. You said. You place your hand on her chest, but she\u2019s gone in a puff of black smoke. She reapers in front of you. You almost had me. Something happened to you. She said as she puts her hood back on. You\u2019d never let me get that close to you. And your attitude seems a little more darker. \u2026\u2026..Oh, I see. You took one of those pills. She said. I did. You said. So do you still remember why you came here? She said. My f\u2026f\u2026friend was killed by her. I came to avenge him. You said. So you still remember. You still have good in you. You aren\u2019t completely bad. Yet. She said. You remain silent. So that must mean luke\u2019s on the way. She said. Luke\u2019s held up at the moment. He won\u2019t be here for a while. Leaving me more than enough time to wrap up here. You said. So luke won\u2019t be interfering? So made we can have a go and finish this time. She said. Time\u2019s wasting. Let\u2019s go! You said. As you wish, but just as a heads up: All the other times I was holding back on you because I didn\u2019t want to hurt too badly, but I think it\u2019s time I showed you how good I really am. She said. About time. I was wondering when. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou disappear and reappear behind her, but she\u2019s already gone. You turn around and she\u2019s nowhere to be seen. You feel energy all around you. Where is she\u2026\u2026.? You said. You see a purple energy shoot at you from all over. With a simple wave of your hand, they stop in midair. Very good. Heather said. The shadows won\u2019t hide you from me. You said. You see her and with a snap of your fingers, you send her own attack back at her. When it makes contact, it phases right through her. An Illusion? Your parlor tricks won\u2019t work. You said. Then you see another one. Two? You said. Which ones the real one? They both said. You point onr finger and fire a purple beam that splits in two, but goes straight through them both. Both Illusion. Where is the real one? You said. Right here. She said. Both illusion disappear and the real one was behind you. When you turn around, she places her hand on your stomach and a dark purple energy goes through you.  You smile as you hit the ground. Now, let\u2019s see what he had on him. She said. Before heather could move, something taped her on her shoulder and when she looked behind her, you punch her hard enough that she when through the throne chair. You\u2019re not the only one who can use parlor tricks. You said. You see heather stand up, but has her head down. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever been hit. She said. You feel a weird power in her. In fact, the last time I remember being hit was my first fight. Hehehe\u2026\u2026. She said. (Something\u2019s not right here.) You thought. Then her right eye starts glowing pink.  I\u2019m going to enjoy this! She said. She come at you and then disappears. Where\u2019d she go? You said. Then you are hit from behind. You stop yourself in midair and land on the ground. You see that heather\u2019s whole demeanor has change. You thought. Come on! Let\u2019s play! She said. ( I feel this bloodthirsty lust in her. Heather would never act like this. Taunting me, sure, but bloodlust ? She\u2019d never get like this.) You though. You look at her and see her energy flow. (Her energy is in a frenzy. It would be easier to kill her, but\u2026\u2026. Something won\u2019t let me. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s my remaining goodness. Or if I want to save her. Either way, here she comes!) You thought. Come, little boy! Let\u2019s play! I promise I won\u2019t be too rough!  She said. Guh! You said. Heather disappears and reappears multiple times as she makes her way towards you. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, but I\u2019m stopping you before you can get a chance! You said.</span></div></div>",

You both attack each other with heavy blows being exchange between you two. After exchanging blows, you two have little to no scratches on each other. That was an intense start! Come! I\u2019m not done playing yet! She said. \u2026\u2026..Fine. Time for round 2. Here I come! You said. You run charge at her. That\u2019s the spirit! This won\u2019t be fun unless you try! She said. You two disappear and clash all over the place and reappear on the ground. She sidesteps you, but you move out of the way of her attack. On the rebound, you kick her in the face. Impressive. Let\u2019s keep this up! She said. Burn. You said. Black fire flies towards her, but she holds out her hand and it disperses everywhere. Good effort.  Let\u2019s not stop now! She said. (If I don\u2019t figure out a way to end this now, luke and the guys will be here. Or worse. That one move. But it will take all of my power and energy. But if this get dragged out\u2026\u2026.) You thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmph\u2026.. You said. You shrink back down to normal size. What are you doing? She said. \u2026\u2026\u2026If I have to. You said. You concentrate all of your power.  A ring of fire encircles and closes on her. Heh heh. This will only hold me for a few seconds! What good will a few seconds do you? She said. Another ring appears around her.  What are you planning? She said. Then a third ring appears around her. You concentrate the energy and a huge explosion destroys the top half of the building. As the dust clears, you see heather is lying right in front of you. She\u2019s not dead. She\u2019s unconscious. That should have killed her.  I put all of my power into that and she\u2019s still breathing. You said.  Then you hear the sound of slow clapping. Bravo. A voice said. So finally decided to quit hiding. You said. In the sky, you see your target floating down towards the ground. I guess I should give you credit for surviving this long and making it here. She said. She looks exactly like how you remember her and she\u2019s only 18. You look like shit. She said. And you don\u2019t look like the queen of bitches with that stuff on. You look like a siren. You said. Just because I am, doesn\u2019t mean I need to dress like one. So why are you here killing my subjects? She said. You killed my f\u2026f\u2026f\u2026..friend. You said. Friend? Oh, your friend Arif. You remember that day? She said. I haven\u2019t. You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashback. 1 \u00bd months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re walking through the destroyed streets of O district. You feel a presence behind you. You look, but no one is there. Maybe it was the wind. You said. You keep walking and look at a destroyed building and see the rotting bodies of males. I think this is one of the reasons Sue  fights so hard. To keep M district from becoming like this. You said. You feel that someone is behind you. You\u2019re about to hit the person, but stop when you see it\u2019s arif. Arif? You said. Nice to see you still remember me. He said. I haven\u2019t seen you since\u2026\u2026.. The Galloway? Yeah. I don\u2019t blame you for thinking I was dead. Don\u2019t worry, they won\u2019t be a pain anymore. He said. You took care of them? You said. I also found something that helped. He said. He shows you your old gear. You found it? You even fixed the mask? You said. Yeah. It helped. Still brings fear even after your whole face reveal. He said. Does it fit you? You said. Yeah. Like a glove. He said. He puts it on with no problem. Hmmmm. It looks better on you than it did me. You said. Come. Let\u2019s reminisce. He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley still giving you a hard time? He said. Like a rash. You'd think she'd stop after i took on Kyle and his goons. You said. Yeah, i saw.  I lost that bet. He said. Really. You bet against me? You said. After i earned my freedom, i got drunk more times than i could count. And I don\u2019t think that well when I drink. He said. How much? You said. $400 and you\u2019d be killed by luna. He said. Really? Luna. You said. She deadly. He said. Maybe if you said amy or kyouki. But luna? You said. Like I said, I was drunk at the time. He said. Yeah. Drunk. How long did you think I\u2019d last? You said. Uh\u2026\u2026 he said. Come on. Out with it. You said. 3 minutes and you'd be on your knees begging. Really. I feel offended and underestimated. You said. I was drunk. Off my ass drunk. I wasn\u2019t seeing double, I was seeing quadruple. He said.  Sure. You said. Anyway, what have you been doing? He said. I\u2019ve assembled a gang of people. Basically say i have a squad. You said. I thought you told me you didn\u2019t want to involve others. He said. Well, they came to me and they really wanted to.You said.  So this gang is yours? He said. Trained by me and luke. They can handle themselves, but you know how I am about my friends. You said. Overprotective. He said. It can\u2019t be helped. I can\u2019t stand seeing my friends hurt. And you? You said. I\u2019m looking for someone. He said. Who? You said. A person. He\u2019s probably grown up by now. I need to find him. He said. For what? You said. I just need to find him. He said.  Do you need help? You said. No. I just need to find him before it\u2019s too late. He said. Too late for what? You said. Nothing. He said. He owes you money? You said. No. I just need to find him. Ok\u2026. I see you still have your tags I made you. You said. Yeah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you hear that? He said. Hear what? You said. *Sigh* Seems like I\u2019m out of time. He said. What do you mean? You said. He pulls off his tags and gives them to you. Take these. You said. Arif. What are you doing? You said. You\u2019ll understand soon. He said. Understand what? If someone is out for you, I can handle them. You said. Then he pinches your shoulder and you are knocked out. Avenge me. He said. A hour later, you wake up. Ow. The sleeper pinch. Arif? Arif! You said. You walk the desolated streets. You walk a few feet and see blood. Blood. Is that Arif\u2019s? You said. You follow the trail until you come across a body bathe in blood. No, no, no, no, no, no. You said. You turn the body over and see it\u2019s Arif. Arif! You shout. You remember hearing him say \u201cAvenge me.\u201d Someone was out for him. Who? You said. You examine his body and see a burn mark and smell a scent of magic. This is too gruesome for heather\u2019s work. You said. Then you look beside Arif\u2019s cold body and see the word witch scribed in blood. A witch? You said. You look up in the sky and get a brief look at a dark figure in the sky. You\u2019re going to pay! You hear me!? You said. You pick up Arif\u2019s body and bury him. This won\u2019t stand at all. I\u2019ll deal with kyle first, then those bitches will pay. All of them! You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Flash back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was my f\u2026f\u2026friend. And you killed him. You said. So you\u2019re here for that. Do you even know what Arif was looking for? She said. He didn\u2019t tell me. You said. He was looking for you. She said. Me? You said. yes, but not for what you think. He was looking for Devil dog\u2019s son.  She said. Why? You said. Did you really know your father? She said. not really. You said. Let\u2019s just say he wasn\u2019t the most well-liked by people. In fact, I don\u2019t think he was liked at all. Your father was a, what do a shorter word for soldier of fortune? She said. Mercenary. You said. Yeah, that. He was smart, strong, you name it. But he used his skills for those who paid him the most money. That didn\u2019t make him well liked among the people. Murdered, kidnapped, you name, he did it all for money. She said. Just like me. You said. Really? I guess mercenary is in the blood then. She said. Why would arif be looking for me? You said. If you saw how your father was and acted, you\u2019d think only one devil dog was enough. The world couldn\u2019t handle a second. She said. So you sent arif to kill me. You had a friend try to kill me. You are a bitch. You said. Maybe I am, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a mean one. She said. What do you mean? You said. With a snap of her fingers, you see two portals. What are you trying to do here? You said. The portal on your left has your father and the one on the right has your acclaimed friend Arif. They both will take you back to that time and you can save them from their tragic deaths. She said. I\u2019m not dumb. What\u2019s the catch? You said. Heh. You can only save one. Which one will it be? Your father or your acclaimed friend Arif even though he\u2019s hunting you? She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeh. You must think I was born yesterday. I know what you\u2019re trying to do. If I save my dad, I might not have my powers, my friends, or anything. If I saved arif, he\u2019ll continue his mission. He always has. You said. heh. Very well. She said. The two portals disappear. You feel your two clones have been defeated. As much as I\u2019d like to take my time with you, I\u2019m on a schedule. So let\u2019s get this over with. You said. With a snap of her fingers, a man in military gear appears. You see his face resembles yours. Dad? You said. You heard why today was special, right? She said. One of your witches was talking about it. You said. Well, since Arif failed to get the job done, who better to kill his son than his father? She said.  Father\u2026\u2026. You said. ugh\u2026\u2026..oh\u2026\u2026. he said. he can\u2019t hear you. And just in case you somehow still alive, I have another surprise for you. Devil dog. Kill. She said. Ohhhh\u2026\u2026..! He said. (Can I hurt my father?) You thought as he comes at you.</span></div></div>",

If my eyes weren\u2019t optical, I\u2019d probably not be able to keep up.) You thought. You can run forever. You\u2019ll tire out soon. She said.  (She\u2019s right. I\u2019m just wearing myself down. But I don\u2019t want to hurt him.) You thought. You side step him, but you couldn\u2019t hit him. Father\u2026\u2026 you said. Ugh\u2026\u2026\u2026 He said. It\u2019s me your son. You said. ohhhhhhh\u2026\u2026..son\u2026\u2026.. He said. Yes. Dad, it\u2019s your son. You said. You said. S\u2026s\u2026.son\u2026\u2026.son. He said. How cute. But he\u2019s far from being reached. She said. with a snap of her fingers, your dad goes into a vicious rage. Dad! You said. He starts attacking you, but you dodge him. Dad. It\u2019s your son. You\u2019re being controlled! You said. He can\u2019t hear you. I have absolute control over him. She said. You keep dodging him until he leg sweeps you. Dad. It\u2019s your son!

But it\u2019s all futile. With a wave of her hand, your father becomes more vicious. You hold him back before he could grab you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(It\u2019s no good. The more I reach, the father he gets away. I want to save him, but i don\u2019t think I can.) You said. Then you hear a voice. (Son.) It said. (D\u2026d\u2026Dad.) You said. (Son. I know what you\u2019re trying to do. Stop it. You know there is only one way.) He said. (B\u2026.but. I don\u2019t want this bitch to control you.) You said. (Son\u2026\u2026. You know how you feeling about the dead having the sleep disturbed. You know what must be done.) he said.  (But I can\u2019t kill you. Plus, your life was taken from you by these bitches.  You shouldn\u2019t be dead yet.) You said. (Son\u2026\u2026. I\u2019ve live a full life. Even though it was suddenly taken by these witches. I did a lot of bad things in the world. But you are the only good thing I put in it. I didn\u2019t want you to have the life I had. By look we you are. Doing what I failed to do. I\u2019m\u2026\u2026.Proud of you. He said.) (Dad\u2026..) you said. (Now\u2026.. You know what must be done.) He said.  You push you father off you. Dad. I won\u2019t let you have him. You said. He comes at you, but all you do it hug him. Dad. It\u2019s time to go back to sleep. You said as you stab him in the back with your knife. S\u2026\u2026son. I\u2019m proud of you. And how you\u2019ve grown so much. He said before disappearing. Dad! You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was unexpected. She said. You grow to 100t. You\u2019re going to pay. Not only for Arif, but for my father as well. You said. There\u2019s just one more thing to do before that. She said. She says an enchantment and a dark purple circle appears on the floor. Coming out of the circle, you see a woman. A woman you\u2019ve seen before. M\u2026..m\u2026\u2026Mom!? You said. That\u2019s right. Your own mother.  The best witch there ever was before she left us for your father. She said. Who\u2019s this pissant? I\u2019ll deal with him. Leah Said.  Why you! You said. How exciting! Mother vs son. Witch vs human!  Which one will win? She said. Mother\u2026\u2026 You said. If you\u2019re just going to stand there, then I\u2019ll make the first move. Leah said. The marks on her start glowing and she waves her hand.  A dark purple bubble appears around you and you can\u2019t move. You disappear and reappear behind her. Hmmm. Maybe you aren\u2019t completely worthless as I thought. She said. Mother\u2026.. You said. Heh. I might enjoy this. She said. Just like with your father, you hesitate. Come on. Don\u2019t be shy.  I won\u2019t hurt you. Much. She said.  You can tell she\u2019s not lying. You feel the energy and power from your mother. (Her power is unnatural.  Maybe\u2026\u2026.for once\u2026\u2026.i was in over my head. I never expected this. But\u2026\u2026..I didn\u2019t get to where I am today by waiting around. Maybe I can reach her. Maybe.) Ok. Let\u2019s do this. You said. You feel the energy pulsing through you. (I don\u2019t have much time.) You thought. You blast a dark beam at her and she takes it head on and is unscratched.  Is that it? Leah said. I had to make sure you\u2019re worth the time and sweat. I don\u2019t pay attention to 3rd rate wannabe witches. You said. well, I\u2019ll show you I\u2019m not 3rd rate wannabe. Leah said.  You disappear and, but with a wave of her hand, Leah stops you dead in your tracks. Quick, but not quick enough. She said. I just need to get close to you. With the use of the optical eyes, you break free and hit her in the face. Ow! \u2026\u2026.You have a strong arm. That one actually hurt a little. She said. \u2026\u2026..My strength is unmatched. You said. Hmmm, if you don\u2019t mind, you look familiar. Have I seen you before? She said. I don\u2019t associate with your kind. You said. By that, you mean witches. She said.  Yes. You said. You do remind me of one person\u2026\u2026. He had the same demeanor when I first saw him. Anyway. Let\u2019s try something different. She said. The marks on leah start glowing. Let\u2019s see. Which one to use? Something dazzling. She said. Multiple bright energy balls come at you. When they hit you, you don\u2019t even react to it. Oh, tough guy, are you? Leah said. try again. You said. It was simple. Let\u2019s do something bigger. She said. A bright beam hits you and a small explosion happens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dust clears, you\u2019re still standing there. Oh, you\u2019re something special. She said. Is this all a witch can offer? You said. You sound just like a person I know. Come to think of it, you look like him. And acting like him. She said. Then Leah remembers. S\u2026.s\u2026..son? She said. \u2026\u2026Mother. You said. My\u2026\u2026.My baby\u2026\u2026..my\u2026\u2026.son. Y\u2026..you\u2019ve grown.  She said. Mom\u2026\u2026. You said. W\u2026..why am I fighting my child? Did\u2026.. I hurt you? She said. You\u2019ve been brought back from the dead, and being controlled. You said. Controlled? \u2026\u2026.but the only person to do that would be\u2026\u2026.Melina. She said. Oh, so you came to your senses as well. She said. Melina\u2026\u2026. You made me fight my son. I should have killed you when i had the chance. Leah said. You\u2019re always spouting off about what you should have done. Melina said. If I knew you\u2019d make me attack my son, I\u2019d done it! Leah said. ah, ah, ah. You yourself know that since you were summoned by me, you have to obey me. Melina said. I\u2026\u2026won\u2019t\u2026\u2026hurt\u2026\u2026my son! She said. You were always the defiant one. Luckily, I had anticipated this. Melina said. With a snap of her fingers, Leah\u2019s mark start glowing. No\u2026\u2026 I\u2026..won\u2019t let you! Leah said. Come on, leah. Show your son your special summoning. Melina said. No! Not him! Leah said. Leah says a enchantment and a huge hell hound with pointy teeth and sharp fangs comes out of nowhere. A hell hound? Haven\u2019t seen one in a long time. You said. Go on, Leah. Command Bloodhound to attack. Melina said. N\u2026.never! Leah said. Go on, Leah. Melina said. Bloodhound\u2026..a\u2026.a\u2026a\u2026..Attack! leah said. Bloodhound charges at you. Time to put the dog down. You said. Bloodhound bites you on your arm. Bad dog! You said as you punched him off. Bloodhound gets up and runs in a circle around you, leaving a ring of fire. You call this fire? You say. Black fire engulf the smaller fire. Come here, boy. You said. Bloodhound comes at you and you let him push to the ground. When he looks at you, it recognizes you from seeing you as a baby and remembers your scent.  It starts licking you. Good boy. Now, go back and wait. You said. Bloodhound gets off you disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Bloodhound. Melina said. A dog knows it\u2019s master. You said. He\u2019s my child! Leah said. All the more to finish this. She said. I won\u2019t hurt my son! Leah said. Yes, you will. And I want you to do your deadliest attack. Melina said. I\u2026.. Won\u2019t! leah said. You will! Melina said. Leah grabs you and the marks start glowing. Leah doesn\u2019t want to, but she know she must listen. Son\u2026\u2026. I love you. Leah said. You uses the optical eyes to break the hold on her. Your mom can tell she\u2019s free, but knows that she will return to the dead since she is free. Son\u2026\u2026 thank you. She whispered in your ear before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my, you freed both your mother and father from my control. You are special. Melina said. You will pay for enslaving my parents\u2026\u2026 you said. Is that so? Well then, I might have to lift a finger then. She said. Before you can start, you can feel luke\u2019s energy. They\u2019re here. I was hoping to be done. But it seems I have to do this early. You said. You hit the detonate button and all of the charges you plant start to explode. The building starts to fall apart and crumble piece by piece. What have you done!? She said. This building is coming down. We will either both die or one will walk out alive. You said. I was hoping to take it slow and painful with you, but I don\u2019t plan on being buried alive. So I\u2019ll kill you fast. She said. Don\u2019t count on it. You said. </span></div></div>",

You said. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m counting on. She said. You go for a punch, but she blocks and tries to punch you, but you grab her fist and twist it and punch her hard in the face. Lucky shot. Melina said. She comes at you and you block a punch. You see her smile. You get a bad feeling and disappear and reappear behind her and kick her, but she blocks and hits you right in the face. You disappear and reappear right in front of her and hold your hand out and blast her right in the chest, but there is no hole in her. It\u2019s going to take more energy than that to harm me. She said. She snaps her fingers and out of thin air, purple spheres come at you. You shoot a few black energy balls at them and they exploded. You quickly charge and tackle her to the ground and are about to hit her, but she\u2019s gone. Where did you go? You said. You block out the crumbling and falling bricks and listen for her. You can her the rush of her footsteps behind you. You do a round house kick behind you and she hits the ground. Turning invisible won\u2019t help you. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrrrrr! She said. Getting frustrated? Not having fun because you\u2019re losing? You said. The marks on her body start glowing. Someone\u2019s not happy. You said.  She comes at you. Because her head isn\u2019t cool and she\u2019s just randomly attacking, you easily block and dodge her attacks. You block one of her punches and combo her and finish by kneeing her in the chin. Hehe. Pathetic. This is the queen of the bitches? This is all you can muster? You said.  You see that she\u2019s even more angry. The marks on her expand onto the other half of her body. You\u2019re going to pay for your insults! She said. When she goes to attack, you side step her. Then you get hit from behind. A clone? You said. You dodge the first one and second one, but you get hit by a third one and they attack you from all around. The hit the ground hard from their last attack. The two clones disappear. You get up with no problem. You\u2019re a tough guy. She said. You disappear and reappear and attack her, but it has no effect. Was that suppose to hurt? She said. You remain quiet. Let me show you the difference in my power and yours. She said. Out of thin air, multiple purple energy balls come at you. You disappear and reappear after they exploded. You get hit hard and fast by her and when she hits you in the air, she jumps up and blasts you back down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lands on square on your chest. Now do you see? You can\u2019t match a witch unless you\u2019re another witch. She said. \u2026\u2026.Hmph. You said. This place is going down. And once It does, I\u2019ll rebuild it on top of your dead body. She said. All of your powers go away and black marks appear on the right side of your arm. What!? She said. You grab her by the throat. You are a siren!? But you\u2019re not a witch or a woman! She said. You slowly get up. My mother is a witch. I\u2019m her son. So that means I have witch blood. You said. you throw her away. This building is seconds away from crumbling. I\u2019ll finish this now! She said. She attacks you, but you block with one arm and kick her in the stomach with all your strength. Ack! She said. All of the wind was kicked out of her. You\u2026\u2026pant\u2026\u2026won\u2019t\u2026..pant\u2026\u2026win! She said. Out of thin air, purple energy beams come at you. You hold out your hand and absorb the energy. How!? She said. You say an enchantment and  summon Bloodhound. A summoning! How are you doing this? She said. Kill. You said. Bloodhound attacks Melina and violently rip her to pieces. Bloodhound.  Stop. You said. Bloodhound stops and comes to your side. You grab Melina by the throat. W\u2026.w\u2026.what are you? She said. A man. You said before ripping her heart out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe marks on your arm go away and so does bloodhound does. You fall to your knees from power exertion. I\u2019m back to normal. You see the building is about to give. You\u2019re about to run out until you see heather\u2019s unconscious body. (We have to go!) he said. (Yeah, but I can\u2019t leave her.) You said. (She\u2019s a witch. She can\u2019t be trusted.) He said.  (I know.  But\u2026\u2026.. I won\u2019t forgive myself for it.) You said. You grab heather\u2019s body and carry her out of the crumbling building. You get out of the building before it all falls down. You place her in the ground and walk away. You revert back to normal size. When you see the guys, they see all of the cuts and bruises on you as you walk by. What happened in there? Tom said. I don\u2019t know, but it must have been hell. Bruce said. What happened? Luke said.  You just keep walking back to the mansion. Not saying a single word.</span></div></div>",
