            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a calm, normal night in the town of Quiet Rock, the little villa nary having a populace of a thousand people. A bright, full moon casted it's glow of silver light upon a young teenage girl that stormed into her home seething with anger and covered in sewage. This young girl happened to be named Edna McCoy, and her last sane nerve had just snapped...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was the mall, dearie?\"A female voice called out from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>FUCKIN'. TERRIBLE.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto the kitchen went Edna's soaked form, her clothes stinking of rot and covered in an odd green slime that clung to every last inch of her, her face scrunched up into that of pure rage. The voice that had called out earlier happened to be her mother, and she raised a quizzical eyebrow at her daughter.\"What happened to you?\"She asked, returning to cooking dinner for her family of three. The husband would not be there that night, for he was much too busy poisoning himself with alcohol at a local bar just after his divorce. He was happy about it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather fucking Miles. That's what happened.\"Edna replied as she grabbed a towel from the counter and tried her very best to wipe away the filth that seemed to have taken a liking to being glued to her skin.\"I was hanging out with my friends, enjoying some of that gross food court junk...\"She growled as a large, unknown black clump was yanked out of the mass of red frizz she called hair.\"When Heather fucking Miles decides to tell a couple of her dumb jock boy toys to throw a bucket of garbage on me. I didn't even know where they got it from!\"She screeched in pain as she ripped off one of the custarded pieces of goop from her forearm. Her mother's face was still questioning, but she remained silent as she pulled meat loaf from the oven.\"I just don't know what to do with you, Edna...\"She mumbled, returning to a mindless humming tune to further block out any conversation with her troubled daughter. It had always been like this ever since the divorce. Edna would come home with a problem, and Laura would ignore it. She only believed in a happy world and happy stuff with her happy children, like her son, Ralph. He was always doing well in sports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh and an angered expression, Edna stomped off towards her only sanctuary, the basement. Nobody else would bother her in there. On the way to her place of seclusion, her brother slid by her in the hallway, almost gagging and vomiting at the smell coming from her. That got her to smile a bit.\"Sweet freakin' Christ, what happened to you?!\"Ralph said, covering his mouth and nose with his hand, tears of pain about to roll down his face.\"Heather. Fucking. Miles.\"Was all she replied before pulling the door to the basement open, entering, and slamming it shut, the distinct sound of a lock clicking echoing in her wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clicked on a naked lightbulb, the artificial yellow glow illuminating the innards of her workshop, dust motes lazily floating in and out of the light produced. A pile of abandoned comics and manga filled one corner, a workbench with various tool and appliances took up one wall. This was her goal. She approached it slowly, as if almost in reverence. What laid on this table was the fruit of many toiling months in dark and all of her anger combined into one hope. Despite the heat of the underground dwelling, she felt almost relaxed as her hand picked up a small device in the shape of a child's toy pistol, shiny chrome in color and cool to the touch, on the side, two buttons and two dials corresponding to those buttons. She grinned almost wickedly as she held it up to the light, examining it as a prize won.\"Heather Miles....\"She whispered to herself before whipping around and pulling the trigger of the gun, a bright green beam erupting from the barrel and blasting the pile of comics. In a flash, they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna walked over to where the pile had once been, bent down, and picked up what seemed to be a bunch of books meant to be held by a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You are <i>fucked.</i>\"She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Very Next Day</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Edna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe geek girl looked up from her locker to see her best friend smiling down sympathetically at her. Ruthie Hayes, Edna's best and closest, and possibly only friend since kindergarten. Throughout the horrible years, she had always been there for Edna and stood up for her whenever she couldn't herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Ruthie...\"Edna replied, casually adjusting her purse, making sure the precious contents inside was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\"Her eyes worriedly examined Edna.\"You always wear that shirt when you're depressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna looked down to see a black shirt with <i>Death Note</i> written across it in bold white letters. She also wore some tight shorts and flip flops, very odd for her usual ensemble, but today would be an unusual day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But, I promise, I'm fine.\"She cracked a fake grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie crossed her arms, a mischievous smile playing across her lips.\"Are you just trying to convince me you're fine? 'Cause y'know, it's not working very well for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me,\"Edna shrugged and began walking, her much taller friend following behind. The smaller girl easily worked her way through the crowd of students, her goal just a few yards away. It was a few minutes before first bell, but a few minutes was all she need to enact her plan.\"I believe today is going to be better than last night, a whole lot better...\"She almost cackled as she came upon Heather and her group of follow-arounds leaning against some lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diva locked down at the short girl with a smirk, easily almost a whole torso and head taller than her.\"Hey there, Edna.\"She greeted with a smirk with her plump pink-coated lips, blowing an equally pink bubble and popping it before continuing chewing her gum.\"Weird...you don't smell like shit today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sent the entire group of Heather's girls into an uproar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to give you a chance to apologize.\"Edna replied monotonously, her hand slowing inching towards her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologize?\"Heather mimicked the word as cruelly as possible, spitting it out along with her wad of gum at Edna's face.\"I'm not apologizing for anything. In fact, you should apologize to me for walking up like you actually have something important to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother roar of giggles. Heather settled them down with a wave of her finely manicured hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna wiped the gum off, smiled as sweetly as he could, and reached into her bag.\"I was so hoping you were going to say that...\"She slowly pulled out her size changing device, and Heather's eyes widened in fear.\"You...brought a <i>gun</i> to school?!\"She screeched just as the bell for first period rang. Nobody would hear her over the ringing and the sound of the crowd. Edna had the perfect shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's not just any gun....it's a <i>SIZE gun.</i>\"</span></div></div>",

But unknowing to them, Edna had finally gotten her hands on something to change all of this in one fell swop, would it worked, she didn't know and how much it would she didn't know either. So she set it to a random setting and pointed the ray gun at herself. The mean girls still mocking her, till she a bright blast of light came from the gun and covered Edna in a beautiful green glow and soon it faded. To Edna's dismay, nothing happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, was that it, a pretty light show?\" Heather asked mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna blushed from being upset and she started to get really frustrated. \"No, I was suppose to Gro...\" Edna trailing off from her sentence, as she suddenly started to feel her plaid skirt and the rest of her clothes getting tighter and tighter. Soon her breasted started to inflate like air balloons. Her short, but modest 4'9 stature was slowly climbing a inch a second! 4'10, 4'11, 5'0, you could sync a watch with her growing height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather and the rest of the student body that happen to be in the hallway watched in a mixture of amazement and fear.  Edna had a mixture of euphoria and fear sweep over her whole mind and body as she watched herself slowly creeping to heather's height and soon passed it. It wasn't long till, the front of her shirt split open to reveal a lovely set of perky C-cups. Though they weren't stopping at C, they slowly grew and grew with her whole body. Edna couldn't help but grope her newly enhanced breasts. She blushed heavily and taunted the mean girls with her new breasts. But Edna wasn't paying attention and she bashed her head through the hallway ceiling. She pulled her head out and smirked at the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, I went through the roof, I'm such a big girl... aren't I heather?\" Edna mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Edna's clothes torn apart one by one, till she was left in nothing but her bra and panties. Though her bra didn't take too long till it exploded off of her and torn through a locker door like a cannon ball. Edna giggled at this and sat on the floor. Soon her panties ripped open, giving Heather and her friends a nice view of Edna's exposed crotch. Edna kept growing and growing. Edna kept taunting Heather and her friends as she just wouldn't stop expanding. But the mean girls soon realized the way the were standing, they were in direct line of being engulfed into Edna's massive vagina!! They tried to move out of the direct line, but Edna's legs were curled up against the opposing walls on each side and so they were trapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Edna realized what was going to happen, she just laughed so hard and said, \"Finally you sluts will be used for what your only good at.\" Edna continued to expand as she tore up and through the ceiling once more and continued up till she exploded out of the school's roof. She finally stopped growing and before she could get up to see how much she grew. She felt a ton of wiggling in her vagina and she let out a huge pleasurable moan. She looked down and decided to figure herself with the girls in her vagina. She played with herself for a while, and soon everyone was outside the school staring at her massive form and she even had local news crews standing outside recording her. Edna was reaching close to her climax as she buckled wildly and moaned loudly, soon she let out a huge OOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH! Then Heather and her friends exploded out of her vagina, safe and sound, but wet from head to toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you sluts make for awful people, but you make great dildos.\" Edna smirked and mocked at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather couldn't reply and was so stunned what had just happen to her and her friends. What does Edna do now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"left\">Edna grinned as she shot the ray at herself. Heather stood with her mouth agape and waited to see what would happen. Ruth felt the heat coming off of Edna as she began to slowly fill out the space around her. Her shorts creaked as her pale wide hips began to grow thicker. Edna was climbing in height while Heather stared. \"I don't believe it. This has to be some trick.\" Heather said and moved close to Edna. A wide grin swept over the red haired girl's face as she crept up closer to Heather. \"You can't just grow like that!\" Heather yelled and made a lunge at the expanding Edna. Edna was starting to grow faster, Ruth stood back and fell to the ground as she tripped over her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you get how fucked you are Heather.\" Edna said in a high pitched kawaii sounding tone. \"I'm going to get big. Like Godzilla big.\" Edna said proudly. Heather's face went pale and she tried to grab Edna's hair. Edna just stood while grinning from cheek to cheek. Her arms were on her hips and she leaned her head to the side as Heather held a part of Edna's growing scalp by her fingers. Edna continued to fill the area and Heather was closer than she realized as she felt the bounce of Edna's C cup breasts on her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds those perky, tear-drop like tits were over Heather's head and she could see the death note shirt Edna was wearing looked more like a tube top. Heather could see the underside of Edna's white bra and felt ill. Edna began to feel her shorts sharply pinch into her hips. The button holding the shorts together popped off violently rocketing into a locker. Edna was now several heads taller than Heather and her C cup breasts were being very tightly pinched by her very small bra. Edna considered trying to remove her tight clothes, but felt it would take away from the awe and felt it more dramatic to let her clothes be made tatters by her transformation. Edna was feeling her very tight clothes and regretting the things she sometimes did to be awesome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather began to shake in fear then turned around and ran down the hall. Edna chuckled knowing when she was done growing there would be no where Heather could go to avoid her. Edna could feel her thighs being burned by the legs of her shorts, they were very tight around her and still had not begun to tear. Her shirt was beginning to tear down the side and patches of her freckle covered torso began to pop out from the ripping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth sat on the ground and watched as her childhood friend expand and climb into the air. Her head was inching closer to the ceiling and Edna felt the sides of her flip flops give out and then could feel her shorts began to tear. As the sides of her shorts gave away more and more of the light blue and white vertical striped panties could be seen. Edna felt the back end of her shorts tear open and they split in two pieces down her hips. Edna could feel her bra dig deep into her back and then the hooks on the back slide and the sides snapped off her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna felt her breasts spill out of her bra and could feel cool air on her large pink nipples. Edna's breasts had a bouncy fullness, her light pink areolas were puffed out and swollen nipples jutted out from Edna's chest. She leaned her back to lift her breasts and bring attention to them. Many of the males in the school had stopped what they were doing to watch Edna's growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna felt her underwear ride up and wedgie between her legs. a damp patch covered the bottom and an outline of her ruby colored hair could be seen. Edna didn't expect to feel an erotic tingle from her pussy but obviously such forceful motions would make her feel something. She could see the eyes looking at her and saw they seemed to be level with her crotch. She rolled her eyes as her head bumped into the 12 foot ceiling. Edna let her butt slam down with a thud on an unsuspecting boy of about 16. She could feel him seem to shrink under her expanding thighs. Edna moaned lightly as her panties snapped off her massive womanhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna looked around and was greeted by shocked faces. \"Not some little geek now huh?\" Edna said to the crowd as a whole. She continued to edge closer to the ceiling at a steady rate and even now sitting her head was pressing against the tile ceiling. In a sudden rush Edna lifted herself up and sent her head crashing through the ceiling. Students on the second floor yelled and were flung around as a huge crown of ginger hair tore up the floor and scattered debris everywhere. Edna was feeling relief as no longer were any clothes pinching or clamping around her body. She was still holding the gun in her left hand but that was the only thing Edna had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of Edna grew through the hole her head had created students on the second floor saw two pale areolas and traffic cone sized nipples on top of two bean bag like freckle covered breasts. The students on the first floor could only see Edna's expanding feet, towering legs and massive curly red bush. Her torso was making more of a hole as her head inched closer to the second story ceiling. She knew she was no where near done and decided to try and sit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna put all of her force into her back and could feel the floor buckle and splinter into ruin, the ground gave away with little effort but she used a lot of force causing the ground to very quickly crumble. Many students too close to Edna fell down the hole into the first floor or were hit by falling debris. She could feel she had several students under her rump this time. Edna hoped Ruth wasn't one of them as she could feel her cheeks crushing whoever it was. The sensation was making Edna feel aroused and she casually let her free hand probe at her muff. Many girls made loud complaints shouting \"Gross, Ew etc.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna felt her body was growing even faster now as light tingles from her pussy seemed to encourage the overall effect. She began to breath in shallow breaths as she let her massive mound press into the breaking ground under her giant body. Her head was about to hit the ceiling again, Edna knew she was near 50 feet tall and was excited about the game of cat and mouse she was about to have with Heather. Edna loudly moaned as she ran her finger over her clit over and over. Her body seemed to swell much faster than before and more of the two floors were being torn apart. Her head slammed into the roof and loud snaps of breaking metal filled the sky. Her massive brown eyes peeked over the roof and she could see for miles. Everything looked very tiny and shrinking to Edna. She was gleefully biting her lower lip as she exploded in orgasm part of the school was exploding from an exposed gas line. Her neck and breasts pushed parts of the roof a side and they landed near the school with ground-rattling booms. Edna tried to climb out of the hole and found it easier just to tear off a side and walk through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna was delighted at how easily everything was for her to move. Her once tiny fingers were now stronger than a bulldozer and no person would ever be able to tease her again. As Edna continued to rise into the blue sky she could see more and more in the distance and wondered what she would do after she dealt with the little nothing Heather. <br>\r\n </div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"left\">Edna called out Ruth's name several times, and to her relief she could see the pink of her hair. Ruth was standing near the front parking lot and heard her name thundering from several hundred feet up. She had left the school before Edna had caused the massive hole that left a few students under piles of loose bricks, drywall and splintered wood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather was running as fast as she could, and her heart sank in her chest as she saw walls of freckled skin that seemed to tower into the sky too high to be real. Heather's face was a deep red from the sprinting she was doing. She could feel her whole body tremble as panic caused her breath to become erratic. Edna was standing still and stopped expanding as she became the length of a football field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school's highest point of sixty feet was lower than Edna's ankles. Edna bent down and got on her hands and knees. Ruth's stomach filled with butterflies as the colossal orbs of brown that were Edna's eyes rushed closer to her. Edna bent down and her face was several feet from Ruth. Ruth could feel a light heat from Edna's body and she knew she couldn't be dreaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I was going to make a real size-ray. Would you like to see how it works first hand?\" Edna asked her tiny pink-haired friend. Ruth looked up and was in awe at the sheer mass of Edna's frame. Ruth felt like an ant and didn't want to think about how dangerous Edna was given her form. The idea of joining Edna was very appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth put her right hand index finger to her mouth and made a melodramatic display of how she was thinking about it. \"Ummnm... hummm become a giant or risk being crushed under you... think think think what to choose... join my best friend in what is likely to be an awesome experience or abandon her when she could use a friend the most...what to do what to do...\" Ruth trailed off. Edna's eye narrowed and she was amused by the obvious sarcasm to her voice. Edna's smile was cat-like pursed in the middled and she giggled at Ruth as she shot her mid-pondering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth let out a short high pitched squeal as the ray unexpectedly pierced her. Her spine tingled and she could feel her breasts dig into the cups of her bra. Her eyes went wide as she realized what was happening. She looked down at her thighs and feet while Edna could see more and more of the pink that was the top of Ruth's head. Ruth felt her red plaid skirt was digging into her hips as her black lace panties slid into her. Ruth looked up at Edna grinning down at her and was trembling from the tension on her clothes. Her shoes caused her feet to curl into themselves and she felt her socks strain across her lower-ankles. A loud creaking from the straps of Ruth's flower patterned black lacy bra was followed by her groaning as her nipples outlined her red blouse. Ruth saw the ground lifting up as her legs lengthened and her whole body expanded. Edna had to lean back as Ruth was getting close to her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a cry of pain as her feet forcefully broke through the insides of her now ruined shoes. Her bra snapped as her blouse tore down the center. Ruth pulled away the red cloth and could feel the cool air on her hard nipples. A few more moments of Ruth expanding and her red-plaid skirt tore loudly down the left side of her hips. Standing only in a pair of black lacy panties that were very tightly grinding into her nether-region, Ruth could see more and more of Edna as she gaining in size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna was delighted to see Ruth get larger, and excitedly chanted \"Grow grow grow~\" over and over. Ruth felt the black fabric pinching all over her hips and butt. Her butthole felt sore from the tension of the material digging into it. Edna kept chanting and saw a blissful look on Ruth's face as her black panties tore down the sides and she was no longer being tormented by shrinking clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth continued to fill out and She could see Edna seem to get smaller as she grew closer to her size. Edna was inches from Ruth's face as she continued to grow. Ruth finally stopped and saw they were both the same height. Edna pounced on Ruth and hugged her tightly. Ruth could feel a radiating tingle down her back. Ruth's heart felt ticklish, she blushed and could feel how deeply her friend loved her. \"Geez Edna its good to see you too.\" Ruth muttered in resistance but did nothing to move out of Edna's embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna decided to hide the size ray in the woods near the school. At its current size no one but Edna or Ruth would be able to operate it and they felt it should be safe. Edna then put her hands together at the finger tips and said \"Just a few more moments.\" Ruth looked curiously at Edna. \"A few more moments till what?\" Ruth questioned. \"By now she is ether hiding or trying to run and if she is able to see us she is wondering why we are just standing here. Edna said into Ruth's ear \"She has had plenty of time to stew in terror. I want to savor this. You have no idea how gross she made me feel and before I am done with her she will be praying to any god or devil that might pity her.\" Edna's eyes were narrowed with rage and Ruth smiled and simply said \"Fuck yeah.\" in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather running towards the back parking lot where her car was kept. She could see the staggering shapes of Ruth and Edna several hundred feet from her. She was behind them and running as quickly as her 6'3 athletic body could go. She knew her life was soon to be over if Edna found her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna leaned in to whisper to Ruth, \"If she isn't hiding somewhere she is likely running to her car. All we have to do is wait and as soon as we see her driving we have her.\" Almost as if on queue Heather's car caught their attention as Heather slammed on the accelerator. She felt a deep dread as she felt the whole car lift into the air. Heather's car was lifted up to Edna's face and all Heather could see in her windshield was Edna's giant mouth. Heather began to cry as she could see how deviously Edna smile looked. Heather could feel the warm minty air from Edna's mouth. She was aware that Edna hadn't moved her anywhere and wondered why. Heather's back quivered as Edna began to move her mouth. \"In case you were wondering why I'm holding you so close to my mouth. I just wanted you to see how happy I am right now Heather.\" Edna's smug voice exploded in Heather's ear from her proximity to the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather's eyes were moist from sobbing and she yelled out, \"Fuck you Edna, I'm glad you're happy you giant cunt!\" Heather's tone of voice sounded hopeless. Edna's face furrowed into a frown. \"Real mature tiny-twat.\" Edna said coldly. Ruth was standing near Edna watching her talk to Heather. Her head spun in a bubbly high and she still was having trouble with her new perspective. Everything was miniature and Ruth couldn't believe the buildings at her feet weren't models. Ruth's fingers ran across her naked bottom and she felt a ticklish tingle from her hips. She wanted to sit down but was aware of the damage she would cause. Ruth considered whether it mattered given her new shape. It wasn't like anyone could do anything to control her so why would it matter if she destroyed whatever she felt like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth felt a sudden drop as she put all her weight into her butt and let herself fall. Edna looked over to see Ruth's huge rump flatten a building. A ball of fire sprung up from Ruth's legs and she felt a blast of heat that was much more arousing than painful, Ruth noted how her body seemed to welcome the heat and it did no damage to her skin as it lapped against her inner thigh. She looked up at Edna who was staring blankly at Ruth. Edna saw the flames flying up from the damaged area around Ruth's legs and realized she wasn't being hurt by direct exposure to fire. \"Are you comfortable?\" Edna asked her voice sounded miffed. \"I am now!\" Ruth said cheerfully and crossed her legs Indian-style. Edna rolled her eyes then tried to focus on Heather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather jumped as she heard the explosion Ruth caused. She felt trapped in her car and knew outside was a fatal drop. Her fear was being countered by a wave of anger and Heather was determined to not give Edna the satisfaction she sought. She didn't know what she could do but her anger was the only thing keeping her from being paralyzed with fear. Heather considered her options and decided to...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Patience, Heather thought. Edna may be in control right now, but she was definitely not used to this kind of situation. She would feel invincible and sooner or later, she would make a mistake. Heather eyed the size gun in the geek's hand. It was several times bigger than she was. So even if she got her hands on it, she would not be able to use it. Maybe if she mobilized some friends when Edna was not watching it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought was interrupted by the screeching sound of metal. The roof of the car was bending. To her horror, she had to watch helplessly as the roof got closer and closer. Outside, Edna's massive hand hovered above, her tree-trunk sized finger resting on the vehicle. Heather screamed. She was about to be crushed inside her car. It could not end like this. But as sudden as the screeching had started, it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. Did I scare you?\" Edna asked in a sweet, innocent tone. Heather's fearful face was pure pleasure to her, but even more excitingly was the realization of her own power. The roof of the car had given in, even though Edna had just softly touched it. To her, it seemed as if the car was made out of paper. \"What happened?\", Ruth asked from below. Edna looked down. It suddenly hit her just how big Ruth's breasts actually were. For a moment, she could not keep her eyes from them. She felt a tingle between her legs and her mouth went wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth, who realized where Edna's eyes rested, touched and lifted her left breasts slightly. Edna's eyes widened, then she looked away and reddened. Ruth giggled and eventually, Edna responded with a shy smile. But then she remembered what was resting in her hand. She sat down next to her best friend and held the car up to their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Heather was even more terrified. Two massive pairs of eyes looked down on her. The two girl's faces were so close their cheeks touched each other. They filled Heather's entire field of view. The former queen of the school wanted nothing more than to get away from here. But Edna and her friend were just too big. If only Heather was on the ground, she could use the car to at least gain some distance between her and them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we do with her?\" Edna wondered out loud. Finally, she had her enemy literally in the palm of her hand. While she was thinking, Ruth's face suddenly brightened and she moved close to Edna's ear and whispered something. Edna smiled mischievously at her friend's idea. Then, their eyes once more turned on Heather. The blonde gulped. She could feel the pressure from those gazes almost physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the unexpected happened. Edna lifted Heather's car from her hand and placed it back onto the road. \"We don't want to be unfair, little wimp.\" Edna's voice thundered from above. \"We will give you a little advantage. Heather looked in disbelieve at the two girls towering over her. Now that she was on the ground, she realized just how big they were. Heather had to gather all her willpower to stop shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then it hit her. This was her chance. Edna had made a mistake. She thought that she could play with Heather forever. But now, Heather had a chance to escape. The buildings in the city would make it harder for Edna to follow and when she was out in the open, she would show that geek that even at her massive size, she could not catch her. Heather's car way not just expensive and stylish, it could race at over 120 miles per hour. She would escape and eventually, some authorities would take notice of the two giant girls and take care of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further thinking, she hit the gas and drove off. Edna looked after her, then turned her attention to Ruth. \"Now, should we just chase after her, or spice this race up by using this.\" With those words, she held the size gun up into the air.</span></div></div>",

There were other people who had noticed the two giant girls. They hesitated, some panicked. But Heather just rushed through, expecting everyone in her path to jump away. These people had no right to stand in her way. She was the queen. Everyone should admire her and fulfill all of her wishes. But Edna..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cursed. There was no way she could deny it. She was scared, scared of Edna. The geek had always been so small and pathetic. But now, she was in control. Heather shivered when thinking about it. She was powerless, at the mercy of that stupid geek. It was so unfair. She was richer, more beautiful, more popular. She should be the one towering over all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she realized something. Sooner or later, someone would take care of the situation. Edna's powertrip would end and then, Heather would be back in control. The police or the military would show up, take the size gun and shrink that stupid geek to the size of the ant she was. But now, Heather could do nothing more but outrun her until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to work, however. Edna and Ruth were too big to follow her. The city buildings were in the way. They fell behind. Heather cheered. The city border was near. Then, she could speed away over the highway and watch from afar when Edna's decision to grow herself would bring her into trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she checked the rear mirror to see if she had shaken off her pursuers. Yes, they were falling behind. But wait, Edna was a head taller than the skyscraper next to her. Had she been that big before? Nevermind, Heather told herself, must just be imagination. The situation was putting a lot of stress on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she reached the city border. Entering the highway, she looked back one last time... and almost lost control of the vehicle. Edna was there, visible from all over town. The biggest building only reached to her hips. Heather's heart jumped when she realized the geek's eyes were fixated on her car. Edna smiled a smile that showed Heather she knew that Heather knew that she could reach her anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Ruthie's head appeared behind her. She gently hugged her from behind. The two started kissing like lovers, ignoring Heather. She cursed again. What were they thinking, stealing all the attention that was rightfully Heather's?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden explosion interrupted the romantic scene. Jets appeared. Heather spotted tanks rolling towards the city as well. She cheered. Now, Edna would get what she deserved. Then, Heather's family would buy the size changing technology the geek created and Heather would be a giantess herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Edna was heavily annoyed by the attacks. Her skin was now so thick, it could withstand the attacks, but they still hurt. Should she deal with these pests? She looked in Heather's direction, who's car was moving closer to the horizon. Or should she finish this?</span></div></div>",

She took the size ray from her friend and modified the settings. Suddenly, another explosion hit her, right in the back of her head. Furious, she turned around, looking for the attacker. The jets which had passed them made a turn in the distance. The streets were filled with tanks and someone screamed something in a megaphone about surrendering. Edna shot him a glare that made him fall silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was getting more than annoying. This was her moment of vengeance against Heather, her life-long tormentor. She would not let anyone disturb it. Her eyes fell back on the dial on top of the size ray. Time to show the world what she had accomplished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move to a save distance, Ruth.\", Edna warned her friend. \"And enjoy the show.\" She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth was confused. \"What do you mean? Aren't we as big as this gun can make us? How much more can it do? I mean...\" She gestured to the ground. The asphalt was cracking under their weight. Just by growing, she had crushed several cars under her naked feet without even noticing it. People looked like insects. If she wanted to, she could simply turn around and smash the tanks which were threatening them. \"...we are giants, no, goddesses to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna smiled even more. Her anger was washed away by anticipation, her body felt hot. She gently grabbed the dial on the size gun and turned it further. \"Not even close.\", she whispered. Then, she pointed at herself and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather raced over the highway. In the rear mirror, she spotted Edna struggling with the military. Soon, it would be over. Edna pointed the gun at herself. She was porbably giving up, shrinking herself back to the wimp she was. The gun started glowing. Light flickered. Something was different, however, as if alot of stress was put on the gun. Then, the light became too bright. Heather averted her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked back, Edna was gone. Only Ruthie was left. Fine, Heather thought, now the other one had to shrink as well. But then Heather noticed something odd. Ruthie was gazing up, her mouth wide open. Heather followed her eyes... and screamed in terror. Edna had not been visible, because she was simply too big. Her feet were placed left and right of the city. Higher and higher, her pale legs rose into the sky. Clouds gathered around her ankles. Her size was ... unbelievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere several miles above, Edna placed a hand on her hip. She bit her lower lip, almost unable to conceal her excitement. She curled her toes, burying them hundreds of feet into the ground, creating hills and valleys. Their smell washed over the surrounding towns and villages. The jet pilots who had flown over her head now found themselves over the soft surface of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is very ... fitting.\" Edna finally spoke. Her booming voice was like thunder. Her eyes searched the flat landscape and then rested at a certain point. \"You know, this gun does not only alter my size, it also improves my senses.\" Her smile grew wider. \"I see you, Heather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather's heart dropped upon hearing that. She watched helplessly as Edna lowered herself. When her knees hit the ground, earthquakes shook the land. It was as if Edna's anger had taken form as a force of nature. No, Edna had become a force of nature. The world was her playing field and Heather was her toy. No, less than a toy. A bug, a grain of sand, maybe even less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde watched in horror as Edna's hands were coming down on the horizon to the left and to the right, leaveling entire mountain ranges. Just by kneeling down and lowering herself to the surface, she changed the shape of the earth. If she ever meant serious harm... With a punch of her fist, she could probably crash through the continantal plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gush of hot wind interupted Heather's train of thought. For some reason, she still drove over the highway, even though it was futile. Edna's massive, freckled face now covered the entire sky. In the distance, she saw her nose impacting with the ground, creating massive cracks. Her breath was like a storm which almost sent her car flying through the air. The temperatures rose higher just because of Edna's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, Edna's ginger hair hang to the ground, curling around hills and buildings, filling the land with its sweet scent. Her massive, red lips were now right over Heather. They parted, revealing a dark abyss. Her pink, wet tongue extended out of it. Drops of saliva hit the surrounding area like meteors. Her breath washed over the land. Heather was sweating. It was too hot. In the rear mirror, she saw Edna's tongue, a wall of pink flesh, spanning hundreds of feet to the left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the impact came. Heather's car was instantly covered in sticky saliva. She was lifted into the air when Edna raised her head. One more time, she saw the sunlight. Next, she was sent down into the dark abyss that was Edna's throat. Now, there was only darkness, hot and steamy darkness. Edna was all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna smiled, satisfied. Vengeance tasted great. With her improved senses, she had felt the miniscule car on her tongue. Now, Heather was in her rightful place. And so was Edna. Now, the world was hers.</span></div></div>",

She heard the familiar laugh of her nemesis, Heather, except that it was now deafening.  She turned around, and saw the gigantic form of a woman's torso, clad in a blue tank top.  She looked up to see Heather Mills' face looming high above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Edna!\"  Heather said.  Edna yelped, and fell backwards.  This made Heather laugh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna looked around and realized where she was:  a coffee table.  A coffee table in an impossibly large, incredibly posh living room. The living room of Heather's mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh-Heather!\"  Edna managed to vocalize.  She was absolutely terrified.

She tried to stand up.  \"Heather, I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Heather laugh again.  \"Sorry?  Sorry for what, little Edna?\"  Heather pushed her feet out, bulldozing Edna with her mighty heel.  Edna yelped as she fell over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gave me an amazing gift, Edna.  An even littler you!  All tiny and helpless on my coffee table.\"  She giggled and writhed her feet together in front of Edna.  \"And with my parents out of town for the next month, I have you allllllll to myself!\"   Edna whimpered as she struggled to stand up again.  Beyond Heather's playful soles, which were more than twice her size, she saw Heather reach over towards the far side of the couch and grab something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the size ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, I was wondering, little Edna...\"  Heather uncrossed her feet and recrossed them right over left.  \"Were you planning to use this thing to make me as small as you are now?\"  She glared down at Edna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I...  Heather...\"  was all that Edna could stammer out before Heather uncrossed her legs and slammed her heel down in front of Edna again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANSWER ME, TWERP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\"  Edna screamed.  \"Heather, I'm so sorry!  I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, you're not!\"  Heather twisted the size ray around, examining it curiously.  \"Y'know, I've been studying this thing.  I can change how much it shrinks something with this dial right here, yes?\"  Heather pointed at a dial on the side of the gun.  Edna was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather raised and slammed her feet down again.  \"YES?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm.\"  Heather nodded as she continued looking the device over.  \"And this little swith here.  There's an 'S' and a 'G.'  It's on 'S' right now, so I'm guessing that means 'Shrink.'  Correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna was hyperventilating.  Her inability to answer right away annoyed Heather, who dabbed her enormous big toe into Edna's face.  Edna was pushed down onto her back.  Her vision was filled by the metallic blue polish on Heather's incredible toe, and her nostrils were filled with the overwhelming aroma of coconut and sweat.  \"Correct, Edna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna gasped.  \"Y-yes.\"  She struggled against Heather, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather smirked and moved her foot off of heather, crossing it over the other again, looming it over Edna again.  \"That's what I thought.  So then, if the 'S' is for 'Shrink,' that must mean the 'G' is for...\"  Heather smiled devilishly down at Edna.  \"Does 'G' stand for 'Grow,' Edna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna's blood ran cold.  Never in her worst nightmares did she predict a worse situation than this.  Heather Mills, who was always a giant to her, was now insanely big, and holding all the cards.  There was nothing she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, Heather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.  Well then... that leaves just one question:  Bigger, or smaller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna whimpered as Heather adjusted the dial on the size ray and pointed it at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna's world changed as Heather quickly moved her feet off the coffee table and leaned in. She aimed the size ray directly over Edna's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or smaller?\"</span></div></div>",

Through the flash of the beam, Edna could see Heather expand.  Her whole body stretched out in every direction.  Heather's head rose higher and higher as her legs and feet stretched out past the table she was standing on.  Edna could only look up, jaw agape, as Heather's shadow consumed more and more of her surroundings.  When her growth was done, Heather was twice her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather moved her arms and wiggled her feet, coming to terms with her new size.  When she was done marveling at her own physique, she returned her gaze to Edna, who was still standing on the coffee table, mouth agape.  A grin crept across Heather's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing, Edna!\"  Heather said, laughing.  Edna cowered as Heather leaned in.  Heather laughed again as Edna fell backwards onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather giggled and leaned in further, chopping her teeth just over Edna's head.  Edna screamed in terror, making Heather cackle as she leaned back in the now diminished couch that she sat in.  It groaned under her weight before collapsing under her 12' 6\" frame.  \"Whoops!\"  Heather yelled before continuing her laughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Edna, this was a fever dream.  Heather was scary when everything was normal-sized.  When shrunk to six inches tall, Heather seemed like a nightmarish monster.  Now  she was twice her original size and laughing like a maniac.  Edna couldn't take it.  This was supposed to be the other way around!  She was supposed to be the one lording over Heather, making her feel small for once in her life!  Instead, she was stuck on Heather's huge coffee table, gaping at an impossibly large Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I tell you a secret, Edna?\"  Heather asked in a child-like tone.  \"I've never told anyone this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna got back to her feet, but could not bring herself to say anything.  It didn't seem like Heather was interested in her input anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather, sitting on the wreckage of her couch, leaned back until she was lying flat on the floor.  \"I've always loved being bigger than other people, Edna.  Girls, boys, I've always liked being the tall one.  The biggest one.  I mean, when you're as beautiful as me, you want to be as big as you can be, so you can show it off.\"  Heather propped herself up on her elbows, glaring at Edna again.  She raised her right leg up and hovered it over the table.  Edna screamed and ran out of the way as Heather brought her mighty heel down just in front of Edna.  If her original shoe size was 14, was it 28 now?  Edna tried to do the math until concluding that It was just. fucking huge.  Edna looked way up at the toes and sole wiggling playfully above her before her entire world collapsed around her when Heather's monolithic left foot came crashing down beside her right.  The coffee table didn't stand a chance.  Edna screamed as the table folded and fell.  She curled up as Heather's booming laughter echoed around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDNAAAAAAA!\"  Heather taunted as she prodded Edna with her big toe.  \"I love being big, Ednaaaaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna could do nothing against Heather's big toe, which was the size of a Buick now.  She cowered and broke down crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather looked over at the size ray.  To her, it seemed to be the same size that it was before.  \"Did the gun grow with me?\"  She inquired.  She picked it up and looked it over.  She laughed and looked down her legs at Edna, who was cowering at her feet.  \"The gun grew with me, Edna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna designed the gun to change size along with herself, so long as she was holding it.  A shame that she lost her grip when she originally shrank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've made all my dreams come true.  Do you know that Edna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna only whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather adjusted the dials on the size ray.  \"I always fantasized about being big, Edna.  I mean, I was always a big girl, but I mean REALLY big!  I don't know... should I do it?  Should I make myself huge?  A goddess?\"  She aimed the gun playfully at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna was broken.  She sat on the remains of the coffee table, looking past Heather's enormous soles, at her menacing face in the distance, terrified at the idea of Heather making herself even bigger.  Then Heather turned the gun, aiming it don at Edna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or do I keep this between you and me, Edna?\"  She smirked.  \"Just make myself a goddess to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm...\"</span></div></div>",

Edna collapsed and sobbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always liked having my feet rubbed,Edna.\"  Heather continued rubbing her heel back and forth on the table beside Edna, flexing her sole and waving her foot back and forth over the tiny girl.  \"Rubbed and tickled, kissed and licked.\"  She raised her right leg and dropped her other heel on the other side of Edna, writhing it seductively.  \"It's my biggest turn-on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna looked up at the towering skyscrapers that were Heather's feet.  At six inches tall, and Heather at over twelve feet tall, Edna wasn't even half as tall as Heather's immaculate heels.  The titanic soles towered over her like skyscrapers.  She looked up the flawless soles to the perfectly pedicured toes that wiggled playfully high above.  She fell back on her butt again.  She was too terrified to be angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edna.\"  Heather said, snapping Edna back into reality with a cold chill.  \"I want you to kiss my foot.\"  Heather moved her foot in front of Heather.  It was a simple adjustment to Heather, but to Edna, it was like a building moving in front of her with scary speed.  \"Right on my heel, Edna.  And I want to feel it.\"  Heather giggled.  \"So maybe give it a few licks while you're down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna could only stare up at the monolithic foot in front of her, so Heather decided to give her some motivation by raising her leg and slamming her heel down in front of Edna again, sending Edna flailing to the hard wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said kiss my fucking foot, geek!\"  Heather shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna had no choice.  She approached Heather's towering foot, and placed her hands on the soft flesh of her heel.  She leaned in and pursed her quivering lips, planting a kiss on Heather's heel.  Then another.  Then another.  Edna was intoxicated with the smell of Heather's coconut lotion and natural foot odor.  There was no way out of this.  In desperation, she started licking profusely, crying as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs miniscule as Edna was, Heather could feel it.  Little tiny tickles on her heel shot through her like nothing else before.  She always got off on being bigger than others, and having her feet pampered.  She mind was going wild as she giggled and then moaned.  She felt more powerful than ever, but somehow, she still wanted more.  Much more.  She had all of her wildest fantasies at her feet and at her fingertips, and she planned to take advantage of that.  As Edna continued her worship, Edna grabbed the size ray and leaned back.  She dangled the gun over her own head, laughing in ecstasy just at the thought of what she was about to do.  She already set the size ray to what she wanted.  It was just a matter of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ednaaaaaaa!\"  Heather said playfully.  \"Better grab on to my foot.  It's going to be one hell of a ride!\"  Heather giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna heard the now familiar sound of her size ray being fired.  She instinctively leaped and hugged the soft flesh of Heather's foot as a bright flash surrounded her.  Heather held on for dear life, but the flesh she was holding pushed out as it started to expand and push towards her.  Heather fell on the hard surface of the collapsed coffee table, but scrambled to her feet and ran away from Heather's expanding foot.  She could hear Heather's blissful laughter as she screamed and ran from the approaching juggernaut.  Heather's growth was too much though, and her growing heel caught up with tiny Edna, bnow bulldozing her off of the remains of the table and towards the far wall.  Bigger and bigger Heather grew, with tiny Edna stuck to her heel, screaming as the endless wall drew nearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big would Heather get?</span></div></div>",

Heather's clothes where growing with her. But more slowly. Edna quickly pulled out her notepad and scribbled it down. She then looked forward.

Completely exhausted and terrified. Edna stopped and turned around and looked back just as Heather's head bounced against the ceiling.<br>\r\nHeather stopped pleasuring herself and dropped the gun. She began flailing her arms about merceliously. Destroy almost everything in what was one a beautiful mansion. <br>\r\nHeather slowly pressed herself through the second story. Her head reached the top of the roof. She arched her back and destroy more of the house.<br>\r\nEdna looked up and up and up she was directly between Heather's feet. She couldn't help but admire her worst enemies beautiful legs. They just seemed to go on forever.  Heather,  back still arched looked down at the tiny Edna. She had stopped growing. Without saying a word Heather pressed her back against the roof and burst through it. She eyeballed the neighborhood and smiled. \"FINALLY .\" she muttered to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna could do nothing but look up at her now even more giant enemy. At a mere 6 inches her impossibly huge nemesis had gotten even bigger and was enjoying every second of it. She watched as Heather ran her hand over her immense breasts and down her toned stomach again to her crotch. Her Jean's had gotten so tight Edna could see the outline of every thing. Edna shuttered and began backpedaling from between Heather's feet. <br>\r\nHeather arched her back and moaned.  And looked down between her feet.<br>\r\n\"HOW'S THE VIEW FROM DOWN THERE GEEK!\" Heather's booming voice echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... I...\" Edna struggled to speak. She was absolutely terrified. She fell to her knees and began crying. <br>\r\n\"Aww look at the tiny geek bug crying. \"  Heather then raised her left foot and slammed it down next Edna causing her to go tumbling simply from the force of it hitting the ground.  <br>\r\nEdna winced in pain as she lay on her back with her eyes clinched shut. Afraid to open them. Hoping this was only a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather was grinning ear to ear. Already obsessed with power and control over people, this was like a dream come true.<br>\r\n\"I SAID HOW'S THE VIEW FROM DOWN THERE YOU FUCKING GERM.\" Heather shouted. Edna could feel the vibrations of just her voice run through her entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna slowly opened her eye and again looked up and up and up. She wanted to throw up. Long toned legs covered in Jean's so tight they looked like they were about to RIP off. Again Edna could see the outline of Heather's vagina through her Jean's. Behind that the underside of Heather's perfect ass. Up a bit higher was Heather's now somewhat exposed flat toned stomach.  Then her massive breasts blocking most of her face. All Edna could see past them was Heather's blue eyes glaring down at her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fucking hate you!\" Edna shouted up at the 30 foot tall Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather began laughing and laughing.  \"LIKEWISE.\"  she then pressed her foot down directly in front of Edna. Her toes were like skyscapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna then realized something.  Heather dropped the gun during her growth. She didn't want to cue Heather to it .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather then lifted her foot up a bit. \"See if you can walk between my toes.\" Heather said. <br>\r\nEdna shuttered then paused. \"Well if I'm between her toes she cant see me looking for the gun.\" She thought to herself. <br>\r\nEdna gulped and walked forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Heather's malicious grin didn't falter once as her hand wrapped tightly around Edna's body. The smaller girl wanted to call out, beg her oppressor to stop, but that was a no go as Heather's iron grip made getting the words out impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're ready, Edna. It's time to please your one and only goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna found herself momentarily jiggled around as Heather quickly kicked her jeans off. She then used her free hand to slide off the smooth fabric that was her panties. Once Edna regained her bearings she saw the sight before her and instantly put two and two together. Her tiny form plus massive vagina equaled disaster. Heather smirked as she slowly moved Edna down toward her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny was scared shitless. Her pussy could devour her whole. This wasn't how things were supposed to be! This was supposed to be her moment! Not Heather's! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around Edna suddenly went dark as she was plunged head first into Heather's waiting vagina. Heather moaned in pleasure at the feeling of her long time victim's small insertion. She didn't even wait another second longer as she pushed Edna further until she completely disappeared into her. Heather threw her head back in pure ecstasy at the feeling of her prey's desperate struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small part of her couldn't believe that this was actually happening, but it was. She'd really done it. Edna was really in there. She'd shove that nerd who'd tried and failed to get even with her completely up her pussy... And it felt great. Who would've thought that poor 'little' Edna could make her feel so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside of Heather's vagina, Edna fought for survival. She was pinned down by Heather's powerful internal muscles and damn near drowning in her tormentor's juices. Add to that was the smell. There was just not enough steel wool in the world that would ever make her feel clean again. She needed to escape! If she didn't then this fleshy prison would become her tomb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna struggled as best she could. Kicking, punching, and biting had the opposite effect. Rather than hurting Heather, she was sending her over the moon. On the outside Heather's breath hitched as she gripped her bedsheets as hard as she could. Whatever that damn nerd was doing she better not stop. If this was what Edna felt like then she might just keep her in there. She'd use her morning, noon, and night. Every second of every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather's moans began to increase and she could feel the pressure building below. \"Any second now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Edna felt the air forced out of her lungs as Heather's vagina clamped down all around her. Then she heard it, the sound of rushing liquid coming strait at her. It didn't take a genus to figure out what was happening. Edna closed her eyes and prayed that today wouldn't be her last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather's back arched as her climax came, spilling both her womanly juices and a now soaking wet Edna out all over her bed. Heather tried desperately to regain her breath while Edna was trying to do the same. Unfortunately for her, Heather recovered first and stared down the defenseless nerd that had brought her such pleasure. She was now looking at Edna in a brand new light. She wasn't good for much, but she made the perfect sex toy,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was... What to do now?</span></div></div>",

She couldn't have been more than one inch tall, which also meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what just happened?\" Edna's voice chilled as she heard Heather's voice, now booming and godlike like Ruth's, coming from behind her.

Heather was much taller than even Ruth, and while Edna was used to looking up at both of them, Heather's athletic 6'3\" form made Edna feel much, much smaller than she already did. Heather wore clothes that showed off her statuesque body, and Edna found herself looking at the ground and blushing, only to find herself staring at Heather's massive, pedicured feet, displayed in all their glory in a pair of strappy sandals. Edna's brow darkened and she shook a little. It should be <i>Heather </i>shaking in fear at <i>her </i>feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather was also looking ahead like Ruth. Neither of them had any idea what the gun did.

She had to hitch a ride on her friend's shoe. And maybe even had to climb Ruthie to get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna dashes towards Ruthie's right Converse before she walks away to class. Right as she gets to the shoe, Ruthie steps forward. Luckily, Ruthie's shoelaces had come slightly untied, giving Edna a nice long rope to grab onto. Edna grabs onto to the worn white shoelace of her friend's red Converse. Ruthie's had this pair for maybe 3 months now, and loves to wear them with her skinny jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie starts to head to her first class, hoping she's not too late. She should probably find Edna, but academia comes first. Besides, Edna was probably just up to some hijinks to scare Heather. She knows her friend will show up eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Edna is holding on for dear life at the feet of her oblivious friend. The loose shoelace flies up onto the the tongue of the Chuck Taylor, giving her more of a handle to hang onto. She grips hard onto the red fabric and crossed laces as Ruthie takes another step. She hopes the trek to class isn't too far away. She doesn't know how much longer she can hold on.</span></div></div>",

Then she looked up in sudden horror that one of the giants around her may have heard her. Of course, they didn't. Both Heather and Ruth, godlike in height, their faraway faces looking at one another instead, weren't expecting Edna to be the size of a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am <i>not </i>a bug,\" Edna said through gritted teeth, dispelling the thought. Then, with a frustrated cry, she started running off to the side, toward the lip under the lockers. She'd be out of sight there and that would give her time to think, but she suddenly found herself surrounding by giant, stomping feet. Edna screamed as she ran, remembering that the bell had just rung, but she had no choice. She was the size of a bug in front of Heather <i>damn </i>Miles, the worst bitch she knew, and Edna was helpless against her now more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna kept running, screaming, and mentally berating herself when suddenly a wall slammed down in front of her and Edna ran straight into the side of someone's sneaker. Then all at once it was gone, the foot soaring away, and the looming back of the giant steadily moving away. It made Edna dizzy to watch the giant move, probably a football player by his letter jacket, but she shook her head and kept running lest another foot fall from the sky. She very nearly ran right into the side of some girl's foot, the creamy side of her heel settling into the insole of her flip-flop right in front of Edna, showing her how much force she could have been under if she had been only a step or two further on, and then, like the sneaker, the giant foot lifted and was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna was crying by the time she reached the underside of the locks, the lip hanging over her and casting her in shadow. She put her back to the rough, fuzzy wall made of the same stuff the carpet was, and put her back to it and sat down. She held her head in her hands and cried while feet stomped around before her, sometimes dangerously close as someone checked a locker by her. Edna saw the gun out in the hall. Ruth's shoes weren't there anymore, but Heather's feet, which Edna had been standing before moments ago, still were. Then a hand lifted the gun out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, Edna thought, she'd made the most amazing invention the world had ever seen and then gave it to the person she hated the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the hallway emptied and the rumbling of the giant students walking around stopped. Edna caught her breath, peeking down the hallway in both directions. Okay, she thought, where to next?</span></div></div>",

She knew more than ever just how dire her situation was, she was shrunken to a mere inch tall, stranded in the hallway of her school with no one in sight. The lack of students being the only good news in her mind, however the view of that gun disappearing into Heather's hands no doubt was just a cruel reminder as to how badly this could all turn in a moment. Especially should Heather actually figure out how to operate the device, the entire world could be doomed to Heather Miles as opposed to just herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question in Edna's mind was who could she turn to, who could she try and get to and help her. An obvious choice would be Ruthie, although Ruthie lacked just as much in the mental department as she did the physical. Not that Ruthie was at all braindead, but she couldn't hold a candle to Edna's brilliance to make up for her own petite stature, sure bigger than Edna at normal size, but still not big enough to take on Heather. A light bulb would seem to go off in Edna's mind as she would roll that thought around in her mind, and a name would soon materialize from her lips. \"Mizuki...\" Her intellectual rival, sure they may have argued alot over which one was more intelligent but the both of them shared that hatred for Heather. Of course, Mizuki was also a smaller framed girl, as petite as her at normal size, but she could at least compete with Edna's brain and perhaps come up with a solution to this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer only concern was of course, if Mizuki could fully be trusted, the arrogant exchange student who often held herself above all others. Was it possible that if she got her hands on the device that the world could be as equally doomed? She didn't have much time to think about it in either case, being a helpless bug on the floor tended to put things in a state of urgency, especially in such a setting where if one were to take too long and the bell rang with an inch tall student stranded in the middle of the hall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she would have to do is figure out where Mizuki was, and judging by the time, from what she could remember, her first class actually was with the Japanese girl, Calculus just down the hallway. Very cautiously, Edna would peak her head out and take another look around the hallway before commiting to actually and fully exposing herself to the world, where her mission had already been set into place, locate Mizuki.</span></div></div>",

Sticking close to the side of the hallway as she feared the common straggler either making their way to their class late, or even those coming from to go to the office or other various means. Nothing would seem to stop her along her way to room 302. From here she would simply slip herself under the door, her body being small enough to fit under the crack and enter the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile amongst the world of the normal sized people, Mizuki herself was having a bad day already. Every day seemed terrible though for the exchange student, having to wake up each morning only to come and listen to lectures from teachers. The \"education givers\" of the states whom said nothing she already didn't know. It really was a bore and it simply left the girl siting at her desk, face buried inside her text book which was haphazardly lying open across the top of her desk. Her arms hanging quite lazily over the sides, giving the clear idea that she was bored to death. It wasn't lost on the teacher whom was at the chalk board going over a few problems from her lesson. She a younger teacher, late twenties, still new to the school and trying to gain ground with the students who would try and take advantage of her lack of experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafe to say, she didn't show much tolerance for such things. \"Ms. Ishihara! Can I trouble you to please pay attention in class?\" She could begin in a stern voice which made many students sit on the edge of their seats and straighten up on the spot. Unfortunately, Mizuki was not one of them, she not even nothing to lift her face from her book as she spoke. \"I don't know, you going to actually say anything interesting?\" Her words muffled by the book. This would earn a few stifled chuckles from around the class, but a glare shot their way by the young teacher would silence them rather quickly. \"Then why don't you come up here and solve the problem we were about to go over, hmm?\" She would challenge the younger girl, sure of herself this would put Mizuki, a constant thorn in her side in her place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she would be sadly mistaken as all this would do would get Mizuki to lift her head. Hair a disheveled mess from how long she had her head down on her desk, eyes narrowing slightly as she looked at the chalkboard. \"Don't have too, the answer is six. Now go back to trying to teach the ones who <b>aren't</b> already smarter than you.\" With that, Mizuki's face would be back in her book as she would look to nap and this would leave the teacher in a sudden look of shock. She wanted to question how she had figured that out, this was an advanced equation, something she herself would have to have a piece of paper handy for, and yet, this girl had done it in her head seemingly effortlessly. Her cheeks would glow a bright red before she turned back to what she was doing, not daring to say anything else further to that arrogant student, and instead focus on teaching a class of snickering students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Edna, during all of this, she had made it to Mizuki's desk, leaving the small girl to simply look up at her would be friend and savior. This girl who was only just slightly taller than her normally now towered over her like a behemoth now. He legs pulled back, those old worn out chucks resting toes first on the floor just slightly behind her seat. This left Edna in a curious position, to figure out what was the best way to contact Mizuki now that she was literally underneath her</span></div></div>",

She barely even having time to try and stop herself before her body would simply run into the side of it. She feeling the somewhat squishy feel of the wall give to her for a split second before she was rocketed back to the ground. As she would pick herself up, sitting up and rubbing the back of her head which had hit the ground. Edna would be left to very groggily stare up at what had just blocked her path, a sight which almost immediately made her lip quiver in fear. It was a shoe, an old beat up skater style shoe with an obviously faded, yet still there decal on the side of two simple letters \"DC\". Looking up higher, she could see the black skinny jeans, the black tanktop which was concealed under a lack leather jacket, the black messily kept hair. \"T-...TRISH!\" Edna would squeak allowed and near instantly cover her mouth as she let out far louder a noise than she had wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough fortunately with her small body, the noise didn't seem to reach Trish's ears, but this barely put Edna at ease as she found herself in this predicament. Trish after all was a delinquent punk, and far more scary than Heather even though she did tend to leave Edna alone in most cases. This didn't make Edna any less scared of the scrapper of a girl who got into more fights than anyone she knew and always came out on top. No matter against any of the girls or even the jocks who played football, she seemed near unstoppable in physical conflict. Though, that could be an asset to Edna in her current situation, after all, Trish could easily take care of Heather, granted she wasn't shrunk on the spot. Should Trish find her though, and Edna warned her to a degree, she would at least be prepared and less likely to be shrunk down. Though, she knew she couldn't trust Trish, there was no way to trust her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear to Edna that this girl had shown up late.....again. Having made her way to her locker in quite a rush, and it was easy to see from the look on her face, Trish was in a foul mood. So much so that when the hall monitor made her rounds amongst the school, she wouldn't even dare to try and question this punk. Though her presence hadn't went unnoticed to Trish who's green eye's soon found themselves locking onto the scared girl. <b>\"What the fuck are you looking at?!</b> Trish would scream loud enough, the booming sound rocking Edna as Trish's voice would simply reverberate off the hallways walls. Trish would be far from done however as she simply turned and took a single step toward the Hall Monitor, causing the scared girl to simply run in the other direction as Trish would simply spit in disgust at the cowardly display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course her actions hadn't left Edna alone, the step causing a tremor, and the small amount spit Trish had gathered in her mouth would cause a slight shadow to envelope Edna who found herself having to dive to the side to avoid getting caught in it. The Inch tall girl, whilst bigger than the glob which continued to bubble from the clear liquid which came from Trish. It was still rather intimidating to see something so insignificant from a normal human being that they often forget about it instantly, seeming to daunting now to her shrunken frame. It would quickly dawn on her, that she was in fact bigger than the wad of spit, and in being so, quite noticeable to the eye, and her sudden movement could very well have alerted her would be tormentor of her presence. Heart practically stopping in her chest, Edna would slowly turn her attention upward to see if she had been noticed...</span></div></div>",

It overshadowing the glob of spit and of course herself without even needing to be directly next to them. Though, this action would only further backfire as Trish would notice the movement out of her eye, turning her attention to her sneakers to notice something quite small scurrying from her. \"What the fuck, another bug infestation? Shit ass school system man.\" Trish would curse to herself as she moved and hovered her shoe over said \"bug\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Edna however it was a terrifying experience. She wouldn't even need to turn to look, she could just feel Trish's shoe leave the floor, the slight uptake of air. The sound it made as said air was pulled in from this massive object. A massive object which was only a lowly sneaker which held a foot of another human being. She could see the shadow enveloping her and it would only cause Edna to try and serpentine. Zig zagging back and forth doing her best to try and fake Trish out. Though this only further worked against her as it wasn't lost on the punk girl. Trish would notice the small bug appearing at each side of her shoe as she lazily hovered it over the bug, it only causing her interest to pique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her foot back on the ground, making sure to watch out for this tiny thing. Trish would crouch down, allowing the show of her entire body to just cast Edna in a hopeless darkness. One of which would only cause her to fall to the ground, Edna realizing just how pointless it was to run and for the simple shadow of Trish to mentally weight her body down. She could only flip over to her back and look back up at Trish's face, looking into those green orbs which only began to study her much smaller form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be after a moment that Edna could see the realization hit the Punk and a sinister smile to spread across Trish's face. She could only lift an arm up and scream to be left alone as she was eclipsed by the view of Trish's hand reaching for her. She soon to be feeling herself pinched between a index finger and thumb far bigger than any tree she ever knew. The soft flesh of the finger's pad surprisingly giving to her body. Had it not been for the rough way in which she was picked up, it may have even been a bit pleasant, which was not something she expected from the up and coming MMA fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, if it isn't geek girl, or is it geek bug now?\" Trish would taunt with a small chuckle escaping her. One which left Edna to shudder as it became very clear that it was a bad thing Trish had found her.  The violent deviant without even saying anything, already let out the mannerisms that allowed Edna, one of the smartest in the school on to knowing she was doomed, Trish wasn't going to actually help her even if she tried to lie and say she was. \"What the fuck even happened to you? Why are you so small?\" Trish would question, another chuckle escaping her as she shook her head at the girl in her hand. It was actually rather surreal for Edna to look back and see hat Trish just accepted this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe accepted that it was possible for Edna to be that tiny, something which was by all rights impossible. In fact she wanted to know how it was done, which left Edna in a bit of a dilemma. The two options were simple, lie to Trish or tell the truth. To lie to Trish would simply keep her off the track f the device and whatever it was that Heather was doing with it. Judging by the way that nothing seemed to be going on in the real world, Trish still being who she was as opposed to on edge or panicking if a giant Heather was roaming around the city, or if she was on a shrinking spree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was possible that Heather couldn't figure out the device, but how long would that last? On the other hand, she could fess up and tell the truth to Trish about how Heather held the power to change size in the form of the device. That would direct Trish to her and no doubt to beat her brains in and take it. It was something she wanted to see for a long time after all, and the promise of being practically a Goddess afterward would quash Trish's restraint when it came to that task. In Edna's mind, she would at least have good favor with Trish for basically giving her that power. Neither option looked good for Edna though, and honestly it came down to a \"lesser of two evils\" scenario in whom she would practically give the gun too.</span></div></div>",

Sure handing over a device to a violent sociopath like this punk was possibly one of the worst ideas she's ever had. There was also the fact that she would be just as blind as Heather with the device, or so she hoped. In that case, if Trish was able to recover it, she would at least have somewhat control over what the delinquent could do. In this theory she could feed Trish just enough info to keep her happy, but not enough to endanger her own life, it was after all self preservation time for Edna. There was the upside to of their common enemy, whom which if Trish was successful, Edna would get to see pummeled into the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's Heather Miles! She has my device which did this to me!\" Edna would find herself shouting into Trish's face, doing her best to get her voice to travel, but it only registered as a tiny squeak to the much bigger girl. \"Wow, you're really pathetic you little geek bug.\" Trish would counter much to the dismay of Edna who could feel her cheeks reddening over the poking she had just received at the hands of what very well could become far more than just a violent punk by the end of this. Still, the message certainly got to her as the smile on Trish's face widened, allowing Edna a view of those pearly whites. It was the grin of a predator whom saw her prey, or in this case, a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather fuckin' Miles huh? Good, I have a reason to beat that bitch into the ground.\" Trish would laugh, her grip on Edna tightening a bit in her joyous display. It would seem to be an accidental thing, that would be until Trish's green eyes settled upon Edna's body once more, they narrowing as her grip continued to tighten to a point of denying her of air. \"Though, what should I do with you hmm?\" She mused allowed, putting it in the air that it was time for Edna to either sink or swim, show her usefulness or perish. \"Y-you need me!\" Edna would cry out in a pained fashion, her voice cracking as she needed air. Fortunately it would pique Trish's interest enough for her to release Edna, allowing the geek girl to fall into her awaiting palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would take her a moment to catch her breath, and take a stand, though when she did she would be greeted by that intense glare of Trish. Wordlessly the massive punk was telling her to continue and explain. \"You're going to need me to know how to operate it. Think about it, why hasn't Heather made it more known she holds that much power in her hands. She doesn't know how to use it properly, however if you restore me back to my original size, it's yours and I'll show you how to use it.\" It was in motion as Edna would collapse in the bigger girl's palm. A much larger punk who was now chuckling ominously as the idea entered her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to be given power, far more than anyone else could perceive, and it was just payment for beating Heather stupid and taking that device from the dumb blonde who is too stupid to utilize it. The only downside was that Edna made it sound like she was required with the deal, that she needed her. It was enough to put Trish off slightly, but in the end she knew she wasn't bound by words. She was big and Edna was small, Heather was dumb and Trish was surprisingly smart. She would take a look at the device once she got it, and then she would decide if she would keep her word with Edna. \"Ya' know, you actually are pretty damn smart. Alright, ya' got a deal, but fuck me, and you're a stain, got it?\" This was Trish's only warning, a warning which even if Edna was good would end up with her being a stain underfoot if Trish found out she didn't actually need her.</span></div></div>",

So much so that she skipped her next class entirely and simply wandered the hallways blindly. Not a single hall monitor in this school would dare try and tell her to do back to class and she knew this. Part of this is why when she heard a voice calling out to her, she not paying much attention as to pick up on whom it belonged too, she couldn't help but look back annoyed. \"Hello Princess\" It was two words which had gotten Heather to look and two words she would come to regret acknowledging as a fist quickly met her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe punch held enough power to floor Heather regardless, but the way she was caught off guard sent her spiraling into the lockers nearby, the gun hitting the floor and sliding off away from her grasp. Feeling a trail of blood exiting from her bottom lip, Heather would look up with a flash of hate to the one whom had hit her, Trish. A girl knew Heather wasn't much of a fighter, at least when compared to her, but she held the size and strength to deal with the other worms of the school. Unfortunate for Heather, Trish was just too damn good to feel intimidated by size alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Heather, you've been the big bitch of the school for so long, making many enemies, and pushing certain people too far.\" Trish words would begin, only seeming to infuriate Heather more and more which each utterance. \"One of them took a stand and failed, but not to worry, I'm here to pick up the slack and take everything for myself, isn't that right geek bug.\" She would pat the breast pocket of her jacket, getting a small and audible squeak from Edna which would catch Heather's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she was shocked to see her there, but it quickly was replaced with anger as she realized what was going on. \"YOU!\" She would shout before she get to her feet and rushed Trish, or rather Edna whom was on Trish's body. It would just be bad luck that she would be caught by her throat, throttled by a single hand which then used impressive strength and turned, bringing her along for the ride and slamming her backfirst into the locked. Heather could feel a few of the padlocks being caught in between her and the lockers and she would let out a groan which only brought a smile to Trish's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna could only look on, happy for once to see Trish beating someone up, she wanting to bathe in the tears of Heather as she was helpless against her. Trish wouldn't be quite done yet as she would grab Heather by the hair with her free hand, moving the one from her throat to grab her by the back of the pants. She would take but a few steps before she would heave Heather's body across the hall. Sending her running at first, but a trip from the princess would sent her airborne headfirst into the lockers with a crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would leave Trish to recollect the size device, finally having it in her hands and a gulp would escape Edna as she looked at Trish's eyes studying it. It was clear as she pointed it at Heather that she wanted to shrink her down, and she had secretly hoped she would be reduced to an ant at her own feet as opposed to Trish's so she could crush Heather herself. Though as Trish turned her attention back to the smaller geek girl, Edna couldn't help but jump as she was spoken too, now the moment of truth if Trish needed her or not.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Edna's heart raced as she awaited Trish's answer, one of which she could tell that Trish wasn't happy about. An annoyed look on the face of Trish would be all that she needed to see. The Punk girl would inspect the device, looking it up and down as she did her best to make sense of it, but Edna would be a crafty girl it seemed with how it was labeled. Perhaps that being the reason that Heather hadn't made use of it. Regardless it left Trish without independent use and it only annoyed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, how do I shrink this bitch you little geek?\" The tone in her voice was enough to get Edna to shake, afraid of this woman. Hell she was terrified of her at normal size, but considering just how pathetic she was in comparison to her now. It was why she didn't show as much glee as she felt on this inside outwardly. The positive to this was that she knew she could at least control Trish;s use of the gun slightly. Though, she also had to take into account of Trish's short temper and not to outlive her usefulness to the Punk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, it's that switch, near the trigger, flip it left.\" She would shakily say up to this woman, watching with a bit of intrigue as she awaited to see this. She hated to admit that she was secretly rooting for her now tormentor. Afterall. going with her meant she would at least get to see Heather get what was coming to her, even if it was just a short term solution to her revenge plot. Still, she eyed as Trish did as she said, flipping the switch over, and making a few other slight checks at Edna's call. The inch tall geek could only look on with a growing smirk as she moved her attention tot he defeated Heather who had still yet to pick herself up off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could only look up as she heard Trish's footsteps getting closer. Heather's face, a blood trail from her nose painted the bottom portion of her face from where Trish had hit her. It was only a single punch and yet it had done so much, and that was to a like sized person! Though, she enjoyed to see Heather suffer, there was a part of Edna that had a mild curiosity as to what Trish could do if she were this titanic, or hell even bigger than that to everyone else. It was a similar curiosity as to a scientist simply musing in their laboratory, and she certainly never wanted to see an actual giant Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather wouldn't even get a hand up to shield her eyes as a flash overtook her, Edna having to do what she could to do the same. Simply ducking back down into that Breast pocket of Trish's jacket, looking to hide until it was over. Something she would get a cue on as she would feel her surroundings shift and two large digits wrapping around her. Trish having fetched Edna from her pocket would soon settle the girl down onto the floor at her feet. Allowing Edna once more the impressive view up at her, and letting her see just how minute she was, even compared to her beat up DC's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, there was something else, Trish motioning just behind Edna and getting her to spin around to see Heather Miles, her enemy still on the ground but at the exact same size as her, or at least relatively so due to their innate height difference. She could hear Heather's threats, the Queen of the School now reduced to a mere insect at the feet of some punk girl, and practically groveling at the feet of her punching bag for so many years, She wasn't happy to be where she was, but Edna was oh so loving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Geek girl.\" Trish's voice would rain down from above, causing both girls, albeit Heather was far slower to look up than Edna, still feeling the effects of the pummeling she took. \"I should really reward you for this, I mean, you didn't lie, and whilst I would have just killed you if you did. I believe there is more incentive in treats.\" As condescending as her tone was, it was enough to get Edna's face to light up. She hadn't expected this from Trish, to actually be rewarded. \"Don't get it mixed up though, you're never going to get your hands back on this device ever. I do have something I owe you however...\"</span></div></div>",

Her feet were a bit sweaty, what with the heat from Trish's palm and all the walking she had been doing.  She then slid Heather between her big and second toe and squeezed just enough to get a grasp on her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather found herself at the mercy of the girl she had tormented for such a long time, and suddenly felt what may have been regret.  It was a first for her.  As the giant sweaty foot got close to her, she gagged at the smell, and tried to run.  She was no match though, and found herself jammed between Edna's slimy, rancid toes.  \"Let go of me, I deserve better then this!\"  She cried, trying to squirm free.Edna couldn't even hear her, she was having too much fun torturing her.  </span></div></div>",

A simple side smirk which sent chills down Edna's spine from the crazed look in her eyes. Soon those eyes would lock onto Edna and her expression would change, Trish would sneer down at the shrunken girl in her hand, only causing her to swallow hard as the truth was known before she even spoke... <b>\"How dumb do ya' think I am? This shit isn't hard, and you are a useless fuck to me right now!\"</b> Trish would shout, her voice echoing through the hallway of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly threw with Edna, she would roughly toss her down onto Heather's chest only to allow her eyes to return back to the device. With it, every bit of Edna's hope would disappear, her control over Trish was gone, and now she had doomed the world for sure. Heather's air headed nature would have at least given everyone a chance, assuming she couldn't figure out the device, but now, Trish was aware of it, and she seemed to know how it operated, or so the massive punk insinuated. Unfortunately, it wouldn't take long before she would be given an opportunity to showcase the truth in her claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs loud as Trish had shouted, it would come of no surprise that a Teacher would hear her and want to investigate what was disrupting her class. The Teacher in question was a young blonde woman, mid twenties and this being her first year on the job. Dressed in a modest suit and dress combination with a pair of heels, she would exit her classroom and quickly find the source of the noise. She glaring down through her thick framed glasses, her blue eyes looking right into Trish's own green orbs. \"And just what is-...!\" The young teacher would only get so far before Trish, whom had already been cackling in the face of this woman would turn the device onto her. A quick draw fashion, and within mere seconds, that Teacher would be staring eye to toe with the soles of those beat up DC's of this punk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWicked delight flashing onto her face, Trish wouldn't hesitate even a moment before she lifted a shoe above the teacher, not even giving her a moment's notice or even a chance to scream before she brought her foot down roughly upon her body. An explosion of red scattering in every direction from the bottom of her shoe, and leaving Trish to let out a dark chuckle of satisfaction. She had just ended a life under her foot, snuffing out that bitch of a teacher like one of her cigarettes or some worthless ant. <b>'Fucking......yes!...\"</b> She would whisper to herself in pure jubilation. Of course this opened up the question of just what else she could do with this device. She would give Edna one last look, one of contempt, it clear to Edna that she was considering just smashing her to paste as well, perhaps even shrinking Heather down to an inch, and her along with her to a microscopic size to get them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough with perhaps mercy, Trish would simply turn on her heels and walk away, taking the device with her to do who knows what. To Edna that didn't matter too much, after all, it wasn't like she was in much of a position to try and take it from her. Even at full size, Trish would just kill her at this point. Her biggest concern at this moment would be her surroundings, being seated upon the chest of a woman, and not just any woman, but Heather Miles, her arch nemesis. Also.....there was the fact that she had just royally pissed her off with the whole \"putting Trish on her, and losing her the device thing.\" So when Heather woke up.....it likely would not be good for poor Edna...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Footsteps echoing off the walls of the hallway, Trish simply made her way down the abandoned walkways surrounded on either side by lockers. In her mind already having forgotten about Edna and Heather, mere after thoughts in the grand scheme of things for what ultimately was to come. Neither were important anymore as neither had what she had or could stop whatever it was that she would settle upon doing with her new toy. Sure, she was fairly certain that once Heather recovered, she'd be denied a kill when it came to Edna, unless the two managed to work out some sort of alliance against her, but she doubted it very much. Heather didn't have the brains or the long term thought capability to realize that her only way to stop the punk girl rested on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold green eyes would inspect this device in her hand, intently looking over every detail of it to try and figure out just what it was capable of. She knew it could shrink things and people, but she didn't know if it could have ....other effects. Could it shrink more than one thing at a time, how small could it reduce said things. Though, perhaps the more interesting option would be the possibility of a growth function. Lost in thought, she couldn't help but purr at the thought of it, to be towering over this pathetic town, staring down upon it before she wiped it and it's stupid fucking citizens off the face of the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left her at a crossroads, she could inspect these options, and employ a few tests to see for herself just what this device had in store for her. It wouldn't be long before a surprisingly sinister idea crossed her mind, causing a small grin to form across her lips. Her grip to tighten around the handle of the device and the desire, a hope that this idea could in fact become a reality. On the other hand however, what was the rush? Sure having the immediate fun would be entertaining, but why should she try and rush into something when she can just let the fun come to her? The small bloodstain under her foot was an example of that, and she could just use it to relieve stress during the day when someone upset her. Who knows, maybe showing up to class for once would be entertaining afterall...</span></div></div>",

Running a hand through her hair as she walked, she did her best to remain composed, but the old saying of the cat and curiosity was a nagging entity in the back of her mind. She couldn't help but think of the device, to the point of pulling it free of her pocket to look it over, practically salivating over it. Hungry eyes which were ready to test it, to do as she wished and of course...to share her prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would become far too much for Trish in the end, only getting a few more steps before her mind would ultimately be made up. She letting out a loud sigh as she once more took the device in her hands, her green eyes inspecting the details yet again, having done this too many times for her to keep track of anymore. \"Fuck it\" Would be all that she said before springing into action, everything seeming to become a blur around the young woman. Fully aware of what she was doing, but the pounding sensation of her heart and the anxiety filling her mind. It was a feeling she remembered very well through her first time in a fight. She was merely acting on instinct, and considering what she could do, that wasn't entirely a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of just how much time had passed, Trish would find herself pushing open one of the double doors leading outside of the school, and allowing herself the sense of freedom. The intense blinding light of the sun overheard, her eyes having grown more adjusted to the more dimly lit school. The surge of such an uncomfortable sensation would be all that she remembered until she got to the base of the steps leading into her apartment....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking the long climb up the few floors to where her apartment resided, Trish would move with intent, the device safely tucked away in her back pant pocket, and in her left hand, she had something clasped in her fist. Something precious by the way that she held it loosely and yet firm to ensure it went no where, but remained unharmed. With a turn of the knob leading into the apartment, she would swing the door open quietly before stepping in. Looking down to her right, she would notice a hoodie hanging on the hook by the door, something which only made her smile. \"Good, she's home.\" She would assure herself before making her way further into her home. It wouldn't take long either for her to find the woman in question either, all it took was a glance to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeated in the center of the couch was a young woman, sitting with her feet propped up on the edge of the coffee table, a book resting in her lap. A young Japanese woman, Nishura Yin whom had met Trish as her parents moved her to the States. Though she was sitting here, she was known to still make trips to tutor some of the students even if she had graduated the year prior. It was an easy way to make money on the side, even if you considered the awkwardness that came with teaching the very people who had been her classmates. Of course through this, she had met a few of the unsavory people that most students had a problem with. Heather Miles being at the top of that list, as well as the incredibly arrogant Mizuki, a fellow Japanese student who viewed Yin as more a rival than a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin wouldn't even look up from her book, but she would merely sigh as she knew what that sound was. \"You're never going to graduate if you keep skipping class.\" She began to lecture, her voice somewhat stern, and yet she couldn't hide that certain sweetness behind it. Unlike Trish, Yin seemed to have a heart, she was sweet and composed, a perfect counterbalance to Trish's violent personality. Even as the Punk girl looked her over, she couldn't help but drool over what she had gotten in this girl. Yin is a petite young woman, both in height and weight, a slender build. Much like what was mentioned, the influences from Trish would come in her looks. She having long shoulder length hair, kept straight, dyed a combination of primarily red, with some blonde and black thrown in. Her dark eyes were hidden faintly by a pair of rectangular black framed glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day, her attire wasn't much either, she wearing one of Trish's black t-shirts from one of her favorite bands, it fitting her loosely, a short sleeved black and white plaid button up shirt over that and a pair of faded and torn blue jeans which traveled to her converse. The dirty and beat up sneakers which had their soles planted firmly on the edge of the coffee table. Sure it may not have been a hygienic move, but realistically, when one looked down and saw off the ash trays which were overflowing, empty cans and discarded trash, her feet being there didn't seem to matter. Wordlessly, Trish would just move in, and deposit the contents of her left hand onto the table. Sluggishly, Yin would allow her book to drop into her lap so she could look over it to see just what Trish had done this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough once her eyes adjusted to it, they would widen, a look of shock coming across her face and a sense of disbelief clouding her mind. She knew what she was seeing, but it was impossible right? \"H-How?\" She could question, only getting Trish to chuckle as she dug that device from her pocket and showed it to Yin. \"Little nerdy Edna \"happily\" donated it to me.\" Trish would begin, hiding many of the facts away, after all, she doubted Yin would catch onto them at the moment. Still, it would leave her to look up at Trish, the device and then allowing her eyes to settle back down upon what was shrunken to an inch tall at her feet.</span></div></div>",

Trish grinned at her friend. \"I knew you'd like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin nodded but kept her eyes on the minuscule structure. Then, she moved her head closer. Something had caught her eye. A group of people was running away from the building. A stupid and unreasonable attempt to escape. But they stopped and cowered on the ground, because Yin was now so close, her breath alone created a massive storm for them. The young japanese woman stood up and returned short after with a magnifying glass to closer inspect the group. Trish just relaxed and watched her, satisfied that her girl liked her little present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin now observed the group of micro people and her heart made a jump of joy when she recognized one of them: Heather Miles. To Yin, she was an arrogant brat who needed to be put in her place. And now that was possible. A mischievous smirk formed on her face. She gently put her finger down before the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather and her friends had tried to escape, but quickly realized how futile it was. The table they were on was like a massive landscape, the edge so far away that they would not even reach it by the end of the day. And beyond that, the two girls rose up like goddesses, surrounding and watching the table that was now Heather's entire world. One of them was obviously Trish, the other was Yin, a japanese exchange student who had tutored Heather from time to time. The famous girl had always disliked the quiet, smart former classmate who had graduated the year prior. Heather had looked down on her, like she did on everyone, but Yin had not been intimidated by her, instead, the young Japanese had looked down on Heather herself. And now she was doing it literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather and her friends cowered in fear as the japanese goddess' massive finger landed on the ground, shaking the earth. \"You better step on my nail if you want to get out of there.\" Her deafening, thunderous voice boomed from the heavens and made Heather's ears ring. She looked up and dropped her jaw in awe. The nail was bigger than a football stadium and almost as thick as Heather was tall. The famous girl shivered in fear and looked at her friends. \"I guess we have no choice. Maybe she will actually help us.\" The others nodded, clinging to that small hope. Then, they climbed the nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wise decision.\" Yin smiled, then looked at Trish. Her friend had taken of her leather jacket off and sat casually on a chair. Her white tanktop was almost invisible at some parts because of her sweat. She must have run from the school grounds to their apartment. Yin's gaze focused on Trish's muscular arm, wandered up her biceps to her shoulder, then their eyes met. The two had an intimate relationship and understood each other pretty well. So Trish immediately knew what Yin was thinking. The punk raised her left arm high in the air, revealing her sweaty, shaved armpit. Yin held her finger before it. \"Have fun, you little brats.\", Yin whispered. Then she blew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moist air and skin was disgusting and her clothes and hair were soaked in sweat. Trish seemed to shave her armpits regularly, but at Heather's size, even the small hairs which remained where longer than she was tall and thicker then her arm, so they where an ideal save spot. Heather was crying in anguish. This was not right. She was queen of the school. On the other hand, the school was now so small that the two girls could crush it effortlessly with their little finger. Suddenly, her entire world shook again as Trish lowered her arm. To Heather, that simple movement was like an unstoppable force of nature. She screamed one last time, then she was surrounded by sweat, skin and darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish and Yin regarded each other seductively, both getting hornier by the second. But then, Yin's gaze fell on the small school building again, dirty and malicious ideas forming in her head. She then looked back into Trish's eyes. The punk smirked back at her and Yin licked her lips seductively. \"You know exactly what I am thinking, don't you?\" Trish nodded slowly.</span></div></div>",

Granted anyone in her situation wouldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry okay?\" Edna wheezed. \"But I really need your help. Trish has already killed someone. Look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather's grip loosened and began to stand up. She then noticed the red pool on the ground. Her eyes shot open as the true threat Trish presented was made clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Heather.\" Edna practically begged. \"I wouldn't ever ask you for anything but right now we're the only ones who know what's happening and Trish can kill anyone she wants whenever she wants. Please! Please help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather listened to the helpless geek beg for her aid. On the one hand she could just killer her and try to wrestle the ray away from Trish herself. Then again, as loath as she was to admit it the geek was smart and new the ray better than anyone.

Heather briefly wonder for a moment who was the poor unfortunate soul that was turned into paste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith barely hidden resignation, Heather sighed. \"Fine geek girl, I'll help you.\" Edna was equal points shocked and relived. She half expected Heather to discard her and take her chances against Trish alone. That plan would've been suicide. \"But just so we're clear. I'm only doing this because Trish is royal pain in the ass, and I owe her for putting her hands on me,\" Edna nodded. \"Lastly I'm in charge! Got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna nodded again. She honestly wasn't surprised that Heather declared she was in charge. Oh well, it was a small price to pay all things considered. As long as they got the size-ray back from Trish and turned her back to normal then she could live with Heather being in charge. \"You will turn me back to normal? Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if I get to keep the size-ray when this is all over.\" Heather stated. Edna didn't like that. Heather was the second to last person she wanted to have her glorious invention. But at the same time she could always find a way to deal with her later once she regained her usual stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy sigh, Edna agreed. \"I accept your terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you had much choice.\" Heather smirked before placing Edna in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to hurry up and find Trish.\" Edna explained. \"She figured out how the gun works and it's only a matter of time before she decides to go full on 'Attack of The 50ft Woman' on the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In case you've forgotten Edna, neither of us have the fighting ability to take Trish on. We have no means of stopping her and no support. If we're going to do this we're going to need more people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna really didn't like that idea, but at the same time Heather had a point. Putting a team together would make their goal a whole lot easier to reach. The downside being that they would be dragging innocent people into their problems. Edna also couldn't say with absolute certainty that everyone would survive either. Plus their was the added issue of having to explain everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do? What to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was feeling rejuvenated as she knew that she would get her chance, her one chance to beat the hell out of Heather without repercussion. After all, it would be hard to punish someone who could just instantly shrink whomever she wanted when she wanted. Something that the geek girl would help her with just to save herself from such a fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still didn't know how to feel about Edna's end of the deal, after all, she didn't like the idea about being controlled even indirectly. It hadn't escaped her, Edna's overall plan granted she didn't know the details. Though she was certainly aware that she would possibly need Edna at every turn, to know how to do what she was wanting to do. It not at all out of her mind that the geek could just feign dumb if she didn't like it either. It was exactly why Trish wouldn't hesitate to kill her if the situation changed and Edna's worth proved not so useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish wouldn't be the only one reflecting however, Edna whom was placed in the front pocket of Trish's jacket. Feeling her backside resting up against Trish's right breast as she looked over the edge of said piece of fabric. She simply watched Trish march on, pushing people out of her way whom didn't have the answers she was looking for, Heather's whereabouts. It seemed a bad call for Trish to be so noisy in her approach, but she just assumed she knew what she was doing. Edna could not say the same thing about herself though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this really whom she wanted to have control of the gun? Sure she would get her revenge on Heather but at what cost? Trish was violent, she was somewhat psychotic and if she was smart enough, the worst possible candidate to be picking skyscrapers from the treads of her sneakers. Edna would only sit back, enjoying her admittedly comfy makeshift seat up against Trish's assets as she waited to see what would happen. It wouldn't take long either before it went south.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly the lights vanished from the floor and it became dark. Something - forceful like an explosion shook - the school. Trish reached for her cleavage, protecting her breasts and tiny Edna from a cascade of plaster that fell from the cathedral ceiling of the floor. Thunderous impacts came from the main entrance. No lights entered the school from the large windows there. \"Oh my god!\", Edna whispered, when he worst supiscions were confirmed by a booming female laughter. Trish\u2019s face became pale. Like in trance she stepped to a window.<br>\r\nIn front of the school stood Heather. Heather wasn\u2018t just big gor tall \u2013 she was humongeous. Edna guessed that Heather was about 120 feet tall and still growing. The blonde titaness rested her hands on her hips, proudly displaying her body. Heather\u2019s straight golden hair, which falls to her mid-thigh \u2013 glistened in the sun. Somehow her body grew faster than her clothes, which became tighter and more revealing, while Heather gained height. Heathers jeans were stretched tight across her legs and hips, though they hadn't ripped and her shirt was starting to ride up her midsection. Edna couldn\u2019t help but notice, that Heather\u2019s proportions changed too. The blonde has always been busty, but her breasts were definitely growing even faster than the rest of her body \u2013 she was now at least a large F-cup. Heather\u2019s breasts strained violently against the stretchy fabric of her shirt, the frontprint \"Empress\" was stretched into big wide letters. The neckline was spreading wider, popping buttons from her shirt, revealing more and more of the alabaster-colored flesh of her bustline. The shocked bystanders could see the supple curve of her cleavage emerging from beneath her ever-tightening shirt, a pair of wondrous orbs making a slow-motion escape from their cotton prison. With each passing second another millimeter was creeping into view. Heather didn\u2019t care. She was as stunningly beautiful as ever, an orgasmic grin on her angelic face... though Edna could barely see it from her angle, obscured as it was by Heather\u2018s staggering breasts.<br>\r\n\"So here we are!\" said the giant Heather aloud, her growth finally stopping at 150 feet. But as she transferred her weight to her left foot, the spike heel of her far two small heel sandal plunged into the ground. Heather wasn\u2019t prepared for it, and she fell back to her left straight into a building next tot he school, which crumbled immediately. The sound was incredible and a huge cloud of dust swirled up and around her causing her to cough a few times. Booming laughter followed her mishap, when the gaintess realized that she wasn\u2019t even bruised. \"So much for those\" she said kicking off tboth sandals into the rubble. Her hands sunk into the ground as she pushed herself up. It was amazing to see the surroundings drop so quickly as she rose to her full height again. The experience sent a shiver of pleasure down her spine. She has always dreamed about beeing untouchable and powerful. Grinning she stepped on a parked car, her foot sunk deep into the road causing cracks to form in all directions from the impact. It actually felt nice. This act of destruction broke the spell on her audience and people started to flee in terror. Heather smiled a mischevious smile. She reached her huge hand down toward her crotch. She started to finger herself, and moaned as softly as a ten-story woman could. \u201eSo much untapped power!\u201c, she whispered.<br>\r\nTrish had seen enough. Panicked she started to run. Heather Miles was gigantic. She needed a new plan.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Edna grinned and immediately pulled the trigger, words couldn't describe her ecstasy at becoming a giantess and crushing all her problems underfoot. This was her grand moment, her ascent. The girl closed her eyes and just let herself relish the moment. In mere moments Edna would become so large this entire school would be but a speck before her sandals. And Heather less than dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...the fuck...?\" Heather slowly mumbled under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edna! What's happening to you?\" Ruthie's shrill voice asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Ruthie. I'm just-\" Edna opened her eyes. \"-Growing...?\" Edna's eyes locked with Heather, who <i>should</i> have been about as tall as Edna's hips. But instead it was Edna who was only as tall as her <i>knees</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're shrinking!\" Ruth shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?!\" Edna looked to the size gun in her hands, now comically over-sized in her child-like palms. Her frantic eyes glanced at the three main dials she installed. One dial was to determine how quickly the target's size would change, Edna opted to keep it a slow steady transformation so she could enjoy slowly towering over Heather. That was where it needed to be just fine. The other was how powerful the blast would be, in this case maxed out for ultimate growthage. But the last dial was the problem. Instead of Grow it was very clearly set to <i>Shrink</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edna you idiot!!!\" The genius cursed herself aloud. Her fingers fumbled in a hurried panic to fix her mistake before her hands would become too small to operate her device. Now less than two feet tall Edna hurried worked the dial back to where it needed to go and pointed it at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat familiar, evil voice ruined everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a simple smack Heather sent the size gun flying from Edna's small hands effortlessly. With a loud clank the device smacked against a locker. Immediately Edna made a dive for it, now less than a foot tall but Heather was far too fast. The diva's fingers wrapped themselves around Edna's tiny body and hoisted her up. Heather clenched the puny girl in her fist as she brought her to her increasingly large face. \"I don't know what you're trying to do but I'll be damn sure you don't get away with it.\" The girl continued to casually chew her gum and blow a bubble the same size as Edna. Everyone aside from Heather was dumbfounded by the sight of Edna continuing to shrink away in the woman's grasp. Only Heather had the clarity of mind to walk to the lockers and pick up Edna's size gun. A casual glance at the clearly labelled dials told her everything in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow...You idiot!\" Heather cackled. \"How could you be smart enough to make a gun that can shrink and grow things. But be dumb enough to forget to set it to Grow!\" Her laughter continued. \"You loser! You almost had me but you were too much of a loser to even pull that off right!\" Heather opened her palm and balanced the tiny girl effortlessly on it. \"You deserve this. Now you get to be the pathetic ant you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it back Heather!\" Edna screamed defiantly at the bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of this girl no bigger than her fingers bossing her around sent Heather into another fit of laughter. \"You guys hear that? The bug wants her gun back! Too bad.\" She twirled the device playfully in her fingers, \"This thing belongs to people, not <i>bugs</i>.\" In her palm Edna grew smaller, \"Wow, how small are you gonna get bug girl? At this rate you'll be less than an ant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Heather looked to Ruth. \"You're still here? Scram!\" She pointed the gun at Ruth. \"Before I shrink you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's eyes were conflicted. It was clear she wanted to help her friend but the threat of becoming that small too stopped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said beat it!\" Heather waved the gun, scaring Ruthie enough she turned and ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, what a pathetic little girl. Speaking of...\" Heather turned her eyes back to Edna and laughed. The whole interaction with Ruth took ten seconds tops. But in that time Edna went from bug-sized to speck-sized. If it wasn't for the fact this speck clashed against Heather's flawless skin it wouldn't have even been visible. But even that was too big for a bug like Edna. Heather watched in fascination as the speck soon vanished and shrunk to...She couldn't even find something to compare it too. It was just a microbe that was barely visible in a wrinkle on her palm. That was Edna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serves you right for trying to stand up to your superiors.\" Heather sneered. \"I always knew you were a dweeb Edna but seriously. Even I thought you were better than this...Guess I was wrong.\" She shrugged. \"Thanks for the toy though. I'm gonna have a lot of fun with it. In fact...\" The possibilities raced through her head. \"I think I'm going to cut class today. I have better things I need to do.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking away from the microbe that desecrated her sacred palm Heather focused once more on the size gun's dials, fiddling around with the settings. Currently it was set to Grow someone to the maximum possible size as slow as possible. \"Wow, you were so close Edna. If I didn't smack this thing away from you <i>I</i> might be a bug at <i>your</i> feet. Ha!\" She sneered at the absurd thought. \"As if.\" Gently the evil girl's fingers fiddled with the device's settings. First things first, set it to shrink. Lest she make the same mistake her microscopic loser made. Second, the speed of shrinking. It was now set to instant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to test it...\" Heather looked around until she found a trashcan against the wall of lockers. \"Perfect.\" She grinned and fired. True to what the dial said, the locker was gone in an instant. Now just another speck of dirt hidden alongside the other specks on the ground. Heather knelt down to try to find it but it was no use. It was too small to stand out from any other speck on the floor. Heck, it was probably smaller than anything she could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's too small...\" The girl thought to herself, \"I can't do this if I can't even see the people...\" Her fingers gently nudged the size setting as she took another practice shot at a water fountain. A split-second passed before there was naught but a hole in the wall where a fountain once stood. Though clashing against the ruined wall was a single white flake, less than half the size of one of Heather's nails. It only stood out because of the harsh grey brick hole left behind by the fountain. Yet for whatever reason Heather's eyes followed it until it fell to the ground and broke apart. Sure enough, at a closer glance it was the fountain. The girl smirked once again, \"Perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last thing though. Heather looked at her palm. Despite her moving her hand about the one speck blemishing her skin was still there. It took a moment but soon Heather realized why and laughed yet again. \"Aww, is poor little Edna stuck to big ol Heather's hand?\" The shrunken girl was so tiny so was stuck to Heather via her natural body oils. Or perhaps the shrunken girl was so small she was literally trapped in one of the wrinkles of her palm? Either way didn't matter, Edna's fate was none of Heather's concern. A Queen such as herself had no business thinking about such lesser beings as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to get started...\" Heather started heading to her classroom, hips swaying confidently as she began her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked in. No knocking. No attempting to hide her tardiness. The girl walked in as if she owned the classroom. Even for her it was pretty ballsy, though no one put it past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are late Miss Miles.\" The teacher sounded none too pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal with it.\"  She retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment the teacher just stared at her, dumbfounded. \"Now you listen here-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, <i>you</i> listen to me.\" Heather pointed the gun at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp filled the room as everyone grew scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Ms. Miles that's a gun. You can't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I can.\" She motioned the gun through the room, \"All of you get in a corner!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be shot, everyone, teacher included, complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Heather fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone bunched together in a corner like that was the perfect target. Just like she wanted, the whole class vanished in an instant. She knew where they all went and casually walked over. She relished each second. Imagining what her victims were experiencing. What were the soft stomps of her sandals against the floor were Earth-shattering quakes. The gentle sways of her hips and hair was high level winds. Her very existence blotting out the world around them as she stood above them as their superior. Heather rested her hands on her hips, sneering down at what looked like a collection of tiny, multi-colored pebbles. Bigger than the microbe that was Edna, but not even an inch high. Heather glared down at them, feeling all the power she had over their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're all coming with me.\" The giantess knelt down, swiping her hand along the ground and rounding up most of the tinies in one fell swoop. The second swoop got the rest. \"And in my purse you go.\" Her fingers dumped the horde of people into the vastness of her purse. \"Be thankful I emptied a pocket for you little ants...Now time for the next class...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the process began again. One by one classes were rounded up into a corner, tricked that it was a real gun Heather wielded, and they shrank and joined the others in her purse. In no time a hallway was cleared, than a floor, than before she knew it all that was left was the principal's office. Much like every other room she invaded, Heather walked in as if she owned it. Not even so much as a courtesy knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? Ms. Miles what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather glared at the woman seated behind her lavish desk. Principal Kari Lindley. In this entire school she was the one who rivaled Heather for looks. Kari held the mature look only a woman could have, though her features were distinctly young. Her long brown hair laid against her shoulders as two mis-matched eyes stared questioningly at Heather. Her body wasn't as developed as Heather's. She was shorter, had smaller breasts and smaller curves. Yet her face and body just seemed attractive in their own unique way. She was the perfect balance between a young woman and a mature adult. And she pissed Heather right off. The bugs she spent the last hour shrinking compared her to <i>this</i>? She wasn't even worth kissing the bottom of Heather's sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, I asked you a question Ms. Miles. I understand you are a beloved member of our student body but even for you I will not tolerate such blatant disregard for th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather fired. No warning, no words, she just blasted the principal into yet another speck on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all the others Heather walked to the newly shrunken principal and stood proudly over her. \"There's going to be some changes around here.\" Then the girl raised her head and walked to the famed principal's desk. A high-quality desk decorated with top of the line materials and specially imported alongside a thick cushioned chair that resembled a throne more than anything else. Heather sat herself in the chair and smiled. It felt right. This was a seat reserved for the best in the school. The person in charge of it all. Her. She owned this school now. She kicked the seat a few feet away from the desk and stretched her legs. Vaguely she caught sight of the puny principal Lindley heading towards her. She chuckled and proceeded to ignore her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diva reached into her purse for the hundreds she had shrunken and pulled them all out, laying them out on the floor before her chair. Seeing them altogether, Heather had to stifle another laugh. Altogether this school had approximately 1,000 students. Right now the entire student body couldn't even fill the space between her and her new desk. It would take but four or five stomps and they would almost all be gone. It was little more than a horde of specks at her feet. A surprisingly noisy horde too. Separate their voices were nothing but together their panicking cries of \"How\" and \"Why were actually ear-grating. Were being the key word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single lazy but firm stomp on Heather's part shut everyone up. Almost regally the girl rested an arm on the armrest and leaned her chin on it, slipping a foot from her sandal and crossing it over her leg, directly over many of her shrunken subjects. \"I bet you specks are all wondering what happened aren't you? Why I shrank you down?\" Heather awaited no answer, \"Do I need a reason? Does a Queen need any reason to make herself stand out more from the common rabble? I shrank you because you all deserve it, and most of all. Because <i>I</i> deserve it. I've always been better than all of you, it's only recently that I've been able to gain the power to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather grinned, \"Get used to it ants. From now on I'm your superior. Your owner. Your master. Your Queen. Your Goddess.\" Her toes scrunched above the shrunken people, \"And you will all spend the rest of your lives worshiping me like the Goddess I am.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The people before Heather's feet took to her news about as well as one would expect. Diminutive as they were the clear sounds of outrage were unmistakably being shouted up the towering giantess. Heather looked down at the mass of speck-sized people with an apathetic look. With a wave of her foot she stomped them all into silence. \"Perhaps I didn't make myself clear. This isn't a<i> choice</i>. It's an order. The only choice here is whether or not you get to live and worship me...Or die.\" She added with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stunned silence filled the crowd as they realized Heather was serious. The reality of their situation began to sink in. This woman held their lives in the palm of her hands. It would be unwise to anger her. Even so, faint murmurs traveled among the people. Outrage, plans of escape, even a few plans of trying to somehow overcome the woman Jack and the Beanstalk style. Big as she was Heather was still just a regular girl. A regular girl who towered over them all normally and was now able to crush them with a single toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They think they're being sneaky.</i> Heather thought with a laugh. These ants couldn't be more obviously up to something even if they tried. It was clear they'd need some...<i>persuading</i>. \"I have an idea. Let's play a game.\" The woman stood up and walked to one end of the mass of people. She kicked off a sandal and quickly stepped to the other end, where she then kicked off her other sandal. Silently the giant diva walked back to the middle and let herself tower over the crowd. \"I think it's time to see where your loyalties truly lie ants. I'm going to ask you some questions. If you decide to answer no...\" She pointed to her left sandal, \"Crawl onto that sandal. If you decide yes...\" Her finger pointed to the other one, \"Crawl onto that sandal. If you get the question right you're fine. If you're wrong I'm going to put the sandal on.\" She giggled as her sentence sank in, \"Needless to say if you refuse to pick I'll just crush you anyway. Depending on how loyal you are to me you'll get to either live or die. This way we can get rid of any bad pets. After all, only good bugs get to worship their Goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of, let's start with that. First Question. Am I your Goddess? You have two minutes. I'd run if I were you.\" The Goddess chuckled as she saw the hundreds of people scramble to run to the appropriate sandal. No one doubted for a moment the evil woman would carry out her threat. People hurried to her right sandal, shoving one another in desperation as they started to climb up. There was no way a single one of Heather's flip flops would carry all of them at once. It was all about whoever got their first or was strong enough to force their way on. It was amusing to watch all the bug people fight so desperately just to get onto one her old sandals. Getting on top of her shoe was the difference between life or death for these ants. Whereas for Heather it made absolutely no difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up! Now let's see how you all did.\" As expected her right sandal was completely full to the brink with tiny people. At a casual glance it looked like maybe ninety percent of them managed to make it. The rest were not so lucky. A few dozen people were right beside her sandals trying their absolute hardest to climb on but constantly getting pushed back. She couldn't tell who they were but Heather had a suspicion these were the weakest geeks in the school. Just watching them try and fail to get onto her sandal was a riot in itself. Then there were the others...Heather saw a dozen or so especially dim bugs in her sandal signalling No. They were either too stupid to realize she was serious or thought they were being heroic. Whichever it was, bugs had only one fate with Heather as their Goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see some of you bugs didn't get the memo...Ah well. I have no use for you then.\" Heather walked to a sandal and slid her foot into it. It was a simple action every person in the room had done hundreds of times. It was nothing new, but man did it feel good. Heather closed her eyes to focus on her first crush. Faintly beneath her soles she could feel the few defiant people under her. She could feel faint cracks beneath her soles until one by one came loud crunches, each crunch killing one more bug. Once her full weight rested on her foot the little nay sayers popped like grapes. \"Mmm...\"That felt good. And don't think I forgot about you bugs.\" The Goddess looked to those who didn't make it on her sandal. \"Accept your punishment.\" After sliding her sandal back off Heather moved and raised her foot over the bugs. \"I have no need of weak bugs who can't even make it onto my shoes.\" She stomped them dead in an instant, not even giving them the chance to beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations on getting the first question bugs. Question Two: Will you worship me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a single soul left her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. Question Three: Are there any other Goddesses besides me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously some people looked between one another. Heather watched curiously as a decent amount of people headed to her No sandal. Perhaps they thought Heather would have some friends be worshiped too. Maybe they were thinking about historical Goddesses. Maybe they refused to abandon their religion. It really didn't matter. There was only one answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to say there isn't. Hope you're ready bugs.\" Heather walked to her sandal to one again put it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Heather! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on girl it's us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Heather heard faint sounds from her shoe. Normally she'd just shrug it off as the usual pleas for their lives but something about this seemed different. She looked down to investigate. In the middle of the people on her sandal were two people jumping and waving their arms. It took a moment before Heather recognized them as her friends. \"Oh...it's you two.\" Honestly she forgot when she shrunk them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Don't crush us we're your friends! We can be Goddesses too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather stood up, frowning. On top of defying her they spout that nonsense? She raised her foot over her sandal. \"A Goddess has no friends...And you have no lives.\" She put on her sandal, crushing even her old friends to paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serves them right. 'Goddesses too'. Don't make me sick.\" It reviled Heather enough so wiped her foot off on the ground before proceeding. \"Question Four...\" Mentally laughed as an idea popped to mind. \"...I will not crush you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone murmured in understandable confusion. If it's Yes she won't crush them...but she clearly has and will. But if it's No then she will crush them. Which was the right answer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To make this one fun you have thirty seconds.\" The Goddess laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no time to spare people ran in accordance with their first instinct. It seemed like a perfect fifty-fifty split between people who said Yes and People who said No. Aside from them sat maybe a hundred or so people in the middle, people who either didn't know or couldn't make it in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather was very pleased with this result. For a moment she remained silent so the bugs on her shoes could get properly nervous. Then she finally said, \"The answer is neither Yes or No. It was a trick question.\" She smiled as the little ants quickly panicked. In a single step Heather walked to one sandal and put it on. Two steps later she put on her other shoe. Hundreds were killed in those seconds, and Heather relished each and every little pop. She sat back on her throne before the people lucky enough to get the right answer and licked off her sandals. \"Congratulations. You're all good enough to serve your Goddess. Now get to work licking my sandals! They're stained with bug blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that not a single person wasted time running on to Heather's sandals and licking it clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather crossed her legs and laughed, \"It's good to be the Queen.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once her sandals were properly cleaned Heather snapped her finger and signaled her pets to get off. With her shoes now available she hurriedly put them back on. \"Not a bad first job bugs. But I'm getting bored just hanging around so we're going to go out somewhere fun.\" She lowered her hand to the ground until all her remaining pets climbed onto her palm, where she then quickly put them all into her purse. Once her purse was zipped shut Heather didn't say a word to them. She simply slung it over her shoulder and walked out of school like nothing was wrong. With every sway of her hips her purse bounced against her hip, scaring all her pets half to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone from the school shrunken the town seemed strangely quiet...well...quieter. Most adults were busy working and nearly all the kids were either in school or shrunken. Heather barely saw anyone before she got to her destination: the beach. The girl smiled in content as she saw a surprisingly populated beach before her. No high-schooler's of course but plenty of adults and college kids. Pretty much anyone who had the time to relish the nice day was here having fun. Heather soon would be too, but there was an issue. Being the kind of girl she was Heather rarely didn't have access to her swimsuit, but she just came from school so she had no towel or suntan lotion or even chair to rest on. Instinctively her hand opened her purse as a sly smile crossed her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as Heather began to glance over the beach she saw the perfect chance. A lone young woman by herself tanning on a lawn chair with a cooler and all the supplies Heather could ever need. The woman was walking towards the nearby bathroom building, unaware she was being followed. Heather creeped carefully into the restroom with her hand resting calmly on her size gun. When she was certain they were alone in the restroom she blasted the girl. One quick stomp later Heather suddenly had a free set of beach gear. She hummed joyfully as she put her gun back into her purse and changed into her swim suit. For a woman as beautiful as Heather she of course had a swimsuit to match: a navy blue two-piece bikini set up built to accentuate her already ample chest. Heather felt like a Goddess when she stepped out of the restroom in her beach outfit. Confidently the blonde diva went to the woman's chair and sat on it, using some of her abandoned suntan lotion on herself. In a couple minutes she glistened in the sun like the beautiful water before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazily Heather opened her purse and pulled out some sunglasses. Once those were on then her music player. Then after she finally got around to the hundred or so people trapped inside. Heather carelessly dropped them all into the sand beside her, faintly aware of the blood at the bottom of her purse. \"You bugs can't even handle a trip without dying can you?\" She sighed. \"It's too nice here to get mad. Turn on my music player then get to cleaning your friends out of my purse.\" The girl rested her head back, content to let her speck-sized people do their duty. After a couple minutes her music player came to life, blaring a terrible pop song. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather frowned, \"Ugh this really? You ants have shitty taste in music. Change it.\" They changed it to another shitty pop song. \"Change it.\" Then another. \"Change it.\" And another. Heather's voice grew more annoyed with each repeated command until she finally sat up and grabbed the device herself. \"Let me take care of it! God you're all so useless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because we're so small!\" A voice piped from the bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather's ears perked, \"Was that backtalk I heard? Maybe you bugs need to remember who's in charge here.\" With a free hand the Goddess pulled up a handful of sand and hovered it over a number of people, specifically the one who talked back. She released her grip and let the thousands of grains fall upon the tiny people. At their size those grains were probably basketball-sized hail. More than a few people got hit and didn't get back up. After a single gust of wind they were all hidden by the sand. \"Stupid ants. Don't forget who's your Goddess.\" Heather scrolled until she found a good song and got comfy again. \"Just for that you can clean me off. Got sand all over from dealing with you stupid bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her sour mood Heather quickly felt content again as her slaves did as commanded. Her favorite songs were playing, she was at the beach with dozens of people as pets. Life was good. Before she knew it Heather felt tired. Then sleepy. Then she was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much time passed was hard to say. It was still early in the morning when Heather headed to the beach and it was still daylight when she woke up. It felt like noon-ish. The girl's eyes fluttered open, faintly aware something was off. In a cold realization Heather figured out what. Her pets weren't there. The tiny hands that should be worshiping her were nowhere to be found. She jolted upright in a heartbeat and looked around: nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little shits.\" She cursed. \"You think you can run away?!\" Heather gritted her teeth and looked around. Since her nap the beach had gotten even more crowded. Not overtly so but there were definitely a solid pack of people here. But as far as she could see no tiny- oh wait! There were some. Very faintly Heather could see a majority of her pets running in the sand away from the water. They barely stood out at all, Heather only noticed because she was looking for them. No sign of the others though. They all probably got crushed or lost in the sand. Those would be the lucky ones after Heather got through with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConveniently they were all next to something useful: a volleyball net. In fact, in their hurry all her tiny slaves had wandered directly into the playing field. This gave Heather the perfect idea. She just needed some help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather stood up and walked over to a group of college-looking kids, all girls oddly enough. One was a short-haired brunette, another a perky blonde, and the last had long black hair. Each of them had sizable bosoms, were nearly as tall as Heather and if she had to guess, were probably very popular with guys. They couldn't hold a candle to a Goddess like Heather though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" She called out to the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" The black-haired one answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys up for a round of volleyball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three exchanged a look before shrugging. \"Sure why not? We were looking for something to do anyway. You got a ball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather slumped, realizing a problem. \"No unfortunately...I didn't even think of that.\" She'd been too busy thinking of crushing her bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman laughed, \"Nice. I think I got a ball in my car though. Be right back.\" The girl returned quickly with a volleyball in tow, and, as Heather noticed, crushed more than a few of her bugs on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny.\" The girl smiled, \"And this is Emily and Tara.\" She pointed to the blonde and brunette respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty Heather. What teams should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe switch it up as we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me! First it'll be me and you against Emi and Tara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Heather did her best to hold back her giddiness as she walked to the volleyball net with her newly-made friends. Her tiny pets stopped in their tracks once they saw her familiar towering figure heading towards them. Effortlessly the girls walked to opposite sides of the net and did a couple warm-up stretches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are going down!\" Tara shouted from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather took a look at all her pets scattered through the playing field. \"I'm gonna crush you!\" She had the ball in her hands. With a firm stomp into the ground, ending someone's life, she jumped into the air and served.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without a doubt, this was the most fun Heather had ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first serve it quickly became apparent all three of the girls she'd just met were skilled athletes. At her own school her serve was unbeatable but Tara skillfully dove into the sand and lobbed it back up where Emily was already in the air to smash it down. As if she saw it coming Jenny was in the air with her ready to block. Heather could only stare blankly for a moment at the three in surprise. Once the ball bounced her way she quickly snapped out of it and sent it over to the other side, relishing a squish she felt underfoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could only imagine the sheer chaos that this seemed like to the shrunken people scattered across the sand they played on. It seemed that with every basic movement a girl made someone died, be it crushed beneath their feet, pulverized by the ball or in one instance, flattened under Emily's bosom as she fell. And the three other girls had no idea. That was probably what Heather liked the most. She made every effort to crush someone when she saw them but these three killed people merely by existing. How degrading it must've been to all the people who died just because they happened to be in the way of Jenny walking or happened to be where one of Tara's sweat beads landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nicely-done smash Jenny scored the first point and quickly turned to give a confident smirk to Heather who nodded in response. These women were all strong. Not like the young girls Heather always had following her. These were actual adults who were worth hanging around. Perhaps these would be her new friends as a Goddess, now that her old ones were almost all dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it comes!\" Emily cried out, gently serving the ball. Heather made a run for it the same time Jenny did. While normally this would've met with disaster both girls were in perfect sync. When they reached where the ball was heading them stopped perfectly and jumped in unison. With both their hands they smacked the ball back with wicked speed and returned to opposing ends of the court. Tara cursed in amazement as she hurried to return this bullet of a ball but it was too late, another point had been scored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least try to make this challenging!\" Heather laughed, catching the ball and quickly serving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere Emily seemed to appear in the air and smacked the ball down with resounding force, leaving no time to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what I can do.\" She winked at Heather before sassily walking back, crushing someone beneath her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I like her.</i> Heather thought to herself playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game quickly resumed. Emily and Tara were on the offensive and it was all Heather and Jenny could do to hold them off. They had the momentum and had the two running all over the place, not that that was bad mind you, each step was another tiny person crushed. Though Heather quickly forgot about all that in the heat of the game. She was genuinely having fun with people more deserving of her presence and it seemed they were enjoying it just as much. It felt like ten minutes had passed over the course of a heated hour-long game. It was tough but in the end Heather and Jenny managed to win by a point. All girls collapsed on the sand panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great game.\" Jenny huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgot how good you were.\" Tara sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't so bad yourself you know.\" Heather noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was surprised you could keep up with us.\" Emily smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously.\" Jenny patted Heather's shoulder. \"Definitely earned my respect that last point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saying I didn't have your respect before.\" Heather stuck her tongue out playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how many nobodies try to hang out with us. If it's not weird guys trying to sleep with us it's jealous girls trying to start some drama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the feeling.\" Heather nodded. \"I used to have all those kinds of issues at my school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Used to? What happened?\" Tara tilted her head. Jenny and Emily looked curious too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather thought for a moment, choosing her words carefully. \"I guess you could say...I just taught them their place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd kill to know how. Would save me a lot of trouble.\" Jenny laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Emily nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later.\" Heater smiled knowingly. \"Up for another match?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! You and Emily versus me and Tara. If we win you'll tell us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather laughed, \"Great, then I won't have to say anything.\" She glanced around the sand for more people to crush but from the looks of it they all died during the first game. Oh well, she'd just have to shrink some more later. Overhead the ball flew past Heather towards Jenny who smacked it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like the first game, this one lasted a while, though only 30 minutes this time. Once all was said and done Heather barely lost, missing one too many smashes. Once again all four girls sat down and began to huff for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was close.\" Tara chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, I almost had you.\" Heather frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost, but not quite.\" Jenny high-fived Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are pretty cool. Glad I met you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" The other girls nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment they grew quiet. Heather let her eyes wander, noting a very slight movement near her toes. Some of the sand was moving. Normally this would be wind or maybe a crab but she had a feeling. She watched closely and sure enough, a person popped from under the sand. By the looks of it he was the one survivor of the massacre that took place during the games. It was a miracle he wasn't buried so deep he died. Heather paused for a moment, \"Didn't you guys say I had to tell you how I got everyone to stop bugging me if you won?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" Jenny laughed, obviously having forgotten. \"You don't have to if you don't want to. It's not really a big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I kinda wanna tell you.\" Heather reached over and plucked something from the sand. \"Though it'd be easier to show you.\" The others looked at Heather as she opened her hand, revealing the tiny person between her fingers. One by one she saw the blank stare of theirs turn into an astonished, baffled look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a person?!\" Tara shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was.\" Heather smirked, \"Now he's just my plaything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you- I mean is this even possible?!\" Emily's jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story.\" Heather shrugged. \"I kind of ended up being able to shrink people and decided to show everyone just how much better than them I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...really something.\" Jenny managed to calm herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now here's the question I wanted to ask you.\" Heather smiled, \"Shrinking people down is fun and all but I'd bet it'd be much funner with some friends. If you catch my drift. Just imagine having a hundred people in front of you, the size of specks of dirt. What you could do to them. All the payback. The fun. I can make that happen. You could all be Goddesses alongside me. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unable to hold herself back any more, Heather eagerly pointed the gun at her own temple. Of course after making sure she didn't make the same mistake the speck of dirt did. Good thing too, in all the commotion the device was set to Shrink again. Heather smirked as she turned the dial back to growth, and while she was at it she messed around with some other settings too. \"Now it's time for this school to see who really runs it!\" She fired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment it looked as if nothing was happening. She was no taller than she ever was, then it started. It started off very slowly she saw, in the span of a minute she gained a foot or so. But if Edna's increasingly rapid shrinking was any indication, soon she'd be growing much, MUCH faster. \"I wonder how big I'm going to get.\" Heather smiled. Confidently she turned to the school's entrance and started to walk. Behind her was silence. Usually her two friends always tailed her but with all that happened they must've vanished in the commotion. For the best really, they didn't deserve to be at Heather's side anymore. No one did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the short walk to the door Heather was almost ten feet high and had to bend over to fit out. Once she raised her head to her full height she was already too big to go back in. The growing girl kept walking until she stood in the heart of the school's front field, a solid twenty feet from the building itself at least. Or as Heather now saw it: three steps. She was now the same size as the thirty-foot tall building and soon even that would be nothing. The giantess stood proudly, chest puffed out, hands on her hips, legs spread apart, and allowed herself to continue expanding. Already some windows in the school were opening, chock full of students staring dumbfoundedly at the girl growing before their very eyes. She now looked down at the building that was only waist high; still growing, still smiling. The amazed shouts of the puny humans  was already too small for her to make out. Speaking of puny humans, Heather broke her pose to glance at her palm. The microbe that was Edna was nowhere to be seen. \"Enjoy spending the rest of your life living on my palm twerp!\" The giantess laughed and resumed her triumphant stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Heather stopped growing, much to the awe of everyone who saw her. The school that once dwarfed her now was only as high as her feet, and barely twice as wide. Her legs that were spread apart now set her massive pedicured soles on either end of the building, with her sandals blocking the roads. She had to have grown to several hundred feet tall. Certain she'd finally finished her ascent Heather bent over and ripped the roof from the school. Against her massive fingers it offered no resistance. Her fist clenched, splitting the structure in half which she then used to block off the two main entrances to the building. Now all the puny people who were dumbfounded to leave were trapped. Heather's face loomed over the entire building as she finally spoke. \"Hello puny bugs. Notice anything different about me?\" Their responses were irrelevant though the terrified squeaks forced the giantess to stifle her laughter. \"I'm sorry to have to say I'm done with this school. In fact, I'm done with being an ant like the rest of you. I'm off to bigger and better things. But before I do that, I want to play a game. For old time's sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In five minutes I'm going to stomp on the school. Just once though. I won't destroy the whole thing in one stomp. So at least half the school will be safe. The other half...Well you know how it goes. You have five minutes to pick a side of the school. If you're lucky, you won't get crushed.\" Heather giggled, \"Oh, and the five minutes started when I was explaining the game. You have four minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing all the little ones scurry was a lot of fun in itself. Though they were dreadfully predictable. Naturally everyone went for the entrances which Heather already blocked off with rubble. Then they went for the lesser known exits. It was a delight to let them get almost there before Heather used a single finger to completely collapse the room, sealing off another door. Three or four doors later there were no more exits and everyone ran everywhere. \"Run run little ants, you only have a minute left!\" Heather inhaled deeply and blew everyone off their feet. Flat on their backs everyone saw her rise to her full height and start to raise one flawless foot over the school. Their sky was now blocked by the filthy, white sole of her eager sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten seconds~\" Heather sang, beginning a countdown. \"And Three...Two...\" Many people thought they were clever by going the side opposite where Heather's foot hovered. They were idiots. In an instant Heather's foot switched sides. \"One!\" She stomped as hard as she could. So many students crushed underfoot like the bugs they were. Heather closed her eyes and imagined all the annoying people she hated. Mean, annoying teachers. That stupid principal Lindley. The violent punk Trish. All now stains on the bottoms of her sandals. She just wished she could see their remains on the bottom of her foot but there was no way to distinguish one crushed tiny from another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations to all you tinies who live to see another day!\" Heather smiled as if she didn't just crush a horde of people beneath her gigantic soles. \"I think you guys deserve a reward for that!</span></div></div>",

It took a few moments for Heather to double in height, much as it had with the first blast she'd given herself, but like before her growth was accelerating and in only seconds her height had doubled yet again. She stretched her body out on the ground, laying down so that her dwindling school was below her gorgeous face, propped up so that the entire visible horizon from the school would be occupied by a view many boys found mind blowing - her deep cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't care in the last about all the people who had died while she was laying down, or about the hundreds more dying as her body continued to stretch out - for her it was all about the little school as she decided how to crush the last of her tiny playthings and demonstrate once and for all her superiority over her school. After all, since she'd outgrown the school what purpose did it serve. To her it had only existed as a place for her to practice ruling people, and she no longer needed any practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came up with a fantastic idea as her growth slowed to a stop, she slid herself forward, raising her body up so that her breasts now hovered above the insignicant building, nearly touching the ground - the school directly under her nipple. She then began picturing all the things she'd do with her new power, how she was completely dominant over all life on this pitiful planet. As she knew it would, the thought of so much power turned her on and her nipples began to harden and grow more erect with her arousal, pushing out against her top until she was aroused enough that her nipples pressed into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the peons below she imagined their last site - a vast field of Heather's prodigious breast blocking out the entire sky, then a growing mountain descending on the school and pressing it flat. Destroying hundreds with just her nipples was a huge turn on. </span></div></div>",

It felt as though her clothes were becoming tighter, the creaking of fabric seams being stretched to and surpassing their limits filling her ears. Had she succeeded? Had she... grown? She looked around to see everyone, boys and girls alike staring at her with slack-jawed expressions. Heather occasionally shot her glances of jealousy and envy, not of fear. Edna didn't understand until she ran her petite hands over her now much curvier and feminine hips. She looked down, and immediately noticed she couldn't even see her feet past the massive swells of her new breasts, easily a full D if not larger, Edna was no good at cup sizes. She was still staring up at Heather, having had no increase in height. Edna quickly jotted down a mental note that although her breasts were so large, they didn't have the unfortunate side effect of feeling like sandbags on her chest. As a matter of fact, they felt weightless, lighter than air. She also noted that despite them being such a large size, they didn't make her lithe frame look grossly out of proportion. Edna thought for a moment. She might enjoy this. She could test it out for a day or two, and try to shrink Heather or grow into a giant another day, when the gun was fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Surely this is reversible...\" Edna murmured as she rubbed her new body, certain that a D cup size may be a bit excessive on her. \"I guess I could always aim again and hope for the best, second time's the charm, right?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Beside the shrinking woman her friends stared, too shocked to give a proper reaction. Even Ruth wore a troubled look on her face. But Edna\u2019s finger showed no signs of leaving the trigger any time soon; all she could think about was all the years of suffering she had to endure. A fire lit up in her eyes at the sight of Heather as she approached a couple inches in height. The bully started to scream as she stared at the immense feet of her shrinker; though the screams were little more than annoying squeaks at this point. It wasn\u2019t even a moment later Heather was the same size as Edna\u2019s toes. At this point Edna finally removed her finger from the trigger, with her biggest school enemy now less than an inch tall. The small click of the size ray switching off seemed to snap Heather\u2019s friends out of their stupor. They took off running in a panic; scared they were next to be shrunken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather seemed to agree with them and took off running herself, though at her size it didn\u2019t even take any effort for Edna to pluck the small girl from the ground and hold her in front of her face. \u201cI bet you never saw this coming huh?\u201d She grinned, \u201cAll those years of bullying finally came back to bite you.\u201d The genius demonstrated a bite for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Edna Ruth looked at her friend, \u201cYou sure this is okay Edna? I know you\u2019re smart and all but this seems sort of\u2026dangerous. She may be a bitch, but killing her isn\u2019t right.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna looked back without realizing Heather, \u201cAlready taken care of. The way my size ray is designed the molecules are compressed in accordance to the size so that whatever may happen-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnglish please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-Sorry. Basically, even though she\u2019s small. She\u2019s really durable. She could get run over by a truck and be fine. Besides\u2026\u201d Edna looked back to Heather, \u201cThe <i>last </i>thing I want to do is kill her. That\u2019s way too good for someone like you isn\u2019t that right Heather?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut me down please!\u201d Heather cried, legs flailing in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing!\u201d Edna happily agreed to the girl\u2019s request. Bending back over she placed her right on her left sandal between her big and second toes. \u201cNow I get to finish what I started\u2026\u201d Heather looked up, unsure of what Edna meant when she saw the familiar barrel of the size ray. Once more she felt herself get blasted, the beam precise enough to avoid hitting Edna or her sandal and only hitting Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had to put you on my sandal.\u201d Edna began to explain. \u201cAt the size I want you I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you from the dirt on the floor, so I needed you somewhere I could find you.\u201d Heather realized what she meant when she saw the light-blue coloring of Edna\u2019s sandal. It was light enough even a speck of dirt would be visible from a distance, or in this case, a speck-sized woman. She tried to scream for forgiveness but by the time she tried she was already too small to be heard. Edna only continued to smirk as the little girl began to vanish from sight. Soon all that could be seen was a speck, and she kept on shrinking that speck until finally she couldn\u2019t see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna released the trigger, \u201cOops, did I overdo it?\u201d She leaned forward and stared intensely between her toes. It was small, but there was definitely a speck lodged into the folds of her sandal. Heather was so small now\u2026Off the top of her head Edna guessed millimeters were over a dozen times her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genius girl stood back up and smiled, \u201cPerfect. You\u2019re finally what you\u2019ve been treating me like: nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all this excitement no one noticed the time flying, at that moment the bell signaling the first class of the day rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth nervously looked at Edna \u201cWe should get going for class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty!\u201d The girl nodded, like nothing had ever happened. Happily she began to walk to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic didn\u2019t even come close to describing Heather\u2019s feelings. Her size\u2026her entire world\u2026it was all gone. In its place was a new world where she was now powerless. Not even ten minutes ago she recalled stepping on a bug because it disgusted her, now <i>she </i>was the bug. No\u2026not even that, she wasn\u2019t even dirt. She was much, <i>much </i>too small for that. It all had happened so quickly it almost seemed like a dream. One second she was a regular person, the next the size of a bug, and now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was placed on a sandal. She knew that. She saw that. But this land looked like anything but a sandal. The ground was an uneven mass of small slopes too small for the typical eye to see. It had a softness to it, but it was firm enough not to give way to Heather\u2019s weight. In the distance was an arc that went up for miles into the air, the only landmark in the endless miles of blue around her. The air had this odd quality to it, that of leather and a hint of feet, but nothing more. But more than anything, what made Heather truly in awe was Edna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna\u2019s foot was easily the biggest thing Heather had ever seen. She couldn\u2019t even comprehend the sheer scale of what she was staring at. Edna\u2019s toe alone looked unfamiliar. It looked like a number of canyons lined up almost perfectly and rising up unbearably high. Heather remembered flying in a plane before, staring at the landscape below. It was so far away yet so massive you could see everything for miles away and realize how much of a speck you were. This was that times a billion. Because Heather realized she couldn\u2019t even see the entire toe, she could only see the bottom half of it because the top half was impossible to see. Each print line was a canyon someone could throw a couple states in it seemed like. Heather didn\u2019t even try to imagine how big Edna\u2019s entire foot was compared to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the piercing shriek that was the school bell. Its loud roar made both Heather\u2019s eardrums pop and caused her to wince. At that moment the colossus that was Edna took a single step forward. Gusts of wind that seemed like they could completely vaporize someone enveloped the shrunken girl but her body would not give way with its new durability and she felt herself sent flying back. Miles of the sandal terrain passed under her as everything went to darkness. Heather turned her head to see her new sky, the ball of Edna\u2019s foot. As the giantess\u2019 foot made contact with the ground it enveloped Heather into an infinite void of foot flesh the likes of which she had no hopes of escaping on her own. The girl was too small to be crushed, merely swallowed up in the heaps of skin. Everything went to black as Heather went deep into the folds of Edna\u2019s foot. It swallowed her as a ravenous monster, and finally the bully felt tears form on her eyes as she realized this was her new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, Edna ecstatically proceeded through her day fully aware that Heather was in a new world of hell just by being at her feet. Not once since that morning did Edna address the speck at her feet. She only reveled in the suffering she could sense radiating from the woman. The poor thing had no idea what Edna had in store for her later. She was tinkering with some ideas in her head at lunch. Normally this would be the chance to talk with Ruth but the girl was oddly quiet ever since the morning incident, which Edna couldn\u2019t blame her. She gently nibbled at a french fry, pondering what Heather was doing in lue of hunger right about now. It hadn\u2019t been long enough for Heather to be at risk of dying from hunger, but being that size who knows? Maybe she was so broken already she was eating anything she could find. The thought amused Edna as a possible way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Little Itty Bitty Slave Heather to Goddess Edna</i>. She smirked at the thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She took her time to make sure Heather suffered. With each slow footstep, she relished the thought of the microscopic bully looking up in terror at her titanic foot coming down upon her to only be squashed again and again against her flesh. It gave her a rush of power that she had never felt before. As she neared the exit to the parking lot down the hallway, her eye caught a glimpse of Heather's group of friends watching her from around a corner. When she turned to look at them, they flinched in fear.\"No one's going to ever believe you.\"Was all Edna said to them with a sweet smile just before she pushed the door open and hopped into her Mother's van awaiting her outside. Her words rang true, who would ever believe that innocent, small Edna would bring a gun to school? Especially one that shrank people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem...awfully chipper today, Edna.\"Laura said as they drove the short 20 minute ride home, noticing her daughter's wide eyes and cheerful humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I took care of Heather today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She won't be bullying me anymore!\"She said as she nonchalantly tapped her foot against the floor of the car, probably making the hell for Heather even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear honey! What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, y'know, I let her know I won't take her bull anymore...\"With that, she slammed her foot down a tad harder, trying to resist the urge to burst out laughing. <i>Oh yes, being a genius does have it's perks.</i> She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home, Edna rushed to her room as quickly as she could, slamming the door shut and locking it for good measure. Plopping herself down on the ground, she stretched out her legs and began to remove her flip-flops, already her plan in mind for the tiny woman she was about to torture...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course, Edna realised as she looked down as her now vacated flip-flop, there would be no fun in making Heather climb right now.  The bully was beneath human visibility; where could one find enjoyment if one couldn't find the victim?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, she took the blue footwear in hand, peering closer with narrowed eyes.  No good.  And if she couldn't see the girl, she couldn't even make her bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Edna wouldn't be a genius if she couldn't figure a way around such a problem!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, she placed the flip-flop back down and stepped back.  Out came the ray-gun and, with a few adjusted dials, she aimed it once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer flip-flop grew, eating up the space between them on the bedroom floor and overshadowing its partner quickly.  It was bigger than Edna's bed by the time she could make out a scurrying, insect-like creature on its pale blue surface.  The girl genius relaxed her finger on the trigger, and strode closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pungent stench of her own foot odour was all about her, but rather than becoming dismayed she smiled all the more, knowing that Heather must have suffered monstrously worse over the course of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna stopped with a foot either side of the miniscule humanoid, and folded her arms.  \"Hello again Heather,\" she said, \"long time no see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather, for her part, began to run again, but a single simple step put a stop to such nonsense.  The shrunken girl impacted against the side of Edna's foot, and the geek giggled as she realised that she felt nothing from the speck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough resistance, Heather.  You should have realised by now that there's no escape.  I am your world now, your only hope for salvation.  So long as you obey me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna crouched, bringing herself closer, all the better to enjoy Heather's plight.  \"Now, you seem to have rudely run into the side of my poor foot.  That hurts me personally, you little shit.  How about you climb up her and beg for my forgiveness, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather may have been screaming something in response, but no words could cross the barrier between the size scales.  Edna gave her an impatient look, and wriggled her toes a little for emphasis.  It took only a few moments more before the insect-girl approached her instep and began to ascend, no doubt sinking her tiny fingers into gaps between the skin cells.  The domestication of the bully was coming along marvellously!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather took a couple of minutes to scramble atop Edna's normally tiny foot, and from there looked upward, making what appeared to be a shrugging gesture, a 'what now' gesture.  How rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Edna had enjoyed watching the struggle.  It had been an empty revenge to have an invisible foe underfoot, and her superiority was much more obvious when she could witness the terror close hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ray enveloped Heather again, and the bully's squeals became aubible as she breached an inch in height, continuing to grow until she stood an impressive eleven and a half inches atop Edna's foot.  In disbelief, she began patting herself down, checking that she was intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she could see the dishevelled state of her former bully, Edna laughed loudly.  Drenched in dry sweat and toe-jam, her hair a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you're such a mess, little Barbie,\" she cooed.  \"Your lovely hair is such a mess.  Let me help you out with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather had barely become accustomed to her new size before Edna's thick fingers enwrapped her torso, lifting her effortlessly into space as the bigger girl swept her feet underneath her ass to sit comfortably.  \"What are you doing?\" she wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna cocked her head to one size.  \"I'm just helping make you all pretty again,\" she said.  \"We'll dry those tears and get you some clean make-up later, but for now let's see about that hair.  It's like a rat's nest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather screamed as she saw what Edna held in her other hand: an immense brush, thick bristles wrapped in tatters of ginger hair from the giant's own head.  She brought her fists down heavily on the fingers holding her, kicked out with her feet, but was powerless as Edna brought her to met the brush, raking across her scalp with those terrible bristles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall as she was, heather's hair was finer still, and she screamed and struggled all the more as her scalp was ripped raw, even Edna's stray ginger hairs coarse and repugnant as they escaped to cover her.  Edna squeezed her every time she tried to resist, the breath being forced cruelly from her body at the merest flex of those titanic fingers, her organs and bones clustering closer.  The slightest increase in pressure would squish or snap her precious internals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, perhaps we should dunk you in some shampoo, to help get those tangles out...\" Edna pondered, raising the living doll to her face.  The blonde hair had mainly been torn loose by her rough treatment, and the geek was looking forward to showing Heather her reflection at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there came a knocking at her door, and she snorted in annoyance.  She couldn't open it now, not with her giant flip-flop a clear giveaway.  She could get her ray-gun out again if she put the brush and Heather away in a drawer somewhere, and clean up her mess while she shooed away her visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edna!  Open up!\" came the voice of her brother, Ralph.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna pondered.  Perhaps she could share this secret with one other person.  As the queen of the school, icon of blonde, empty-headed feminine perfection, Heather was widely desired by the male population of the school, and by none more so than those - like Ralph - just crossing the border into puberty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather did not like the slasher smile creeping across Edna's billboard face.</span></div></div>",

She didn't want to share the Barbie sized girl with anyone. Sharing meant revealing too much and knowing Ralph the way she did, he would be far too tempted to steal her invention for his own use. Anyone would really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now she would hide Heather away until she could shoo her brother away. Enda walked over to her nightstand drawer and dropped the eleven and a half inch girl inside. Heather looked so pathetic it wasn't even funny... Okay, in Edna's mind it was very funny. She fixed the ''doll'' sized girl with a stern look, \"Make a sound and I'll make you microscopic again, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing for her life and not wanting to ever be that small again, Heather reluctantly nodded. This seemed to appease the geek as she gave her arch enemy a bright smile that did nothing to hide her malice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'm glad we understand each other.\" Enda then shut the drawer, sealing Heather in darkness. Edna then turned her attention to the giant flip-flop in the center of her room before another knock sounded. \"Alright! Alright! Just give me a second will ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe geek girl pulled out her size-ray and adjusted the setting. She took aim and watch as the large footwear began to dwindle down in size. It didn't take long for her floor to be revealed once again as the flip-flop returned to it's normal size to match it's partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot stench still saturated the air but that wasn't really a cause for suspicion. Pleased with her work, Enda pocketed her invention and unlocked her door. On the other size was her little brother Ralph with his arms crossed looking at her with mild annoyance written all over his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you so long?\" He asked. \"You weren't tinker again were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe geek girl huffed. She didn't owe him an explanation, but the lack of an answer would only grab his full attention. \"Yeah. Tinkering is sort of my hobby, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside the drawer, Heather could just barely make out the voices of the giants in the darkness. It sounded like Edna was talking to someone. Most likely a family member or her equally or her equally geeky friend, Ruth. She mentally begged for it not to be Ruth. One giant geek with an exe to grind was already bad enough. Two meant certain death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez!\" Ralph winced as he clamped his nostril shut. \"Your room stinks! What are you making in there, stink bombs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe?\" Edna lied. She needed to change the subject. \"Anyway. What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom said we're ordering a pizza tonight. She just wanted to know what kind of topping you wanted.\" Ralph answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPizza? That sounded pretty good actually. \"Pepperoni and mushrooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Mushrooms. Hawaiian is the way to go Ed. Anyway, I'll let mom know. See ya.\" Ralph finished as Edna watched her little brother disappear around the corner. With that distraction out the way, the vengeful nerd returned to her lair and locked the door. She still had plans for the tiny girl in her drawer, and she was going to have pizza later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was coming up, Edna.</span></div></div>",

The geek that had served as her punching bag for years had finally developed a backbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the little nerd had turned fiction into reality and created some sort of shrink ray. The idea was ludicrous, and yet her current situation couldn't be ignored. Edna \"Geek Girl\" McCoy had shrunk her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she'd made her microscopic, invisible to the human eye. The sheer terror she experienced was on a completely different level. The ginger's flip flop was like an endless desert, it was all so surreal. Then there was Edna herself, a true blue giantess in ever sense of the word. Her foot alone was leagues above, and Heather would know considering how intimate she'd gotten with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was too small to be crushed, which meant she had to endure being buried under miles off foot flesh. Constantly forced to endure the stick and sweaty skin, and the constant rise and fall. Not to mention the smell. Heather would never forget the pungent scent of Edna's foot for as long as she lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torture didn't stop there however. Until the school day's end until she got home, Enda made sure to nearly shake Heather's new world apart by stomping her foot extra hard. The shrunken girl knew for a fact the redhead did this just to add insult to injury. It was almost hard to believe this was the same girl she took pleasure in bulling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she did get home however, there was no rest. Heather tried to run away after Edna used the ray on her again, but was stopped by the Titaness's colossal foot. Heather couldn't believe how insignificant she was. She couldn't even measure up to the geek's toes. She was then talked down to and forced to climb like some sort of bug. It was all just to humiliating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather knew Edna was enjoying ever second of it too. After the humiliating climb the nerd had finally grown her back a little. She was no longer a bug, instead she was now a Barbie. A Barbie being hoisted up against her will and treated like a toy. She was a human being goddamn it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna clearly didn't think so as she squeezed the life out of her and savagely brushed her scalp raw with her tainted hairbrush. Edna McCoy was a damn sadist and she was reveling in her suffering. Heather couldn't take it. She wanted this nightmare to be over. And why wasn't anyone breaking the geeks door down to rescue her!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends saw what she did. There were witnesses all around them in the hall, weren't there? So Why? Why wasn't anyone here to save her? Where were the police? Her parents? Her friends? Was anyone even trying? Did anyone even care?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot tears began to trickle down the former bullies face as she sat in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was all alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally.\" Ralph whined. Lockpicking Edna's doorknob took longer than expected. Oh well, at least now he'd be able to get his hands on those stink-bombs she was working on. There a few people he could think of that deserved a little payback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he turned the knob and cracked open the door. The room was pitch black, save for the lava lamb she had plugged up. He never understood why Edna kept that old thing. It was the only thing their dad ever gave her that she kept. Everything else she either threw out or sold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting his thoughts on that aside, he poked his head in and found his sister wrapped up in a blanket burrito, snoring. He smiled brightly. Edna was out cold. Feeling confident Ralph completely entered the space. He moved in close to Edna to see she had her earplugs in. He was in the clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his hands together, Ralph began his search. \"Alright stink-bombs... Where are you hiding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the first he'd snuck into Edna's room. The first time he did was to \"Borrow\" something and nearly got caught. The second time he was more prepared, but not for what lied within her drawers. Needless to say, he didn't sleep that night. Eventually came to learn Edna's lab was in her closet. The very same closet he was invading right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing aside hanging clothes he came across a small desk with boxes underneath. Normally the desk would be filled with nails or scraps of metal, but this time it wasn't. Instead there was this weird gun sitting there. It honestly looked like something out of one of his comic books. Not thinking twice about it pocketed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Edna won't miss this, right?\" Ralph asked himself. Her inventions normally backfired anyway. He continued to look around the closet for a little while longer before growing bored. Eventually he left the lab and re-entered the bedroom. Edna was still out. Ralph figured he might as well search her nightstands. After all there was no way he was going in her main drawers again. He shuddered. Anyone but Edna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on stink bombs, please be here.\" He whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first drawer had nothing in save for a few notebooks and a strange box. Ralph ignored the books and instead focused on the box. Was this where his big sis was hiding the goods? Gulping nervously, he opened the box and immediately slammed it shut. His face had turned a few shades red before he returned it to the drawer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna need therapy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far there were no stink-bombs to be found. Maybe Edna really was just pulling his leg? Then that meant this was all just a huge waste of time. Crap! He then strode over to the other nightstand and prayed there was nothing else... unmentionable in there. Ralph took a deep breath... and opened the drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw was nothing. Just a doll. Disappointment was clear on his face. There were no stink bombs. Just a whole lot of nothing. Not even thinking twice about it he picked up the doll, only to hear it yelp. \"Jeez. To think Edna still plays with dolls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a doll!\" The Barbie shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph's eyes widened and his jaw hung open. Did this toy just yell at him!? \"Y-you talk!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot fulling understanding what was happening at the moment, Heather spoke. \"Yes I talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph couldn't process what was happening. All he did know was that a toy was talking to him. Without warning Heather found herself gripped tight by two hands as Ralph raced out of Edna's room and back into his own. He slammed the door shut and placed the doll down on his desk. He quickly flipped on the lamp and stared down at the shrunken person on his table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Talk!\" </span></div></div>",

She'd been venting to Edna's little brother for almost an hour about her current predicament. Needless to say the boy was shocked beyond all belief, if he wasn't looking Heather dead in the eyes right now he'd call her a liar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't lying, that he knew for certain. The gun he was currently fumbling with in his hands had done this to Heather. It turned her from a tall school beauty into little girl's Barbie. It should've been impossible, and yet it was real. What other explanation could there have been?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!? Hey!?\" Heather called, breaking the stunned boy out of his stupor. \"Are you still listening to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah! I hear ya.\" Ralph stuttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather sighed. \"You have to help me! Use that gun to turn me back to normal before that damn sadist wakes up and notices I'm missing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no secret she was desperate. The last thing she wanted was for Enda to find her in such a vulnerable state. Right now her only hope lied in the hands of her arch enemy's brother, her flesh and blood. How ironic was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" Heather begged when she saw his hesitance. \"No one else will help me! No one else even cares! You're all I've got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph still looked hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she can do this to me then imagine what she'll do to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-me?\" Ralph asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you!\" Heather said. \"She'll go after anyone that's done her wrong. You're her brother, surely you've done something to get on her bad side. It's only a matter of time until she does the same thing to you or worse! But if we work together then we can stop her. By helping me you help yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph was really conflicted now. If what Heather said was true then there was no question that Edna would eventually come for him. He shuddered when he thought about all the pranks he'd pulled on her and all the embarrassing secrets he told his friends at school. Not to mention the occasional jabs he would throw her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it would be a good idea to grow Heather back to normal and have an ally by his side. He could strike before Edna got any ideas and have the company of a beautiful lady. Assuming everything worked out. But what if it didn't? What if Edna had something even more dangerous locked away somewhere?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps he should just give Edna back the gun and turn Heather over. That would definitely get him on his big sis's good side, right? But what if it didn't and she turned against him anyway because he knew too much? That wouldn't be very good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it, what should he do? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was no way he'd ever let Edna subject him to such terror. He'd get her first and have a little insurance in the form of her hot and sexy arch enemy. \"Alight, I'll do it. I'll grow you back and we'll get Ed to together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather could hardly believe her ears. Edna's little brother was going to help her?

He wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, but he could definitely work Edna's little ray gun. Thankfully it seemed the ginger girl made her toy user friendly. Big mistake on her part. After a few tweaks it was ready to go. \"Now hold still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph took aim and fired. He watched in jaw-dropping fascination as Heather's body rapidly began to expand right before his very eyes. If he could compare this moment to anything it would be like watching Giganta grow on Justice League. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather felt a tingle run through her body as she continued to expand. Everything around her began to dwindle in size back to it's original state. In mere seconds the ray's effects wore off and she was back to her normal height. Looking over herself she could hardly believe it... She was her old 6'3\" self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Was all Ralph could say. Heather was kind of cute mini, now that she was back to her towering self, the pre-teen could really take in her full beauty. None of the girls at his school could measure up, literally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis little outburst broke Heather from her trance and she stared down at her savior. She hopped off the desk and in a moment completely out of character for herself, gave the boy a bone-crunching bearhug. He was officially her favorite person right now. \"Thank you! You made a wise decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the blonde's ample bust pressing into him, Ralph couldn't help but agree. \"N-no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the idol broke off the hug and smiled down at the boy. Oh to be the tallest once again. She could now make that little shit Edna pay for her sins. First things first though. She extended her hand. \"The gun please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph complied and handed it over. \"Here you go. So what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\" Heather smiled evilly. \"Now we take the geek down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph nodded and the pair made their way back to Edna's room. They were extra careful to not wake up Laura and took even greater care not to wake up the geek... yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather held the gun close and couldn't stop the vicious grin that threatened to split her face. In front of her sleeping like a baby was none other than her former tormentor. Thinking back to how she made her microscopic and stepped on her, how she turned her into a Barbie and tortured her, how she threatened her, it made Heather's blood boil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph sensing the blonde's anger took a few steps back. \"Sooo? What's the plan?\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake her.\" Heather growled/ordered. \"Give her a nice hard slap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ralph said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slap her.\" Heather repeated. \"Think of it as a preemptive strike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph understood and snuck in close. He braced himself as he looked down at his sister's sleeping form. He raised his arm high... and delivered a hard slap across the face. The reaction was instantaneous as Edna shot up and Ralph cowered behind Heather who stood her ground with a satisfied smirk. That was one hell of a slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! What the hell!?\" Edna cried as she nursed her stinging cheek. It would seem Ralph's hand left a mark. The geek frantically scanned around her room until her eyes settled on her arch-enemy. \"Heather?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow? She was supposed to be mini. Was she dreaming right now? Looking closer she saw something that made her heart sink. The size-ray? How?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she noticed the little shit cowering behind her. \"Ralph?\" She growled. Said boy was shaking now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I wouldn't worry about him Edna.\" Heather stated as she took aim. \"Worry about yourself.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Edna McCoy was genius, there was no denying that indisputable fact. She built a freaking size-ray for crying out loud and turned science fiction into science reality. With it she could do almost anything, change the world, become rich and famous... Get a little payback. That's what inspired her to build the size-ray in the first place... Revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a simple plan, target Heather and get even. At first that's what happened to. Her plan had gone off without a hitch and she had her shrunken school bully all to herself. She'd planned out everything and had them all lined up from A-Z. Or so she though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was variable that she hadn't taken into account. One person she hadn't thought. One thing she failed to calculate. Her little brother Ralph finding and aiding her arch enemy. Now because of this oversight, Heather was back to normal and now she was staring down the business end of her own gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was little she could do except cower in fear as Heather pulled the trigger. Within seconds her room towered over her like the skyscrapers of New York City and she was left helpless in the face of the spawn of the devil and her treacherous sidekick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph had officially made it to number two on her shit list... Not that it really mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Heather was finished she blew against the barrel of the size-ray. Her and her new bestie started down at the bed to see the great Edna McCoy reduced to a pathetic 3 inches tall. \"How's this for Karma geek?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph could hardly believe what he just saw. He was new to this whole size business and watching someone grow was a far cry from watching someone shrink. His 4'9\" sister was shrunk to a miniscule 3 inches. He had green army men taller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just sat there stunned as Heather walked over to the bed and scooped up the 3 inch girl in her hand. \"How's it feel to be small now Edna? How's it feel to be back under my thumb where you belong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather! You fix me right now!\" Edna shouted, although she sounded more akin to a chipmunk at her size. That got a laugh of the blonde and even the Ralph found himself giggling. His laughter however earned him a nasty glare from the diminished geek girl. \"What are you laughing at you damn traitor!? The second I get big I'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll what?\" Heather swiftly cut off. \"You're in no position to threaten him, much less anyone. He did what he had to do and that's survive. He got you before you got him, and you're a fool for not taking him out when you the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna cursed. As much as she hated to admit it, Heather was right. She should've taken Ralph out when she had the chance. He might've been her brother but he was still someone who wronged her in the past. She should've made him a prime target, so how one earth did he slip under her radar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Edna. But it was either you or me.\" Ralph explained. It was just like his father told him once before the divorce, survival of the fittest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna was seething.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what to do with you?\" Heather teased. \"Before this whole size business, I never knew you had such a sadistic streak Edna. The things you did to me. Do you remember? I sure do. I might've been a bully to you, but I never once took things this far. You... ? And people call me evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do to her?\" Ralph asked. Despite everything Edna was still his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno.\" Heather shrugged. \"I told you everything she did to me. What do you think I should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph felt a shiver run down his spine when she asked that. She sounded so hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aside from an uncomfortable feeling coming off of Ruth lunch went by like it always did, Edna was too lost in her gleeful thoughts to realize anything was amiss though. These thoughts wouldn't last much longer though, the final class of the day was coming up and Edna was so lost in her vengeance against Heather she forgot to dread it. But once that lunch bell rang it came back to her: Calculus. Now, Edna was extremely smart, smart enough to end up in a top level math course at her age, so the work wasn't anything more than just an annoyance. The teacher however was a different story. The former Misses Emily Henderson, a towering six-foot high brunette who, while admittedly attractive in an adult way, was a straight up bitch. Edna heard stories dating back to when she first started High School about Ms. Henderson, how mean and uncaring she could be. Even her husband couldn't escape this demeanor, which would explain why they ultimately divorced. And of course Edna was just lucky enough to get Ms. Henderson the year of said divorce, and all the stories she had heard was blown away with a much meaner, hurt woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna was the youngest in her class, being something of a math whiz and Ms. Henderson seemed to almost take this as a challenge. Anytime there was a question it was Edna who had to answer it. Anytime someone needed to be tutored, she had Edna do it. Anytime there was an especially difficult quiz, it was obviously Ms. Henderson trying to outsmart Edna. As far as teachers went by it was pretty immature, but that did nothing to stop the general disdain felt towards Edna as a result. She became something of a class know-it-all, despite not actually trying to do anything. And the overly difficult quizzes and tests were blamed as much on Edna as the teacher. It was pretty much the epitome of hell inside a classroom. As this all came back to mind Edna felt a momentary dread, but it quickly fizzled away as she remembered the microbe struggling beneath her soles.<i> I think today won't be so bad. </i> The young genius smirked to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later Edna was seated in her desk, right at the front row fazing Ms. Henderson. As always the teacher seemed to tower over her as a giant. Wearing a rather tight-fitting gray skirt with pantyhose, heels, a matching dress-shirt and long, flowing dark brown hair knit tightly into a bun the teacher seemed like something straight out of a fantasy, especially with her notable D's. Edna looked up to her teacher with an innocent greeting smile, receiving a monotone scowl in response. <i>She won't be towering over me for long. </i>Edna was gleefully counting down the time til class ended. After a brief minute the class bell rang and Ms. Henderson promptly shut the door to  begin her lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today...We shall be reviewing some Trigonometry in preparation for our lesson next class.\" She began, slowly walking towards her chalkboard which was covered by a picture pulled down. On the way Ms. Henderson grasped a teaching stick while her class breathed a sigh of relief. Reviewing meant it wouldn't be too difficult....Then the picture was lifted to reveal the horror beneath. To put it simply...what was on the board didn't seem to resemble anything remotely indicative of math, or in fact English. There were...three variables, two greek letters, and some angle numbers written but to ask anyone what it meant was bordering the impossible. In fact there was a chance some of this wasn't even a part of the question but rather something later on, not that anyone could tell. Anyone of course, except Edna. Ms. Henderson slammed her teaching stick in her hand, glaring right at Edna. \"Solve the problem. You have two minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna went right to work plugging in the numbers, accounting for mew and theta, the variables and so on. When she got her answer there was still a minute to be had. Naturally her fellow students didn't fare so well, some got the answer, some gave up right away, and most of them were just confused. But a minute later Ms. Henderson's teaching stick clanked into her hand again, \"Pencils down.\" She took a step towards Edna, \"Miss McCoy, would you be willing to be provide for us an answer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Out came a long series of numbers and variables that seemed to come straight out of nowhere, baffling several people in the room. Ms. Henderson frowned, \"Correct.\" Before Edna could gain any sort of smugness though the teacher continued, \"Since you all seem to be well acquainted with the material I think it's safe for us to take a quiz then. Books down and paper only.\" Edna shriveled into her chair as she felt the piercing gazes of her class eyeing her from behind. To help relax herself she rubbed her foot against a barely noticeable speck in her sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was just the beginning, and before long it only got worse. After an impossibly hard quiz that even Edna barely handled the class went on to the lesson meant for tomorrow because they were \"so prepared\". At this point Edna debated on shrinking her teacher right there, but decided against it. If too many people saw her shrinking people things could get out of hand. She would just have to wait. The class went by mostly with notes after that,  but the general misery of the room was very obvious. Occasionally Ms. Henderson walked to a desk and slammed her teaching stick onto it to wake up a sleeping student, other times she would call out Edna.  By the time the bell finally rang even Edna was happy it finally did. As the room cleared out Edna casually walked over to her teacher at her desk, \"Ms. Henderson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Miss McCoy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had something I wanted to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the teacher could brush off the gesture Edna pulled out her size ray. Immediately the teacher recoiled as if it were an actual gun, then calmed down. \"Oh, just a toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong on both accounts.\" Edna smiled as she pulled the trigger. Much like Heather, Ms. Henderson quickly began to shrink in size right in her very chair. In no time the six-foot beauty in heels was Edna's height, by this point she stood up to question Edna as to what was happening. Before she even stood up all the way her eyes met with the younger woman's bosom. Ms. Henderson had to look up to Edna's face as the girl slowly grew more titanic. \"You were always so tall so I think I'll leave you a little taller than my first pet.\" The girl giggled as Ms. Henderson, frozen with shock, approached shoe-level. Finally Edna released the trigger of her device as Ms. Henderson was now only a couple inches high. The teacher fell flat on her bum when Edna bent over and plucked the woman up with no effort. In the girl's palm Ms. Henderson stared up the face of an immense Edna. The young genius grinned as she clenched her fist, \"I'll have a lot of fun with you later but for now I have to run before I miss the bus.\" Before any more could be said Ms. Henderson felt a hurricane of wind against her face as she suddenly entered a dark cave. Overhead was a thin veil of light that revealed the cave had a notable curve to the wall. Still in shock over everything she silently figured out where she was before being pushed deep into a rough fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you don't mind I when I sit down.\" Edna laughed as she patted her butt pocket. Having enough for now Edna ran for her bus, eager to toy with her two new pets.</span></div></div>",

The redheaded genius casually walked towards the door that lead to the bus parking lot, her ride home waiting for her. She made to smash down with her foot a bit harder with every step, smashing Heather into her bare foot, and swayed her hips a little more, sending her horrid teacher face first into her butt cheek. All in all, she felt good. She felt <i>powerful.</i> Never before had she felt such things. Edna had always been the smallest, been the weakest, been the most ignored or bullied girl. Now, things were different. She had a weapon that would turn the tide for any conflict she faced, and her act of vengeance was not over yet. There was still so many that needed to suffer by her hands, but for now, she was simply content with toying with the two tiny slaves she held with her right now. Edna opened the door, only for a hand to slam it shut in her face. She whirred around in anger, only to face Ruthie's buxom chest, looking up at her friend curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Ruth?\"Edna asked casually, her anger replaced with a bit of happiness at the sight of her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie eyed her friend warily, choosing her reply carefully.\"Edna...you know what's up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small girl gave a grin of innocence.\"Whatever could you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHRINKING people, Edna?! I didn't even know it was physically possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is. I just proved it.\"Edna laughed.\"All it took was a little thought and a bit of radioactive materials...the hard part was concentrating the beam to minimize cells without destroying them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care HOW you did it! I care that you did it at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna shook her head.\"Tcht tcht, Ruthie. I thought you were much more openminded than this? Imagine what I could do with my new size ray! After some...personal uses, the entire planet could benefit from it! Food could be enlarged to end world hunger, natural disasters could be shrunken down to pathetic little waterdrops before even hitting a city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Personal uses.\"Ruthie mimed one of Edna's questionable words in that sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead shrugged in reply.\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You mean hurting people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurting the ones that hurt me first.\"She was so nonchalant in her voice, it scared Ruthie at how cruel her friend could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruthie...I've always worried about you...but this is taking it too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking it too far would be enlarging myself to a titanic stature and declaring myself 'Goddess of the Planet' or something.\"Edna cackled a bit at the end, but a glint in her eye frightened Ruthie even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edna...give me the gun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cocked her head to the side at her pink-haired friends words.\"What was that, Ruthie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change Heather back to normal...and whoever else you shrank...and give me the gun. It needs to be destroyed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruthie...you know I can't do that.\"She said calmly, but a hint of anger at the end of her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not giving you a choice, Edna.\"Ruthie stepped closer to her friend, her much larger form towering over the 4'9 girl. Edna looked up into Ruthie's eyes, and saw fear. Ruthie could only see something soulless in Edna's. Before a move could even be made, Edna had whipped out the size gun from its safespot in her bookbag, aiming it directly at her best friend, and pulling the trigger. In a matter of moments, Ruthie was eye level with Edna, but steadily growing smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Ruthie, it had to be done.\"Edna said as her friend became waist high, looking up at the giant girl with shock in her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow small does Edna shrink Ruthie?</span></div></div>",

Ruthie wanted to stop her, make her surrender both the gun and her revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike hell she would just hand over her magnum opus and end things here. She owed Heather big time for years of abuse and Ms. Henderson for just being an all around bitch. No one would stand in the way of her revenge... Not even Ruthie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Edna held the trigger and watched her friend dwindle down towards her sandal, she finally released her finger from the trigger. If she hazard to guess, Ruthie must be about the same height as Ms. Henderson right now. That was just fine. She wouldn't reduce her to microbe like Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile down below, Ruth was in a panic. Edna had actually shrunk her. Her! Weren't the two of them supposed to be best friends? How could she do this to her? Couldn't Edna see she was just trying to help her before she took things too far? There was an evil growing inside Edna, Ruth could see it when she looked into her eyes. She could already shrink a person and be casual about it, how long before she crossed the point of no return?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edna?\" Ruth cried as she looked up to her titan of a best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid titan shook her head. \"Sorry Ruthie. Like I said, it had to be done. I can't let you try to stop me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said the geek girl placed her gun back into the safe spot of her bag and reached down to pluck her miniature bestie. Just like with Ms. Henderson and Heather respectively, it wasn't even a challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth felt nervous being plucked from the ground and placed into her friend's palm. Edna was just so big and could crush her at any time she wished. Knowing that fact frightened her. Was this the kind of terror Heather experienced and was probably still experiencing right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the school idol wasn't dead already she most likely wished she was. Ruth couldn't help but pity the girl knowing while her best friend stood stationary she was being buried under what must seem like endless miles of foot flesh. Oh god. \"Edna, please-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough Ruthie.\" The geek interrupted. \"I don't have time to deal with you at the moment. I have a bus to catch. We'll talk about this later.\" Without warning, Enda pealed back the front of her shirt and dropped her dumped her diminished friend between her bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth screamed as she fell from Edna's palm and in between the pale twin mountains that the redhead's cleavage. The fall wasn't at all painful, but the descent further down was horrifying. \"Edna!? Edna!?\" Ruthie cried. The light faded and on the outside the girl genius gave her chest a light pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that business out of the way it was time to head home. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only was Heather not shrinking to the size of a bug, she was now growing to gargantuan proportions. At first Heather was surprised by what was going on, but she quickly started to enjoy the feeling of growth. Her clothes were growing along with her body, but they were doing so at a much slower rate, and so she could feel them beginning to get tighter and more revealing around her expanding form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Heather finally stopped growing, she looked around at all the pathetic tiny losers scrambling at her feet and laughed. She then picked out a particular midget from the crowd and plucked her off the ground. Edna had been quickly trying to reset her size ray so that she could shrink Heather back down to size, but before she could do anything her body was being lifted off the ground by two massive fingers. Heather's thumb and index finger had Edna's arms pinned to hers sides, so she was unable to continue adjusting her ray. Edna couldn't believe that her plan had backfired so spectacularly. She had planned everything out so carefully! How could something like this have happened?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So loser,<i> this </i>was your plan for revenge? Turning me into the most powerful human being on the planet? You <i>do</i> realize what you've just done, right? I already ruled this school, and you've just given me the power to do anything that I want to the rest of the world as well! I'm going to be a fucking goddess now, and it's all thanks to you!\" Heather said, laughing at the helpless nerd she was dangling in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you think, bitch...\" Edna mumbled under her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then squirmed one of her arms free from Heather's iron grip and aimed the size ray at her once again. She was just about to pull the trigger and turn everything back to how it should have been, but Heather saw her holding the gun and quickly snatched it out of her hand. Edna simply stared in horror as her last hope was wrenched from her fingers in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's this? A present? For me? Why Edna, you shouldn't have. Well, if this little toy was able to make me this big, then I'm sure it'll be useful for something in the future. I think that I'll just hang on to it for now.\" Heather said teasingly as she placed the gun into her pocket for safe keeping. \"Now, the only question left is what should I do now. I could always have some fun playing with my favorite little punching bag, but you're so small compared to me that I'd probably end up breaking you on accident. Maybe I should go out into town and introduce the world to its new goddess. Of course, it could be fun to use <i>my</i> new size ray to have some of my friends join me at this size. We could be the world's sexiest and most powerful army! Hmmm, so many choices...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of thinking, Heather decides to...</span></div></div>",

She then took a long look at Edna, still trapped between her fingers whimpering like the pathetic bug she had been reduced to. \"I could use a snack before I go though\", decided Heather. She raised the terrified loser who had thought she could best her above her mouth, looking her in the eyes with an evil look on her face. \"Bye Edna\", Heather simply said before dropping the screaming geek girl into her open mouth and swallowing. She felt Edna slide down her massive throat into the oblivion of her waiting stomach and laughed. There was no one on earth who could stop her now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a satisfied burp from her quickly digesting meal, Heather looked around the remains of the school she had destroyed with her sudden growth spurt, looking for stragglers. She saw her group of friends nearby looking up at her with a mix of fear, awe, and anticipation. If they were hoping to be elevated to Heather's level, they would be sorely disappointed. Heather didn't need anyone anymore. With a quick move of her foot, Heather crushed her former friends into paste. She then began making her way through the neighborhood surrounding her school, effortlessly destroying everything and everyone in her path. It felt good to be powerful. \"Look out world!\", she shouted, the force of her voice breaking windows and toppling power lines. \"You can't hide from me!\"</span></div></div>",

That was something everyone else present wanted to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna began to panic as she saw what was happening. Patsy Smith was growing right before her very eyes! How was that possible!? She had the damn ray set to shrink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edna!? What's going on!?\" Ruth asked hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-This wasn't s-supposed to happen!\" Edna stuttered. Where had she gone wrong? This didn't happen in the beta test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback-The night before)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna's little brother Ralph had snuck into her room late at night to retrieve the soccer ball she had confiscated from him earlier. Her reason being that him kicking it against the side of the house was distracting her from her work. What that work was she wouldn't disclose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph didn't care either way, he would get his ball back from her. He carefully made his way around his older sister's room, making doubly sure not to step on the discarded bags of junk food. For such a smart girl his sister really was a slob at times. Then again most geniuses were slobs, weren't they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRalph began to riffle through Edna's dresser and nightstand for his ball. He even froze up once or twice when he heard her mumble in her sleep. Something about cutting a rude bitch down to size and making her pay. That only reassured his belief that women were scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes of searching, Ralph decided to check the closet. He slowly eased the door open and dimmed the light inside. There he found his ball leaned against a small folding table. \"There you are.\" He smiled. Mission complete. He was just about to make his great escape until he took notice of what was actually on the folding table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe it. Where did Edna get a gun? He cautiously took the device in hand and began to relax. This wasn't a real gun. It was just one of his sister dumb inventions. He didn't even know why she still bothered to tinker in her spare time? None of these things ever worked. At worse they blew up in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soccer boy chuckled before carelessly waving the device around like a hero in one his favorite action movies. He aimed it at his soccer ball before reciting his favorite movie quote. \"Hasta la vista baby.\" He pulled the trigger and much to his shock and horror... A laser fired from the barrel. He fell flat on his ass as his soccer ball shrunk to the size of a marble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so stunned he didn't even realize he dropped the size-ray. Instead he opted to focus on his ruined soccer ball. It was so tiny. One of Edna's crazy inventions actually worked! Oh god! He needed to leave. He needed to get out of here before she woke up! Fear filled his very soul as he quickly turned around and placed the ray back where he found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely unaware of the internal damage he caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed his marble sized ball in his shorts pocket and bolted out of Edna's room as quickly as he could, thanking his lucky stars that she slept like a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Flashback End-Present Time)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edna!\" Ruth screamed as multiple students walking the halls began to scramble away from the rapidly growing teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatsy couldn't process what was happening. The world around her was beginning to shrink away. Everyone was getting smaller and smaller. This was just like that comic she was reading in class one day. Then it all finally clicked. The world wasn't shrinking... She was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy...\" Heather said in awe. Patsy just kept on climbing in height. She then turned her attention to the nerd who was causing all this to happen. She then took note of the ray in her hands. Without a second thought she bum rushed the girl and knocked her flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edna!\" Ruth cried before running to her friend's aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather smirked before scooping up the size-ray. \"I'll be keeping this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceiling of the school began to give way as Patsy's head had finally broken through to the next level. The school started falling apart at the seams as Heather's fallower grew. Ruth had finally pulled Edna to her feet and the two watched in horror as one of her tormentors ascended higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth took off the other way down the hall as the school fell apart around them. Once outside they watched as Patsy's grown reduced their place of learning to nothing but rubble. It was shocking. What was more horrifying was the knowledge that anyone who didn't get out in time was most likely flattened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey craned their necks upward to see Patsy growth had finally stopped. The woman was huge. Edna hazard to guess she could probably fit into the palm of the taller girl's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Patsy finally regained her bearings she looked all around her to see what she'd become. She was a honest to god giant! It was as if someone had brought a science fiction movie to life. This was all too weird. All around her were the remains of her former school and the lucky few who had survived her little growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatsy was in awe of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was... Awesome!</span></div></div>",

Edna gasped in surprise, as it had covered a larger radius than she had expected. With what appeared to be a puff of smoke, Heather and her group of four cackling bitches disappeared with no trace. Edna scanned the floor carefully, finally spotting the minuscule group of inch tall teens. Edna knew they would get smaller, but she wanted to get to them before the got too small to keep track of. She quickly collected the squealing group of five, now rapidly diminishing to the one centimeter mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Put me down, you BITCH!\" Heather cried in defiance as she pathetically slammed her fists into the thick skin of Edna's thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nope.\" Edna replied dispassionately, placing her comparatively enormous fingertip on top of Heather's head and pushing her backwards. When she withdrew her finger, Heather and her friends had reached one half of a centimeter. Any screams they had diminished to something that not even the most gifted of hearing could distinguish. \"Before you get any smaller Heather, I think I may as well put you and your friends somewhere for safekeeping.\" She put a finger to her lips. \"As a matter of fact, I know the <i> perfect </i> place for you.\" Edna flashed a grin that would put the Grinch to shame. She unbuttoned her jeans and pulled the waistband of her cute panties away from her hips, giving the girls a good view of the dark chasm below. \"Since you all love acting like such cunts, I think you'll feel right at home in here...\" Edna tipped her hand, sending Heather and her band of bitches flailing through the air. A few of them impacted cotton, not even making a dent in the fabric. Heather herself and one other girl had the misfortune of slamming headfirst into Edna's pubic mound. Drool seeped from the corner of Heather's mouth as she hit cotton. Her clique's overlapping worried voices pierced her ears in the worst of ways. She pushed herself onto her knees, still dizzy and disoriented. Heather looked up towards the sky, towards the light, to see Edna's grinning visage what seemed to be miles above them all. They had, unfortunately, reached their current desired height of two millimeters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please!

No luck, another sliver of light was gone. \"I'm sorry, Edna, please!\" Another. \"Please Edna, no...\" Another. \"Please...\" Heather was close to sobbing now. With that final plea, they were all encased in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Edna smiled contently, a new spring in her step.

You keep on insulting and pushing her and now look what just happened!\" The brunette said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's side are you on again?!\" Heather asked not to nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I'm just scared to death here and I feel like we could be in here for the rest of our lives!\" The brunette said in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't gonna let that bitch keep us down here.

Edna's panties proved to be the perfect prison. It was as if Heather and her clique had been locked up in Alcatraz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just give it a rest already?\" One of Heather's groupies asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather regarded them with cold eyes \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way out.\" The brunette said. \"And even if we did get out can we even grow back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave Heather pause. She hadn't really thought about that. If they did all escape could they grow back? And another thing, how were they even going to survive the outside world at their height? Let alone operate the gun? Then their was the geek girl. How were they going to get past her? She'd kill them with just her pinky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat realization scared Heather more than she'd care to admit. Even still, she couldn't just give up. \"We will escape and we will get big again. And when we do, we're going to make that ginger bitch pay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say.\" Another groupie said as they took off their shirt. \"Damn it's hot in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. It's like a sauna in here!\" the brunette agreed. She'd long since opened her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\" Heather whispered as she wiped the sweat from her brow. Her friends weren't wrong. Behind them, Edna's enormous womanhood was generating heat like the sun. Not to mention it was making the place moist with sweat. Heather tried not to think to much about it as she didn't want to puke. All that mattered now was freedom. \"Alright. We all know we can't stay here so... I'm open to suggestions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know? Can we rip the fabric?\" One asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tried it. Didn't work. Any of you have a knife?\" No one answered. \"Didn't think so. Any other ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could try to bite her.\" Another suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think she'll feel that.\" The brunette said flatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could try lighting her pubes on fire.\" A groupie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather looked at him as if he was stupid. \"News flash... We'll burn to death. God your an idiot.\" Heather sighed. \"What I wouldn't give for a smoke right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you telling? Patsy always buys the best brand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patsy! That's it!\" Heather cheered as she dug into her pocket. Her grin almost threatened to split her face when she pulled out her cellphone. \"We'll call Patsy. She was skipping today, remember!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement alone filled the group with hope. Patsy was skipping today and that meant Edna hadn't shrunk her. If this plan worked then they could warn Patsy she could take down the geek and rescue them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for?! Make the call!\" The brunette ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Originally she had been slightly disappointed that the pinkette wasn't present, but apparently all she had to do was wait. Now that she had her she had the whole set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna could only imagine Heather's reaction now that her most loyal follower was trapped down under with her. If she had to guess, Heather was beyond pissed, probably cursing up storm while she was at it. That made her giggle. Hopefully they wouldn't all kill each other before school's out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Edna was walking to her next class solo as she and Ruthie didn't have History together. But that was okay as no one seemed to be messing with her now. Heather and her group where now less than bugs and she was pretty sure her earlier display of power also had a role to play in people leaving her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad for her, she had F-rank luck. She found herself flat on her back with all her books and notes flying in all different directions. \"Ow. What hit me?\" she asked as she rubbed her head in discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch where your going next time, Geek!\" a familiar and yet aggressive voice sounded. She looked up to see none other than Trish Pierce and Yukimura Aoi. Instinctively, Edna gulped at the sight of the two. Trish had a known reputation for being a psycho and bullied her on more than one occasion before suddenly leaving her be over the last year. Aoi was just as bad and one glare from her could make even the bravest guy shit themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting to receive an answer, Trish grunted before walking off. Aoi merely shook her head at the geek before following suit. Edna was left alone in the hall watching the two disappear around the corner. The geek could feel her fists tighten as she barred her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again she let someone else walk all over her. This was just another reminder that there were more pests at this school outside of just Heather and her crew, Edna grumbled in frustration as she scrambled to pick up her notes and felt a familiar bulge in her pocket... Her size-ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just so tempting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she should go pay Trish and Aoi a visit?</span></div></div>",

Except for maybe THIS!!\u201d Edna said as she took out the ray gun and fires at Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a success as Trish was shrunk down to about the same height as Heather and the others. She could tell that Trish was likely beyond scared of what just happened and was now terrified at the new view of the geek. Aoi was shocked to see that happened and was scared for she might be next, which was the case as Edna fired at her as well. They were both at the same size as Edna picked them both up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the did you do, geek?!

While Heather and Co. occupied the front of her panties, Trish and Aoi could fit snugly in the back. \"I think I have just the place for you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish didn't like the sound of that and neither did Aoi. Since when did the little geek girl become so intimidating? The watched her closely as she suck her fee hand down the back of her shorts and pulled them away, revealing her pale ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take a genius to put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell no!\" Trish shouted. \"You better not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is seriously fucked up.\" Aoi added blandly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you speak up?!\" Trish roared. Aoi rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you both like to shit on everyone you come across, it only seems right that you spends some time with my ass. Who knows, you might actually like it in there, eh Trish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid girl's eyes widened at Edna's comment. How did that little geek know about-- never mind. \"I'm warning you, you little shit! If you don't stop this right now and fix us, I swear--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll what?\" Edna interrupted, not the least bit concerned about Trish's threat. She clearly didn't understand who the top dog was around here. \"Are you going to tell on me? Beat me up? Or maybe you'll sick your attack dog Aoi on me? News flash, nothing you do will work. I'm bigger, meaner, badder, and better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna smiled. \"You two have fun now. Oh and if you do managed to see Heather, tell her I say high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hall are you taking about Geeeeek!!!\" Trish shrieked before Edna let them drop. The two delinquents screamed as they plummeted into the dark chasm that housed Edna's ass. Aoi landed against the soft fabric that was Edna's panties and was left rolling down them like a hill until she reached bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish on the other hand landed right on top of Edna's pale cheeks and was left sliding down the crack until she landed right on top of Aoi. The two girls groaned in pain from their crash landing and had little time to take in what just happened before the light above faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnda, feeling quite pleased with her catch decided to make things a little more interesting. She grabbed the back of her panties, and gave herself something that she hadn't had since middle school... An atomic wedgie. Rather than feeling embarrassed however, she felt hot, powerful. If this felt good to her then it must be hell for the tinies down front and in the rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, Edna savored the feeling for a minute before pocketing the ray. She still had a class to get to and this little detour guaranteed she'd be late. Hopefully everything else today would go smoothly. </span></div></div>",

Honestly she didn't know and that's what she was afraid of. For now she would act as if everything's normal. After all the last thing she wanted was to wind up microscopic at the feet of everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Edna! What's up?\" Ruth greeted with forced happiness. She hoped that her \"friend\" hadn't noticed anything was amiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much. Just enjoying my day for once.\" Enda replied happily as she closed the distance. If she noticed Ruthie's unease then she didn't show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's tried to bother you I take it?\" Ruth asked. What a dumb question. Of course no one had the guts to pick on her now, let alone talk to her. Everyone was paranoid and afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. After what happened to Heather and her little posse, no one has the moxie to mess with me. You should see the way people look at me now. It's good to finally get some respect around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth just laughed her words off. \"Yeah. I guess it is. So... Anything interesting happen since... Ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" Edna grinned. :Although, I did bump into Trish and Aoi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie felt her heart sink. \"Y-You did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. They were being their usual selves, but don't worry I took care of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth gulped. \"Took care of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Edna answered before giving her rear a light pat. \"They won't be a problem anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie hid it well, but her mind was screaming. Edna had shrunken two more people and stuffed them in the back of her panties. Oh god! Her friend was out of control. The power of her size-ray had clearly gone to her head. This wasn't good. How long before she shrunk someone else for something minor or just because she could?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Ruthie? You look a bit pale.\" Edna asked in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine. I think I'm just coming down with something.\" Ruth lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, really.\" Ruth assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. If you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That only provided the delinquents more motivation to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Trish's natural instinct was to attack.

But at our size there's no guarantee we'd survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish gulped. \"But what if she doesn't go and just holds it in? We'd be buried in shit.

Well they were half right. She reached her hand inside and ordered them to get on. There was some slight hesitation, but they complied all the same. That made Edna smile. Power felt good. Really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the tinies in her palm, Edna grinned.

Inside was a small pink box decorated in stickers. It had been quite a while since the geek girl laid eyes on this, and now she was more motivated than ever before to open and reveal it's contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting a second she clicked the box open to reveal an eight inch purple dildo resting on a velvet surface. Mr. Big was the brand if she remembered correctly. Guaranteed to hit those hard to reach places. With this she would definitely be able to make her message loud and clear. Don't fuck with Edna McCoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently retrieved the purple mass from the box and eyed it critically. This would be her weapon of power over those cunts. Smiling to herself. she placed it upright on her bed, the tip facing high into the sky. Edna gulped before leaning over dropping a huge wad of spit on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe geek began to rub it in like lotion before slowly letting her entire mouth consume it. Up and down her head bobbed as she gave the purple mass her full attention. If this things was going to go inside her she was going to make sure it was a slick and easy journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue wrapped around the hard plastic and she made sure to pull it into her throat as deep as possible. She gaged and chocked a bit, but it was all worth it. She finally released the now sleek plastic from her maw as the wad of spit connecting it to her broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna giggled to herself before looking down at her wet and hungry vag. This was going to feel amazing. Heather and Co. won't even know what hit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile inside the baking pit of moisture and warmth, Heather and her crew fought for survival. They scattered to the wind when Edna forced them into her pussy. Heather still couldn't believe the geek would actually take things this far. Was this sadistic bitch really the same girl who would cower at the sight of her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather was currently trying to navigate the slimy cave that was Edna's pussy, literally waist deep in the ginger's juices. The smell was horrendous and she could swear this girl's vaginal fluids were hardening as she moved along. Right now nothing was more revolting than Edna's cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather was soaked in it. Everyone had to be after that waterfall swept through. Edna's cave reminded her of the water rides at Six Flags only horrifying and twisted. Just where the hell had everyone gone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Is anybody out there?\" Heather called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patsy?! Groupies?! Brunette girl?! Stupid guy?! Anybody?!\" Heather again called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heather!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get us down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even remember our names?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather swung her head around frantically until her eyes landed high above on the fleshy pink wall of the geek girl's vagina. All of her crew members were stuck to the wall like in that wired science fiction movie they had to watch in class. What was it called again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys okay?!\" Heather asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we look okay?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of stupid question is that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and get us down?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you only remember Patsy's name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather rolled her eyes at the last comment. \"Just sit tight. I'll find some way to get you all down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Heather looked around for a means to get her friends down the brunette decided to comment. \"This is all your fault you know. If you hadn't pushed that damn geeks buttons we wouldn't be in the mess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and like your any better. Last I checked no one forced you to mess with her either. Are you going to tell me peer pressure is the reason you did it? Boo fucking hoo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you even hate her so much?\" Patsy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather ceased her search and glared at her group. \"That's none of your business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the tension in the pussy was broken up by what felt like an earthquake. The cum stream around Heather shimmered and the group on the wall prayed the geek wasn't about to come again. \"What is this?\" a groupie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatsy was the first to take notice of the slow approaching, foreign object invading their space. \"It's big... Scary... And purple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was confused for a moment before they turned there heads to what Patsy was gawking at. All at once they went pale when they saw that big purple monster. It was a dildo. The biggest dildo they'd ever seen. It was taller than King Kong in heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shiiit!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the outside Enda moaned in pleasure as she thrust her big plastic friend into herself. The feeling of being filled to the brim with something that actually touched the sides was pure bliss. The geek could feel her cave stretching apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she enjoyed herself she though about heather and her motely crew. This must be agony for them. The looks of terror on their faces as they saw the dildo's head must be priceless. If only she could see their reactions. Oh well, there discomfort was Edna's pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can rise above them though, if that's what you really want.

You'd be <i>just</i> big enough to be my new vagina toy, a job that you will come to love in time.

Edna had completely and utterly lost her marbles. All the choices presented to her sounded insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could either surrender her life to the geek girl and become her personal slave. Which would mean being regrown, but just big enough to be ''Mr. Big 2.0''. She would be her high priestess second only to her and her shrunken friends will be her own personal slaves. While having people worship her sounded good, she didn't play second fiddle to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the second option. If she stayed defiant, Edna would shrink her again, only this time she'll be microscopic. Edna will shove her back into her love tunnel and she'll be lost forever. That is unless one of her ''friends'' found her. But then again there's no guarantees they wouldn't crush her. Well, she knew Patsy wouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the final option. If she declined the geeks offer like option two, Edna could choose not to shrink her again and just sstuff her back inside with the rest of her friends. The nerd made it clear she had no plans to ever set them free from her birth canal. No matter what she chose, all roads led back to Edna's cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking figures.\" Heather whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no chance in hell she'd allow herself to become Mr. Big 2.0, just thing about becoming a human dildo made her sick.

She would lose no matter what she chose. Freedom wasn't an option. That sucked but that's life for you. It's cold, harsh, and hardly fair. The shrunken girl continued to glare at the oversized geek and struggled against the sleek purple mass against her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the hardening juices that marinated her clothing and coated her body, she was able to get her arm free. She raised it high with the most intense glare she could muster in this situation. Edna could tell what her nemesis was doing to she went back to her nightstand pulled out a magnifying glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw both angered and disappointed her at once. Heather ''Fucking'' Miles was glaring at her definat as ever, flipping her the bird with her free arm. What was wrong with ths girl? Didn't she understand she wasn't the one in control here? She knows what her defiance means so why? Why wasn't she afraid? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Edna's turn to bar her teeth. \"Fine. If this is what you want, then so be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna tossed her magnifying glass to the side and used her free hand to pluck the shrunken girl from the dildo. Mr. Big was next to be discarded. Heather was then placed on the geek's index finger. Said girl stood tall and didn't cease in her glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna then grabbed her size-ray and pointed the barrel at her mortal enemy. Heather gulped, but she would show no fear. In a weird way, she'd won. She waited as she saw the barrel begin to glow. Edna reset the device and and looked down the sights at her bully for the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye... Heather Miles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gun fired... And Heather was struck. Heather felt a cold chill rip through her and could see the world grow around her. Before she dwindle away completely, Edna brough her close and shoved her back into her new home. The geek gasped a bit and wiped her finger all around. When she pulled in back, Heather was gone. No doubt she was a microbe by now, lost forever in the folds of her love canal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd done it. She'd defeated Heather completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026So why did she feel like a looser?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rutie is frightened thinking that Heather was crushed along with his group, unfortunately it happened with most of the group, which was crushed, turning into red paste. Except Heather, who was lucky to survive and was crushed between the buttocks, suffocated with farting Edna, and fainted. After class, Edna and Rutie went home, coming, Edna removes her panties, seeing the red dots. Rutie is shocked, her best friend crushed these people, with his ass. Except for a small person who began to move. Edna was very happy, knowing it was Heather. And now Rutie, what do we do with the cow?<br>\r\nRutie says: She knows more, we need to end it well. Let's go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A mixture of euphoria and fear swept over her as everyone kept getting smaller... and smaller. The erotic pleasure coursing through her body made her legs weak. Going on instinct she immediately sat down... right on top of a small group of jocks who were oggling her enhancing assets. Their squirming against such sensitive parts only added to her arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie gasped as she climaxed, shrieking cutely as her juices flowed freely... covering said jocks in her inner fluids. Soon the feeling passed, and she then remembered where she was.... and now she was gargantuan!!! Meeping again she stood up to her full height. \"Whuh.... wha... what happened?!?!\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna only smirked \"It's a size ray sweetie.

With her arms pinned to her sides by Ruthie's massive fingers, Edna was unable to continue adjusting the size ray. Looking down at her tiny friend in her hand, Ruthie grinned mischievously. Edna was starting to get worried now. She had thought that her best friend would support her in her plans for revenge, but now she was beginning to worry that she had made a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Edna, but I'm really liking being able to tower over everyone like this. I don't really feel like having someone else my size around, so I'll be taking that little toy of yours off your hands.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Ruthie carefully pried the ray gun from her tiny friend's hand and placed it in the cup of her bra for safe keeping. She was honestly surprised that her underwear had managed to hold together through her massive growth spurt while the rest of her clothing had been torn to shreds. It had grown in size along with her, but it was much tighter now so she could tell that it didn't grow at the same rate as she did. After she had secured the ray, ensuring that nobody else would ever be able to grow themselves to rival her size, Ruthie turned her attention back to Edna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Edna, why did you think that it was a good idea to do this to me? Wouldn't it have made more sense to just grow yourself if you wanted to get revenge on Heather and her lackeys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it because I wanted my best friend to be able to share in my greatest moment of triumph, and I trusted you enough to think that you'd support me with this. I never expected you to turn on me and take all the power for yourself! What the heck are you even planning to do now that you're so huge?!\" Edna said in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie considered that question for a while before coming to a conclusion.

Why else would you take my ray and stop me from joining you at that size?\" Edna replied confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't you worry your cute little head about that, Edna. I just didn't want you or anyone else to steal my thunder! Like I said, I'm loving this new size, and I don't want to have to share the spotlight with another giantess. That doesn't mean that I'm not gonna help you out with this little revenge plan of yours. After all, what kind of best friend would I be if I didn't help my friend when she needs me!\" Ruthie said, smiling at her Edna in her hand. She then lifted Edna up to place her on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Ruthie wasn't going to betray her after all, Edna breathed a sigh of relief. She and Ruthie then glared down at the terrified Heather, who was still to stunned by everything that had just happened to even think about moving. With her hands on her hips, the giant Ruthie spoke to her friend on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Edna, since you're the one who's been putting up with this girl's shit for all these years, what do you think that I should do to punish her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jee Ruthie, I don't know... I mean, this bitch hasn't given me a moment of peace since kindergarten! I think that she deserves something pretty serious for all that I've gone through, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Edna, I do agree. She needs a very severe punishment to make up for all she's done to you. Hmmm, what to do... Well, I could always just step on her and crush her like the worthless little bug that she is, but that would probably be much to quick. After all, you've been suffering at her hands for years now, and it wouldn't really be fair if she only had to suffer for a few seconds before escaping to the sweet embrace of death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that definitely wouldn't be fair, would it. After everything she's done, she needs to really suffer! Maybe you should swallow her whole. Being tossed around in your mouth for a bit like a little piece of candy, and then being swallowed and sent to your stomach where she'll have to endure having her body eaten away by your stomach acids for a few hours. And then she gets digested and turned into a piece of your shit on top of it all! I think that that would be a fitting end for worthless garbage like her, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I certainly do. But why should I finish her off right away? I think it would be more fun for both of us if I tortured her a bit first. It's not like she doesn't deserve it after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Ruthie, you really should get to have some fun with her before you finish her off. And don't look now, but it seems like your little toy thinks that she can escape from you.\" Edna said, pointing at Heather's fleeing form down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow them, Heather was running away as fast as her slender legs could carry her. Everything about this situation was just too insane for her. Sure she had been nothing but cruel to Edna for all these years, but she never expected that nerd to actually stand up and do something about it! Now she had made a real working growth ray, and her best friend was towering over everyone at 50 feet tall! What was even worse was that the two of them had just been casually discussing how they were going to go about killing her as if she wasn't even there! Heather knew that she had to get away from that psychotic nerd and her giant freak of a friend. If they caught her, she was dead! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Judging by what they were saying, if they caught her, she'd be better off if she were dead. With that in mind, Heather let her legs carry her away. She didn't risk taking the time to look behind her and see if she was safe, she just kept running forward with her eyes closed. She was too terrified to do anything else. After what felt like she had been running for an eternity, Heather finally decided that she must have made enough distance to escape from Edna and Ruthie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to see, however, she was broken by what she saw: Even running at her fastest pace for so long, Ruthie's massive form had allowed her to keep up with her with just a casual stride! Now Heather was exhausted, and while she was completely out of energy from running so long, Ruthie hadn't even begun to break a sweat! She was simply walking toward her prey at her usual pace, humming a tune to herself as if this whole thing was nothing but a game to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was at this point that Heather realized that trying to escape was a hopeless endeavor. Knowing that it was physically impossible for someone her size to outrun a titaness like Ruthie, Heather colapsed to her knees and surrendered herself to her pursuers. Seeing her prey fall to the floor defeated, Ruthie smirked and scooped up Heather in her massive hand. Raising her up to her face, Ruthie smirked devilishly before tightening her grip around the tiny bully's tired body. Hearing Heather cry out in pain from what was simply a light squeeze from Ruthie's giant fingers, she and Edna began to laugh at their victim's plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So bitch, this is it. Game over. Now, do you have something that you want to say to my little friend here?\" Ruthie said cruelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I give up! You win! I'm sorry for everything that I did to you! Please, just have mercy on me!\" Heather cried, absolutely terrified by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two simply laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jee Edna, I don't know... Do you think that someone as worthless as her really deserves mercy from us?\" Ruthie asked, looking to her shoulder to smile at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course she doesn't<i> deserve</i> mercy, Ruthie. That much is pretty obvious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Edna say next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Events unfolded so quickly Ruth was only vaguely aware of the situation. When she saw Edna pull out a gun she feared the worst but this was just...unexpected. Her friend has this device aimed not at her hated enemy, but <i>her</i>! Ruth wasn't even sure what it was doing. There were only two things she was aware of. One: She felt very strange. And Two: Everything seemed to get a lot smaller very fast. As she registered the fact that she was slowly growing Ruth realized what Edna said about the device being a size ray and it all clicked. But why her? Ruth was always there for Edna, so why was she using her for this? It didn't add up, but Ruth didn't have time to ponder the inner workings of her friend's machinations; her head just tapped the ceiling. \"Ow!\" The growing woman swung an expanding arm up to rub her scalp but it slammed right into Heather's face, knocking her over. In the seconds that had transpired Ruth's body was already fifteen feet tall and only growing faster. The confined space of the school halls couldn't hold in her figure anymore. With a crash a chunk of the ceiling gave way to Ruth's frame. Ruth looked down to her feet only to see Edna, now positioned on top of her shoe and still blasting her with this fiery grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd that in this hectic situation Ruth suddenly realized she was wearing a plaid skirt and tried to cover herself futilely. Thankfully her clothes seemed to be growing along with her. But speaking of the growth, with the school being forced out of the way it continued to increase in pace. Several feet of ceiling continued to break until finally the growing girl's head popped into the open air, followed by the rest of her. In mere seconds the school only reached her waistline and dwindled further. Ruth's feet expanded, slowly crashing the land beneath her as the school started to get smaller all around her. The giantess shuddered when she felt a crunch under her right foot. Remembering where Heather was before all this, it didn't take long to realize what happened. With horror the giantess looked down and saw a good chunk of the school utterly devastated by her expansion. With each passing second more things were getting crushed and more people hurt to make way for the woman's body. Edna was now slightly bigger than her shoelaces. It crossed Ruth's mind she hopped onto her foot to avoid getting crushed; smart, but still horrific. Of course the little genius seemed to get impatient. Ruth spotted Edna making some sort of adjustment on her size ray without releasing the trigger. When Edna stopped tinkering the world only grew smaller from there. Until this point the growth was slowly accelerating, but now it was a sudden spurt that shot Ruth into the sky faster than she could process. People didn't even have time to register the school around them being demolished before they met their untimely demise underneath Ruth. The giantess peeked over and saw a majority of the building covered by her shoes, she had to be hundreds of feet tall by this point and even that quickly became too small as the next second added additional buildings to the destruction. Ruth grew her way into the streets and cars began to crash against her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta get away from here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo avoid hurting more people Ruth tried to take a step away but a house was right where her foot landed, it didn't even last a second. \"No!\" Ruth pulled her foot back and retracted it onto another pair of homes, her being big enough to cover two in one step. Getting increasingly upset, Ruth just hurried her way to the nearest sanctuary, a park that went on for a couple miles. At her size it only took ten steps to get there, unfortunately that still meant at least ten buildings were crushed in the process. But even as Ruth stopped she was horrified to see her feet were almost engulfing the park too! She retracted her head back up and saw now the whole town was smaller than her, buildings now not even at her ankles. While she was so desperately avoiding crushing stuff she had grown <i>miles</i>! And Edna wasn't stopping. But enough was enough, so Ruth did what she should've done in the first place. She knelt over and plucked her friend off of her shoe. \"Stop Edna!\" Her friend was practically a speck in the palm of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna did stop, \"Why? You're so big, it's awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call this awesome?!\" Ruth looked down at her feet and saw now a couple neighborhoods outside of her supposedly safe park were now gone too. \"Do you have any idea how many people I must've hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They deserve it for hurting people too! Besides look at you, you're like a Goddess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't want to be like this! Why did you even fire me anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to make sure this thing was safe, there was no telling if I fired it on me that I'd have-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You<b> TESTED</b> it on me?!\" Ruth's voice was now full of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna didn't seem to register this though, \"Yeah but now we know it's safe. So now I can grow too. We can be Giants together!\"</span></div></div>",

Being her stature, Abby possesses what most would call a \"cute\" build, quite petite though she does have a bit of a curve to her, if only a modest one. She possesses a head of long black hair which reaches a bit below her shoulder, and a pair of dark brown eyes most can get lost in. Being that she comes from a family of wealth, Abby is one to be able to afford to keep in fashion. Even though she tends to stick to what most would call the Emo/Scene look. On this particular day wearing a T-shirt with a bands logo on the front, hugging tightly to her small frame. A pair of black skinny jeans and a pair of old chuck taylors. She also wears a pair of fashionable thick framed rectangular glasses, and a beanie fitting loosely to the back of her head.<br>\r\n<b>Personality</b>: Despite her looks, as well as coming from a family which is well off. Most would expect this rich girl to be as snobby, if not more so than Heather. though it is quite the opposite. Abby is a kind girl who tends to socialize with everyone, as would be the case with her becoming friends with Edna. Abby is a scholar who enjoys the company of like minded geniuses and Edna is perhaps the only one in the school who can match wit with her, if not more so. As such, the two have developed a sort of friendly rivalry of brains, always trying to trump the other. She isn't overly fond of Heather or her friends, if not only for the way she treats Edna, bullying her friend for no reason. Heather tends to fall under that group of people which irk her to no end, the ones who live for now and won't go anywhere after high school of college if they are lucky enough to get that far. It's a thought which brings a bit of a darker side to this normally sweet girl. Though they do say that the intelligent ones are the most lucky to snap.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Edna was taking aim with the device when a student came running by, in a hurry to get to her locker before it was time for class. The girl coming barreling through the open courtyard in the center of the school where this was all going down, Abigail Thorsen. A young woman from a wealthy family, her parents from Finland, she born in the US. Abby's family had made it big through her Parents owning one of the biggest corporations of the world, making them quite powerful. Naturally, with as bright as she was, they wanted Abigail to attend a private school, or even be home schooled, though she wouldn't have any of it. Knowing that if she wished to succeed in life, that she would have to know how to deal with people, and not be pampered her entire life. Of course, with her parents being who they were, Abby was quick to make friends, as well as some enemies such as Heather. Although, one of her closer friends would be none other than the school punching bag, Edna. The two of them building somewhat of a friendly rivalry when it came to intellect, always trying to outsmart the other, or even outdo the other on report cards. Still, Abby joins the ranks of one of the few people that talk to Edna, and even fewer people to be a genuine friend to the geek girl. Of course, her parents concern for her well being might have been justified, because before Abby could even stop herself to apologize to Edna for running into her. The device would be turned onto her from it's holder being spun around from impact and Edna would accidentally press the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna could only stare on in horror at what she had just done, the purple glow of the device soon surrounding poor Abigail, and soon the device would go to work. Abigail's body would begin to expand, the small girl gaining mass as she grew and grew. The student body, including Heather could only look up, slack jawed at the sight. Not only was the ever small rich girl now eye level with them, but she was getting far bigger than that. Her body steadily climbing and fast. Many of the student body bolting in different directions, wanting nothing to do with Abigail as she passed the twenty foot mark and continued to climb. Soon that becoming nothing but a memory as she passed the hundred and fifty mark in an instant. All that left, standing between the safety of Abby's expanding shoes was Edna, Heather, Ruthie, and even Trish Pierce, the local delinquent of the school. All of them there for different reasons. Edna for starting this and feeling slightly guilty over doing this to a friend. Ruthie, because she didn't want to leave Edna behind to get crushed unknowingly by Abby. Heather and Trish both on the other hand, had only one thing on their mind, jealousy. Heather perhaps showing a shade of green the most as she had been jealous of Abby most of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was this girl rich, but she was a straight A student who seemed to never have to try much to get by. Meanwhile Heather had to do what she could to just scrape past the years. Not only that, but now, as Abby topped off her growth spurt, this used to be small runt, stood at an outstanding one-thousand feet tall and literally towered above not only the school, but the nearby city. Heather's immediate thought, and one shared by the scrapper beside her was <i>\"It should have been me!\"</i>. Fortunately for Edna, perhaps due to the literal colossal distraction Abby was giving, Heather hadn't put two and two together, even with her opening her big mouth like some fool who calls out all her plans of attack before doing them, Edna could kick herself over that now. She still had a BIG problem to deal with, what to do next. Though she wouldn't be allowed much time to think on the matter as she could feel 2 pairs of eye's glaring right at her. Turning her head to the side, she let out a small yelp in shock to see Heather and Trish both glaring at her, practically salivating at getting their hands on the device. Edna would have no prayer of doing anything to stop them, or even outrunning them. Fortunately, Abby would save the day, albeit accidentally, as it would seem her new height wasn't settlign with her. She taking an unintentional step back from losing her balance momentarily and planting her old beat up chuck taylor of her right foot through the roof of the school. Demolishing many classrooms, and perhaps even ending several lives underneath her unforgiving tread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosion of debris as well as the resounding <b>Boom</b> which followed was enough to grab their attention again, just long enough so that when they looked back, Edna and Ruthie were gone. Having fled to hide and not allow either of them a chance at the device. Edna now hiding behind a nearby pillar, holding on Ruthie's arm after pulling her away. Her breathing heavy as she took a quick peak around it, She still far enough away from Heather and Trish that they would not find her unless they looked hard enough, and still giving her a good shot of Abby. Though she could by hundreds if not thousands of feet away and still have a good view of her. Still the range of the device needed to be taken into account. Because as she stood there, she knew she needed to do something. On one hand she could try and bring Abby back down to size, which seemed the most logical. A quick scream and shout respectively from Heather and Trish would be enough to get her to look and see Heather and Trish on the ground. Heather frozen in fear whilst Trish held her ribs, both having been gently nudged by the tip of Abby's shoe, she still not having found her balance quite yet. Trish obviously taking the brunt of it as she seemed to be in pain. More importantly however, Abby's shoe began to raise again, and a shadow began to overtake the two. Heather could only scream as she held her hand up in a futile attempt to stop it if it came down on her. Trish on the other hand, a survivor was already doing her best to roll to the side and escape it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only brought the though to Edna's mind that stopping it was the right call, to reduce Abby before she turned either one or both of these women into a stain on the bottom of her massive show. They possibly not even registering to her, their pops not felt and the blood stain so miniscule she would have to be actively looking for them to what they used to be. Although on the other, she could allow things to play out, after all, it wasn't as if Heather and to a less degree Trish didn't deserve this. Not to mention Abby was her friend, and to a degree she felt she could trust her not to do anything to her intentionally. The only problem was, when you're as big as she is, things tend to happen on accident a lot. All that Edna knew was Heather was a sure fire goner if Abby's foot came down, though Trish looked like she would escape that fate, but depending on if her ribs were broken or merely bruised, that would dictate for how long she could continue living at this Goddess's shoes.</span></div></div>",

Whether or not this was from general curiosity of how she would take it, or the fact that she had Ruthie yelling in her ear was all up in the air at this point. \"What the HELL! Edna what's going on?!\" Ruthie couldn't help but cry out, only earning her a \"Shhh\" from her friend who looked on. Watching with morbid curiosity, a grin on her face as she watched Abby's old chuck taylor, dirty from years of use raise up into the air. The ear piercing shriek of Heather only bringing but a smile to Edna's face as she watched that foot lower. For her it was almost as if time stopped as she watched the unforgiving tread of those shoes come down. It was almost as if she could hear each of Heather's bones simply snapping, the blood being pushed from her mouth as little by little she became more compressed underfoot until all at once, Abby's foot just seemed to consume her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sickening crunch heard and that was the end of it. Without dirtying her own hands, she had rid the world of that bitch Heather, and for a moment, Edna was truly happy. Though it wouldn't be long before a tinge of disappointment hit her. A part of her feeling guilty that the blood was on Abby's hands, or perhaps more fitting, under her right foot. Another part of her however, felt terrible that it wasn't by her hands that Heather bit the dust, though revenge was revenge all the same at the end of the day, and Heather did get her comeuppance. Although, that did leave Edna with a curious question for herself, what to do with Abigail now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the other side of that monstrous foot, Trish, ever the survivor would pull through once more. Though certainly hurting, she wasn't about to let herself get crushed like the insect under another bitches foot. After years of beating the living hell out of people like this, it was not the just punishment that she wanted to face at the end of the day. Fortunately her ribs were only hurt, throbbing lightly as opposed to being actually broken, and though it hurt like hell, she was able to roll herself to the side. Just narrowly escaping the underside of that Chuck Taylor. The loud thud of that foot coming down, mixed with the crunch of Heather caught underneath, as well as the huge tremor it caused. It was enough to practically toss Trish to the side, hitting a few empty trashcans which would topple over her. Though this left her to simply lie there, in pain, she only had one thing on her mind, find that geek girl and take that device from her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today had started like like any other for the Japanese woman known as Mizuki, or Mizu for short. She had woken up, showered and simply made her way to school for yet another boring day of what these people called challenging work. Truth be told, she didn't find any of it to be that, it was dull and hardly worth her time and each class hardly did much to amuse her, and today would be no different she was sure. Making her way up the walkway leading up to the school, Mizuki's eye's allowed themselves to fall upon the open courtyard of the school. This squared section of the school, only edged out by cement floors which were covered by awnings, both leading to walls which were lined with lockers. The Grass covered grown which was allowed to survive this modification, as green as ever and eventually leading up to a moderate sized fountain near the center of it all. Of course as she drew nearer, her backpack hanging lazily on her back, just by the right strap on the corresponding shoulder, she couldn't help but spy something which only caused her lips to curl in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather Miles, someone who had made her already boring and dull school life here in the States just that much worse. If it wasn't enough that she didn't at all feel challenged, the last thing she needed was some tall bitch to try and make herself look better due to being threatened by the Asian beauty. That was the keyword for Mizu as she looked back at each and every day, Heather was threatened by her and for good reason in her mind. She knew that she would go on to do great things, far better things that what Heather would do when she realized the real world didn't operate like it does now. Oh she might extend her stay on top when she goes to college sure, but after that, Heather Miles will proceed to fall in line with the rest of them, below Mizuki. At least this is what the young Japanese woman liked to think. Still, today she had at least something to distract Heather from her whilst she moved on by, and that would be the blondes favorite punching bag, Edna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna was a mixed bag for Mizuki, often the brunt of Heather's joke and yet having an intellect and perhaps even a drive to rival her own, although there was one important detail about her feelings for Edna. She never once has ever felt sorry for her in any way, Edna was weak and this was what happened to the weak. At least Mizuki has on multiple occasions lashed right back at Heather when she poked at her, if not on a few occasions downright embarrassed her through attacking her intellect or imperfections. She was cold and cutthroat, while as Edna didn't seem to posses much outside of her intellect, a pity too for such a great mind to go to waste. That was where Mizu felt some pity, over that wasted potential. Perhaps, Edna's potential was only beginning to crown however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had happened so fast that not even Mizu had seen it, all that was visible to her as she witnessed the scene as she walked by was Edna pulling out a device of some sort. A clumsy student bumping into her, involuntarily causing her to readjust her aim which had been on herself. The business end of it pointing right at the Asian exchange student and a bright flash taking over everyone's eyes. After that, for the students who had been looking on in shock, each of them with wide eyes and jaws dropped, Mizuki had simply ceased to exist it seemed. \"Holy shit, Edna vaporized that Asian girl!\" A young man had screamed which only seemed to cause the silence to grow even more thick. Even Heather could help but stare dumbfounded by all of this. There was one person who didn't however, and that would be Edna who looked downright mortified, and it wasn't due to killing that girl. She knew exactly what she had done, and as she looked down on the device to check the settings, she couldn't help but gulp at the realization of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be long after that a thunderous boom would overtake the student body gathering in the courtyard, witnesses to what they thought was a murder. Of course, they were unaware to what was about to happen. All they knew was that the sky darkened, a large shadow casting it's way over the entire school. Many assuming storm clouds as they continued to stare at what was the last place that Mizuki had stood. A deafening scream from one of the girls who had joined the party would grab everyone's attention, each of their eyes following on her as she pointed to the sky, covering her mouth with her free hand. Many eye's had followed her finger and many similar reactions was given, all except Edna who couldn't help but remain more shocked than scared, having caused this mess. \"Fuck...\" was all that she could say for herself as her eyes also met what everyone was now rightfully panicking over, the monster which she had created.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>White. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the color of the sky. Instead of the bright and carefree blue that it was mere moments ago the sky was now a grayish white that seemed to go on and on for at least a mile. Beyond that was the haze of what appeared to be black. The strange colors went on for what seemed like forever, blocking any view the school had of the world around it. It didn't look like anything anyone had ever seen before. Everyone had a vague idea as to what happened but it didn't seem to dawn on anyone just what they were looking at. Only Edna was calm enough able to figure out what was before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tread of a shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\" She cursed again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened...?\" Mizuki shook her head and glanced around her. Around her was...nothing. Just barren land as far as she could see with the occasional hill in the ground. Not too far was a decent-sized pool of water that separated her from another barren body of land. Tensing her brow Mizuki reflected on the last minute. The last thing she saw was Edna standing up to Heather for once. She pulled a device and then someone made her misfire and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got hit.\" She said aloud. But what did she get hit by? Whatever it was was likely intended for Heather so...did it teleport Mizuki to some barren world? No...teleportation was just silly. So what did Edna do? If that spineless girl could figure it out then it should be all too easy for someone of Mizuki's intellect. \"Maybe some of the dirt will give me some clue.\" Mizu bent over for a closer look. Barren as it all was the ground was a strange assortment of colors. Mainly green and gray, but the ground didn't have the same texture as dirt and grass as far as she could see so what was it? Once Mizu got a closer look she realized immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like everything else, Mizu was a master at geography. She knew all the peninsula's, islands, states, nations, and even most cities by heart. She studied topography and knew it better than most. So when what she looked at resembled an overhead view of Quiet Rock, the very town she resided in, it all clicked together. \"Edna made a device that changes size. And quite a powerful one at that.\" It was just like someone as cowardly as Edna to stoop to using a device to solve all her problems. \"Still, I never would've thought of this.\" Mizu mused. She took another look around her, identifying the barren land as the country of America and its many cities that were barely distinguishable from dirt. And right in front of one of her feet, less than half the size of her foot, was the puny little down she'd grown to despise during her time in the States. The nobodies who would go through life scraping the bottoms of the barrel just to get by. Those of mediocre intelligence who would manage to get a job shuffling papers til the day they die. And of course the Heather's, the people who'd peak at 21 and quickly become less than dirt. All these people weren't even worth the dirt she walked on. And now ironically enough they were less than the dirt she walked on. The entire world was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizuki started to smile as she began to realize the implications of her current position. Already the lands neighboring the city were demolished into rubble just to make room for her feet. All it would take is a little tap; no, not even that, a twitch. And everything she disliked about Quiet Rock would be ended under foot. Or maybe she could allow herself to be petty for a moment. As much as she disliked the town, the idea of personally getting payback on Heather sounded incredibly appealing too. Maybe Mizu could somehow start with Heather and then finish with the town? Oh but she was much too big for that. Of course, if anyone could accomplish it, it would be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, Decisions...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Trish who had been walking with her backpack lazily over her right shoulder,had overheard much of the commotion regarding Edge and Heather. As usual, the big bitch was tormenting the smaller girl. A thought which only caused a scowl to creep upon her face, and her fist to tighten, the knuckles turning white. There wasn't possibly a word good enough to describe the hate she felt for Heather. Still, she knew that if she turned around and hit Heather like anyone should have many, many months ago. She would be suspended and possibly held away from graduating yet again, no doubt Heather and her parents having some pull in that. Sighing, she would just keep walking, crossing into the open courtyard in the center of the school. Many people getting out of her way, as per usual. After all, even if she being held back from getting violent, not many aside Heather knew that she wouldn't fly off the handle, and having a background in MMA certainly helped her reputation in this regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this curse of being unable to do anything, would be lifted as it were. The rogue beam having been shot, away from it's intended target would find it's way, flying through the air an hitting Trish in the back. The purple aura surrounded this young woman, causing her to stop in her tracks. Eye's looking down on herself, noticing the glow. \"What the?!\" She couldn't help but question, more so annoyed than scared of what was happening. Although a bit of a worried look would cross her face as her body began to expand. Something which would far more worry the other students than herself. After all, no matter what, one of your peers growing to giant size would be intimidating. Now that said peer was a violent psychopath, well things were not going to end well. Many students could only remain frozen in place, staring up in horror as Trish peaked out at fifty feet tall, a classic height, and only the beginning. She would hold her right hand out, dropping her now giant sized backpack to the ground with a thud, looking her hand over. She couldn't help but chuckle at her new size, a devious, near diabolic one. Her green eyes scanning the ground and soon locking onto the target of her frustration, Heather. <b>\"Oh, you're so fucked.\"</b> She couldn't help but laugh, bending at the waist and picking this young girl up into her right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish's grin would widen as she felt the struggles of this girl, doing nothing against merely her hand. She holding a life effortlessly in her grasp, literally her future was at her whim. She could be the judge and jury for Heather, and she would deserve anything that Trish did to her. Most of the student body knew it, and Edna, well she looked forward to it. Although not her immediate plan, at least the ray had hit someone who hated Heather as much as she did. Although it did concern her a bit that she didn't know Trish all that well, she seemed to be more interested in Ruthie, and often times, Edna questioned just how interested she was indeed. Trish couldn't help but lick her lips, her deep chuckle reverberating through Heather's body who begged to be let go. \"Leave me alone!\" Something which would only earn a shake of Trish's head. <b>\"Leave you alone? Afraid I can't do that pipsqueak. After all, you often wouldn't leave everyone else alone when they asked you too. High on yourself, thinking the world revolved around you, fuck you Heather.\"</b> She would coldly say. Bringing tears to this girls face as she looked into the unrelenting, and angry eye's of Trish. <b>\"The way I see it, even if this is temporary, if I shrink back down, I'm going to rot away under the scope of some scientists, so I'm going to get my monies worth, and do us all a favor.\"</b> Once again, a dark almost ominous chuckle would follow suit. <b>\"You're going to die, Heather\"</b> This girl would wail at this, and as Trish gave her a bit of a squeeze. Laughing rather evilly at this display, sending a chill up the spine of every student, including Edna who watched on.</span></div></div>",

On the one hand, things were going beautifully. Not only had her device worked wonderfully, but Heather was going to meet her long-overdue end, and it certainly didn't look like Trish was going to let her off easy. All was right with the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, was it, really? After all, this had been Edna's experiment, and it should be HER achievement! Trish may have had the good sense to want Heather dead, but the now-gigantic delinquent was still a crass bully who was completely unworthy of the power, glory, and opportunity for revenge she'd been accidentally gifted with. It should have been Edna, standing as a terrifying titan, reigning down terrible judgment upon her foes. This wasn't right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparing to fire the ray once more, Edna considered how to approach the situation. She could try to shrink Trish back to normal, but it might not be wise to test that function under emergency conditions. If something went wrong, and/or if Trish got angry at her, the results could be bad for Edna, personally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could enlarge herself, but there was no way she could overpower Trish's obvious physical gifts. On the other hand, Trish seemed to have a...special interest in Ruthie, and Ruthie could certainly be trusted. Perhaps a giant Ruthie could calm Trish down long enough for Edna to find a better solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the manic look on Trish's face, Edna had seconds to act. Inhaling deeply, she made her choice, and fired the ray at...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The look on Trish's face certainly did add a tad bit of urgency to Edna's decision making, and even now as she continued to think about it, she wasn't even sure that either decision was the correct one. A giant Ruthie could be the answer that she was looking for, after all, it was no secret that Trish fancied her. A though which only made Edna shiver at the thought of having to see this thug more than she already did. Not that she particularly hated or disliked her. Trish seemed to leave Edna alone for the most part, the two of them having a shared understanding when it came to Heather as not even Trish was safe from Heather's torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough whilst Edna undoubtedly got the worst end of the bargain when it came to her arch nemesis, Trish still had to put up with Heather's constantly taunting. Although Heather would never even hope to try and fight Trish, as even on her worst day at a handicap, Trish would decimate the pretty girl who ruled the school. Still, it seemed like part of her wanted to goad Trish into assaulting her to get her expelled from the school, and even though she hadn't been successful yet. The untold amount of anger she had caused the delinquent was far more satisfying, knowing that Trish just wouldn't hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what scared Edna the most however as she looked at the classically sized, fifty foot Trish now squeezing the life out of Heather in her hand. Trish had a bad temper, short fuse not even beginning to describe it. The fuse may as well have not even been there with her, and in most cases the unpopular kids are the ones who had to deal with it. Many a time had Trish beaten up some innocent bystander who didn't have much clout in the social hierarchy around the place, all due to what Heather put her through, needing that release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile as Trish did in fact leave Edna alone, perhaps feeling sorry for her, even just a little bit. Never have been on the receiving end of one of Trish's legendary beat downs. The sheer fact that she was fifty feet tall, and enjoying oh so much having Heather cry and beg for mercy in her grasp. Having much of the student body at her DC's. She knew she couldn't allow her to stay like this, and perhaps not even Ruthie could help the situation. After all, who would stop Trish if she became too forward with Ruthie, her friend certainly didn't have the physical gift of the giant standing in front of them now, and knowing her power, she couldn't subject Ruthie to that, not on good conscious. With that in mind, Edna was left with only one option, and it was one she still hesitated in using. Lifting the device up, she pointed it at Trish, and after a few presses of buttons, she hoped it would work. The untested feature on the device, the shrink feature. We knew the growth feature worked, but anything could happen now, and Edna was taking the gamble. With a sigh and a silent prayer, she would fire upon Trish, bathing her in that purple glow.</span></div></div>",

Possibly the worst case scenario was happening, queen bitch of the school, Heather Miles was growing. Edna was no longer cursing under her breath, oh no, she was quite vocal about this. \"Fuck...\" Being all that she could say, but many students, including Ruthie who stood next to her couldn't help but look her way. Had it not been for the fact that perhaps the biggest bully in the school was getting even bigger, Ruthie may have inquired about the device in Edna's hand and the situation as of current. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish as well would notice this, though a bit slower than the others. Her only hint being the load in her hand getting heavier and heavier. Her fingers unable to quite get around this girl anymore, and soon, unable to hold her growing form. Trish would realize all too late, too caught up in her mind wandering in the ways she could off Heather. That it wouldn't be until she was forced to drop her, Heather already a forth of her size and catching up fast. Trish's green eye's locking onto her, a growl escaping her as she sneered down at Heather who's confidence was flowing back into her. She wearing a cocky grin as she continued to gain size. \"You ready to pay, Trish?\" A cocky grin which would soon melt away once she realized that she would only level out at Trish's height. Perhaps Heather's mind only wishing to gain more size on this psychopath, but being the same size, at fifty feet meant one thing for her, and she knew it. There was nobody big enough to stop Trish from doing what she had wanted too for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather could only look on wide eyed as she watched the first punch come at her. It connecting with her jaw and immediately knocking her off balance, Heather taking a step back and nearly flattening a student or two underneath her shoes. Though, she managed to stay up, it wouldn't be for long before she would feel Trish's shoulder burying itself into her midsection, her legs being swept out from underneath her as Trish tackled her with a double leg takedown. Lifting her up into the air and throwing the both of them into the school. Even at normal size, this slam would have been brutal, knocking the wind firmly from Heather's lungs. Though at fifty feet, it brought a whole new scale of destruction, the ground bouncing from underneath the normal sized people, a loud boom being heard as well as the sound of concrete and brick turning to dust under their combined weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dust cloud of debris would rise, and all that would be left would be Trish pushing herself up slowly, Edna able to swear she saw a devilish grin on Trish's face as she looked down at the fallen Heather. <b>\"You done? Huh!? Come on, I thought you had more fight then that!\"</b> Trish's voice would bellow, her shouting forcing everyone to cover their ears in pain from the power of her voice. <b>\"Oh, we're not done Princess, not by a long shot!\"</b> She would shout one more time before grabbing Heather's right arm. This giant girl already having the fight taken out of her, she helplessly lying on her back, wishing her time as a fifty foot giant was going better for her. It would only get worse as Trish leap to her side, falling to her back and locked in an armbar. Her body demolishing even more of the school, but more importantly forcing Heather to cry out in pain as her arm began to hyper extend. Heather's screams of pain only making those around her feel it as she could feel her arm breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna meanwhile was left with a decision, neither of them good. After recalibrating the device, by her calculations things should be fine. Though there was no way to be sure. The Device could do a number of things at this point as it has proven, and shooting one of them again could have disastrous results. The question for Edna was simple, who does she fire upon? One one hand, she could try and shrink Trish down again, but that would leave Heather still fifty feet tall, and if she could move, perhaps extremely pissed off and who knows what she would do. On the other, the more unpredictable Trish, who was already proven to be a violent hothead. Could Edna really trust her enough to leave her as the remaining giant, if only for a moment until she knew for sure to try and shrink her too? The sound of a reverberating cracking could be heard, Heather's arm giving way, and this seemed to be all that Edna needed to hear as she raised the device, ready to fire.</span></div></div>",

Trish was startled by the sudden feeling of disorientation, relenting in her assault on Heather as she felt herself get smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then something unexpected and terrible happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather's free arm struck the dwindling Trish in the face with terrifying speed and ferocity, sending the smaller and still shrinking giant sprawling back in confusion and pain.

Either the fearless cage fighter couldn't help but feel the drop of her stomach as she saw those blue eyes glaring at her, seething with anger and looking for retribution. Blood running from the corner of her mouth, her right arm stinging with pain from nearly being broken in half. She wanted to make Trish pay, and with her life it would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her sneaker covered foot from the ground, she hovered it above Trish, causing the now normal sized girl to grimace, cursing at not finishing her when she had the chance, knowing she was about to die. Heather tilting her head to the side and grinning a malicious grin. <b>\"You hurt me, but times up bug bitch, time to go splat like the worthless insect you are.\"</b> Heather would simply say, though the actually splat part never seemed to come. Instead, Heather would simply be left there, standing, the gears turning in her head. \"Speaking of insects, where's Edna?\" Heather would practically giggle this, wanting to see her punching bag so pathetic and weak, and at her feet. Not to mention, didn't she bring that gun to school, what did she call it, a.....<i>size</i> gun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather's eye's lit up at the thought, after all, here she was at fifty feet tall, so the idea, no matter how silly, even for her, she was proof it was true. She would simply lower her foot back to the ground, to the side of Trish who simply scurried away to lick her wounds. <b>Ohhhh Ednaaaaa, come out please, and bring that size gun with you, I have quite a few demands.\"</b> Heather would call out in a sing song styled voice as she surveyed the ground for her little victim. Having allowed Trish to leave, since she had bigger fish to fry, although perhaps that decision would come back to haunt her, especially since she just called out Edna's device. Unfortunately for Heather, Edna had long since retreated, not wanting any part of a giant Heather who was recovered, especially since she didn't seem interested in Trish anymore, she taking shelter inside the school to plan out her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish on the other hand, still feeling the effects of a giant fist to her face, agitated that Heather had managed to get the better of her due to that little pipsqueak geek girl's interference as she was to find out through Heather's big mouth. Rubbing her face as she wandered the nearly abandoned hallways. She knew she saw Edna run back into the school, and as she could hear Heather's voice calling for her, the walls rumbling with each step that big bitch took, Trish knew that they both had the same intentions in mind. Find Edna, and in Trish's case, either force her to do what Trish wanted, which was to make her so big that Heather would be a speck at her feet along with the rest of the world. Or take it by force, and achieve the same thing. Heather no doubt also wanted more power added to her, which made things a bit tense for Trish as she could almost feel Heather's presence looming over the school, making this a race against time for the delinquent.</span></div></div>",

Not wasting any time, Trish ran into the school and started searching as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few moments of running, Trish entered the first classroom she saw. Much to her surprise, she had already found Edna. There she was, in the corner of the classroom, hiding under a desk. The source of this entire mess. With an enraged scowl on her face, Trish walked over to Edna and reached down to grab the geek girl by the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're the cause of all this, huh? Well, nerd, do you mind telling me why you thought it was a good idea to screw everything up for me right when I was about to get my revenge on that bitch once and for all?! I thought you hated her guts even more than me!\" Trish barked furiously as she violently pulled Edna to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" Edna couldn't even say a single word before Trish slapped her in the face and slammed her against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I don't even care why you did it! All I care about is finishing the job that I started! Now hurry up and blast me back up to size, or else I'll beat you black and blue and take that size gun of yours for myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna knew she had no choice in the matter at this point. Either she could give in to Trish's demands, or she could refuse and get pulverized by her. Either way the end result would be the same. Trish was gonna be growing again, rather or not Edna wanted her to. The choice she should make couldn't have been more obvious. Edna nodded in agreement, and Trish let go of her neck so that she could do her thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as Edna readied the gun and was about to fire, something terrible happened. The roof above their heads was torn from the building by the enormous alpha bitch Heather. They had been found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Ohoho, what have we here? It looks like I've finally found you, my puny little punching bag.\"</b> Heather said tauntingly, glaring down at Edna with her monstrous blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and shoot me!

Her grip was like iron, and no matter how hard she struggled, Edna was unable to break free from her grasp.

That I'd give you another chance to upstage me? HA! What a laugh! This is my school, bitches! I rule this place, and now I think it's time to expand my kingdom beyond the walls of this school. From this day on, I won't just be Heather Miles, queen of the school. Soon I'm going to be Heather Miles, queen of this entire puny planet! And to do that, I'm going to be needing that little toy of yours, Edna.\"</b> Heather said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather then carelessly dropped Trish back into the classroom and loosened her grip on Edna enough to pry the size gun from her tiny hand. Holding the ray at last, Heather wondered for a moment how she was going to be able to use it. However, soon after it shifted hands from Edna to Heather, the ray began to adjust its own size to be more suitable to that of its wielder. Heather's eyes went wide with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! You know, a toy like this is WAAAAAY too good for a pathetic little loser like you, Edna. It's much more suited for the hands of a beautiful and powerful goddess like me! Anyway, now that I've got this, I really have no more use for a disgusting bug like you. Get out of my sight, loser.\" Heather said, taunting her victim one more time before tossing Edna back into the classroom as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna fell hard and landed on the floor right next to Trish. Edna groaned in pain as she landed, feeling as though several of her bones were now broken. Looking at Trish and seeing the pained expression on her face as she clutched her chest, Edna could tell that her condition wasn't much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a few broken bones were the least of Edna's worries right now. Heather, her worst enemy, the person she hated more than anyone else in the world, had just stolen the sized gun that she had worked so hard and for so long to create. And if she figured out how to use it right, then she would hold the fate of the entire world in the palm of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Edna, her decision to design the ray with ease of use in mind was about to come back and bite her in the ass. Within moments of fiddling with it, Heather had already figured out how the ray worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question now is, what does she plan to do with it?</span></div></div>",

Satisfied she realized that her strength was as enormous as her body. At least she walked over the school yard, only clad in her underwear, a black thong and bra. Heather thought of herself as a goddess, she didn't care what those tiny mortals saw of her body. Occasional she wreaked havoc to objects in her path, marvelling how strong she had become. She loved every moment of this, how the sunlight glistened in her long golden hair and warmed her skin, how the now tiny students fled from her in terror. They were so scared that they didn't dare to be caught by Heathers hulking shadow. <b>\"That's right, you little bugs. Run from your new empress!\"</b>, Heather boomed, while she flattened a car with her right foot. With both hands she gently stroke her double-F breasts and let out a a deep moan. Perfect... This was just so perfect. Her \"ascension\" felt so right.<br>\r\nSuddenly she saw a group of girls, who didn't flee, but instead gaping at her in awe and fear. Heather smiled even broader, when she recognized the women. There was Tasha, with her waist-long blond hair. She was the only girl in school, who could pride herself to have an even more impressive bust than Heather. But unlike Heather, Tasha preferred to hide her assets by wearing wide clothes, which didn't emphasise her fantastic features. With more confidence and longer legs Tasha might have been able to compete with Heather for the title of the schools beauty queen, so Heather never encouraged the shy girl to change. Heather and Tasha differed in many ways. While Heather loved to humiliate people, Tasha was a gentle soul and a diligent student. Under different circumstances Heather would have picked her as one of her victims, but Tasha was too popular for this. No one, not even Heather, could have tormented her without being opposed by half the school, so Heather had decided to make Tasha part of her \"team\". The upsides of this choice were that many people decided that Heather couldn't be that bad, when a nice person like Tasha spent time with her. Tasha's parents were even wealthier than Heather's, so for Heather it had been legitimate to befriend with Tasha for social reasons, too. And last but not least it had improved her grades considerably, because Tasha was great in explaining and helping her with school issues. Next to Tasha she spotted the tall and athletic twin sisters Gisele and Emma, with their long dark hair, like usually tied to a pony-tail. From her high vantage point the giantess was almost unable to distinguish them. The only difference between the twins was a small beauty patch on Emma's right cheek. Both of them featured delicate faces with high cheek bones, dark brown eyes and tall and athletic bodies, with exactly the same measurements. Gisele claimed to have bigger breasts but couldn't prove it. They both sported fairly big breasts in C-Cup range. A bit apart from the three stood Elisabeth, called \"Liz\" - Heather's shadow. Since her 18th birthday the red-haired Liz worked as a fitness model, but ironically she wasn't very self-confident. So she searched for affirmationt through the group and especially Heather. She never questioned Heather's opinion, a \"trait\" Heather valued. With long strides she stepped in front of them, forcing them to look upwards. The four women looked up to see Heather's monumental breasts towering above them, hiding the blonde giantess face.<br>\r\n<b>\"But every empress needs a her nobles!\"</b>, Heather almost purred. With surprisingly nimble movements she switched the dials of the size gun and fired for quick shots, each beam hitting one of her friends straight in the chest. With giggles of pleasure and surprise the four started to swell in size. Heather focused on Tasha\u2019s boobs, which were swelling still bigger as she steadily grew taller. Her friends growth stopped at forty-five feet. They were as stunningly beautiful as ever, an orgasmic grin on their faces. Before they could react Heather ripped Gisele\u2019s and Emma\u2019s T-shirts. Liz, always eager to please Heather, got the hint and ripped her own clothes herself. Tasha hesitated, but Heather left her no chance. <i>\u201cWait!\u201d</i>, Tasha murmured as softly as a four-story woman could. Heather grinned at her seductively: <b>\"No, I won\u2019t!\u201d</b>. Skilled she shredded Tasha\u2019s wide top and pulled her close. A soft moan escaped Heather\u2019s red lips when she felt the skin of Tasha\u2019s bosom against hers. She had to admit they were monumental. Despite her five feet height advantage Tasha\u2019s breasts were bigger than hers. Teardrop-shaped and beautiful they seemed to defy gravity itself. <b>\" \u201cThere is no need for coyness, Tasha!\u201c, Heather said. <b>\"We\u2019re goddesses now. Who should stop us? Who should judge us? Who should harm us? This is the beginning of a new era!\u201d</b>. Heather saw the twins smile, they had always enjoyed to show their own superiority to others, just like her. Their belly abs looked they were chiselled out of marble. She watched Tasha\u2019s face again, clearly seeing Tasha\u2019s confusion. But there was another emotion, shown by her quickened breathing and flushed cheeks. Heather\u2019s smile showed her white teeth. They were turned on by the growth and horny as hell. Tasha reached down to her filled-beyond-capacity bra. She popped it open and let her big breasts free. \u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d she whispered, half moaning.<br>\r\n<b>\"Let us see what this bodies are capable of!\u201c </b>, Heather said, gently squeezing Tasha\u2019s right breast.<br>\r\n</b></b></span></div></div>",

She felt Heather's strength increasing along with her body. Forceful Heather pulled Trish up, the feet of the smaller giantess hovering abowve the ground. Gasping at the blonde Trish realized that standing she wouldn't even reach Heather's navel. Satisfied Heather grinned and dropped Trish. The smaller giantess wasn't prepared for it and she fell nearly fell back.<br>\r\n<b>\"Forget about the Queen!

Before Trish had a chance to react Heather's enormous body was on top of her, and she was pinning her wrists to the ground.

It wouldn't do much in the way of harming Trish as much as Heather would have possibly wanted, but it did do one thing. It stopped Edna from zapping Trish and making her more of a problem for someone who couldn't even take her on equal terms. An increase of size for Trish no matter by how much only meant a death sentence for Heather. There was only one problem however and both titans would see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flash of the device as Trish hit the ground, Edna being flung from her hand to skid across the ground. Though this would rough her up more so than she would have liked, Edna would come out alright, with a few scrapes and bumps. This was the least of her worries however as she knew the device had been fired, but wasn't sure what had happened. Her eye's much like Trish and Heather's feel onto one another, Edna of course eying being of them to look for any changes. She was relieved to find none, well relatively so as once both of them realized nothing had changed, the fight was back on with a vicious punch from Trish taking Heather back to the ground. Still, Edna couldn't help but wonder, where the beam had went....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike many students, one in particular found herself watching the ensuing battle from a safe distance. Unlike many of them, she wasn't covering her mouth or even watching with much in the way of fear. It wasn't to say she wasn't scared, she was just able to hide it under a cold exterior. Amongst the handful of Exchange students from Japan, she was one of them, however she stood out from them in a number of ways. One way would be her appearance, she sporting a head of dyed silver hair, mostly straight with a few spiky sections sticking out, nearly touching her shoulders in length. Dark eye's and fair skin, she also opts for a style all her own in the school. Today like many others being seen inn a black suit vest with a black and white pinstriped button up shirt underneath that. Black suit pants which pass over a pair of black boots. These things would be enough to set her apart from the other transfer students, but the fact that since arriving she had became fast associates with one Trish Pierce was one of the main ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Trish around as one of her followers, being consider amongst the formers clique of like minded delinquents, something she would be known for quickly due to a certain meanstreak she held alongside her normally silent exterior. Something that held true even now as this young lady simply watched the fight unfolding, that same cold look she had from day to day, though eye's a bit wider than usual as the absurdity of the situation was a bit much even for her. Still, she had yet to scream, no matter how close the fight got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as a certain glow enveloped her body, a beam of energy flying past the two behemoths and striking her. She would barely even make a sound as she idly looked down at herself. Noticing an all too familiar purple glow which overtook her and within time, her body would begin to expand, she who was called Aoi would soon join the fray....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name</b>: Yukimura Aoi<br>\r\n<b>Age</b>: 18<br>\r\n<b>Appearance</b>: Aoi sports a head of dyed silver hair, mostly straight with a few spiky sections sticking out, nearly touching her shoulders in length.

Body wise, she's taller than some of the others that came from her country, standing at 5'3\" and weighing just over one-hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<b>Personality</b>: Cold and calculated, Aoi is one of very few words and yet with just a glare can often scare others into submission. Far from a brute like Trish, she likes to think things through before acting. Though one would beware when messing with her, as Aoi possess a meanstreak which would even cause Trish to shiver at. This all packaged into a small frame which even in the most intense of dangers can keep a cool head and a straight face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The student body, the trees, school everything, and it would be as a result of the purple glow which surrounded her. Though it wouldn't exactly be a mystery as to what had caused the whole ordeal, hell both Heather and Trish both had been quite vocal about it. Edna McCoy, the geek which Heather had tormented for years now, and even Trish hadn't been the nicest to her. As odd as it would seem, Aoi had taken up for the poor girl from the shadow's, tormenting most of the tormenters and making them back off, as well as deterring Trish from going all out on Ms. McCoy. It wasn't out of any sort of care, but more respect she held towards the intellect of the girl, something which shouldn't be mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good reason would of course be the situation which was playing out now, Trish and Heather brawling it out, well sort of. Heather Miles' may have been the top of the food chain in the school due to her popularity and her families pull in the town. Though in Trish's world, none of that mattered and Heather would currently have her face in the ground and the tread of Trish's boot firmly pressing into the back of her head. Neither of the two would take notice to what was happening to their backs, Heather only able to see the ground and Trish enjoying this far too much. It wouldn't be until darkness overtook them that Trish would turn to look for the source. An utter look of confusion on her face which would fall away to a second's worth of terror. The sudden \"Darkness\" wasn't nothing more than a shadow. One which cast itself far beyond just them and covering not only the school but most of the town as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation was spiraling out of control at the sight of the third giant woman, this one whom was still growing by the looks of it. Though Trish's horror would turn to arrogant glee to see that it was one of her own whom had grown. Though a bit of her did hate to see that she was now bigger than her, but with loyalty that could be fixed. Aoi's growth would slow to a stop, leaving her in the ball park of about two thousand feet tall. This of course leaving Trish and the downed Heather having to look up to see this woman's ankle. Of course, they were still fifty feet tall, and this information alone would be quite humbling for anyone at ground level whom possibly didn't even register to her at this point. Trish and Heather were but mere bugs, whilst humanity were ants. The look in Aoi's eye;'s that distant and uncaring look as she simply looked over her crossed arms to the ground beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt somewhat eery that she wasn't reacting much tot he fact that she was now the most powerful being on this planet. <b>\"I am god....\"</b> She would mutter, mostly to herself than addressing the beings at her boots. Her tone was calm, and eerily dead. It wasn't a proclamation, it was more of an inner thought. This Goddess as it were would take but a moment to look closer at the scene at her right foot. Though she would find that her view wasn't perhaps the greatest from her vantage point. She taking a moment to crouch down. This action alone causing many screams as well as a renewed panic to be driven back to Trish. Even she able to hear the air being displaced by such a large being suddenly moving as she was. It wouldn't be long before Aoi's face would be hovering dangerously close above and Trish's confidence would soon be rising. She would watch as Aoi's gaze drifted over to her, and simply locked onto Heather. That certain glint in her eye which she had come to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing to herself Trish would kick Heather over to her back, allowing the blonde to get a full view as Aoi's hand simply engulfed her. Kicking and screaming with renewed vigor, Heather would do all she could, but if she couldn't fight back against an equally scaled Trish. She had no chance against the titan that was this exchange student. Her vision would blur as Aoi stood back to her full height, bringing Heather before her face. The silent girl remaining as such as she looked her over with cold eyes. Heather doing what she could, pleading with her, hoping for some mercy, though what she got in return would turn her ghost white, Aoi would lick her lips. Confused at first, Heather would soon catch on and she could only beg to the emotionless face of this giant. From down below, all Trish could do was laugh evilly. Her eye's scanning the ground for Edna whom was launched from her grasp. Unbeknownst to her, that the geek girl had already retreated for the moment. \"Come on, hurry up and finish that bitch. We got a geek girl who still needs to make me bigger!\" Trish would demand, only causing Aoi's attention to fall upon her, a kicking and screaming Heather still trying to escape her fate. Aoi did have a desire to find Edna herself, but it was doubtful for the same reasons as Trish....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Heather groaned in pain as she fell to the ground once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, regardless of the pain, she struggled to her feet and charged Trish one more time. Trish was already more than capable of beating her within an inch of her life even at the same size, and as her current state evidenced, Trish had every intention of doing just that. If she managed to grow even more, that was it. Game over. If Trish got any bigger than she already was, she was going to hold nothing back and kill her on the spot. Heather knew that if she didn't stop this before it happened, she was going to die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Trish sensed Heather coming, and once again she defeated her without even looking. As Heather ran toward Trish in desperation, Trish reached out and grabbed Heather by the neck with an iron grip. She then lifted her up for a moment before slamming her back into the ground below. With her down, Trish planted her foot on Heather's back to pin her down and ensure that she wouldn't interfere any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather was beginning to cry in fear once again. She couldn't believe how outmatched she was, even at her size. Trish was just too strong for her. Even without looking she was able to easily beat her up. And now she was going to become even bigger! If she couldn't defeat Trish now, all hope was lost. This was her only  chance, while they were still on even ground. If she failed she was going to die for sure. Trish would grow bigger than ever before, and then she would kill her without hesitation. And unfortunately for her, as she felt the pain of Trish's shoe grinding into her spine, Heather quickly realized that she had indeed failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"What are you waiting for, nerd?! Hurry up and blast me already!\" </b>Trish barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Edna followed the massive delinquent's orders and pulled the trigger, firing the beam at her one more time.

Struggling to her feet, Heather could only look up in terror and watch as Trish quickly grew bigger than ever before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Trish finished growing, Heather looked and was terrified to discover that she was now only eye level with Trish's...</span></div></div>",

Fear causing a near crippling amount of dread to build within her for as she got to her feet, she would notice on thing. As she looked straight out, she still would need to look up just to see the ankle of this woman. She instead treated to the near overpowering sight of the DC logo on the side of Trish's old beat up sneakers. Their age alongside her indisputable colossal size making their presence known. Still, Heather still had it better than everyone else, whilst still a mere insect to the massive delinquent. The rest of the world were hardly even ants in comparison. Edna on ground level could only look up, barely able to see even past the toe end of Trish's shoe due to being so close, shaking her head as she questions what she had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't bad enough that Heather Miles, the biggest bully in the school was fifty feet tall after a misfire which originally put Trish at that size. Trish, an aggressive young woman who hates the world, whom was now over two-thousand feet tall and absolutely dominated everything around her, including her meal ticket in Edna, but most importantly, her prey in Heather. The queen of the school whom it took a moment to register with, the dire nature of her situation. She taking a few steps back away from Trish, she looking up to see the delinquents green eye's piercing down upon her, a gleefully sadistic grin on her face. <b>\"Oh, this is going to be fun, thanks geek girl.\"</b> She would boom, getting a strange sense of self worth out of Edna as she was thanked. Though she knew that Trish meant it only sarcastically, but she needed to look at the positives in situations like these! Such as the fact that Trish was once again putting her attention on Heather Miles. The blonde fifty foot woman would would simply turn on her heels to try and run, but before she even took a step. She would feel the impressive power of Trish's shoe hitting her in the back. Sending her forward with authority, shaking the immediate area with what was only a weak prod of Trish's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would only coax a husky moan from Trish, that feeling of power of this being. A being which was gigantic in her own right, yet still nothing compared to her. She almost couldn't help herself as she brought her foot over Heather's downed body. She beginning to simply roll Heather's body underneath her unforgiving treads. The rough and unyielding rubber which threatened to simply rend Heather's flesh from bone as it pulled, tugged and certainly took skin from her. Causing her to simply scream in pain, and yet only causing Trish to purr in satisfaction. It wouldn't be long before a loud rumble would be heard as Trish would shift her weight, allowing herself to take a seat on the ground. Ending the time in the sun, as well as the lives of the students unlucky enough to of been caught underneath her jean covered ass of this girl. She having taken her foot off of Heather as to not crush her as she did so. It wouldn't be much longer after this that she would encircle her legs around the remainder of the school, touching the soles of her shoes together to simply create an inescapable wall with her legs. Heather, barely able to pull her body up, bleeding from the patches of skin she was missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely able to comprehend what was happening as she looked back to Trish's feet.  It a hard pill to swallow as she would note that the length of Trish's shoes, they had to be nearly six times her size, this just pounding into her head how tiny she was in comparison. Of course, to Edna who also found herself trapped, now looking up from that hole in the ceiling which Heather had created. She going back to her hiding spot under the desk until she could figure out what to do. Heather of course wouldn't be so lucky as it wouldn't be but another moan to snap her back to attention just in time to see Trish's hand coming for her, her other free hand massaging her crotch through her jeans. It clear at this point, that being so big was beginning to get Trish hot and bothers, the question is, what was she planning?</span></div></div>",

She picked up the smaller girl in her massive palm, bringing her up to her face.  Trish watched the other teen writhe around in agony, a cold expression on the punk girl's face as she decided what to do next.  Grabbing Heather with the thumb and index fingers of her other hand, she squeezed until her body burst like a grape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!  That was easy!\" Trish said victoriously, standing up to her full height, wiping the blood stains on her pants.  \"Now what do I -- hmm...\" She stopped mid-sentence, as she glanced towards downtown.  She had always hated this city.  And now that she towered over everything else, now that every person was barely a bug-sized speck to her, she could finally do something about it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting up one of her humongous feet, Trish started walking, every step she took demolishing everything below her in seconds.  She casually stomped her way through the city, crushing entire neighborhoods instantly, leaving behind huge craters in the ground, setting off quakes that could be felt for miles. A chuckle escaped her lips as she heard terrified screams far below on the ground, the distant wail of a siren as emergency crews were notified.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down one of the city's main streets, Trish effortlessly crunched rows of houses and businesses under her feet.  Asphalt breaks into huge chunks and flies off in every direction, parked cars are left completely flattened.  A handful of military helicopters approach this rampaging giant, but she deals with them in seconds, smacking them out of the air as if they were gnats and watching the tiny fireball erupt against her hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish makes it to the edge of the downtown area, laughing cruelly as she realized the tallest structure didn't even reach her waist.  Squatting down, she eyes an office building that barely made it to her laces and rips it out of the ground.  She hears the terror coming from the people inside as they're lifted into the air and deposited on her palm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say goodbye to your miserable little lives, you pathetic bugs!\" Her voice boomed out like thunder, rattling windows and forcing the people on the ground to cover their ears in pain.  Her fist began to crush the building in her hand, crumbling everything inside to dust.  Trish grinds her fingers together, watching as bloodied chunks of brick and metal fall to the earth, a look of satisfaction on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground behind her began to shake.  Glancing around, Trish saw someone approaching.  Someone she recognized from her school.  Standing as tall as Trish, another giant had entered the city, taking care not to cause any more damage than they had to as they walked closer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis person was...</span></div></div>",

Trish's temper was well known around school and the moment that things didn't go her way, it was game over for anyone near her. Unfortunately for Edna, she was close enough to her to take that chance. Of course, there was the possibility that this girl could remain interested in torturing Heather to death to notice. Edna wasn't prepared to take that risk however, as well as wanting to end Heather herself. That in mind, she turned her attention to Ruthie, her best friend and the one person she could trust the most. Of course, Ruthie's attention was on the sight before them, a hand covering her mouth as she stared on in horror, and giving Edna all the time she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouble checking the device, she took careful aim at Ruthie, her friend glancing just in time to see Edna pointing it at her. Though she wouldn't even get a moment to protest before that all too familiar, and eery glow of purple surrounded her. Many students screamed out as they saw this, but more importantly, Ruth was gaining size. Sprouting from her normal height of 5'4\" and quickly passing the 10 foot mark. Ruthie couldn't help but look around, frantic as to what was happening to her, almost afraid of what she was becoming. Though, as she continued to gain height, she began to notice just how less imposing Trish became. In time, she would top out, matching her height and leaving her with an almost surreal feeling. Here was this troublemaker, this delinquent who was known for fighting. One of which who moments ago was towering over her, now standing close to the same height again, at least relatively. Although as many of the students continued to scream and point from her sneaker covered feet, it was painfully clear that things weren't normal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEye's hitting the ground, Ruthie could feel her heart jump from her chest. Down below, these....people looked so tiny, so unimportant, insignificant to her. Yet unlike Trish, she was far from a psycho, Ruthie knew that these were people and one of them at her feet was her best friend, which did this to her. <b>\"Edna, what the hell?!\"</b> She couldn't help but shout, unintentionally causing many to fall to their knees holding their ears from the volume alone. Her voice raining down like thunder which shook all to their core. More importantly, it was enough to get Trish's attention he turned to look in the direction of the sound. It of course sounding like a normal voice. which seemed odd to her considering she was a giant now. <b>\"Well, hello there.\"</b> Trish would comment, a grin on her face and a lick of her lips following as she looked at Ruthie. Heather continuing to scream from her grasp. Things beginning to look bright for Edna's plan as she looked on. Smirking to herself, she knew it was time to go with her plan, and she would merely give Ruthie one more look. Noting for a moment the <i>odd</i> smile that she seemed to give Trish. Had she the time to spare, this may have been a little more than an afterthought, but her mind was currently on that device to bring Trish down.</span></div></div>",

Three minutes ago, that day had been turned upside down, as Trish, potential psychopath whom harbored an obvious crush on Ruth, became the size of a small building and decided to destroy resident alpha-bitch Heather Miles. But just to make it better, it turns out Ruth's best friend, Edna McCoy, was behind all of this madness, and seemed intent on making the whole situation even more insane, enlarging Ruth as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lot to process, is the point; Ruth can be forgiven for not immediately noticing how close Trish had smoothly slipped next to her. Edna, at their feet, had no choice but to notice, as movements that seemed minor to the two giants were a great deal more disruptive to those small students at their feet. Still, she kept her focus, glad that the plan was, for the moment, proceeding to her designs. Trish was distracted, and that would give Edna the time she needed to recalibrate her device and shrink them all back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish, for her part, couldn't care less about the students at her feet, being much more concerned with the only other one at her scale. She'd lust for Ruthie for some time, and now that the sexy little (well, relatively little) firecracker was at Trish's own tremendous scale, she was going to take advantage of the situation. She'd been completely honest while taunting Heather earlier; she was going to do whatever she desired as a giantess, letting all of her inhibitions drop aside. And what she wanted, at that moment, was Ruth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth didn't recoil when the other giant ran her free hand down Ruth's side, having noticed her flirtations from day one, and decidedly conflicted on whether or not to reciprocate. At the moment, though, trying to make sense of this mess, she didn't have the wherewithal to stop the amorous Trish, and frankly, she rather enjoyed the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this just too lucky?\" Trish whispered, tantalizingly close to Ruth's neck. \"I'm just getting everything I want, today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to snap Ruthie out of her trance. \"No,\" she said suddenly. \"Luck doesn't have anything to do with it. Edna does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling, the titanic teen firmly, (but gently), grabbed her BFF off the ground, shocking the girl genius and foiling her attempt to adjust her amazing device. \"Ruthie, what are you doing?\" Edna demanded, shocked at her friend's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing?\" Ruthie repeated in a somewhat softer voice, not wanting to her Edna's ears. \"What are YOU doing? Why did you make us giants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish's eyes lit up. \"Wait, what? Nerd girl did this to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, look, it wasn't quite supposed to happen as it did,\" Edna tried to explain; Ruthie certainly wanted to know more, but Trish would have no more of it. She'd already heard all she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stow it, geek,\" the punk girl snapped, grinning with lust and malice. \"Here's what's gonna' happen: you're gonna make me and Ruthie bigger. A lot bigger. I'm gonna' show this whole stupid town the back of my hand, and I don't want anything to be able to stop me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth's eyes grew wide in shock. \"Are you INSANE? That's terrible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like you don't want to,\" Trish whispered, licking her lips again. \"Think of it, sexy: we'd be queens. Everyone would have to do what we say. And we can deal with bitches like this,\" she gestured to Heather, who had at this time assumed a fetal position in her tormentor's hand. \"The way they deserve. Besides,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with this, she pressed her body against Ruth's, eliciting a small, surprised gasp from the other giant girl. \"Being big is pretty hot. And I didn't think you could get any hotter. I'll show you the best damn time you've ever had...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie turned bright red, obviously aroused, obviously tempted, and obviously torn. She glanced down at Edna, who clearly thought this was a terrible idea. And she glanced back at Trish, replying with bedroom eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't hurt anyone cool like your nerd friend, there,\" Trish added. \"She can even come watch the show. We'd just put the pricks of the world in their place. C'mon. You know you wanna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie hesitated, biting her lower lip before responding.</span></div></div>",

Even through the look in her eyes and the closeness which brought her breath to a halt. She couldn't shake the feeling that what was being suggested was wrong. \"I'm sorry Trish, but we can't do this, it's just not right!\"[/color] Her voice was very apologetic, genuinely sorry for what she had to say to Trish. She feeling the Punk back away from her, she practically able to feel the disappointment radiating off Ms. Pierce without even needing to look at her. \"Edna just needs to shrink us back down...\" It would be the final words which sealed the deal, it was Ruthie's final words. With hopeful eye's she would spin to look at Trish, Ruthie's own shoes causing a bit of a quake and many students to back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough what she saw on Trish's face wasn't something the enjoyed, it was the look of detachment. Trish's green eyes were staring holes through Ruthie whom admittedly could feel her own pulse quickening just under their glare. Edna in Ruthie's palm immediately didn't like the direction this seemed to be taking. Her thoughts confirmed as she would watch Trish take a step forward, the dull thud of her shoe hitting the ground, leaving an imprint in the ground. Her right hand would come to rest on Ruthie's cheek, caressing it lightly as if to console her. For a brief moment, she did feel as if she were safe. \"It's a pity...\" Trish's voice would be hard to read as she began. She would practically whisper this to herself as if the two before her no longer mattered. \"Such a pretty face, but....that will only get you so far.\" Her words would gain a sharp edge to them as she neared the end of her sentence. To the point that Ruthie's eye's would widen as she saw what was coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish would be quick to use her grip on Ruthie's cheek, sliding her hand back to grab Ruthie by the back of her head and pulling her in to drive the point of her knee into her sternum. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Ruthie!\"</font> Edna would practically squeak from inside her friends grip. She could see the pain in Ruthie's eyes, the tears forming from having this happen. She in her mind was looking to help Trish, once back to normal, they could have made a run at what happened within this short time. Edna's thoughts would be a bit interrupted however as Trish's giant hand would peel her effortlessly from Ruthie's weakened grip. Trish's fingers wrapping around her like a vice, keeping her arms at her sides as she wiggled for freedom. She would still be better off than her rival in Trish's other hand whom was fully consumed in her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Ruthie, I really did like you, and I still do, but unfortunately, I favor the power we have now a bit more.\" Trish would take this time to move toward Ruthie, not caring for what her shoes crushed under them along her way. She crouching a bit to meet what would be Ruthie's eye level as she was still doubled over for air. \"We could have had alot of fun, but you wanted to try and ruin it all. Trying to save the worthless insects we used to live amongst.\" Ruthie would do her best to try and shove Trish away. Though her weakened body would do little else but annoy Trish who shoulder checked her into the ground. Her body hitting with a rumble and flattening much of the school which was left. Spitting at the display, Trish would only crouch fully now next to Ruthie's body, she taking a moment to inspect her once again. \"It's a waste, but realistically, you weren't the only good looking one in school. Who knows, maybe that exchange student Mizuki wouldn't mind taking your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie would once again try and fight back, but it would earn her nothing but more punishment as Trish simply placed a knee into her chest and held her down. Shaking her head in disbelief. Edna would plead from her grasp to leave her friend alone, but she wouldn't even be acknowledged for the time being. Trish was more focused on sending a message to not only Ruthie, but the world. \"Why fight me in this Ruthie? What to save people like this?\" Trish would question as she brought her hand containing Heather up, allowing the Princess to see daylight for the first time in quite a bit as she was roughly contained in her fist. \"They mean nothing to us now, or I guess just me now, just watch...\" Without even a second thought she would close her hand around a screaming Heather. The Blonde feeling the ultimate force which was Trish's power magnified with her size. Her grip easily passing anything man made and could no doubt turn a car to tinfoil. The screaming would sharply intensify before a sickening crunch was heard and then nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn but a second, Heather Miles, queen of the school was crushed in this Punk's hand without any remorse. Though Heather had been a bully, still, both Ruth and Edna couldn't help but wonder if what was being unleashed on the town was just that much worse than anything Heather could have done. Furthermore, at the forefront of this would be the inescapable truth that it was all Edna's fault. Which speaking of her, Trish after tossing heathers body away and wiping the blood off her hand with the help of Ruth's shirt. She would soon be the center of Trish's attention. \"Now, I did mention I wanted to be bigger.\"[/color] The geek girl's blood would run cold at the mention of making the delinquent any bigger. She was bad enough at this size, what could she do at a bigger scale?! \"And now, I'm to be grown alone, unless I say otherwise. She had her chance.\" This would make matters worse for Edna to know that Ruthie would hold little to no hold over Trish now. She dismissing her friend as a liability to her rule. Trish's grip would loosen and she had her orders, what will Edna do?</span></div></div>",

A small chuckle escaping her as she saw the look of distress in the eyes of the one she wanted most. True to it, Ruthie continued to gnaw on her bottom lip, allowing a small sound to escape her as she continued thinking. For a moment the school of students at their feet could only stare up silently, almost as if their future hinged on her answer. Though, to be fair, for most if not all of them, depending on Trish's intentions, it did as Ruth was the only one capable of quelling Trish's aggression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Well, I mean, when you put it like that....\"</b> She would advert her eyes from Trish, cheek flaring red as she felt Trish's fingers run past her, grabbing her and pulling her in closer. Edna in the palm of Ruthie's hand and Heather in the palm of Trish's free hand. It was a sight to behold for each of the small cargo. Heather of course checking out mentally long ago, rocking back in forth in Trish's hand, waiting to die. Edna on the other hand, could only stare up horrified as Trish's face came into full view. Threatening to take up her entire field of vision as she leaned in close. Those green eyes practically glaring a hole through her, she too afraid to even move, fearful of what she might do if Edna raised the size gun. The cocky grin of Trish eating away at Edna as she was helpless in the palm of her best friend. <b>\"I figured you would appreciate this most, geek girl. After all, we've always had a silent understanding for one another. We both hated this bitch in my hand right now.\"</b> She would begin, she unlike Ruthie, not caring about the volume of her voice or what effect it may have on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna could only cover her ears, much to the silent glee of Trish who looked on at what effect the simply action of talking was having on \"normal\" people. She could only imagine what it would be like when she was miles tall, after all she knew she was going to get her way. Even though Ruthie had yet to agree, she knew she had won. <b>\"Of course, we both also care about what's best for Ruthie, and what's best for her is quite simply, me.\"</b> Manic eyes, a slightly psychotic grin on her face, this woman was mad, crazy and now fifty feet tall and wanting more. Edna had to stop this and now, the sight of Trish patting Ruthie on the head and pulling her even closer. Shifting the world for Edna was beginning to make her sick. \"Now, you listen here, you big-\" She would only get so far before a slight shake of Ruthie's hand would get her to stop. Although, as she looked up, she could see that Trish had nothing to do with it, she was merely laughing at her as Ruthie decided to interrupt. <b>\"She's right Edna, make us bigger.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Edna couldn't help but look up at Ruthie's eyes, betrayed. Although rather than the cold and callous gaze that she got from Trish, she found the still conflicted friend of hers. Cheeks still burning red as they were prodded by Trish who was thrilled to hear the news. <b>\"Edna, you know I love you like a sister, and would never do anything to hurt you. I mean, watching Heather mistreat you all these years, it's eaten at me. Here's a chance to fix things and make it right. I'm still your best friend, just bigger, okay?\"</b> The tone in her voice was warm, genuine. It was almost enough to ease Edna's concern, after all, this was what she wanted. Trish was of course the wild card in all this. Chuckles able to be heard from behind her, and leaving the student body to flee in terror at Ruthie's decision. <b>\"You can't run...\"</b> Trish would coldly announce as she tilted her head, looking down at these people like mere insects, already allowing her mind to disregard them. Though there was one that did matter, and she rested in the hand of her fancy. <b>\"Get with it, I have a promise to uphold.\"</b> She would harshly order, looking to Ruthie with those eye's of hers. Causing the conflicted Ruthie to shrink away, this only fueling Trish's on all the more. The defeated Edna having no choice, would turn the gun on both these giants, and fire, enlarging their already gigantic size...</span></div></div>",

She let out a low, sultry moan as she continued to expand, one that quickly turned into a cruel chuckle. \"Look out below, ants,\" she sneered as her enlarging feet plowed through the quickly-evacuating school. Trish had absolutely no intention of restraining herself, or keeping her promise of controlled violence to Ruthie; her new friend would see things her way soon enough. And then this whole fucking stupid world would pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth, for her part, did her best to give Edna a reassuring smile as she ballooned outwards, although the sensation was quite distracting. She was glad that the students at their feet had the good sense to get out of the way, although she couldn't bring herself to feel sorry that their high school was going to be wiped off the map. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was Edna, who was already trying to figure out how to fix all of this. She had a measure of control over the situation as long as Ruth and Trish still needed her to keep making them larger, but she doubted that would last as soon as Trish had a mind to get rid of her. Ruth wouldn't allow anything like that, but accidents do happen, particularly when you're as enormous as these two were getting. Taking a look at the expanding plain of Ruth's palm, Edna realized her estimates were correct; the two were petering out at around five hundred feet tall. Edna had NO desire to double-check her math by peering over the edge of Ruthie's hand, thank you very much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish looked around, taking in the view of the suburban landscape at their feet, and the cityscape in the distance. It called to her, an invitation to some ungodly and truly righteous destruction, but it would have to wait. She had to deal with something more immediate. She still had the tiny Heather in her hand, of course, but she also had the truly stunning Ruth before her. Size apparently agreed with the other giantess, because Trish had never seen anyone more stunning than at that moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole situation was turning the unruly goddess on like never before. Which of her lustful cravings is she going to satisfy, first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although Ruthie did look rather inviting at that moment for Trish to move in for, there was still something else, an afterthought in the back of her mind. Heather, the reason for this mess, although it wasn't as if Trish was complaining about being five-hundred feet tall, still she wasn't going to allow her to go either. After all, when she began to think back, as would Ruthie and especially Edna. Heather had been a problem for all of their lives, the one thing that they shared in common. A problem that Trish would have dealt with years ago by caving Heather's face in, had the school not been so direct in keeping her from doing so. Although the world where Heather was on top, having everyone wrapped around her finger, they were gone, and the days where this bitch wasn't even as big as Trish's pinky finger were beginning. A grin formed on Trish's lips as she stared down at Heather, curled up in a ball sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh how so much that she wanted to just close her hand, smashing this girl in the palm of her hand, a thought which would cause her fingers to curl inward slightly, wanting to do it. Though a bit of control went a long way and an eery chuckle would soon follow as she eyed Heather who seemed to be out of it. <b>\"It's time for the queen to return to her kingdom.\"</b> Trish would snidely say, though her voice was powerful enough to rock Heather back to this new world of hers. The plain of Trish's palm being what she immediately saw, until she looked up. When that happened, all that she saw was the face of her tormentor, those cold green eye's staring back at her. Though, much to her surprise, Heather would find herself being lowered to the ground. Was Trish letting her go, or was she just putting her on the ground to stomp her flat? Well much to this girls surprise, and after a moment of Trish clearing way the roof of the already crumbling high school. This action alone causing a few of the hopeful Teachers and Student who returned to the building for sanctuary to now bolt from their spots like roaches, feeding Trish's ego all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a moments notice, Heather would surprisingly be softly put down, back into the school, in one of the hallways that ended in a dead end. Her back against that very wall at the end. This was also on the second floor, she able to see the staircase at the end a good fifty feet away. Likewise, she could catch a small glimpse of the destruction these two growing had done. On her way down, much of the school had been destroyed, this being one of the few wings of the school which made it. Tears painting her cheeks, Heather could only look with hopeful eye's to the sky and see what game Trish was playing here. <b>\"Ironic isn't it? You're Kingdom, where you were queen bitch is now crumbled at <i>my</i> feet. Seeing as how now, there is nothing holding me back from just killing you, that makes the whole experience a bit boring.\"</b> Trish's words continued to bring hope to Heather. Although a small part of her knew it was just her bringing her up so that she could be knocked back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she had to cling to whatever it was that she could get, for her own sanity's sake. This was her only choice in the long run anyways, her only hope for survival was to move forward and hope for the best, rather than accepting that she was as dead as she is now. <b>\"I tell ya' what Princess, you get away from me and you live. I catch you, and well, you're fucked.\"</b> A cruel grin spread across her face, Trish knew it was impossible for Heather to get away from her. With the roof cleared out, she could see every move that Heather would make, including each class room. She just wanted to torture Heather with hopes of survival that she never had in the first place. Still, it wouldn't stop Heather from trying, the blonde wanting to see tomorrow bolting immediately forward, running the long distance for the staircase. It wouldn't be until she was a few feet away from it that she would have to put on the breaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sky came crashing down, Trish's shoe with her foot inside it, attached to her leg. Debris raining down, coating the air with dust and the sort, but more importantly, Trish's stomp which let out a resounding thud and created a tremor which knocked Heather on her ass. The staircase disappeared under her foot, and when she pulled it back up and back out of the building, Heather could see that the staircase had broken way, leaving her with a two story drop to the ground down onto the broken cement which was the staircase. \"N-no!\" She would shout before rolling over back to her feet and running in the opposite direction. Turning to the first classroom she could find. Only looking skyward for a moment to see Trish beaming down at her cruelly, shifting her stance. Moving her foot from where it was, a bit of debri raining down from her foot as she moved it one the classroom and did the same thing.  As Heather would open that door, Trish's foot would come into view, causing Heather to shout as she was knocked back again, she only able to see the DC Logo on the side of Trish's shoe from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please, stop!\" Heather would shout before moving back into the fetal position, crying loudly as she just wanted to be left alone. Though it was obvious from the near deafening laughter above that it was not going to happen. <b>\"Done already? I though you had more fight in you than that, oh well.\"</b> She would practically scoff at Heather, that smile never leaving her face. The next thing Heather would feel would be the enormous pads of Trish's finger tips grabbing her around the ankles before being pulled up. Heather having quickly tried to stand as a result of this, on all fours before being pulled. Would have the unlucky luxury of her hands giving way, and the side of her head smacking into the floor hard enough to put her on the verge of passing out. The last thing she hearing as she was being lifted all those hundreds of feet into the air upside down was Trish's voice. <b>\"Hey geek girl....\"</b> Everything would go black before she could hear the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather would be quite surprised to wake up some time later. She screaming loudly as she came too, her body jolting around before she came to the conclusion that she was okay. Her ankles were free of Trish's grasp, she seemed to be on some sort of ground. Of course, this sense of being fine would be ripped away from her rather quickly as not only did she take note of the flesh covered ground, but she also took note of something else in front of her. A pair of massive black flip flops with the owners feet placed in them. Heather's eye would widen as she was left to look up and up to find the face of Edna glaring down at her, arms crossed over her chest. <b>\"How's it feel to be tiny?\"</b> Edna would practically growl down at her, eye's never softening as she had her enemy at her feet. The only bad thing here was that her hands were currently tied when it came to doing anything, and the reason would make itself known soon enough. <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"Finally awake, Princess?</b></font> A voice, the voice of god it seemed to Heather. Booming didn't even begin to describe it as she was left to simply cover her ears and scream from it threatening to blow out her ear drums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe she turned around to see the source, she nearly passed out from the sight. It was Trish, the still five-hundred foot tall Trish, and considering the still normal sized Edna was standing in Ruthie's palm also at her respective five-hundred foot height. It was safe to say that heather had been shrunk to a small size compared to Edna. Which made her unfathomably small to the other two. What else, Trish currently had her shoe in her hand, the opening facing Ruthie's palm. Both Edna and especially Heather could feel the arm air coming from them, the smell causing Heather to wretch. After all, these were the shoes that Trish had worn the better part of two or three years, her shoes that she trained in. They having seen their fair share of battles and collected many years worth of sweat and grime. Trish would only taunt the small Heather as she leaned in to take a smell, and pull her head back disgusted. <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"Man it stinks in there, well, welcome to your tomb Heather, You are going to die in here.\"</b></font> The small girl could only shake her head back and forth, crawling backwards on her hands as she wanted to get away. Though all she felt was Edna's hand wrapping around her body, lifting her up wordlessly. <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"Well geek girl, toss her in.\"</b></font>  Would be all that Trish would say, nearly deafening Heather who screamed for her not too. Though Edna wanted to make Heather pay herself, there was still something appealing about what was to happen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ruthie merely stifled a laugh as she watched Edna in her palm, holding the now tiny Heather in her own hand. Something of a spectacle to be holding someone smaller, who was also holding someone smaller than them. The sadistic grin on Trish's face was almost contagious as Edna couldn't help but give Heather that exact look. Heather pleading for her life with Edna, would receive no mercy, only a shake to stop her begging as Edna's eyes showed no mercy in them. \"You're so lucky it's not me who's doing this.\" She would say down to the tiny Heather, her voice low and direct. It sent a chill up the tiny girls spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she would simply toss Heather where she was intended to go. It wasn't a hard throw by any stretch of the means, but she still needed to clear the gap. Almost immediately, Edna's hands would come up to cover her nose, the smell finally reaching her now that her attention was off of Heather. Of course for the miniscule girl, she would land with a wet smack onto a soft yet firm surface. Still sobbing loudly, and pushing herself to her feet, it wouldn't take long for her to realize where she was. The black ground, even to her small size giving way under her feet. The ground moist as was the air which seemed to be almost a thick haze, warm and making it hard to breathe. She was inside Trish's shoe, Edna had actually sentenced her to death in here. As her new world, or tomb as Trish called it would shift to even out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but cough and wheeze, practically choking on the sweat infused air, her wails unable to reach anything on the outside world. Though a deep rumble of laughter would be enough to shake Heather's attention skyward. She screaming loudly as she saw the last thing she wanted to see, it was Trish's face staring in at her. The evil smile on her face forcing Heather to crawl away, though it was hopeless she was trapped. It wouldn't be long before Trish's face seemed to get further and further away, a puzzling sight, though it soon dawned on her. \"She's lowering her shoe.....\" Heather thought, and her assumption would be confirmed as it wasn't soon after that she saw the most terrifying sight imaginable. Trish's foot, encased in a dirty and dingy sock entering the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell inside had already been nearly unbearable, but the source of it all was entering and now it would all be trapped inside. Heather couldn't help but scream as she quickly pushed herself up, attempting to run deeper into the shoe to escape this fate. Though it was too late, it wouldn't be but a moment later that she was bulldozed by this massive foot, it sliding over her and eventually coming to rest, pinning her face down into the sole of her shoe under the arch of her foot. Somehow Heather was not crushed, but she was left no room to move. Her face forced down into the sweaty sole of this shoe, leaving an impression and a pool of smelly liquid to gather inside it. Heather couldn't help but cough loudly. Screaming and praying for help, the heat generated from Trish's foot beginning to have it's own effect. Causign Heather great pain as she was suffocating, drowning in a small pool of sweat. Heather's struggles would only continue for a minute or two, but they would be the worst few minutes of her miserable life, which would then end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Trish, it was a true rush, excitement, and got her heart racing. To have ended a life under foot, subjected them to the torture of your lowliest body part. It was enough to get a purr from her as she looked down upon Edna in Ruthie's palm. This causing her to step back, slightly terrified of what this psycho had planned next. Truth be told, she wanted more, more power, more size and more destruction. She wanted to be able to hold a city in her hand and crush it out of existence. Hell she may even want to put a city inside her shoe and repeat what she did to Heather. Although there was also Ruthie, and Trish has enjoyed quite an amount of fun already. Perhaps it was best to focus on her, or even allow her to choose what they did next.</span></div></div>",

This psychopath was finally breaking away from any sense of control and was losing herself in the power which wasn't even meant for her in the first place. Still, Edna did have a trick up her sleeve and it was quite the plan, although it did certainly mean death for many people. Ruthie still beside herself, wanting to get Edna from this crazy woman would be stopped when she would hear Edna's voice. \"Fine, I'll do it.\" Of course it wasn't what Ruthie wanted to hear, but it was everything that Trish wanted and then some. <b>\"Good, now get to it, or pop under my thumb.\"</b> Trish would edge her on, content to get her way and not seeming to notice the crafty grin on Edna's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna would take but a moment to crank that dial, far past what she had EVER intended for it to go. A loud read light showing and a warning sign appearing on the display. Still she chose to ignore it, instead aiming it right for Trish's face and allowing it to fire. Ruthie was quick to want and stop this, but it was far too late. That purple glow emitted with a tinge of red to it, immediately surrounding Trish. This however would be all that anyone remembered. The Device beeping loudly would kick back, allowing a bright light to go off, and the next thing Edna knew, she was waking up at ground level. Waking up on a soft surface, she almost immediately thinking that it was Trish's hand. Though as she looked at the red plaid design, as well as felt the cotton material, she knew that it was Ruthie. She lying, still normal sized upon the stomach of the still five hundred feet tall Ruthie, who also began to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, as Edna waved for Ruthie's attention, she noted that she didn't see Trish anywhere, her large face not panning over her, she not hugging up onto Ruthie, it was over. Edna could be found smiling, glad to see that everything seemed to be normal, aside the giant Ruthie and the destroyed and smoldering school. \"Ruthie!\" Edna would call up to her friend, showing a friendly smile as she looked to be noticed, but she couldn't help but notice that Ruthie refused to look down. Instead she seemed to look out, looking at something else. A terrified look on her face, mouth agape and quivering. Confused, Edna would do the same and immediately regret it. Out into the distance, and untold distance away, Edna could see, and only see a wall of black, a wall of familiar black material. It was all that she could see, and it disappeared high into the clouds. She was looking at the immense, no that didn't even begin to describe it correctly. Absolutely godly DC sneakers of Trish. These big enough to crush untold amount of property, the feet that these covered over a mile wide and over three miles long. Which judging by Edna's calculations would clock Trish to having been over twenty miles tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops\" was all that Edna could say in her defense, knowing full well that nothing could survive at that size, as there would be no oxygen for them to live off of. Nope, this was truly over, or that would be the case until what sounded like the worst thunder imaginable could be heard. The power enough to shake the ground drastically, worse than the worst Earthquakes ever recorded. Building in the nearby cities collapsing under it's power, and yet, Edna when she listened close enough after covering her ears and recovering from the worst migraine imaginable, could have swore she heard....words. Eye's widening, she couldn't believe it. Immediately dousing herself in a cold sweat, Edna couldn't help herself. \"S-she's alive?!\" It was impossibly Edna thought, how could she be alive? She had intended to grow her so much that she would die without oxygen. Quickly, fumbling for the device, she could only look at it, seeing the warning sign and remembering the red glow to the purple energy. \"N-no way...\" Trish had done it, she had gotten allt he power she could ever imagine, and now, what would she do with it? Now that even Mount Everest was at about knee height for her.</span></div></div>",

The tiny little geek fumbled her size device back toward Trish, now set to fix this problem once and for all. \"Please Please work.\" Quivering, her finger pulled the trigger. And for once, Ruthie didn't try to stop her. Together they watched the beam blast its way all the way towards the mile-high tread of Trish's sneaker and make contact. Ruthie cheered immediately but Edna was more cautious. As it would turn out, Edna was right not to cheer. Nothing happened. Trish neither grew nor shrank. Edna cursed, looking back to her device, now obviously on the fritz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I rather like this size.\" Trish chuckled, each word deafening the tiny world at her feet. \"Now where's my little girl Ruthie?\" The giantess craned her neck and found herself once again stunned by her size. Buildings...entire towns...None of it even rose past her shoes. Even Ruth, who was once as big as Trish herself, was barely noticeable from the rest of the specks. If not for her bright red attire she probably wouldn't have been noticed at all. \"There you are...Come here.\" Trish's skyscraper-sized fingers reached for the lesser giantess, who in turn still had the normal-sized Edna in her hands. Compared to her giant lover Ruth was barely big enough to be plucked with Trish's fingers, each of which over twice as tall as the girl herself. In the seconds it took to be brought to Trish's face Ruth found herself reflecting on her recent choices associating with this girl. Perhaps it was a bad call on her part. It didn't matter though. There was no going back from Trish now. Lest she meet the same fate Heather did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding Ruth in front of her face Trish smirked, \"I think I like you more like this. Small enough to be all mine, but big enough that no one else can have you.\" The Goddess puckered her lips and gave her tiny partner a kiss. \"Who knows, maybe later me and you can have some<i> fun</i>. Seeing you tiny like this has me all worked up. But first...\" Trish's eyes darted back to the cities at her feet. \"I do believe this world needs to learn who their Goddess is.\" As casual as can be Trish quickly pulled her shirt out, exposing her cleavage to Ruth. \"You can stay here til I need you doll face. Try to keep that geek girl safe too okay? I get the feeling I'm gonna be bigger before the day's over. Before Ruthie had any chance to respond Trish already sealed her fate. \"Now then...\" She grinned below, \"I think it's time I start getting some payback.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised a foot as high as she could. Trish watched in delight as she the entirety of Quiet Rock fall under the shadow of her foot, as well as a bit of the neighboring town. It was good to know that in her growth she didn't crush too much actual civilization with her feet. That left more for her to actively crush. Beneath her shoe was her home town. It would take less than an instant and it would all be gone forever. \"Good Riddance.\" The Giantess stomped the Earth as hard as she could, creating a seismic quake that broke records across the globe. \"Tch.\" She clicked her tongue, annoyed at her indecisiveness. At the last moment Trish spared her town, instead crushing the neighboring one. Not out of any act of mercy or anything oh God no. But because this town was such an annoyance to a Goddess such as her it deserved a special fate. It deserved to suffer like Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave Trish an idea. With the toe of her shoe the girl removed a shoe and kicked it into the nearby mountainside, doing the same with her other one. The fresh air felt incredible against her socked toes but she wasn't quite done yet. Once more with her toes Trish removed her socks, tossing them into what was moments ago a thriving city. \"Hey wifey, sorry to bother you so soon but your Goddess has a job for you.\" Trish reached into her bra for Ruth, easily finding her. She set the girl beside Quiet Rock, between her mountainous feet. \"I want you to relocate the town. Okay dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where?\" Ruthie nervously replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish grinned. With the same hand she used to lower Ruth she quickly grabbed a discarded shoe and placed it beside the town, chuckling at the fact her shoe alone was bigger than both her love doll and the city she once lived in. \"There of course. And I do mean the whole town. Buildings and everything. I want this entire worthless little town to suffer in my shoe until I decide to wear it and end their lives...In fact. While they're waiting have them lick my shoes clean too. No reason not to put them to work, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes Trish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Trish's voice instantly grew annoyed, \"That isn't my name. I'll let it slide once since you're cute but never make that mistake again Ruthie. I'm <i>Goddess</i> Trish. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie's lips quivered, slowly leading to her lowering her head, \"Yes Goddess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl! I might just get you a reward later. I'll be back in a bit to check up on things. If the tinies give you any trouble crush them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going Goddess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish grinned, \"Everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that the barefoot Goddess began to leave and find another land to terrorize for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ruth! Ruth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meek giantess' ears perked. \"Yes Edna?\" For safe keeping and easy access she relocated her friend to her ear for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can fix this, but I need to go home and get some supplies to repair my Size Gun. Can you get me there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reply was immediate. \"Of course.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a nod of her head and an optimistic smile, Edna couldn't help but let out a sigh of confidence as her and Ruthie had at least a semblance of a plan. Though far from concrete as it not only required the ability for Edna to fix her device. Fortunately she having the Ruthie Taxi service to get her from point A to point B. That would be once the ungodly tremors that were Trish's foot steps quit rocking the earth enough so that even Ruthie could get her footing enough to move. The still giant best friend of this young geek, carrying her in the palm of her hand across the town which had nearly met it's end under the shoe of Trish. A disgusting and yet mildly entertaining thought to Edna, to think of not only the town, buildings and streets, but even the people to be stuck in her treads. The town much like a wad of gum and they unfortunate ants who happened to be in it once stepped on. Instead, Trish wanted something more cruel for the town, for them to suffer as Heather had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was poetic justice at this point as Edna herself had condemned the once popular and alive young woman to her death in a similar fashion. To die under the sock covered foot of this woman, to either die from the puddles of sweat that had gathered, or hell even at their current size difference. The heat which would generate from her foot would no doubt be enough to bake any who were \"lucky\" enough to not simply be crushed by her unforgiving mass. Still, there was one thing that bugged Edna more than anything as she simply rode in Ruthie's palm, the rhythmic and far more tolerable tremors caused by the much smaller giant, almost comforting to her mind when compared to the still distant rumbles which could be heard from Trish's departure. It never have left Edna's mind, not since she had realized Trish had survived her plot to kill her, and especially not since the gun refused to do as she had willed it. That warning sign, the red hue to the beam of energy which had struck Trish, as well as the fact that Trish was able to survive being so unbelievably gigantic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer calculations were not incorrect, that much growth should have killed her, putting her above the oxygen level of the planet where she would suffocate, and yet she was able to not only breathe, but further taunt her and Ruthie, as well as the world. Caught so deep in thought, nearly to a maddening level as she gritted her teeth trying to find any answer she could. She almost hadn't even noticed as Ruthie would give her hand a slight shake before putting her hand to the ground, angling it so that Edna could gently slide off to the ground below. Literally dropping her off at her own front lawn, and back into the \"World of the Ants\" as Trish would address them, possibly from now on if she couldn't fix this. A thought which only caused a shudder to make it's way up her spine as she thought about how easily \"Goddess Trish\" could live up to that name and rule this Planet. Something Edna would only see if Quiet Rock somehow survived past this day, irritatingly enough if by the mercy of the Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked around her neighborhood, she couldn't help but notice that the immediate environment was far past worse for wear. An area not at all touched by the sudden appearance of giants and yet the scene was something out of an end of the world movie. Fire Hydrants having erupted, water spitting straight up from it and coating the immediate area in moisture. Car's turned over and sections of homes either on fire or simply collapsed. Simply from the tremors of Trish's monolithic foot steps and the power of her lesser actions. people either injured or even dead, homes broken into as people's sanity and reasoning was slowly depleting and it was all her fault. The guilt was immediate, the ever emotional Edna, whether quick to anger or calm down. She would feel the tears of sorrow flowing from her eyes. Her vision blurring slightly as she couldn't help but sob as the wails of humanity were heard. It was something that Ruthie had picked up on as she would use her index finger, her hand far too big, and even this appendage still outsized her friend. Still she would try to comfort and console her as she would simply pet her with the pad of her finger, ruffling her hair slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Come on Edna, you still have a chance to make it right. You need to hurry before she causes even more destruction.\"</b> Ruthie would try to reason, her voice low and soothing as she talked to her friend. Though even at her size, it was more than just a whisper to those of normal size. Yet it would seem to do something for Edna who would slowly begin to wipe the tears from her face and do her best to give Ruthie that confident nod of her head, though it was evident she was still reeling from what she had caused. Inside the house, hours would go by as Edna had moved to her room, accessing her tools as she sat at her \"workbench\" which was her desk. Several of the things she thought she would need to try and repair her device scattered here and there as she had it cracked open. Her T.V. on behind her, serving as nothing more than background noise to will her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter the channel which she could have chose to put it on, the result would be the same. Each channel had an emergency news broadcast, whether local or even statewide, even international. Everyone not only in the United States, but also the World were only concerned about one thing, Trish. Every so often, Edna would turn around in her chair to look at it, she seeing the outward shots of Trish stomping around the world. It almost a surreal feeling to see Trish stomp the ground, and just but a second later, almost as if having a delay, feel the earth rumble as a result. Though each time that she would do this, a sudden tapping on her window would break her trance. She looking for but a moment to see Ruthie's gigantic eye looking in on from outside, willing her on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Dammit.\" Edna cursed, wiping sweat from her brow. Half of the device she'd made had already needed to be replaced. Every time she replaced a burnt out or worn wire or circuit she pointed it to something in the room and fired, hopeful that the device was now repaired enough to work. She didn't know how much time had passed. Hours maybe. Thankfully Trish seemed to be having the time of her life destroying half the world, unaware of all the time she'd spent doing so. Faintly Edna heard the titaness's voice from across the planet demand worship. It only pushed her to work harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie was no longer outside. In the small chance Edna couldn't make it the giantess proactively thought to help evacuate the town. Quiet Rock was almost entirely empty now aside from Edna. At her request Ruthie was now placing buildings into the large mountain that was Trish's shoe. In the event Edna wouldn't make it in time this would at least fool the mega giantess into thinking the town was now trapped in her shoe. Everyone may survive long past that, but it was better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Edna fired a test beam again. The couch that got shrunk down to near microscopic size then quickly bounced back to twice its height. \"No...\" The geek girl sighed. What was she missing? She made this device once before already. It should be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so lost in her frustration she didn't even notice the door fling open until a shout filled her ears. \"Edna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Edna turned around; standing in the doorway was the only other genius at her school: Mizuki. \"Mizu? What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't waste time.\" The asian girl frowned, \"I'm here to fix your little mistake before that ignoramus shows up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have time to talk then get to work! Honestly, no wonder you let this happen with an attitude like this.\" The girl pulled a seat forward and took a single glance at  the inner workings of the device in Edna's hands. \"Half of your conductors are utter garbage, we need to swap them out. Otherwise this thing will never hold a charge long enough to actually shrink something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! How could I be so stupid?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not me.\" Mizu smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether with the young asian Edna felt her second wind coming. All her frustrations and pressure went away. If she had the time to get upset she wasn't working hard enough. With the help the size gun repairs were finally on their way to completion. It felt like no time had passed since Mizuki showed up before the girl now held the completed device in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this we can fix everything.\" Mizuki muttered, adjusting the dials on the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't have done this without you Mizu but...how did you know it was me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't hard. You're the only halfway intelligent person I've met in this country. Plus that giant bimbo shouted \"Geek Girl\" at least a dozen times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me. I just have better things to do than end up crushed beneath someone's foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Boom.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairly consistent booms had been going on for the last few hours. It wasn't new, but for some reason both girls grew quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>Boom.</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother boom, much closer. It didn't take a genius to figure out what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"></font>}<b>Boom!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello my little germs. Are you all ready to meet your fate?\" A thunderous voice giggled high above. Trish had returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst to react, Edna ran out the door quickly followed by Mizuki. The skyline was blocked out by the giant punk's eager toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mizuki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it!\" The asian girl readied the gun and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Edna's and Mizuki's grin's would only diminish and soon cease to exist entirely as their plan to reduce the threat which was Trish Pierce back to a more manageable size, quite literally grew from their control. The tanned flesh colored wall which was Trish's big toe which stood quite ominously in front of the pair only seemed to swell bigger and bigger. Both girl's jaws would simply drop, the color flushing from their face as their hearts would sink. Though Mizuki would be quick to toss the blame elsewhere as she would whip her head around to give Edna an accusing glare. 'What did you do? You moron!\" Her shouts would both showcase genuine frustration fueled by the fear of what they had just done. Trish's toe, as well as the rest of her foot attached to her body just continued to rise and rise into the sky. What was left of the town, what hadn't been destroyed already of been put into Trish's DC sneaker was simply bulldozed away. The earth under Trish's soles simply giving way, the simple act of existing causing untold destruction, and then came the laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunderous, monstrous, many words couldn't describe it well enough with the exception of Godly. It wouldn't take long for Trish to realize what was happening, the world shrinking away from her yet again, only causing the massive punk girl to let out a laugh which rocked the world. <b>\"You pathetic fuckin' germs just can't get enough of me? Can't say that I blame ya'.\" </b> The ever arrogant Trish would boast to herself. Although even her \"inside voice\" was magnified thousdans of times over and caused a steady tremor on the ground below. Causing both Edna and Mizuki to be forced to the ground from the power of it. \"I didn't do anything! You're the one who said the gun was \"fixed\"!\" Edna would only argue back after recovering, causing the eerily composed Asian girl to simply look at her with disgust. Almost as if she was able to ignore the 64 mile Trish standing right behind her. \"It's your flawed design!\" Was her retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was a rebuttal which struck Edna in her heart, after all, if her intelligence was put into question, what else did she have left? By what the popular kids at school placed her, it was all she was, just a geek who lacked any other traits worth noting. It was something which Edna could pride herself on, and here was another girl, perhaps as intelligent, and has the social skills and looks to get far in life, to just tear it all away from her. Something would only snap in the Geek girl, causing her to frantically take a step towards Mizuki. \"No you just used it wrong! I can fix this!\" Desperation was clear in her voice, and Mizuki would be unprepared for Edna's advance, easily letting the geek to take the gun from her. The Asian girl wouldn't even get a chance to protest before Edna turned the gun on herself and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizuki's eye's would only widen as she realized that Edna hadn't even bothered to change the settings. She back pedaling a step or two out of sheer reaction before she realized it was a futile gesture. Edna's body would simply balloon out, growing at an exponential rate. Not even bothering with the ever slow 5 feet becomes 10 feet style of growth. In fact it may have been more accurate to say she practically shot straight up to 50, and then 100 in a matter of seconds. Realizing her danger, Mizuki would do the only thing that she could think of, and that was to jump onto Edna's expanding foot before it bulldozed and crushed her into paste under her flip flop. The Asian girl coming to rest against Edna's big toe, her hands resting on the toenail and hanging on for dear life, not wanting to plummet backward and off the flip flop back to the ground where she would surely die. Though it would only be a moment or two before even Edna was so large, passing the mile marker in under a minute of her growth that Mizuki would have plenty of room at the end of her foot wear. She having quickly lost her grip and fell to her back, hitting the squishy material of the flip flop with a dull thud and a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizuki's eye's couldn't help but look straight up and almost immediately she would be left breathless, Edna was enormous! The Geek who stood at around her height just prior now towered over her like a behemoth, hell her toes were making her seem insignificant. Although, this wasn't all that she saw, far up, further then the clouds and seemingly blurred out due to the sheer distance which was her height, her eye's were seeing Trish, the ever massive punk girl which Edna had barely reached the ankles of, and it wouldn't be long before Mizu took notice to Trish's eye's adjusting on the still growing Edna, a cocky smirk forming on her lips as she saw this. A smirk from Trish which wouldn't falter, even as Edna soon hit her old height of 20 miles, and even some time later when Edna would peak out at Trish's current height of 64 miles tall. Edna as frantic as she had been couldn't help but take a step back in shock from her new height, her flip flop raising and coming down only to completely eradicate the rest of the town, aside from the ones surprisingly safe inside Trish's shoe, including Ruthie who wisely took refuge with them. The tremor caused from this action alone, a mere misstep by Edna, a small girl at normal height, it would send tremors which could be felt not only by the entire state, but even the surrounding states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, it hadn't been with the foot that Mizuki currently occupied, the normal sized Asian girl who found herself helplessly lost on Edna's flip flop, at the mercy of this geek's foot which simply dominated her in every sense imaginable, and without even having to move. The minute action of a nearly unnoticeable wiggle of her toes, an action which Edna herself wasn't ware of was an action of cataclysmic effect to Mizuki who found herself lost on a plain of black foam rubber which seemed to go on forever to the flesh covered cliff sides of Edna's foot. Though, Edna would have bigger fish to fry than to worry about what she had done, she had something to fix, and it wouldn't be long before she tried. Spinning the dial on the gun, she would hurriedly point it in Trish's face. The Punk who seemed far too at ease for what Edna intended to do. The thought just now crossing her mind at how Trish actually allowed her to grow without interference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she stared down the barrel of the size gun which Edna held, a finger on the trigger, she couldn't help but chuckle slyly. \"Listen, that's real cute and all, you bringing me what's rightfully mine, that gun, but. I'd suggest you get it out of my face before I'm forced to break yours.\" Trish's voice was stern and  threatening. Those eyes which has seemed to show amusement would only harden as she looked at Edna who could already feel her confidence in this plan dwindling. What was she thinking to just grow to Trish's size?! This woman would rip her to shreds if she missed this shot somehow, and Trish's words only made her all the more sure that missing was going to happen. \"I promise you, I will make you think what Heather did to you all those years wasn't so bad, if you don't hand over that gun right now.\" Her threats would only continue and so would Edna's heart rate. Trish's brow would twitch slightly as she seemed to be reading Edna's expression, eye's watching that finger which slowly began to squeeze the trigger.</span></div></div>",

If she tried to blast her point blank, Trish would easily dodge, beat her into the ground, and take the gun for herself. However, Edna's quick thinking allowed her to come up with a plan to use those instincts against Trish. If she feigned pulling the trigger and tricked Trish into dodging prematurely, then she would be able to readjust her aim and blast her mid-dodge. It was a risky plan, but it was her only hope of pulling this off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquinting her eyes, Edna pulled back on the trigger. Not enough to make the gun fire, but enough to trick Trish and make her think she was firing. As Trish jumped out of the way to avoid the blast that never came, Edna re-targeted her and pulled the trigger for real this time. Instantly a bolt of energy was fired from the gun and the shocked punk was caught directly in the blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck! I'll kill you, you little shit!\" Trish cursed as she felt her body tingling from the energy of the blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She lunged at Edna in rage, but as her anger made her movements more reckless and less fluid, Edna quickly avoided her and she fell flat on the ground. Trish slowly stood up and dusted herself off, but at this point she could feel the ray's blast beginning to take effect. As much as she hated to admit it, she knew that this was the end of her reign as goddess. Soon she would shrink away and become just another one of those insignificant bugs that she had moments ago been crushing en masse beneath her feet. Then she would be jailed and put to death for all the destruction that she had caused, and that would be the end of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr would it? Edna <i>was</i> in quite the rush to set things right, after all. In her haste to blast Trish with the gun, had she even remembered to reset the gun to shrink before firing in the first place?</span></div></div>",

Trish was after all, an MMA fighter, and with it she had reflexes and the ability to read much weaker foes such as Edna who was no physical prowess what so ever. Meaning that, it wouldn't take anything for Trish to simply allow her body to move to the side, allowing the blast to travel into the distance, presumably with no consequence. Well no consequence other than Trish now being quite pissed off Edna for not listening. Though Edna would soon feel the effects of that as Trish would waste no time in driving a heavy fist right square into Edna's face. A punch which hit her in the bridge of the nose and was more than enough to take the fight out of Edna. She actually in the midst of falling back to the ground as a result, and destroying untolds amount of damage for the surrounding towns and cities of where this originated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, perhaps as merciful as a Goddess like her could be, Trish would save the masses from this fate. Her hand quickly reaching out and grabbing Edna by her Death Note shirt, grabbing her by the collar of it and yanking back on it, stretching it out in the process of stopping Edna's momentum, but saving those germs below, a good deed indeed. \"You know Geek girl, I thought we had an understanding, a possible way of getting along. We both hated Heather, you made me into a Goddess, and even gave me a Queen in your best friend, all as I killed that bitch of an enemy for the two of us.\" Trish would only pull Edna closer, the poor girl bleeding out of her nose, barely conscious from that shot alone. There was a reason Trish held the record for knockouts in the state, Edna could account for that. Though it was obvious that Trish wanted her awake, she having pulled back her punch a bit. A single droplet of her blood dribbling from her nose, running down her face and eventually dripping down her chin. Leaving it to freefall with a loud whistle until it hit the wreckage which was the remains of the destroyed town. Coating the rubble red as well as creating yet another crater within an already existing footprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would ruin that wouldn't you? You turned my Queen against me, and even now you try and stop me, but let me tell you something Geek girl, it's too fuckin' late for that. This is my world now, and you should be glad I even allow you to exist in it.\" A devilish smirk would form on Trish's lips as she would simply reach a hand out, Easily stripping that size device from Edna's hand and claiming it for herself, sealing the world's fate with that. To further that, Trish would immediately do away with her previous good deed, only wanting to put Edna in her place and take what was hers. She would then pick up Edna effortlessly, practically tossing her over her head as she would spin around, using this momentum to slam Edna down into the ground with a takedown. An aggressive deal she had done hundreds of times, but never at 64 miles tall. The impact FAR greater than Edna's misplaced step. the shockwave much like a bomb which would simply obliterate everything in a radius around them for several miles, leaving nothing to survive, the earth practically cracking under Edna's body. Trish could only sneer as she looked down upon Edna's defeated body, she having never stood a chance, and neither did the world now. Though her eye's would survey the ground and find nothing of interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite simply, everything was rubble, even the surrounding cities, from that shockwave had been brought to that point, and she hadn't even visited them yet, a shame. The only survivors being the two of them, Ruthie and the rest of the town in Trish's shoe, and of course, Mizuki who on a positive note, no longer found herself surrounded by the smell of Edna's feet, constantly being threatened by being crushed by the most minute movement of her toes. On the bad side, she now found herself surrounded by black trees, each wider than anything she had ever seen before, and a forest which seemed to go on forever. The ground she walked on, flesh covered, as was her world now it seemed, her mind only able to replay the last few moments which seemed to pass by like a blur. When Trish picked Edna up for that slam, she had been tossed up in the air, away from her foot and no doubt to certain death, flying even higher than Trish as she stood. Though as her momentum would cease and gravity would reassert itself, that image of Trish would only increase and increase, her head and short hair only getting bigger and bigger....Mizuki could only sigh as she realized where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was too small for Trish to notice, and even if she wasn't the Punk had other things on her mind. Looking down on Edna, she beaten and bleeding still. She couldn't help but turn her new toy on Edna, not even bothering to check the settings which Edna had hurriedly done. Edna even in her right mind wouldn't even know what she did. Quite ominously Trish would take a step close and point that barrel in Edna's face as she simply was helpless on the ground. \"Begone\" Was all Trish said as she pulled the trigger, that light enveloping Edna....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was finally over, and even as as Edna was quite literally finding herself face to toe with Trish. These massive appendages which dwarfed every man made accomplishment and snuff out cities in their own right. She couldn't help but smile to herself, knowing that in a few moments, her entire life would relatively go back to normal. Trish would go back to being one of them, arrested even for all the carnage she had caused. Sure for quite some time, this would be news and it would forever be history that would be taught to generations to come as one of the World's grimmest days, but at least it was over. Edna would slowly turn her head to face Mizuki, the foreign exchange student from Japan, the only reason that this device had been fixed in time, and immediately the color would flush from Edna's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of horror filling her eyes as she would simply look upon Mizu who had the barrel of this device not pointed at the bringer of their doom but yet at her own head. She wearing a knowing grin which simply radiated her own arrogance. \"I did tell you not to thank me, after all I really don't want to end up a stain on another person's foot. I want the stains to be on the bottom of my own feet.\" She would coldly point out which would only cause Edna to take a step back in shock. She instinctively looking around for Ruthie who could not be found at current, possibly blocked off by the monolithic Trish whom simply was too busy basking in what task she had assumed Ruthie had accomplished and what she would do with that. To her, a twenty mile tall woman, she would not see anything, but to Edna it would be truly hell. Mizuki would pull that trigger and a blinding flash would be seen, it so bright that Edna would simply fall backwards to a seated position and cover her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally when she would uncover her eyes, she would feel that desire to cover them again, she shaking her head and she simply mouthed the word \"No\" to herself over and over again. She was so close to fixing her mistake, to restoring this world back to what it was. To no longer have these giants which would destroy anything they saw with the exception of the good hearted Ruthie. Yet as she looked on, she could only shout up at Mizuki, furious that she had trusted this girl as she simply skyrocketed into the air. She gaining mass at an incredible rate through the fixes she had made to the device, seemingly making it more powerful than ever as it would be but a few seconds that she would surpass Ruthie's size, and soon that would be but a memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shadow overtaking the area and coating Edna in it's ever growing form as it covered more and more with each moment. She passing the two thousand mark within and minute and still going strong. Mizuki simply spreading her arms out to her sides, laughing maniacally the entire time that she grew, knowing that in a short amount of time, she would be what she had always thought herself to be, above this entire world. <b>\"What's this?\"</b>  A rather booming voice would call out, loud enough that even the still growing Mizuki would have to cover her ears and cower from it. Trish's green eyes far above able to have picked up Ruthie on ground level, certainly were able to pick up on someone who was six times the size of her favorite little pet and still growing. Although as they looked down, they would notice something else, this person wasn't Ruthie, nor was it the geek girl. As Mizuki neared the one mile mark, Trish couldn't help but smirk, practically licking her lips as she realized that it was another geek girl, that Japanese girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe looking to have figured out how to grow, but this raised a question in Trish's mind, when would she stop? What was this girl's purpose and what was she intending to do. Naturally, Trish could simply just end this now, yet a part of her halted herself. Her mind going back to Ruthie, and just how uncooperative she had been by her side. Trish remembered Mizuki well, and she also remembered she was quite the attractive one herself, and perhaps, more willing. This would only bring a smirk to Trish's face as she wiggled her toes in thought. A miniscule act by her, yet it only caused cataclysmic tremors down below for Edna and Ruthie, the only ones left of what they had to call a town, Mizuki would finally hit the one mile mark, still but an insect to Trish when...?</span></div></div>",

Leaving the device to power down and at that moment, become a paperweight in her hands. A question of what that meant for this poor girl would simply be answered once Mizuki quickly realized she wasn't gaining any more mass, she would come to a halt at the one mile marker, still making her rather gigantic to the normal world. Though to Trish she was nothing more than a slightly more glorified insect at her feet, standing barely at her ankle's height. Of course, the advantage here was that she was bigger than those toes which had moments ago dominated her entire view, but she was still smaller than the foot they were attached too and by quite a bit at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?!\" Mizuki would shout in a flustered frustration, dark eye's immediately locking onto the device, hand drawing back and smacking it into her awaiting palm. She doing anything and everything to try and just jump the machine back alive, yet whilst it may have gotten a flicker of life, the device which allowed her this much growth and previously had made Trish as big as she is now. It was, in this moment, simply done for, possibly for good. Of course, the realization would not settle well with Mizuki, she taking a step back so that she could turn her body around. She looking immediately down upon the ground, spying near where she had started growing, and it wouldn't take her long to find what she was looking for, Edna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"You idiot!\"</b> Fire in her eyes, Mizuki as clearly more than prepared to blame this failure on anyone but herself. pointing the finger figuratively at Edna. After all it was her design, her device and perhaps she would allow some blame to fall to herself. She knew she shouldn't have trusted ANYTHING from someone of clear inferior intelligence. This was all that faulty work on Edna's part coming back to get her and of this she was certain. Hate filled her mind as she looked down upon Edna. The small and to anyone except the one mile tall Mizuki, genius simply could do nothing but cower as she stared helplessly up at what was a new tormentor for her. Edna could tell, this new giant did not look happy, and whilst she may have lacked the size Trish did. The fact remained that her being smaller would work in her favor better for what Edna feared she had in mind as she felt so insignificant under the sheer power of Mizuki's gaze. <b>\"You're worthless!</b> The voice, booming and only causing Edna to cringe, falling to her ass on the sidewalk she stood on. Before her, some distance away, yet still still so unbelievably colossal, Mizu's beaten up chuck of her right foot began to lift off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith it, much of the ground, smaller buildings, cars, buses and even trees would be both ripped up from the ground and caused a kick up of debris, further punctuating in Edna's mind just how minute the human race has become with her newest creation. To make matters worse for her would for her mind to realize that Mizuki, this monstrous girl was only the second biggest of the newly minted giants. She currently holding a sneaker covered foot over a large section of the deserted remnants of Quiet Rock, but more importantly, positioning the toe of her sneaker above Edna's house. The shadow being cast would only cause Edna's heart to drop as she locked up, noticing the diamond tred in the sneaker, noticing several crushed cars simply stuck in them, a vision which only made Edna want to cry as she would soon join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"Suck to be you, nerd.\"</b></font> A voice louder than the shouts of even Mizuki, and yet Edna knew that it was only a soft utterance from Trish. It was teh voice of a Goddess and Edna would have half a mind to bow before her as such, her savior. The voice of Trish would do everything, including stopping Mizuki for the moment as the giga Asian would halt her progress in making Edna pay in order to quickly and rather fearfully turn her attention skyward. Her eye's meeting a similar of green orbs looking back at her, a sadistic grin on her face. <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"If anyone gets to cast judgment on the land, it's me you little twerp.\"</b></font> Trish would coldly and quite snidely remark. Showing just how serious she was, even as she wore that eery grin on her face. Even for Mizuki who had little to fear in this world, she couldn't help but shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"I should just kill you here and now, after all, you're a threat if you were able to grow like that.\"</b></font> Her grin would only grow, her predatory gaze hardening, Edna even down below could have sworn she saw the massive titan punk's mouth water from this. It was clear, Trish was violent, she may have even been a sociopath. Now she had the power of a Goddess and she wasn't afraid to spill blood to get her point across. Edna knew, without the device in her hands, she and the rest of the world was fucked. <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"However...\"</b></font> Trish's words would hang, only causing Mizuki to gulp, even with a feeling of relief hitting her. <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"I like you, perhaps you have more potential than my other pet running around, maybe even a bit better looking too.\"</b></font> Trish's toes would wiggle slightly as she would let a chuckle escape her. The tremors this caused from such a minute action, only further driving Edna to a pit of madness as she looked on, she wanting so much to just run inside and hide under her bed to escape the reality of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply put, she couldn't take her eyes off of Trish, she took up everything, she was everything to her, to the human race and even Mizuki. Speaking of the giga Asian, it was apparent that she had heard enough. Turning her attention back to the gun which had grown with her, she could see that it was still on the fritz. This would only leave the usually calm and collected girl to come to one conclusion as to what she had to do....run. Turning on her heels, she would take but a few steps forward, her sneakers nearly crushing Edna's house anyway as she would simply do what she could to get away. The thought that if she could simply stay away long enough, maybe she could figure this problem out. The only problem was that this action only amused Trish to the point of maniacal laughter. Creating a hell storm below of Trish's booming laughter as well as the ground shaking crashes of Mizuki's feet frantically hitting the ground over and over as she ran away. Everything which was caught underneath them simply disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a warpath and anything in her shadow was in a doomed area as they soon would be trodden on, although Mizuki was the least of their worries as an even bigger shadow would make it's presence known. Mizuki refused to look back, knowing full well that if she did she would lose speed. Edna on the other hand, accepting her fate, remaining in place as Mizuki raced off into the distance, she could see Trish's foot raising above Mizuki's fleeing form, she of course glad that she too was not in that shadow as well. Still she would watch as those toes of Trish would simply wiggle playfully in place as the foot hovered only a few inches above Mizuki to Trish's perspective, yet the entire thing was more than a mile or two in the air. Her sole casting a shadow for miles in every direction around the fleeing Mizuki and it would only be a moment before the laughter of this punk could be heard before her foot came down atop the fleeing Asian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna fully expecting to see Mizuki simply crushed to paste, a warning to all who would oppose their new Goddess, was both surprised and a bit relieved to see that she only simply pinned Mizuki to the ground. Using her big toe, planting it firmly into the Asian's back, she would push her into the ground. Only causing the mile tale girl to flail, doing all that she could do to get loose. Her hands clawing at the ground, digging up entire forests, her feet kicking behind her and erasing neighborhoods by the second. <br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"Man, for someone who thinks they are so smart, you're real fucking stupid aren't you?.\"</b></font> A haunting voice would call out to taunt the smaller giant, only further showing Trish's amusement by this. <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"No matter how cute you are sweety, 'fraid I can't let you get away with that one.\"</b></font> Trish would only apply a bit more pressure, getting Mizuki to cry out in pain a bit, yet not injuring her, just scaring her.  Having not even moved but a step, Trish would simply bend down to retrieve her right shoe and a single sock which she had discarded moments ago, holding them up for the world to see. <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"Do me a favor, see if you can find Heather's stain in there.\"</b></font> She would continue to laugh as she would use her free hand, to grab Mizuki from under her foot. Bringing the miniscule girl up to her face for a second, allowing the smaller giant to see sadistic smile on her face before she would condemn her to her punishment which she had hinted at, the tomb that was her shoe.<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"Oh hey, maybe you're old house is in there too.\"</b></font> With this, Mizuki find her body held over the mouth of the DC shoe, the smell and heat emanating from it causing Mizuki to wheeze already and she wasn't even inside yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With no remorse, no hesitation, Trish's fingers would simply relinquish their hold of the giga Asian. This allowing what was a massive and unstoppable young woman to the eyes of human's, to simply fall like some insignificant bug inside the shoe of an even bigger titaness punk. Mizuki's screams could be heard for miles and she wailed the entirety of her fall, only to hit the sole with a subtle wet slap, as well as a slight crunching under her ass along with it. The young woman would only groan out in slight pain and discomfort as she did her best to recover her composure, the act of her hitting the sole making the physically weak girl to relinquish her hold on that size gun. It flying off into the distance which was Trish's shoe. Though this hadn't occurred to Mizuki yet, her immediate attention was on her surroundings. She immediately being assaulted with the smell of a pair of shoes which had been worn nearly every day for several years now, and today was no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, Trish who was a fairly athletic girl who took to classes which pushed physical activity as opposed to the mental academics, it would seem like she had been in such a class today. The inside of the shoe was moist, the air thick with a musty fog, it only causing Mizuki to cough and wheeze. Of course, it wouldn't be long before she had also noticed the rather uncomfortable feeling under her rear end. Getting to her feet and looking behind her, this girl would be surprised to find that she had landed ass first onto a cluster of large buildings, no doubt from the town and no doubt fruits of Ruthie's labor to appease Trish, or at least fool her into thinking she had done what she was asked. Normally such an act would have gotten this girl to smirk even a little bit, but considering her whereabouts, there was nothing to smile about. Instead, her eyes would travel around the sole of the shoe, the light from the mouth above her allowing some light to seep in. She able to see many other buildings, both clusters and even what appeared to be neighborhoods which were here and there, some of which seemed to just disappear into the darkness near the toe end of the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the toe end of the shoe, Mizuki would not be the only unfortunate soul inside this hell, in fact there were many. Ruthie in waiting so long to begin her task would have simply rushed it. Whilst many citizens were smart enough to abandon the sinking ship which was the town, some were not so lucky. Likewise, when Ruthie ripped houses and everything else from the ground, she didn't have time to check. Such was the fate of another young woman from their high school, and one whom Trish would have loved to know she had literally underfoot. She another one of Heather's followers, a girl by the name of Ami. Although that was not a title she had always worn, she at one time wore both badges of being best friends to the very girl's shoe she found herself in, as well as a past lover to her. Ami, at one point was like Trish, a punk and an advocate for physical classes and activities. Whilst Trish took to MMA, Ami took to Boxing, and quite good at it. Many spars had been held between the two, and many split decisions between the spectators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi had always caught the formers eye, she having a head of black hair, cut rather short with her bangs dyed a bright blonde color, a pair of beautiful blue eyes. They hiding behind a pair of black rectangular glasses, and of course a wardrobe similar to Trish's day to day. The two had been inseparable, until Heather. There was no secret that Trish and Heather hated one another, for various reasons. Perhaps this very hatred was what turned Heather's attention to Ami, it being no secret of their relationship over the years.  The vindictive Heather would see her chance to take this away from Trish, to \"persuade\" Ami to become one of <i>them</i>, the in crowd. Although, Ami joined Trish's side in disliking Heather, she still couldn't resist the chance to be popular. Crushing Trish's heart underfoot and only causing Trish both heartache and anger anytime she saw her. If only she could know that she would have this woman underfoot now, it would no doubt elate Trish to new heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of her home, Ami couldn't help but have a small towel wrapped around the front of her nose and mouth, doing her best to hinder her senses to the smell and moisture inside her prison. She of course aware of where she was, aware of the twenty mile Trish and even the five hundred foot tall Ruthie who was a fool to not join her former best friends side. If allowed the chance, the slightly power hungry Ami would not make that mistake, possibly looking to even rekindle her relationship with Trish. Though it was hard to be attracted to someone who's shoe reeked this much, even for the size comparison. A cough would escape Ami as she looked out her window, looking into the lowly lit tomb of Trish's shoe, looking down upon some of the other unlucky citizens of Quiet Rock who also were now stuck in this place. Though, unlike her, there suffering would not be long lived. <b>Boom!</b> It would happen all at once, an object flying from the abyss which as the other side of this couple miles long shoe. Large beyond belief, a monolithic shadow of a gun would envelope these poor souls and it wouldn't be long before an eruption of gore erupted from the bottom of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, it would take Ami only a second to both recognize what this was, and connect the dots. \"No way...\" She would mutter under her breath before turning on her heels and bolting out of her room, down the staircase leading to the second story of her home and out the front door. She coming to a halt as she spied the size device, the gun which was currently at size to perfectly fit the hand of a mile high giant in her own right. Still, with intrigue Ami couldn't help but walk up, dressed much like she had been since following Heather. A white and black plaid stylish blouse, a simply tight fitting t-shirt, a pair of black skinny jeans and a pair of Etnies. From the back of her head hangs loosely a black sock cap. \"So this is what started it...How did it get in here?\" Ami would wonder to herself, and for reasons unknown to even her, she would reach a hand out to touch it. Perhaps in her mind, she was hoping that it wasn't so damn big, that she could have it for herself. Thoughts of the past, her chance to make amends with Trish, after all, it wasn't as if popularity in school mattered anymore, and even if it did, Heather was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, she was sure she could see the red stain which used to be Heather off in the distance somewhere. Fingers gently grazing the side of this device, the material it was made of, cool to the touch would only get a shiver from Ami and soon after a smile. In that instant her fingers made contact, the device would kick itself back on, the modifications which Mizuki had made when she worked next to Edna would cause this machine to simply reduce down to fit her hands. Though, Ami wouldn't get too long to enjoy the fact that she now possessed the size device, which for the moment may or may not be back in working order. A low rumble would hit the shoe, causing the ground to shake violently underneath her as a shadow would cut most of the light out from the shoe, somehow darkening her surroundings even more so.</span></div></div>",

If you say yes I'll let you live and worship me forever. Say no and I'll just stomp you out like the bug you are.\" Over Mizu's head Trish's toes wiggled eagerly, signaling that either way was fine with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a better idea.\" Mizuki smirked and pointed the gun at Trish's towering food. Unable to see past her sole, Trish was only vaguely aware of a strange feeling beneath her foot. It only lasted a moment and left as quickly as it did. Seconds later she realized what it was and gasped. She was shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't bitch!\" Trish stomped as quickly as she could. Beneath her foot everything was utterly devastated, but not Mizu. The asian girl ran from beneath Trish's foot in the nick of time. Her still-growing frame glanced up at the bigger giantess with a mocking look. As Trish grew smaller she grew bigger. Already Mizu stood just past ankle-height in comparison to the woman whereas before she was barely taller than her foot. \"Die already!\" Trish gritted her teeth and kicked the ground near the asian girl. The lesser giant predicted the move easily though and ran to the side. Compared to her Trish was horribly easy to predict. That brief exchange now had her knee-height with the woman who still shrank smaller and smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the people of Quiet Rock watched the battle take place, unsure of who to root for if anyone. Although she towered over everyone else, in comparison to these two giantesses Ruthie was just as insignificant. They all stood next to Trish's titanic sneaker, unable to do anything but watch. Whoever won this battle would rule the world. Edna was nowhere to be seen, hidden away inside her house to wallow in shame. There was no time left to undo her mistake. It was simply too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here you little skank.\" Trish reached down and swung her hand towards Mizuki. The young asian girl quickly jumped back in time to dodge but Trish saw this coming. Her bare foot took an extra step forward and quickly her hand grabbed the lesser giantess. \"Heh, almost scared me for a second there cutie. Now let me see that there gun. Thanks for taking the trouble to deliver it to your Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone's going to become a Goddess it's me!\" The defiant giantess screamed, biting into Trish's finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yow!\" Unable to control herself, Trish released Mizuki. \"You little-\" She cut herself off. Mizuki had the gun pointed at herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye<i> little</i> one.\" She sneered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a second blast Mizu's growth kicked into overdrive. Trish tried to grab the girl again only to quickly find her hands could no longer fully wrap around her. In the seconds it took for her to try Mizu quickly reached Trish's height and kept going. She didn't even bother fighting the woman anymore. She only looked down as she dwindled more and more before her. Trish finally stopped shrinking at the height of one mile, but by this point Mizuki was already two and growing another mile each second. Soon she was half Mizu's height, then a fourth, then ankle height, then finally Trish found herself staring at the tip of the woman's shoe. The asian girl surpassed Trish's original height and now stood at a towering 30-miles high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better.\" She sighed pleasantly. \"It's only fitting that the best become the rulers of this world. Wouldn't you say Trish?\" Mizu bent over to glance at the bug before her shoes. \"In a way I should thank you. If it weren't for you I never would have gotten the idea to do this myself.\" Seeing Trish so large and unstoppable inspired the woman. If Edna could create a size gun then she could easily do it. And do it better. \"Notice the improvements I made to this little device? It no longer shorts out. And it even grows in accordance to the wielder. I don't need to rely on any of you ants to change my size. That was your mistake. But that's to be expected from a <i>lesser</i> being such as yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one of her feet Mizu began to slide off one of her shoes. \"But like I said. I should thank you. And I have just the idea.\" Trish stared nervously as the shoes came off, soon followed by the socks. In a moment each of Mizu's toes wiggled before Trish. \"Climb onto my big toe.\" The giantess ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I will!\" Trish spat in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it or I will crush you into dust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing her situation, Trish complied. She just needed to last until she could get ahold of that size gun. Then she'd show this asian bimbo what's up. Awaiting the next degrading act, Trish looked up to the sky and saw the barrel of a familiar gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye.\" Mizuki laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beam completely enveloped Trish in its light. With dismay the woman quickly realized she was shrinking once again. In almost an instant the area around her looked utterly unfamiliar. She'd shrunken so fast. Where was she? It was just...tan in every conceivable direction. She could see for countless miles and miles but it all looked the same with no discernible features. Where did Trish end up? The answer came from the heavens in the form of a deafening chuckle, \"The gun also has stronger effects relative to its size. For me it still works normally because to me it's still the size as a gun. But for someone as small as you, you <i>really</i> shrank. Enjoy my gift to your Trish. For giving me the idea to become a Goddess you shall live. Enjoy the rest of eternity on my toe nail.\" Mizuki's laugh drowned out all of Trish's screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then...as for the rest of you.\" Mizu locked eyes with the speck-sized Ruthie. Her finger pointed to one of her shoes she left on its side. All of you worms hiding  next to that girl crawl into my shoe and accept your fate. If you do as I say I might be merciful and let you live. And just so that you don't get any ideas...\" Mizuki hovered her toe over the lone house left in Quiet Rock. Edna's house. \"This is to make sure no one else tries to build another size gun and beat me.\" Her toe came smashing down. With such a simple act Mizuki got rid of the last hope everyone had of stopping her. \"Make sure they do it Ruth.\" She spoke, addressing the miniscule giantess. \"Be a good girl and you may get rewarded. I always wanted a pet. Now get those people into my shoe <i>now</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

Though to her, it very much so was. After all, Ruthie wasn't a cold blooded killer as Trish was shaping out to be, and as such had a very problems with this, at first. After all, it was extremely difficult to ignore the fact of how fast she was able to just sign Heather's life over to Edna, not looking to save her, but allow the one she tormented the most to do the deed. It was yet another point added to the tally which Trish was finding attractive about Ruthie, and quite the catch as it would turn out. Though she really needed to be considering that she was the only other one in this world who could satisfy her needs, and there wasn't anyone else that she wanted more for that role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough those feelings were certainly being brought to the surface for Trish, she knew she could hold off for a bit more, there was always later when they were perhaps even bigger. For now though, she was focused on causing as much havoc as possible, to allow their rule to be seen by the world and what they were capable of. This seeming to be the most important as it wouldn't be long before the Military would be on them, and as unstoppable as she felt, she questioned how well they could deal with some of their weaponry, even at this size. Ruthie would take a step back, taken back by Trish's demand, her cheeks once more flushing red for a moment as she saw the way that Trish was looking at her. The obvious glint of lust in them as she steered away from the obvious and opted for carnage. A part of her wanting to say no, yet that certain mischievous side of her just couldn't get the image of toppling skyscrapers out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't as if the city didn't deserve it either, they having allowed Heather to do what she had to Edna and many others, as well as giving birth to others like her, hell the parents themselves much in the same way, bullied their way in the workforce. It was time to make a stand, and she knew this, for the better of the world, justice being the main word for her. <b>\"Sure, anything so that Edna close this chapter in her life.\"</b> Edna would agree, taking a step closer to Trish, only causing the latter to purr lightly at getting her way. Although this step would not only rock Edna and Heather's world, it would cause the both of them to gulp loudly as the view of Trish's face got even bigger. She having leaned in so that her chin practically rested on the edge of Ruthie's hand. The slightest of laughs cascading her breath upon them, swaying Edna lightly and just throwing Heather to her side. This showing her just how insignificant she was now. <b>\"Well, get on with it geek, I want to have some fun with my lady, kill her so we can go.\"</b> Trish would say coolly, another factor which sent a chill up Edna's spine. What sort of monster had she unleashed on this world, Trish seeming to have little morality for the lives of others, a literal monster. Still that slight impatient tone in her voice would urge Edna to get with it, and not keep this woman waiting, her life possibly depending on it.</span></div></div>",

All of this was Edna's doing, accidents and all. She wished that she had the nerve to put everything in its place, but she didn't want to end up like Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather. Smiling so broadly that most of her teeth were visible, Edna stared daggers at the shrunken, frantic form in her hand. At least she would have this pleasure. The hysterical girl was still sobbing, but felt she had a chance with Edna that she hadn't with the power-mad Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edna, please,\" Heather whimpered. \"I'm so, so sorry. You don't have to do this. You're not some...some monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know a thing about me, little girl,\" Edna whispered, practically purring with eagerness. \"Couldn't be bothered to learn. All you cared about was yourself, and making yourself look good at the expense of people like me. And now, you're a bug. Time to squash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Heather's fate was sealed. No overly-elaborate executions; Edna just did what she should have done to start with, and closed her fist around the tiny, flailing thing. Slowly. She could feel each bone as it twisted and snapped, hear Heather's plaintive wails grow louder and louder, see the blood gush from her mouth and spread its warmth over Edna's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething deep and dark stirred within the geek girl, then. Something that had always been there, subtly guiding her actions, but hadn't really took root before. The feeling of crushing her hated foe, of watching the life leak from her eyes, had done it. The viciousness that years of torment and resentment had allowed to fester was blooming in full, and Edna eagerly embraced it. It filled her with new purpose, and new confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning slightly, Edna realized that both Trish and Ruthie were staring down at her, transfixed by the almost animalistic lust that Edna's feelings of dominance had released within her. Wanting to give them both a proper conclusion to the little show, Edna smoothly slid Heather's crushed corpse within her mouth, swallowing it without hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sick...\" Ruthie whispered in shock. Even Trish looked a bit put off. This was good. It was exactly the sort of hesitation that Edna required. She flipped out the size gun, and took aim.</span></div></div>",

It was all that she needed and Edna knew that she could take control of this situation again. Shrinking the both of them down for fun could have been better, but what's better than two toys? A world full of them. Knowing she had such a small window of opportunity, Edna haphazardly spun that dial as fast as she could and shot herself before either of them knew what was going on. Much to that note, they had no idea for a moment, why Edna was getting heavier in Ruthie's hand. Although the speed in which she shot up made it very obvious, she was growing. <b>\"What the?!\"</b> Trish would shout, balling up her fist ready to smash Edna into paste, but in the blink of an eye, she had went from normal human sized, to half of their size, and in the next, twice their size. Trish's green eyes widened as she looked on, Edna gaining height, those feet of her encased within those black flip flops, leading up to a pair of bare legs until they hit her rather short and tight shorts, and loose fitting black short with \"Death Note\" printed across the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she doing?\" Trish would call out, her voice losing it's power over Edna, still able to shake the bugs which were getting increasingly smaller at her feet. No longer did it shake and quake, or even scare her though, now it was laughable. Grabbing Ruthie by the hand, Trish would begin to take her and run, not so much trying to get away from Edna, whilst Trish was no doubt a bruiser, a fighter. She was leaps and bounds away from being at all dumb. The way Edna was enlarging, she had no idea when it would stop, she already far above doubled their height, if not tripled and still going strong. Knowing that she didn't want to get bulldozed by those feet if it came to that, she wanted to get Ruthie back away a safe distance so that neither of them got hurt. It was actually quite the sight for Edna who looked on, a warm feeling entering her stomach as she watched this cold girl, actually showing her feelings for Ruthie, to protect her. Though said warmness was immediately taken away and replaced by a sinister chuckle once she realized how small they were getting, being forced to run away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish, refused to look back, especially after hearing that deepening chuckle from Edna, she could almost feel this girl growing behind her, and she was. It wouldn't be until she heard a near deafening laughter and the words <b>\"Guess I'm done.\"</b>. Trish would slowly turn around, and a look of terror would cross her face. For the first time in her life, this woman was actually scared, mouth slightly agape and unable to formulate words. The only thing visible of Edna was her knees and down, the rest of her having disappeared into the clouds. Her Flip flops having bulldozed the immediate area, including the ruins of Heather's Kingdom, the school and much, much else. Trish couldn't help but look and try and judge the distance that she had ran with Ruthie, and it was just shy of a mile in comparison to normal human measurements. A terrifying giggle could be heard, leaving both Trish and Ruthie to look up, and see that Edna had cleared the clouds to look down on them, a playful yet sinister smile on her face. <b>\"Oh hey guys, remember me? Looks like geek girl is in charge now, huh Trish.\"</b> She would taunt the fighter, knowing full well she couldn't do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo showcase how much bigger she was to them, that distance that they had ran, Edna would easily be able to clear it in a single step, stepping forward with her right foot, it cutting the wind around it, and creating a gust of hell for those below. Men, women and children alike being tossed into the air from this simply action, of course they were too insignificant for Edna to notice at this moment. After all, she had two others who were by far more important to her right now. Her right foot would land just a scant two inches, at least to her, away from Trish, her left coming along and landing the same distance away from Ruthie. She keeping her feet close together to box them in, placing them between her feet as she looked down on them, allowing them to look up at what she saw as her superior body. Trish would merely pull Ruthie in closer, gritting her teeth and balling her fists up, ready to protect this girl. Though, Ruthie would only put a reassuring hand on her shoulder, practically telling her it was hopeless to try it her way. <b>So Trish, how did it feel to be on top for awhile? Good, I hope, because that's over, and you didn't get to enjoy Ruthie all that much did you? Hope it was worth it.\"</b> Edna would boom, taunting Trish further with her laughter, only causing Trish to become more and more enraged as opposed to scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was exactly the reaction that Edna wanted, after all, looking down at these two, she could see that they were not even ankle height to her, they having to reach up and touch her ankle if they wanted. By rough calculation, not to mention that the clouds were at knee height with her. This would put her approximately in the 12,000 foot margin well over two miles tall with a thousand feet worth of change and then some. This made Trish and Ruthie bugs at her feet, and whilst she still cared deeply for Ruthie, Trish was a whole other story. That sadistic grin forming on her face, remembering how Trish treated her when she was smaller, how Trish tried to control the situation, oh she was going to make her pay for that. <b>\"You ready to die, Trish?\"</b> She would ask with an arrogant grin on her face. This causing Trish to take a step back, taken back, still unwilling to show her fear of the situation, even when facing death. Edna would simply begin to raise her foot into the air, this huge flip flop raining down building and other debris it had collected from her few steps. It was a truly breathtaking sight for anyone unlucky enough to be under it. Still, before Edna could step down on Trish, she having attempted to push Ruthie away from her to spare her this fate. Ruthie would do the unthinkable, she would get in front of Trish, holding her arms out to her sides as if protecting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Edna off guard, not expecting her to safeguard Trish when she was about to end her. Sure she was aware of Trish's crush on Ruthie, but in this short time, had she actually won Ruthie over? Visions of Trish pulling her along with her to save her, standing in front of her to protect her from Edna. It did bring up the idea that Trish did in fact care for Ruthie, and perhaps the feeling was mutual. \"No! Don't do this Edna, please!\" Ruthie would plead, her voice barely reaching Edna's ears. For a moment, she was left to consider this, her Best Friend's plea, the one person at school who actually cared for her. Edna's foot hovering in the air above them, continued to rain down more and more rubble here and there, leaving the three in silence as Edna made her decision.</span></div></div>",

But the titanic teen didn't do so. Rather, she moved it aside. \"I'm not going to kill you,\" she sneered. \"But you're still going to be punished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that decree, Edna opened fire on the two smaller giants with her size ray, laughing darkly as they began to shrink, smaller and smaller. \"For the crime of betraying me for an ant, you can live among the rest of them,\" Edna chuckled. \"I'll rule this world alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two former titans returned to their natural proportions, Edna considered her next move, as an undisputed goddess.</span></div></div>",

Although that slight feeling of betrayal, a knife in her back as it were for her. For Ruthie to actually stand up and protect Trish from her, it was painful. For a moment making her consider her ways. Perhaps a large contributing factor of why she didn't just stomp both of them flat being that she saw some of Heather forming in her, how small she used to make Edna feel. Literally displayed with the difference between her and the other two at current. Though with them now normal sized, as insignificant to her as the rest of the world, it didn't seem to matter. These thoughts, merely in the back of her mind, an after thought as she turned to look at the city. The very same city which Trish was wanting to trash earlier after she allowed her to deal with Heather. Soon enough, that dark grin would return to her face as she turned on her heels and began to make her way for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Trish and Ruthie on the ground however, this action, mixed with her first step was truly devastating for the both of them. They having barely enough time to even look to adjust to their new puny size. The mere action of Edna turning her body around was enough to generate a gust which swept them up. It unimaginable that a being this vast existed and could still move like she did. This would only get worse as she would take her first step. The two being pulled in to her as she turned, both screaming and clawing at the air. Doing all that they could to grab on to something, if anything. The wind from her step would only redirect their momentum skyward, throwing them untold heights into the sky. Only to, and much to their dismay, land on something black, the ground very weird to them as they held on for dear life to it. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"BOOM\"</font> Would be all it took for Trish to whip her head around, and see something which made her lose all the color in her face. Looking down, well over a thousand feet below, were the long expanse of Edna's bare legs, leading into those feet in her flip flops. The right of which was currently crushing a neighborhood on the outskirts of the city. The dust and debri not even kicking up past the immeasurable wall of black which of the sole of her flip flop. Thin and worn by her standard, a towering monolith to the rest of the ants. The slap of her feet onto that sole, much like a thunderclap which shook everything within the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no way!\" Trish would shout, her grip tightening on this material which she now knew to be Edna's shorts. The two of them having landed near the waistband, and sure enough, as she looked up, she could see the bottom of her shirt passing over said waistband, it a few sizes too big for Edna after all. Looking to her left she was quite relieved to see that Ruthie had also made it, and not too far apart. It a miracle they managed to stay together as they did. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"BOOM\"</font> Trish wouldn't even bother looking down this time, knowing full well what was happening, the only thing she would do was look back, and see that the city was far closer than it had been moments ago. \"She's going for it.\" Trish would mutter to herself, slightly annoyed to not be doing this herself. Kicking herself for not smashing this geek to paste earlier. Still, she would look to Ruthie, who looked absolutely terrified, with a motion of her head, she would wordlessly tell Ruthie to climb. She even taking the fist few steps toward this, using her small size to her advantage, able to use the threads as footholds to climb. The two of them able to make it to the waistband, going under the shirt to do so, just as Edna would make it to the edge of the city. The two of them able to sit for the moment, side by side on the waistband of Edna's shorts, nailing into their minds just how insignificant, not only they, but the entire world was to Edna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the rest of the world, they were the safest of the safe it seemed. The rest of the world was literally at the feet of this geek girl turned psycho from years of abuse. Meanwhile they were at least safe from mercilessly being stomped, although this didn't mean they didn't have their dangers where they were at. Behind them, a gap which wouldn't be noticeable to the wearer of these shorts, from where the waistband didn't perfectly meet with her hips. It created a chasm of which they could fall in, down either into the panties of this girl, or worse, down out of her pant legs of these shorts. Of course, a bad enough stomp could send them forward and down the way they came to fall to their death all the same. These thoughts, mixed with the fact that they could comfortably actually sit where they were and have room, hell maybe even throw a picnic, it infuriated Trish to no end. \"I'm going to kill her!\" She would shout, seething mad as she sat next to Ruthie. Holding her head in her hands, pissed about being normal again and turned on by this geek girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie however, caught in the middle, couldn't help but stay quiet. On one hand, there was Trish who in this short time had done so much for her, showed that she cared at least for somebody. Part of herself unsure just how she felt about her, whether the feelings were mutual of not. Still she cared enough to not want Trish to end up dead, after all she was now a friend, if not more to her. On the other hand however, there was Edna, her long time friend and someone she has felt sorry for all her life.The subject of being picked on, tortured by the popular scene, and for what, because she was smarter than them? Heather the main problem with this, and she was dead and now Edna was an unstoppable goddess on a rampage, pushed over the edge by the deceased. \"We have to do something, we got to talk some sense into her.\" Ruthie would suggest, wanting to find that middle ground, but all it did was make Trish laugh. \"You know she's not going to listen, hell I'm surprised I'm still alive. We need to get to that device, that's the only way to stop her.\" Trish would offer, though her plans were far more sinister than she led on, wanting to grow even bigger than Edna and crush that bitch flat. Still, Ruthie could only nod, weighing their options for the time being until it was time to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna, now on the outskirts of the city, her flip flops at the edge of the city, could only look down, a grin plastered across her face. Hands on her hips and casting her terrifying shadow across the land. She couldn't help but chuckle evilly as she looked down upon them as they were. Insignificant, inferior and a waste, mere playthings for her.<b>\"As one of you ants said once before, You are fucked\"</b> Edna would quote Trish, still unaware of her current passengers on her shorts, inside her shirt and having a full view of her stomach and underside of her breasts. All she cares about now was in front of her. Device in hand, she pondered what she wanted to do. She could become even bigger and simply stomp this city out in one go, or she could take her time and methodically torment this city one stomp at a time. Either was rather tempting for her.</span></div></div>",

It was, to her perspective, short and to the point, simply obliterating anything under her impossibly huge foot. She didn't experience the slightest resistance as she snuffed countless lives with the simplest of motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned slightly, deciding that was undesirable. No, she wanted to FEEL her power as she wiped this bustling metropolis off like the bit of dirt that it truly was to her. Sliding her foot out of her flip-flop, she made her next step much, much slower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming for you all,\" she whispered to herself, still a relative thunderclap of sound to anyone for miles around. The soft, wrinkled flesh of her foot essentially became the sky for those unfortunate enough to be in her path, and Edna thrilled to imagine it. Hundreds, no, thousands, of people, at her mercy. And she had none left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe audibly moaned as she felt the first building offer its pithy resistance to her descending foot, enjoying the feeling as it submitting and crumbled. Her power lust was quickly mixing with her physical lust, and Edna's eyes rolled back slightly behind closed lids, savoring the ecstasy of destruction at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just germs to me,\" she purred, rubbing her chest slightly with her free hand. \"I'm so far above you. Genius, impossibly strong, beautiful...\" She'd never considered herself pretty before, but she felt nothing but pride and egomania at her new stature. \"And what are you? You can't even budge my foot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother low moan as she felt her foot meet, then sink into, the ground. A chuckle followed. \"That felt...wonderful,\" she sighed, taking another slowly, taunting step. She was very obviously becoming aroused, now; Trish and Ruthie, at her waistband, would be able to feel their unknowing host begin to heat up, a steady furnace building within her loins. If Edna got too carried away, their position could become even more precarious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna took another step...</span></div></div>",

The fact that nothing stood a chance at her feet, flip flops or bare, they crushed all the same. The purrs, the moans that she allowed to come from her mouth, a long time in the making for this young woman. Being who she was, and her standing within the school. Edna had never had much in the way of romance in her life, no boyfriend, or even a girlfriend.  Most knew it would be social suicide to get near her, and the only one who seemed to not care about that was Ruthie, and even she turned her back on her in the end, rather this is what she liked to think. Screams heard all around the city, alarms going off, fires kicking up from the buildings she crushed. impossibly large sections of the city, buried within her footprints, condemned to a five toed grave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna couldn't help but bite her lip, feeling the heat generating within her, causing her cheeks to flush, her breathing to increase. Edna was ready for what she had heard many talk about before, to put her studies aside and focus on herself. After all, her ascension into Goddess hood was all the confidence building she needed to take her game to a whole new level. Much of the city would be immediately eclipsed, the sun being blotted out and leaving many to simply point and scream. The smart ones who accepted death would be treated to quite the view of Edna's ass, still contained within her shorts coming down upon them. Pulling he material tight around her rump and of course, compacting everything caught underneath it. Nothing survived, nothing even came close to resisting against her full weight. A girl who couldn't have weight over a hundred pounds before, now an immeasurable behemoth which with even the smallest of efforts could destroy anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe satisfying crunch felt underneath her would cause yet another exasperated sigh to escape her, the furnace building behind Trish and Ruthie's back. Alerting them to what was happening to Edna's body. They able to see Edna's enormous fingers gripping the edge of her shirt, ready to lift it up and get to work, though a loud explosion would put a halt to that immediately. Edna barely feeling much of anything aside a small heated sensation to her finger, would lazily look to the source. The Military had arrived, and were looking to stop her once and for all before anymore died. A laughable cause as she surveyed this troop, a legion of tanks rolling up the streets, a swarm of jets flying over head. It was enough to get a sultry laugh out of Edna who was still lost in the moment. <b>\"Really?\"</b> She would sigh, clearly annoyed at the disruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing herself to her feet, Edna would be left to look down upon them. The action of her getting up, like a mountain rising at the drop of a hat. It was enough to catch a few jets off guard, catching them in her hair. Their fiery explosions going unnoticed to Edna who merely glared down upon these ants who wanted to fight back. hands on her hips, she sneered down at them, shifting her feet slightly. The smallest of movements actually causing enough of a tremor to flip the tanks closest to her. A sight which only caused this colossal geek gal to snicker, the only question was, what was a girl to do with them? She could go the classic route and stomp them flat, or she could get creative with her use of the size device.</span></div></div>",

The hear rising to her cheeks as well as turning up the heat behind Trish and Ruthie, she needed it not more than ever. Taking a seat yet again, with the same untold carnage as before. The kick up of debris, the satisfying crunch underneath her ass. She would encircle her legs to that the bottoms of her bare feet touched on another, allowing a silent gasp to escape her as she let her right hand fish at the bottom of her shirt again. This time, the military, the fighter jets long gone. No doubt having went back to report their defeat and plan for the next wave, Edna would be waiting and hopefully refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish's attention would be grabbed yet again as she saw the black wall which was the inside of Edna's shirt shift.

Day light once more hitting Trish and Ruthie, causing them to shield there eyes, temporarily blinded, but not deaf. <b>\"Oh!\"</b> Trish would hear Edna moan, and she could only lower her head, knowing to herself that they had been found.

Her Index finger lazily pulling the waistband of her shorts, as well as her panties away from her. Opening up that chasm even more for these two. A wave of heat rising up and nearly taking Ruthie off her feet in surprise. How did her friend that she had known for so long, become so cruel so suddenly? Sure she had been picked on by bullies, but Ruthie wasn't a bully, she was her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edna, no please!\" Ruthie would shout, doing her best to back away from the pit to hell as it were.

She was fairly certain that even at her previous height, this would have swallowed her up no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither would get too long to think on the matter however as the finger belonging to Edna's hand would give the waistband a good shake and tilt, forcing these two to fall in.

They acting as sort of a slide for these two as they simply slid down \"comfortably\" as you could be in this situation. It being a plus that once they reached the bottom that the fabric of the underwear was soft enough and the fact that slid down, resulted in no injury's. Still it didn't take away from the fact that they were now in front of Edna's most precious part. Hungry with desire, salivating with anticipation and emitting such intense heat it was far from comfortable for these two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slap of her waist band being released, and the soft tap of Edna's hand on the crotch of her shorts is all they would hear and feel as she would simply giggle. <b>\"Jeez, who knew I was so desirable.\"</b> Edna would shrug, continuing to giggle as the thoughts, the confidence was building inside her. <b>\"Oh I bet you're enjoying yourself in there Trish, since you're into girls and all. I'm a bit more woman than Ruthie at the moment though, so be careful.\"</b> She couldn't help but chuckle at her repeated pokes, enjoying her prodding at Trish.

Her 12,000 foot body shrinking, she frustrated beyond belief by how solo this experience had been. She too big to interact with much of anything. The people below ants, their building so fragile that if she breathed on them wrong, they seemed to break. Of course, she wasn't the only one who seemed to notice the change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, underneath the waistband of those shorts, deep within the panties that Edna wore, her two passengers were the first to notice that the behemoth was decreasing in size. Although their method of measurement was far more intimate than anyone else could imagine. Whilst the rest of the world could see that this Geek's feet were getting smaller and smaller, taking up less and less room. Trish and Ruthie would simply put, notice that the room that they had, previously able to have possibly fit a building in there. Able to comfortably move around due to the amount of room they had, but also, and perhaps most importantly. Able to stay away from Edna's most private of parts. Clearly showing the excitement of Edna and making a wet spot in the front of those panties. Though prior the room they had allowed them to merely stay to the side of this wet patch. With the shrinking confines however, it wouldn't be long before both of them were back first, or in Trish's case, face first into the damp material, and coughing, spitting it free from her mouth. \"She's getting smaller!\" Ruthie would proclaim, somewhat out of excitement, perhaps believing that Edna was coming to her senses, though Trish would not be so easily swayed. \"No shit, and she's still as ready to go as ever.\" The tone in Trish's voice was that of someone who was not enjoying her time in another woman's panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping her eyes, trying to clean of them of the sticky substance which was dampening her face, it wouldn't be too much longer before Trish felt he back pressing up against Edna. Her space to maneuver disappearing as she was literally being stuck into position, pinned between the now tighter panties up against this girls body. Fortunately, to the side of what Edna was clearly wanting to give attention. It having lost much of it's terrifying bulk, no longer an obscene colossal terror of womanly fresh that could swallow her whole and possibly not feel it. Oh, it would still eat her, but now, the host would certainly feel it, as was Edna's plan. In the world outside of Edna's panties. The monolithic Geek had reduced herself to a far more modest one-thousand feet tall, twice the size of what Trish and Ruthie had been. Still big enough to dominate whatever she wanted, and making such things such a buses and certain buildings useable. Not to mention, though they were still less than an inch tall in comparison, she could now feel Ruthie and Trish in her panties. Both outside of her intimacy, one of each side of it, though for how much longer would that be the case?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside the panties, Trish could be found yelling, cursing at Edna and demanding to be let out. Of course this was followed by idle threats which she had no chance of making good on at their current size difference. Although she had more of a chance now, that before, and this thought seemed to spark a light bulb in her head. \"Can you move, Ruth?\" Trish would call out, for the first time using Ruthie's actual name as opposed to a pet name. \"Yeah.\" It was exactly the response that Trish wanted to hear, at least things could begin looking up for the pair. Trish could hear the moans coming from above, hot and heavy and she knew them well. Having experienced them herself, Edna was close to beginning, and possibly unable to hold back which meant bad things for them. Although, it possibly didn't even matter anyways, considering the power mad mindset Edna was in, Trish possibly only on borrowed time before Edna simply killed her. \"Look, we really need to get out of here before she begins.\" It was only stage one of the plan, but it was essential. Trish didn't want to be in here much longer, and as she looked up, she feared seeing Edna looking down at her with her waistband open. Fortunately it wasn't the case, and she would take her first few steps to escaping, assuming Ruthie was keeping up. </span></div></div>",

Not only that she could also the carnage her friend had wrought while she was trapped. It made her want to throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Trish?\" Edna demanded. Ruth's eyes widened, Edna was pissed. Then again she'd been pissed off majority of the day. Ruth didn't immediately answer, how could she. This was all just to much. Oh, how she wished she could go back to simpler times when her friend wasn't a giant monster and there was still a city to live in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHERE IS TRISH!\" Edna again demanded. She was already frustrated, but now she was getting more and more furious because of Ruthie's silence. Ruth knew Edna wanted her to answer, she then remembered Trish's plan. She needed to stall. She needed to keep Edna occupied. Silence wouldn't do that for very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustering up the courage to speak, Ruth spoke. \"I-I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna was not pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you don't know!?

She needed to keep talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not lying, I swear. When everything starting shrinking we got separated. I don't know where she is.\" Ruth felt Edna's grip loosen, but not by very much. At least she had Edna's full attention. \"B-Besides, why are so focused on h-her anyway? Shouldn't you be more f-focused on yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me\" Edna tilted her head. \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the giant girl, a certain MMA bitch was beginning to scale her jeans, thanking her lucky stars that this Geek wore such loose fitting clothes. Thankfully Trish remembered the pocket knife she had stashed away in one of her shoes. As she scaled the colossal geek, she could hear the conversation between her and Ruth, she just hoped Ruth didn't get herself killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you worried about what's going to happen to you when all of this is over.\" Ruth asked, finally loosing her stutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding, right. With my size-ray I'm gonna rule the world. So no, I'm not worried. None of these ants can stop me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How ironic. You sound just like Heather.\" That proved to be the wrong thing to say as Edna's grip again tightened and she glared down at her 'tiny' friend with malice. How dare she compare her to that evil little bitch. They were nothing alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are nothing alike!\" Edna roared. \"Don't you dare compare us! She was nothing more than a bully. And in the end I showed her she was nothing more than food for the strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish on her part was making some good headway in her climb, but momentarily paused when she hear Edna's screams of rage. It seemed like Ruthie had mentioned the school bully that had been the catalyst to send the geek to the dark side. If only she hadn't let Ruth convince her to let Edna make the kill. If she'd just killed Heather like she originally planned to, they all wouldn't be in this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strong?\" Ruth parroted. For the first time since this conversation started, Ruth felt her blood begin to boil. \"Look around you Edna. What do you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna humored the 'ant' and did as instructed. She smirked at all the destruction she caused. \"I see symbol of my strength.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong! This isn't strength. You don't know the first thing about strength! This just power! Look at all this mess! Looked at what you've done! You originally wanted to get back at Heather! Well what did those innocent people you killed do! Did all those innocent women and children need to die!? You've become a monster, a bully just like Heather. Yeah, you may be powerful... But you're not strong! In the end, Heather won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah! How do you figure that!?\" Enda screamed. \"She's dead, how can you call that a victory!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth glared at her 'friend' with as much malice as Edna herself. \"The proof's all around you! She made you loose control!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish finally reached her destination. Edna's pocket that she was using as a holster for the size-ray. If Edna reacted the way she thought she would from getting chewed out by Ruthie, everything would work out perfectly. Trish said a silent prayer as she slid into Edna's pocket and into the barrel of the size-ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! NO! NO!\" Enda had had enough. \"I am strong! Stronger than you, stronger than Trish, stronger than these 'ants', And I'm damn sure stronger than Heather! I'll prove it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth could only marvel at how accurate Edna's reaction was to what Trish described. Ruth felt Edna's grip loosening as she reached into her pocket and pulled out the size-ray. She used her nose to flick the switch to grow. Ruth couldn't see if Trish had reached the gun or not, she only hoped she stalled Edna enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you just how strong I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna aimed the ray at herself and pulled the trigger. She expected to grow to unheard of levels, instead the rays never reached her. She looked into the barrel and saw something else entirely. In an instant the delinquent known as Trish popped out and decked her across the face. Edna went crashing to the ground hard as Ruth and the size-ray flew through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth could only scream as gravity took affect and she began to fall. She expected to become nothing more than street pizza when she hit the ground, but luck was on her side when she felt herself collide with something soft. She had landed in the outstretched palm of Trish who had not only caught her but the size-ray as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna slowly started to regain her footing when she noticed the sight in front of her. Her so called friend in the palm of the recently regrown school delinquent. She'd been tricked. Trish had somehow made it into the barrel of her gun. She unconsciously reached to her side only to find her size-ray missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"looking for this?\" Trish taunted as she held the gun up high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna felt her heart sink. \"This can't be happening!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is geek. How did it feel to be on top for awhile? Good I hope, because that's over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna was a mixture of both livid and scared. When she was a giant she could take Trish on without any effort, but in a fair fight she'd get clobbered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have two choices here nerd. Either step down or get knocked down.\" Trish then proceeded to crack her neck in an intimidating fashion. \"And I really hope you pick option B.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth then added her two cents. \"Edna. It's time to stop.\"</span></div></div>",

If Edna wouldn't surrender then Trish was going to beat her within an inch of her life. Or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant geek girl would have none of it however. She refused to listen to the words of that treacherous ant. She could still salvage the situation. All she had to do was get the size-ray back from that damn delinquent. Once she did she could get right back to business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, that what she'd do. She didn't need to fight Trish head on. All she had to do was get back the size-ray before the MMA girl had a chance to use it against her. Edna had a plan, all she needed to do was execute it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No chance ant. If your new gal pal wants a fight then bring it on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie looked absolutely shocked. Not only had she failed to get Edna to back down, she actually wanted to fight Trish. Just what was she thinking? Ruthie knew Edna better than anyone in the whole school, the geek girl didn't have the ability to fight anyone. Was Edna really going to risk everything on this all or nothing gambit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish grinned ferally. \"You hearing this bitch, Ruth? Geek girl's too far gone. If she wants to fight than it's her funeral.\" Trish looked down at the size-ray that was still set to grow. All she had to do was blast herself again and she'd kill this nerd with one stomp. Or maybe she'd make her suffer first and do to her what she originally had planned for Heather?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna followed Trish's gaze and began to sweat, it was time to put her plan into action and hope for the best. \"I see you're eyeing my magnum opus pretty hard there. What's wrong Trish? I thought you were supposed to be tough girl. Can't win without a little assist? Just how weak are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish's blood was boiling. Did this geek just call her weak? At their normal size she could crush her just as easily as a spider under her heel. What was her game? Was she trying to make her mad. That's when it hit her. Edna was trying to get her mad. She didn't care about having a fight. She just wanted to get to the size-ray when they tussled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth instantly knew what Edna was planning now. She was trying to rile Trish up and not make her use her own invention against her. Leave it to Edna to be so sneaky. She was honestly seeing a whole new side of her friend today and she really didn't like it. She was about to call out to Trish until she hear the larger girl laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dumb do you think I am, geek? Did you honestly think I wouldn't see through your bluff. Sorry, but I'm not letting you trick me like I tricked you. This is your end of days, bitch. Now it's time for you to pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna's blood ran cold. She miscalculated, Trish so right through her. Edna was about to beg until Trish aimed the size-ray at herself. Edna's eyes grew as big as saucers as a familiar glow surrounded Trish's body. Edna started to back away as Trish's shadow began to consume everything around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish's height just kept on climbing higher and higher until she was at the height Edna held previous. Trish had eclipsed her and now she was the goddess. She was back on top while Edna was reduced to mere ant in comparison. How did things go so wrong for her? Maybe her brother was right to call her a born looser. Her luck was terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth could only marvel at the view before her. just a moment ago she Edna was a giant, now she could barely see her. It would seem the ray affected her too. She was still small enough to fit in Trish's hand so it made it appear that she hadn't grown even though she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what true power feels like.\" Trish boomed. She was the biggest thing alive at the moment and was loving it. No wonder that nerd went on such a power trip. It was hard not to when you felt this untouchable. Speaking of the nerd. Trish looked down to see an ant sized Edna staring back at her fear written all over her face. She couldn't run and she couldn't hide. She literally had nowhere to go and Trish knew it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was payback time...</span></div></div>",

It seemed the school delinquent had come to a decision. She was going to do to her what she had originally planned for Heather. Death by sneakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna remembered the vile smell and it seemed almost worse than before. It made her want to wretch, but somehow she managed to hold down her lunch. Trish grinned evilly as she saw the 'ant' start to back away. Good! She should be afraid. She should be very, very, very, VERY, afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's showtime.\" Trish smiled as she slammed her shoe into the ground. The resulting shockwave sent Edna skidding across the ground violently. Whatever structure was left standing behind her was obliterated by the sheer force and sent sailing through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe geek girl slowly crawled to her feet to see the giant DC logo of Trish's rundown sneakers staring back at her. All color left her face knowing Trish fully intended on sending her to a very embarrassing and stinky demise. She had to get away! She couldn't die like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to turn tail, but found her path cut off by the dingy socked foot of her new goddess. Edna stopped dead in her tracks and looked up to see Trish's face. The evil look in her eyes was like that of a cat that's cornered it's prey. There was no way to escape her. Not at her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think you're going?\" Trish taunted. \"I thought you were supposed to be a tough girl. Just how weak are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe geek girl broke out into a cold sweat as Trish threw her words back in her face. Was this what she was like when consumed by power? Comparing how Trish was acting now to how she'd been acting not to long ago, it was like looking in a mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna was so lost in her own head she almost didn't register that the ground beneath her was getting further and further away. Terror filled her heart as she realized there were two very large finger nails that raising her up by the shirt. Trish had caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuthie couldn't help but look at her friend with pity. She had brought this all on herself. She had ample opportunity to stop this madness but chose to let her insanity run free. Too many innocent lives had been lost. Now it was time for Edna to learn that her actions had consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna was now staring face to face with both Trish and Ruth whilst being dangled precariously over the former's stink trap. This wasn't at all what she wanted. All she wanted was to make Heather pay. Then that's when Ruthie's words from earlier came back to her. Why did she do all this? She'd gotten her revenge so why continue making others suffer? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey nerd!?\" Trish called. \"I hope you've made peace with your maker because you're going to be seeing him real soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna's could feel the tears forming in her eyes. She didn't want to die. Not like this! Not in such an undignified manner! \"Wait!\" She cried. \"Ruthie! Stop her, please! It's me, Edna! Your best friend! I surrender! I'll stop! I'll turn myself in! I'll do anything you want just stop her, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth looked just as much torn as she was shocked. Edna was crying. The mania that once consumed her seemed to have disappeared. The nerd she'd been friends with for so long was back and the stranger wearing her face was nowhere to be found. The only problem now was what was she going to do. On the one hand she didn't want to sentence her friend to death. On the other, she'd done way too much for her to just let her go unpunished either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish, noticing her new gal pal's confusion let out an annoyed sigh. \"It's your call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was now essentially playing the role of judge, jury and if need be, executioner. She tried multiple times to get Edna surrender, the only way the nerd girl did is when she found herself dangling over a giant smelly shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Ruth was really going to be the great decider, she needed to think. Edna only did what she did to get back at Heather. But at the same time once he did she went mad with power and went on a rampage through the city, killing who knows how many. But could she really blame Edna? After all power changes people. Weren't all three of them going to become goddesses and squash every last piece of 'trash' in the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something to consider. But then again, she and Trish never git the chance because Edna stabbed them in the back and became a goddess herself. She killed innocents, something Trish and herself didn't do. surprisingly enough, despite trying to kill Heather, Trish's hands were clean. She and herself hand taken a life. Where as Edna claimed many. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth knew Edna since they were little. Yes the geek girl was a victim of bullying but she never acted psychotic about it. Were her action's today a byproduct of years of abuse and neglect? Or was this simply inside her all along? Or maybe both? Who was the real Edna? Ruthie racked her brain for what felt like an eternity, until her mind settled on one person... Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes Heather. The catalyst for all of this insanity. The idol of their school and the bully of nearly everyone she came across. She pushed Edna to this. But at the same time blaming the now dead girl would just be an easy cop out. It was hard to admit, but she played a role to. She should have been there for her friend more. Trish also played a role, but for unknown reasons left Edna alone for the last year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth was about to tell Trish to spare the helpless geek girl until she took a moment to take in the ruined city. The smashed building, broken streets, crushed cars, and dead civilians. Despite everything that lead up to this moment, Edna chose to go down this path. Each and every person is responsible for their own actions and Edna was no exception. She then thought back to Edna's words when she gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a genius far beyond what anyone expected. To build something straight out of science fiction was astounding. But like any mad scientist, she became corrupted. If they let her go, who's to say she can't build another size-ray? NO! As much as she would love to go back to how things used to be... That just wasn't possible. That wouldn't be realistic. It broke her heart. But at the end of the day, Ruthie made the tough call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish!\" She called, gaining the giantess' attention. \"Drop her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny hope for mercy Edna thought she would get from her 'former' best friend was turned to dust with those words. Trish looked ecstatic at Ruthie's decision. Revenge would be hers and it would taste so sweet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a vicious grin she looked Edna dead in the eyes. \"You heard the lady.\" And then she released her hold. Edna felt herself falling, the world around her moving in comical slow motion. Out of all the scenario's she envisioned, this wasn't one of them. All she felt as she plummeted to her doom was guilt and fear. Is this what Heather felt in those final moments of her life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna would have no more time left to ponder these thoughts as she felt herself collide with a wet smack against a soft yet firm surface. It didn't take a genius to figure out where she was. As she rose to her feet she noticed the black interior all around her, and the rancid smell that came with it. She was inside Trish's shoe, the very same shoe she was originally going to throw Heather into before Ruthie convinced Trish to let her make the kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that's where it all went wrong for her? Once she killed Heather it was as if the devil inside had been awakened. She never would've guessed she had so much evil inside of her. Edna was still terrified though, and she looked up to see the light above her. It was the last time she would ever see the sky again. Maybe... This is what she deserved?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes then widened as the light began to fade, descending down on her was the scariest thing she'd ever laid eyes on... Trish's foot entering the shoe. The very source of the smell and sweat that lingered in the dark place was now going to trapped inside with her. She was going to be crushed like a car in scrapyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna's natural instinct was to run, but at her size there was no way to outrun the massive foot that was looming over her. Plus the walls all around her ensured there would be no escape. She ran as far as she could to the very head of the shoe but that did nothing to protect her. She was soon forcefully pinned down by the massive foot she tried to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a horrible way to go. Edna was pinned and in pain. The vile smell as well as the heat was magnified to unheard of degrees. Edna began sweating like a pig from the heat, and Trish's accumulated sweat wasn't helping either. It soon began to build under Edna as she was being forced down into the sole of the shoe. She was drowning as well as being crushed. A slow and painful death. She struggled and struggled and struggled until finally... She could struggle no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside Trish had a cruel smirk of satisfaction at making the geek girl suffer. No one fucked her over and got away with it. Now that the geek was dealt with and she had the size-ray as well as Ruth, the question was where did she go from here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dominating the army with such ease aroused her greatly, maybe she could even put her size-ray to good use? Oh there were just so many possibilities. Edna could feel herself heating up just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take her long to reach the army base either as at her current height it only took her a few minutes at best. She could see the 'ants' scrambling all about as they saw her coming. They were so pathetically small and terrified of her. Edna's grin threatened to split her face knowing the 'ants' were afraid. Oh how she would enjoy crushing them underfoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second?\" Edna thought. This was an army base, these were the only people brave enough and stupid enough to try and fight back. Stomping them out wasn't good enough. They needed a punishment fitting of attacking a goddess. Edna looked back at her size-ray when an idea came to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin turned dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe army base shook as Edna approached. The soldiers inside scrambling around trying to find a way to either fight back or live to fight another day. They had all heard the report from the city before they were all cut off. It wasn't good. Now the unstoppable giantess was coming for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna smiled seeing the army in disarray, too bad she wouldn't be able to enjoy it for much longer. It was time to address them before they met their eventual fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ants! For crimes against your goddess, you will be punished!\" She aimed the size-ray at the base. The soldiers looking up at her in fear. \"No longer will you be ants! From this day forth you're all mites!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the trigger, and in an instant they were nothing more than a speck to her. She almost couldn't even distinguish the base from the dirt all around her. Meanwhile down below the soldiers on the base were freaking out, their world just got a whole lot bigger as they got a whole lot smaller. How!? This didn't seem physically possible! Worst of all, what was the self proclaimed goddess going to do with them now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna giggled. \"You're all so small now your base could probably fit into the pores of my foot. Actually, that's not a bad idea. Without giving it much thought, Edna pushed her big to forward and watched the mites disappear into the cavernous skin pore. She couldn't feel them but knew they weren't having a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside the skin pore the army struggled for escape. it was dark and filled with dirt and debris. Escape was all they could think about, but there was just so much rubble to get through that it seemed damn near impossible. Then just to add to their misery, a giant mountain for dirt rushed in, bury half the base. Reality struck them all hard. They were all doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna couldn't be more pleased with herself. A punishment fitting mites. Now it was time to get back to business.</span></div></div>",

Jason just stands there, she shrinks him back to normal size, nobody calls the police, and they all get smoothies? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about three giant strides away from her and had long arms and massive hands even relative to his size.

She buried her face in the flesh of Jason's thumb, waiting for death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On Heather?\" Jason further pressed.

Oh my god!\" <br>\r\nMrs Vicky started to make out little buildings and even frightened people between the buildings. The reason for that is, that Edna build the size ray with the effect, that if you focus on one or more of your senses, these senses would increase in effectiveness.

I can't change that, but I can do the best out of it.\" <br>\r\nFeeling confident again, after years of being insecure, of feeling weak, mrs Vicky finally felt happy with herself. <br>\r\nShe basically could do everything she wanted and no one would be able to stop her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I looked back at the city, the man had stopped to masturbate, he was scared and confused now, but I could see, that he was still aroused. I looked at my boobs. They were huge, even for me. They were firm, but still really soft and perfectly round. I hold one of them up, it was a wonder that I didn't had any back pains from them. I let go of my tit, making it bounce. Maybe I was a little bit to harsh to the man, I mean, he was just enjoying the view, he wasn't as afraid as the other people, he didn't acted like one of the students. Maybe I should give him a better look at my babies.<br>\r\nAfter finishing my inner debate, I slammed my body face first against the ground, directly in front of the building there the man was. My boobs worked like pillows for me, while I made sure that the city around the man was being destroyed. Everything was being crushed under my body, it almost felt like I was crushing most of the US. I don't know how many people I've killed with that action, but seeing the reaction of the man made it completely worth it. He looked scared, but in a way equally aroused. He had short brown hair, a skinny body and he didn't seem to be older than 25 or something around that age. Overall, he wouldn't stand out so much in a crowd of people, but I liked the way he looked, i can't explain it.<br>\r\n\"Hello again little one. I, your goddess have taken interest in you. So tell me, what is your name?\" I said in a deep voice and a smile on my face. At first the man didn't react, probably progressing everything that was happening in this moment. But then he had the courage to speak up.\" My name is Richard, my goddess.\" Aww, he had already accepted me as his goddess and he was even slightly blushing. I'm probably overreacting to this, but it feels like ages that someone respected me and took me serious. \"Well hello Richard. I see that you really like my figure. Would you please tell me what you think about me overall?\" I said trying to keep a serious face. \"Well uhm... You look really good and your obviously are a great pers- I mean goddess.\" I start liking this boy more and more with every second. He behaves like I want everyone to behave when I'm around. \"Come on, say what you really think about me. You don't have to be scared. I won't hurt you\" I tried to keep talking with my deep serious voice, but who was I kidding? I killed millions of people in under an hour. I proclaimed myself the goddess of this earth, after I cried about my miserable life and I made sure to crush as many people and their cities as I could, just to get closer to Richard, right after I said that I would kill everyone who would masturabait to me. Of course he would be scared and tell me anything that would calm me down. \"I uhm... I like your breasts and your big butt as well. Your face is pretty cute too...\" Richard said, quite confident for being in a situation where he could die at any moment. \"And what do think about my seize? I mean, it's the most prominent thing about me.\" To give a demonstration of my sheer power, I put down my finger to a distant city (well distant for him, for me it felt like 2 inches), instantly crushing it. The feeling of killing hundreds of people in an instant, especially when you have improved senses, is one of the best things in my opinion.<br>\r\nRichard, obviously shaken by the the thing he just saw, looked back at me and said \"Well to be honest, I think it's the best thing about you. Yes your curves are amazing and you have a beautiful face, but I was always a fan of tall woman, like really tall. So seeing you, was a bit of an dream becoming true.\" I felt how Richard was more scared of telling me this, than he was from my little demonstration. \"And yeah, it was pretty disturbing to see how you destroyed most of the US in a few minutes. But to be honest, I think you are going to give this planet what it deserves. Punishment! Punishment for all the the suffering that was caused by some selfish people. Punishment for ignoring and hiding problems. Punishment for the ones, who are treating people who are honest, good, kind and selfless like shit!\" I didn't knew what to answer to this, but I knew one thing. I was totally in love with this man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1:she keep talking with Richard and gets to know him better as a person<br>\r\nOr<br>\r\n2:something interrupts the two of them </span></div></div>",

Edna thought, her mind racing and fear spreading through her.

Laura asked 'um, well I might have found something in the basement, but I still made this' Edna yelled up. 'I am not asking, I am telling you Edna, give me the gun, I am your mother and you will listen to me' Laura boomed, she glared at Edna, who shook in her moms grip and slowly offered her the gun. 'That's better' Laura said as she took the gun, which grew to fit comfortably in her hand 'I think this is in the right hands now, don't you Edna? yes right where it belongs.'
