The winter wind enters the tunnel under the street and blows on Jenny's exposed face. Jenny brings her head up from her backpack and smiles at the sight of a bunny scurrying around.<br>\r\n\"Hello James\" Jenny quickly finds a name for her new friend before the bunny escapes into the darkness under a stump.<br>\r\nJenny's joints ache as she finds herself rising from the blankets and to her feet.<br>\r\n\"eeeerrrrrr\" Jenny runs her empty stomach before throwing her duffel bag across her back. <br>\r\nThe bike squeaks and clicks as it wobbles down the street. The seat was ripped and the back tire was bent. But, Jenny loved the bike .<br>\r\nThe bike that Jenny found alongside the rail road tracks now hurdles into motion as Jenny heads down the street. Jenny was 3 miles from the nearest town and her legs ached as she rose and fell with the hills of the road.<br>\r\n\"One last one\" Jenny thought as she started up the last hill before the downward slope into town. Jenny's legs burn as the road grabs at the tires. The wind blows against Jenny's face and her back pack although empty seems to gain weight. Jenny stands on the pedals as her thin figure starts to sway back and forth working the bike to the top of the hill.<br>\r\nStopping at the crest of the hill Jenny looks down and says aloud \"Now where to?\"<br>\r\nJenny could go to the Empire hotel. They always had great food, out back that is. She could go to the park. People were always leaving food laying around there and it was the nearest spot. And then there is the orchard. It has been a while since she has been to the orchard Jenny could load up her backpack without anyone noticing or criticizing her. But, it was also on the other side of town and would take most of the afternoon to get to.</span></div></div>",

A couple of cars go by, the drivers with there minds set on there days plans don't notice the girl. The bike is seen a few times, but it looks like it fell off a truck and no one really cares.<br>\r\nA small baby squirrel runs into the bush and stops to look at Jenny. It head bobbing back and forth is the first sight that Jenny sees as she opens her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Damn it. What the hell happened Bobby?\" The squirrel looks at Jenny and then scampers off and up the tree. Jenny looks over at the tree at her bike. Jenny slowly gets to her feet.A few small scrapes, and a rip above her kneecap on her pants is all that the whole ordeal has done to Jenny.<br>\r\n\"Guess I got lucky there Bobby.\" Jenny says looking up while walking towards the tree.<br>\r\n\"Huh, now it matches\" Jenny boast while looking at the bent front rim. Jenny picks up the bike and moves it back and forth a few times.<br>\r\n\"Seems OK\" Jenny says while setting the chain back into the sprockets. Jenny finds the cable that has frayed and broke going to her breaks and shortens it so she has breaks again.<br>\r\n\"OK, that will about to do it.\"Jenny starts to get on the bike when something catches her eye. The bike dug a small rut next to the tree. Inside of the rut Jenny notices something reflecting the sunlight.<br>\r\nJenny gets off of her bike, letting it fall to the ground. Her fingers begin to tear at the soil around the object until Jenny holds it in her hands. Jenny places it in her palm and starts to clean it with her thumb. The world around her seems to stop, as Jenny fixcates on the luster and the image that makes it self more promoniate with each pass of her thumb.<br>\r\nWhat is reveled is a small circle of symbols  Jenny flips the coin over to a side that has nothing. The side is completely blank.<br>\r\n\"That's weird\" Jenny thinks as she starts to examine the coin some more.<br>\r\n\"errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreep\" Jenny's stomach interrupts remind her of her current situation. Jenny stuffs the coin into her pocket and starts to head down the hill on her bike.</span></div></div>",

Most likely harassing street-people like her.  \"I'll just stick to the outer sidewalks, paths and trails if I have to\", thinks the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trail through the tree-lined area takes her towards another slight ascent up the sidewalk, past an elderly couple, and towards a bench with...the \"Perv\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, great.\", thinks Jenny, as she pedals towards the skeevy bum who she's never spoken to, but who always seems to be undressing her with his those bloodshot eyes of his.  Thus her nickname for the old bum(\"Perv\") Even going uphill, she's got enough speed going that she's not worried about him bugging her(he never has, beyond eying her like a choice cut of meat).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as she passes within yards of the derelict, Jenny feels that familiar sense of repulsion as the creep just stares blatantly at her, as if he's picturing her naked as she peddles past.  Skinny legs pushing the pedals as she zooms towards another slight uphill ascent past the \"Perv\", Jenny looks back long enough to see the bum's eyes grow even wider, as she herself suddenly feels the chill Winter air over her entire body...because she's completely, instantly naked, riding a junk bike uphill with only her backpack still on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the top of the small hill, Jenny nearly has her second wreck of the day, trying to cover-up her young bare body in the middle of a public setting!  Skinny arms covering her small breasts, long legs tiptoed as she straddles the seat of her bicycle at the top of a public hill, Jenny is dumbstruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's as if the \"Perv\" had somehow <i>thought</i> her clothes away or something!  Jenny looks back down the hill, and the Perv is standing right where he was when she past him.  He looks as dumbfounded as she feels, only he's already beginning to head up the hillock toward her, an evil grin on his smarmy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in <i>Hell</i> is going on, today?!?\", Jenny almost screams.  There's no way she's going to go back down the hill towards the Perv, so the only two choices are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, I'll let you stay in the sleeping-bag until we find you some clothes, dammit.\"<br>\r\nJenny's stomach makes the familiar mewling sounds of hunger as she smells the pot of stew the old man has concocted on a tiny range deep inside the latticed network of brush inside the park.<br>\r\nAs she tiptoes out of the bushes and does a dive towards the old hobo's sleeping-bag inside his makeshift tent, Deacon J. yells, \"Holy Jesus, girl!  You done lost ALL your clothes!\"<br>\r\nPerhaps a tad too loudly, as you both suddenly stop, stock-still in your positions, as you hear a Police radio from what sounds like mere yards away.<br>\r\nThen you both hear a voice, smooth like silk, but flat, like something soulless speaking, saying, \"It's here in the park somewhere, Captain.  I can feel it.  I MUST HAVE that coin.  You and your men will help me find it.  Do we <u>understand</u> each other, Captain Richards?\" <br>\r\n\"I'm doing everything in my power to help you in your search, Baron...\", begins the usually hard-assed Captain Eubanks, who sounds positively flustered today, \"these things can take some time, and we don't want to draw undue attention.  If what you're telling me is correct, this coin's been missing for over two centuries --\" <br>\r\n\"SILENCE!\", growls the \"Baron\"-creature(Jenny is certain something sounding that hollow could never have been truly alive), \"That \"coin\" could be the key to TOTAL WORLD DOMINATION, fool!\"<br>\r\nAnd with that, Deacon J. leans over and, grinning, whispers in her ear, perhaps to calm Jenny, \"I wish both the Police and this Baron-thing would go on a week's vacation to Siberia, don't you, hon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as suddenly...nothing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing but steps, retreating back through the forested area to the central area of the park.

She makes a lot of wishes after the first, since the ideas just keep getting better as she goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opener is obvious, or so it seemed to her when she gave it some thought. In the twinkling of an eye (bloodshot or otherwise), the Perv is transformed into just the sort of girl he'd like to drool over. Perv-girl is stunningly cute, exuding pert tween allure (Ugh! Jenny knew he liked them even younger!) and fully deserving of her own sitcom. She's in a halter top, flip-flops, and short short-shorts, everything shaded in cutesy pastels. Jenny has to fight from laughing out loud, because she's not done yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Perv-girl is discovering how jaw-droppingly wonderful she is, Jenny gets to work on the seat. Several full-sized vanity mirrors spring into existence around the back of the park bench and angle over the top in a shroud so that Perv-girl can see herself from multiple angles. Lush red upholstery appears, and the bench makes itself as comfortable as possible. Quite comfortable, with plenty of functional, miniaturized amenities, because Jenny's decided the altered Perv is going to be there for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fridge/freezer/microwave combo and teensy toilet/shower assembly have bookended the park bench, Jenny's having second thoughts. Perv-girl, however, unlike cop-girl, has maintained 'his' original mind, mentally remaining a dirty old man. Maybe Jenny wished for that, just a little? Perv-girl starts trying to worm out of her skimpy wardrobe to get a good luck at herself, so Jenny proceeds without remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whole bunch of fully automated and highly technical devices appear, completely lining the rear of the bench as the mirrors twist and flow to accommodate them. One is a containment field generator, so no one can get to Perv-girl and, more importantly, she can't escape either. Another starts bumping out a light show to accent Perv-girl and churns some bass-rich porn groove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the stuff is to make Perv-girl happy. Really, really happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny stops with the wishes, feeling tapped out and a little ashamed of herself. The first ones to see Perv-girl in action are the elderly couple Jenny had passed on her way up, the first time. They stand in shock as Perv-girl's orgasmatronic park bench proceeds to slick her down with perfumed oil that disintegrates her scanty garb before leaping in with... oodles of other stuff. It's all sucking, slurping, and merciless vibratory assault with a thick frosting of Perv-girl moans and squeals as Jenny turns her back and splits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can always undo it later, if I want,\" Jenny tells herself. Still, she wonders if that was the best way to apply her newfound power.</span></div></div>",

Still, she wants to properly represent her status to future victims, so she engages in another string of wishes. She changes her hair and outfit black (elevating both considerably from 'homeless' chic), sprouts a cute pair of black bat wings fringed with pink fur, and places her beloved bike and street survival backpack safely in an 'elsewhere' condition until she requires them again. And decides on a tiny pair of horns as well, why not? Black, with pink tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... and, also...\" Jenny says, flapping her wings listlessly. She makes one more wish -- more of a directed inquiry, in truth -- just to confirm. Yes! The coin will allow for unlimited wishes.

Even that brief contact convinces her that the Controlling Unknown is rooting for her to become honorable and responsible rather than venal and corrupt as she makes her wishes, which makes Jenny feel a little uncomfortable. The last thing she wants right now is to sweat details like being benevolent and using her power for the greater good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get to all that world peace jazz, eventually,\" Jenny says, talking to the coin in her hand, \"but I'm permitted a little time to mess around now because I've been homeless for a while, so I hope you'll forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus letting herself off the hook for the many indulgences she foresees in her near future, Jenny considers catching up with...</span></div></div>",

Only Jenny knows they're actual girls, each one hideously aware of her condition despite being inanimate. The three are stooped together in a circle, bracing against each other's butts, as they squat to relieve themselves. Jenny knows they're furious enough right now to have strokes, assuming they were still flesh and blood, which is exactly what she'd hoped for. Still, their upturned faces are petrified in expressions of blissful contentment, and no one's aware of the toxically bad vibes radiating from the fountain. When the spigots are turned on, with ceremony, even the adults are prostrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor merely smiles throughout the hysterics, a responsible civic leader, and poses for the photo op.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--   --   --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople eventually collect themselves, and a general picnic gets underway.

She realizes it's been costly to maintain the plumbing with all of the sand smashed into the snobs' crotches, so Jenny wishes for a refinement in the pipes that makes it a non-issue. The kids can pound sand to their hearts' content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther forward, and the playground's the center of urban decay. The fountain's dry, the statuesque girls have been thoroughly tagged (special attention given to their privates, with no end of competing initials, gang signs, whatever), and someone's broken off Alison's head for a trophy. They're just statues now. Any continuing mental life that remained trapped following their transformation has slipped away, finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--   --   --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny reverses in a hurry, wishing herself back to the point where she's still considering how to handle Alison, Lisa, and Trish.

She wishes no one would find this amusing or even odd, and Jenny caps it off by wishing that this strange afternoon will become the thin end of the wedge that leaves Alison and her friends eventually becoming nicer girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still feel like crap,\" Jenny announces, walking past the swingset and remembering a dark possible future.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenny likes the idea she just had, and a sphere pops into existence around the motionless trio. It looks like a giant soap bubble, a touch of oily sheen running through the transparency. Jenny lets the girls talk and move again, all three screaming as they punch and kick uselessly at their new container. No sound's allowed out, which just makes their impotent rage funnier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well go and meet your audience!\" Jenny tells the three, heading down the hill. Alison, Lisa, and Trish look around in terror before they turn back and try to plead their way out of this. They look really sincere as they beg for mercy, but Jenny can't hear a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--   --   --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check it out!\" a boy on the playground yells, pointing at what's rolling over the sand toward the jungle gym. A crowd forms in a hurry, and Jenny tweaks their reactions for the desired effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take much meddling. All the kids squeal with laughter and point at the three naked girls, who've huddled together as they try to hide their nudity and continue to scream their inaudible curses at whoever their eyes fix on. Several kids try to pop Alison, Lisa and Trish free, but their efforts only send an elastic wobble through the sphere. And knock the girls on their asses, since the interior's pretty slick. That becomes the game for a few minutes, the bebubbled repeatedly brought down every time they stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone peers up at Jenny from time to time, trying to figure out what part the demon grrl's playing in all of this. Jenny stands on top of the bubble, wishing a thing into place that finishes off looking like a bellows combined with an industrial wet/dry vacuum wrapped around a helium tank. It welds itself to the outside of the bubble, and Jenny grabs a throttle as it grows out of the device. She knows the prop isn't really necessary, but it's a little embarrassing for her to be presenting the mean girls like this, and it's nice to have some 'business' to fuss with for distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTumbled over again, the three girls nearly froth at their mouths with ire as Jenny pulls the throttle and lightens the atmosphere for them. The three try to keep their feet on the slick concavity they've been floundering on, but can't stop themselves as they get lighter and lighter. Alison and her friends scream silently, balanced on tiptoe, before becoming completely airborne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the situation wasn't humiliating enough before, this new twist makes up for it. It's a lot harder to hide yourself when you're trying to 'swim' in a weightless condition. Alison and crew put on quite a show as they flail, still shouting, rolling around in midair. Their cowlike ungainliness under present circumstance is the cherry on top, and Jenny falls to her knees in laughter along with most of the playground crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny thinks it might be better if all assembled knew <i>why</i> the snoblings were being held up to ridicule like this, and so an image of each girl with their full names and nastiest quotes appears on the bubble's surface. Taking it a step further, Jenny wishes the three bubblees would be cursed with thought bubbles, and the young snobs sprout a progression of puffy white ellipses from their heads with current thoughts scrolling in black text within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((Don't kick <b><i>me</i></b>, you bitch!!)) appears above Alison's head, Lisa having accidentally nudged off of her with a foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((How the <b>@#$%</b> is she doing this??!!)) Lisa wants to know about Jenny and her revenge, oblivious to the fact that Alison is getting pissy with her. Alison shouts the curse a second or so after thinking it, though no one outside can hear. This leads to a shrieking match between the two, their lips flapping in pantomime as their thought bubbles brim over with grawlixes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((This isn't so bad...)) Trish thinks, ignoring everyone else as she enjoys flying around. Jenny shrugs. If Trish can have fun zipping about in midair in front of a crowd, naked, as her friends are having a screaming fit nearby, she probably deserves the thrill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Alison and Lisa can get into a full-on cat fight, Jenny reminds them why they're here to begin with. Twisting the throttle of her weird machine, Jenny gets the vacuum going. Alison is sucked, ass first, to the top of the bubble. Her butt bounces off the interior, and Jenny's waiting to jump up and land firmly on those cheeks. There's only a thin membrane between her pink-and-black Docs and the vulnerable rump of Snobling Prime, and it's no defense at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's an immediate crowd pleaser! Kids and caregivers alike go nuts as the snotty Alison has her ass stomped, applauding as she shoots back to the bottom of the bubble. Lisa's next, just missing a collision with Alison on the way down. Jenny leaves Trish alone, alternating her trampoline revenge between Alison and Lisa. Their thought balloons are boiling with such unmentionable filth that the color of the symbol crawl turns a flashing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of this, Jenny decides...</span></div></div>",

They had an understanding: she didn't make a pest of herself, but he insisted she at least ask for a freebie rather than mope around waiting for him to surrender. It was an OK arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe week previous, though, Kevin had been off the route and a new girl had taken his place. She was probably in college and looked a lot more severe than slacker Kevin, wearing a starched white uniform and standing by the cart at attention. Jenny hadn't been surprised at how things had turned out. She'd asked politely for a 'sample,' got shot down, got some recyclables together, came back from the recycling station with a handful of honest change... and got turned down again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a soup kitchen,\" the hot dog girl had said. Her response had been heartlessly indifferent, almost mechanical, as she'd ignored Jenny's hard-won fundage. And then she'd prepped <i>herself</i> a hot dog and eaten it in one gulp, right in front of Jenny! Without any comment, or a nasty smile, or anything. She just broadcast her coldness expressionlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish she's still running the cart today!\" Jenny says, with a sour grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--   --   --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl is there, either because she actually had the shift or because of Jenny's wish.

Maybe it's the way she stands?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny has a strange impulse and goes with it. She holds her hand out, bouncing the wish coin in it, and offers it to hot dog girl. Her palm has gone sweaty around the token, and a cool breeze seems to rise in warning against the chance she's taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a wishing coin,\" Jenny says. \"Honest. I'll trade it to you for all the hot dogs I can eat.\" Jenny doesn't dump the prohibition against anyone else making wishes on the coin yet, but she's prepared to.

Jenny takes time to point out to Tori that she only has herself to blame, tucking the coin into a starched white pocket. Man, how could Tori stand this rotten outfit? Jenny wishes it to relax a little. It's hard getting used to the new luggage up top, and she doesn't need crisp corners digging into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a look at herself from outside, Jenny's saddened. She wishes her old kid body clean, gives it a haircut, gives it some new clothes, generally spiffs it up. Doing so proves to be at least a little traumatic. Jenny's no stranger to self-pity -- not a luxury, when you're homeless -- but now, effectively outside of herself, she sees how badly she's been used by an unkind world. The grooming's an acknowledgment of that, rather than an attempt to make Tori more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're pretty hungry,\" Jenny tells Tori, and feels a little cheated to realize that, in Tori's body, she's not. She'd been hoping for a hot dog, but now doesn't have any appetite. \"What you need is... all the hot dogs you can eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori scowls, and Jenny makes up her mind. She grabs a roll from the bread box, juggles a hot dog out with tongs, and assembles the finished product with condiments in the prep area. Tori's body has some muscle memory going or something, because Jenny flies through the process like she's been doing it for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go!\" says Jenny, all smiles. Tori accepts the hot dog, unable to disguise a sliver of gratitude, and chows down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--   --   --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna give yourself a gutache, kid,\" says an older man, watching Tori/Jenny's body with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori's drawn a small crowd, patrons who'd come over for a hot dog and stopped to watch the show with the same interest they'd reserve for a traffic accident. Tori's up to her twelfth hot dog, under the influence of Jenny and her wishing coin. Tori the Hot Dog Girl wanted to behave like a cold engine of nastiness, and now she's essentially a frank-scarfing machine. Jenny feels a pang of sympathy, not for Tori, but for her poor old body. A quick wish sets that right; Jenny pulls another body swap, changing her former body to Tori's, at 13, and taking what will eventually be her own nineteen-year-old body for her current shell. And, naturally, wishing that none of the onlookers would find this sudden change unusual. Jenny starts to wish she had a mirror, just to get a glimpse of how she'll turn out, but decides to worry about that later. The important thing right now is packing one hot dog after another into Tori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's much more gratifying to see Kid Tori with mustard, ketchup, and relish all over her face. That messiness is more becoming to a suburban princess with silver spoon scars on her tongue. Tori's down more than a few notches by now, but Jenny thinks they're just getting warmed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori finishes a hot dog, and Jenny makes another one, the girls effective as a two-person assembly line. Occasionally, someone else actually wants to order, and Jenny gives them what they want. Her change belt is starting to get heavy, and Jenny has to wish the excess coins into wrappers in a locked drawer in the cart. She wishes the cart to be replenished as well, once she notices she's running low of certain supplies. Tori's not getting out of this <i>that</i> easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, lay off!\" says a kid, giving Jenny a look of wondering dread. \"You're gonna make her explode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't do <i>that</i>!\" Jenny says, offering a sweet smile as Tori's eyes show white all the way around.</span></div></div>",

At the same time, she'd wished that there'd be no pain or even mild physical discomfort to distract Tori from the awful mental awareness of what was happening to her. It was more fun that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny realizes it's going to take too long to properly inflate Tori with this hand-to-mouth business. Mechanical intervention seems called for, as earlier with the Perv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tori works her way through another hot dog, Jenny wishes for a particular button that will convert the hot dog cart into something suitable. Suddenly, there it is, with an inlaid plastic logo arranged around the top in a semicircle: The Frank-Infurnel Radical Expander!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revenge is a dish best served <i>hot</i>!\" Jenny shouts, hitting the button and clapping her hands. Tori looks like she's going to come unhinged, since the current hot dog torture is more than enough for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jenny hits the F-IRE button, there's a lot of clanking from inside the cart. Sterile, metallic attachments began emerging, along with a substantial appendage that leans up and over, reminiscent of a scorpion's tail; it's mostly a length of clear plastic tubing, accordioned for flexibility, terminating in a faceplate with goofy silver teeth around either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faceplate springs forward and adheres to Tori's screeching mug, latching into place just below her nose and anchoring under her chin. The goofy teeth click tight along her jaw, going into action with a whirr as she finishes her last \"polite\" hot dog; these are apparently going to force her to <i>keep</i> chewing, but the visual effect makes the lower half of Tori's face resemble a giant pair of choppers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe less sensational devices get to work and, soon, a dozen freshly-made hot dogs are vacuumed up by the Frank-Infernul's delivery nozzle and conveyed to Tori's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd shrieks with exactly the revolted fascination that Jenny's feeling, exposed to a real-life example of cartoon horror. Tori screams deep in her throat before the Frank-Infernul's supporting dentition whirrs back to life and forces her to start chewing at low mach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's quick to shoot a string of wishes at her coin, wanting this to go just right. No suffocation, no rescue, no possible escape, etc. Everyone else seems to think the show is Tori's gnashing teeth, but Jenny takes a good look at her and realizes the only thing worth watching is her eyes. She looks as though she's staring into hot dog hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori braces a foot against the cart, her expensive Nike sliding off with a squeak as she drops to her knees and thrashes her head around in a futile effort to get free. The Frank-Infurnel muzzle tracks right along with her, keeping up the stream of hot dogs. Soon, understandably, Tori's stomach starts to distend, getting rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Frank-Infurnel extends a padded rest, red as a devil's tongue, to support the expanding Tori, her stomach beyond the size of a beach ball and only getting bigger. Her clothing is either under the effects of the machine or else made of some extremely forgiving spandex blend, as it swells without threat of ripping. Tori's blouse rucks up just enough to show her belly button, which is more a shadow of a pucker than a proper navel by now. The metal jaws keep whirring, the rendering hose keeps up with a steady Suck!/Schloof! of hot dog transport, and the tiny utensils of the frankfurter arrangement engine keep clinking and tinkling away, making more hot dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's more privately surprised than anyone else watching this -- her older body is all squirms and flutters as Tori inflates, some element in the display sort of a turn-on. Ooh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori angles her head up and presses her hands to her expanding tummy, eyes round with alarm. If this keeps up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, there's a low, purring rip.

The faceplate and attachments subside back into the hotdog cart. The sight of the plump Tori causes the crowd to let out a dissatisfied groan slowly scattering ignoring the sight of Tori in her underwear which is barley noticeable. A few people watch Tori and the slight changes that seem to be happening. Tori can feel her arms being pulled against her ribs, her wrist are pushed against her swollen hips. Tori feels her legs merging and her eyes go wide at feeling her belly moving down over her midsection. There is an oily feeling across Tori's face as her eyes begin to sting. She feels the fat roll over her hips griping to her legs causing her lower calf to thicken. Tori's watches as the haze over her eyes becomes thicker. Feeling her body being squeezed and getting tighter becomes relaxing. The world turn on its side suddenly as weightless takes over her.<br>\r\nThe sight of a pool comes into view before Tori is submerged in the water.

She then has to listen to the new girl describe how horrible life's been as a homeless teen, and Jenny has to add, several more times, that that's <i>her</i> life, not the new girl's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we just had the same stuff happen?\" asks the other girl. \"It's a big city, and we're kinda little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, upset by hearing someone else talk about the exact conditions of her life for the past several months, gets mad. Not mad at the other girl for her probably counterfeit biography, but mad at the situation she's been in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I just wish that...\" Jenny begins.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's been a weird day, so Jenny doesn't react with much surprise when her fellow ragamuffin begins reaching for the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck's happening?!\" the supposedly homeless girl asks, finding she's eight feet tall and getting bigger. She doesn't sound like she minds her absurd growth. By the look on her face, Jenny thinks she might be enjoying it more than is appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, don't let anyone <i>see</i> you!\" Jenny whispers, concerned that a naked girl is going to have even more trouble hiding her nakedness when she's 20 feet tall. Or taller. Jenny steps aside from the increasingly giant girl's feet, noticing the leopard-print spandex bike shorts and bandeau top that appear on the young giantess. That makes sense, since giantesses should have skimpy clothes, and leopard spots look good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at this point that Jenny 'Gets It,' and cop-girl breaks the treeline. Still growing, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" someone asks from not very far away. A couple of other cops have arrived, looking around for something, and found out there's a giant girl growing out of the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, meanwhile, is considering things very rapidly. For a test, she wishes a top and some bike shorts up for herself, and is not completely amazed when they appear on her. She has wishing powers, somehow, but doesn't have time to consider it further as the cops are just outside the bushes she's hiding in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kid, get down here!\" one of the cops calls up, sounding more puzzled than alarmed. Cop-girl carefully steps out of the scrub and kneels down with a smirk. Watching this operation is pretty amazing, since cop-girl's topped out at the height of a five-story building. Looks like she's stopped growing, too, fortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't arrest me just for being tall!\" cop-girl scolds her fellow cops. Jenny is about to wish things back, but thinks twice. This could be amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I can't!\" one of the cops says, chuckling along with the other one. \"Just stay right there, or you'll get tased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny realizes that things could get dicey, so wishes that no one, including cop-girl, can get killed or hurt by... whatever she intends to do. Rampage, maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tase away, <i>fool</i>!\" says cop-girl, standing back up with a sniff. \"I'm out for social justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cops are out for civil obedience, even from giant teen girls who used to be brothers in blue, and one whacks cop-girl's left pinkie toe with his baton. Cop-girl laughs it off and again declares the cop a fool, practicing her villainous voice. The cops don't care for it and make good on the tase threat, which gets a good scream of \"<b>Puny</b> <b><i>FOOLS</i></b>!\" from the giantess. And also brings a lot more cops, along with their captain and another guy giving orders in a flat, soulless voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny creeps along quietly until she realizes she can just wish herself indetectable, and follows the cops and the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even try it!\" says the cop who whacked cop-girl with the baton. She's trying to lift one of the police cruisers and having a tough time. Just because she's fifty feet tall doesn't necessarily mean she's ten times stronger than she was at five feet. Jenny grants superhuman strength to cop-girl, at which point she's able to handle the car easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's Spicer's coffin!\" one of the cops shouts, apparently upset at his buddy's car about to be smashed. \"Where the hell is he, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny hears that detail and mentally dubs cop-girl \"Ms. Spicer,\" since cop-girl is an awkward way to think of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Spicer turns out to be too polite. She picks the cruiser up, tries to roar, and immediately puts it back down, gently. A few cops try shooting her in the toes, which is as effective as the previous batoning and tasing job. The shots put the Captain in a screaming fit as he tries to restore order, and the tall, skinny, evil-looking non-cop guy begins demanding Ms. Spicer be stripped for the sake of finding \"it.\"</span></div></div>",

Ms. Spicer is standing quiescent, as though waiting for orders or something. She's too well-behaved to be a giantess. Jenny can't decide whether that's because of her past life as a cop or her false memories based on Jenny's own experiences. Jenny's just introspective enough, even now (in her leopard-print skimpies and undetectable condition), to realize that there are all sorts of interesting philosophical questions being raised by this scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the cops has figured this out as well, and starts running around like a loon under Ms. Spicer's feet, doing chicken squawks and war whoops and stuff. Jenny bursts out laughing, and wishes to know what exactly <i>his</i> trip is. She only winds up laughing harder once she knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a crush fan!\" she shouts, wishing everyone could hear. The weird non-cop immediately tries to track her, but Jenny walks away from her shouting spot, still in her indiscernible condition. He's the only one here who looks like trouble, so Jenny has him demand to be arrested and has a cop stick him in the back of a patrol car. A few cops start calling out after the phantom girl's voice, demanding to know who's there, but Jenny doesn't have anything to add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sampson!\" shouts the captain, giving up on his radio. \"Get the... Leonetti, get control of your partner! He's creating a damned incident, here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny can see Ms. Spicer has no intention of smooshing Officer Sampson underfoot, no matter how much he taunts her... so Jenny wishes she'd get fed up and give it a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up!\" says Ms. Spicer, bringing one of her feet down on the blithering cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Jenny specifically wished that no one would get hurt with Ms. Spicer's gigantic antics, Sampson winds up stomped into the ground. Only his head is sticking out of the grass. He's still blithering, but looks ecstatic at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" says Ms. Spicer, surprised and thinking this must be more of the same weirdness that both made her gigantic and supplied her with her current outfit. \"That wasn't so bad. Heck, why not?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cops open up on Ms. Spicer's feet in earnest this time, grabbing everything that kills to blaze away at her stomping soles, but she just laughs the laugh of the invulnerable and grinds one gendarme after another under her heels. It looks like a spirited zapateado, punctuated by the report of 125 grain JHP and the occasional bark of double-ought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's on her knees, laughing so hard that she has to fight for breath. A dozen-plus cops, reduced now to shouting heads, are hurling insults and pleas at Ms. Spicer, who's relaxing from her exertions by stroking Sampson's head with her right big toe. He may be the only cop enjoying himself, but the beatific grin he's beaming makes up for the rest of the squad's fury and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrested non-cop is still looking everywhere except at the interesting stuff, but Jenny's forgotten about him.

Maybe they'll cheer up a little if they see her get the same treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny wishes herself back into a state of perceptibility, grinning as she walks past several yelling cop heads. Since holding the wish coin in her hand seems like a bad idea for this next adventure, Jenny wishes it into a necklace. The sheen of the coin, now around her neck, catches the non-cop's eye, and he begins to shout from inside the patrol car. No one is paying any attention to him, understandably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Miss Spicer!\" Jenny calls, the giantess noticing her. \"I think I deserve my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spicer?!\" says one of the cops. The one who'd been worried about the cruiser, earlier. Jenny stoops to address him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's him!\" Jenny tells the cop, pointing at the giant girl. \"I wished him into a girl, and then into one of these cool outfits, and then into a giantess. <i>And</i> I wished no one would get hurt as she tromps around, so that's why you all weren't instantly squished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid's psychotic,\" says a nearby cop, but Jenny just smirks it off. \"It's the giant girl's little sister or something, and having a giant sister like that drove her nuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ms. Spicer has stopped with Sampson's head and is reluctant to stomp Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to stomp <i>you</i>!\" she protests. \"I only like stepping on cops who try shooting me. You hooked me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trigger-happy cops all roar with outrage, the Captain loudest among them -- about how this has gone too far, that the girls are stopping them from fighting <b>real</b> crime, and so on. Jenny decides for a much larger wish than she's attempted so far, and simply ceases all crime in the city so long as the Captain and his detachment remain buried. Sure, she could end crime indefinitely, everywhere... but then what would the cops and criminals do? Jenny realizes she's not up for heavy abstract stuff like that, yet. It's more fun to prank around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I've stopped all crime in the city for as long as you guys are buried -- how long are you willing to make the sacrifice, I wonder? I'll also be fair and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of the wish is speedier than her ability to relate it to the cops. Jenny is under a shadow before she knows it, something big rushing at her from overhead. There's a sense of warmth, gentle pressure, and turf yielding under her feet like styrofoam. She's then on the same level as Officer \"Don't Smash Spicer's Car!\", who frowns at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny squirms around, up to her neck in cool, packed earth, and unable to stop grinning. That was weird!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, you're stomped!\" Ms. Spicer announces. \"Should I go trash downtown, like we talked about, to demand action for the city's homeless? Or should I throw some cop cars at city hall from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a scalp massage with...\" Jenny begins, breaking off in laughter as Ms. Spicer shrugs and prepares to oblige. \"I'm kidding, I'm kidding! Go back to your number one fan over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change him back!\" says Spicer's pal. \"He's a cop, not a giant girl. He's got family!\" Spicer's pal isn't having as hard a time believing Jenny has a wishing coin... and with everything going on, Jenny's surprised any of the cops doubt her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry!\" Jenny assures him. \"I'll put everything back the way it was. In fact, when I'm through, none of this will ever even have happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring all of this 'stomping giantess' stuff, other people from the park are wandering over to try and figure out what Ms. Spicer <i>is</i> exactly.

Or him, depending on how you look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know you're hungry, kid,\" says cop-girl, and the choice of words makes Jenny grin. \"And, whether or not you believe it, I don't think the homeless are a burden or something to politely ignore. My first beat was off of Market and Grand, and the city's only shelter used to be in the old YMCA before they tore it down back in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stuff it!\" says Jenny, wishing cop-girl back to a mirror of her own girlish mind. She doesn't want to hear some cop going on about how socially conscious he is, fitting himself for a halo while reclining in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, put me down!\" complains cop-girl, looking like she's under some mental strain. Her memory, again superceded by Jenny's own, leaves her remembering the overwhelming pleasure of shrinking and returning to normal size... and what it feels like to have a six-inch girl in one's nethers, what it feels like to have a six-inch girl being pleasured on the end of one's tongue, and what it feels like to have a six-inch girl sliding down one's esophagus. Except she knows she was <i>also</i> the six-inch girl involved in all of this, and it's scrambling her brains trying to figure out her own personal narrative in the past several minutes. Something about being a cop? Huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be happy to put you down!\" Jenny tells her, opening her mouth wide and moving cop-girl toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCop-girl lets out a thin, piercing shriek, and Jenny has a fit of giggles over her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're all, 'Eeeeeeeek!'\" Jenny teases cop-girl, who's steamed by this treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I could see how <i>you</i> handle it!\" says cop-girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Jenny hasn't specifically wished otherwise, and since the wishing coin's still in her backpack (where it hopped as a substitute pocket after the Perv got her naked), cop-girl gets her wish.</span></div></div>",
