She hadn't  heard anything about this. She wasn't sure if his program was real. If not, the boy would be without a home for awhile.<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Z asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, right! I forgot you were coming!\" Cass couldn't leave him on his own. \"Come up, we'll get you settled\" and with that, Z was now staying with the Hamada family. Aunt Cass explained she \"accepted\" to be part of the program to Hiro and Tadashi before they went to their room. They didn't know she didn't actually accept anything.<br>\r\n\"Hey there Z, I'm Tadashi and this is my little brother Hiro\"<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you two!\" After they all had dinner and went to bed, Z was ecstatic!

After doing so, Z said good morning beaming with happiness.<br>\r\n\"Why were you sleeping on me?\" Hiro asked. Z then looked disappointed.<br>\r\n\"Well, I have a hard time falling asleep by myself. And I had a nightmare. I also felt safe with you since I have an older brother that's about your size so it reminded me of him.\" Hiro felt bad. He thought Tadashi must have understood the situation which is why he didn't help.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, I used to sleep with Tadashi when I was your age too, but I quickly grew out of it. You can sleep with me until you feel comfortable sleeping by yourself.\" Hiro brushed Z's hair, got dressed then left the room. Z was happy again. Hiro was okay with his hugging. Too bad the story was just a lie for him to agree. Downstairs, Hiro called to see if Z was done getting dressed, surprised by Z jumping on him for a hug.<br>\r\n\"Good morning!\" He said. Both Tadashi and aunt Cass we're glad that he taken a liking to Hiro. After eating breakfast Z asked a question.<br>\r\n\"Hey Tadashi, how tall are you?\"<br>\r\n\"About average adult height.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey Hiro, do you think you'll get that tall?\" Hiro thought about it. He than had a grin thinking how great it would be if he was Taller than Tadashi.<br>\r\n\"You got a long way to go bro\" Tadashi said.<br>\r\n\"Well let's see how long.\" Hiro then got a pencil and he and Tadashi went to the wall they used to check their heights. After doing Tadashi, Cass then did Hiro. No one else knew, but Z already grew Hiro a bit. Z used to come about to Hiro's nose when they first, but now he was under his chin. He was as tall as Cass.<br>\r\n\"My little boy is growing up!\" Cass said while hugging Hiro.<br>\r\n\"Aunt Cass!\" Hiro said annoyed<br>\r\n\"It has been awhile since we measured our heights\" Said Tadashi.<br>\r\n\"Hey Hiro, can you show me your bots?\" Z asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" The two then went upstairs to play while Cass opened the Lucky Cat and Tadashi went out with the gang.<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

Z walked up to Hiro.<br>\r\n\"Your on..\" Z's voice slowed down and he fell. Hiro reacted quickly to catch him, but not enough to prevent himself from falling with Z. Z was asleep on top of Hiro and wouldn't budge, just like this mourning. Seeing as he couldn't move Z, and Cass already checked on them before turning in early and Tadashi probably would get back late. Hiro decided to sleep too seeing as Z probably wouldn't get up till morning. After drifting to sleep, Z woke up. \"Woah\" he thought. \"I must not have had much sleep last night\". Z doesn't go to sleep this early. He looked down to see who he was on. \"Neither did Hiro\". Z decided to use this to his advantage. He wrapped his arms around Hiro which caused him to grow. Z did it slowly because he wanted to see it happen. Sill sleeping, Hiro grew taller than Tadashi if he were here he'd be at Hiro's chest. Z also made Hiro's muscle grow but not by much, just enough to cause his clothes to feel tight. And they were tighter than he wanted, he realized that he forgot to grow Hiro's clothes with him. It look like Hiro was wearing a child's shirt. Z grew the clothes to what he originally wanted and rested on the \"bigger Hiro\". He put Hiro blanket on them so when Tadashi got back he wouldn't notice the growth spurt. Tadashi fell asleep without needing to change. Z then fell back asleep happily snuggling against Hiro. In the mourning, it was Saturday and aunt Cass left a note stating she would be out of town regarding business. It was now noon before __ woke up.</span></div></div>",

I can make your growth seem normal to everyone else.\" He said as he shrunk Hiro again to his normal height.<br>\r\n\"Then why shrink me back?\" Hiro asked, missing the feeling of being huge.<br>\r\n\"You'll see. Hey, Tadashi?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n\"Can you stand next to Hiro? I want to take a picture .\" Tadashi decided agreed.<br>\r\n\"Not back to back, side to side.\" Hiro and Tadashi had their arms crossed while back to back then stood side to side with their arms around each other's neck. However, Tadashi had to slouch a bit to have his arm around Hiro. Z adjusted his camera so they were both in the shot.<br>\r\n\"Hold on a sec.\" Z than \"adjusted\" Hiro's position.

Ecstatic, Hiro slouched like Tadashi did before.<br>\r\n\"You know what?\" Z stepped in from of Hiro again. \"Why don't you just hold Tadashi?\" Upon hearing this, Hiro grew to as tall as he was before shrinking, now with the muscles of a bodybuilder. Tadashi felt like holding a small child to Hiro. Tadashi's arm was still around Hiro's neck, but now Hiro held Tadashi in his arm.<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Z said as took the shot. He then showed the brothers the picture on his phone. Hiro thought it looked like a huge bodybuilder holding a child, which is what he felt like.<br>\r\n\"Can you pick me up Hiro?\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure he can. Put me down.\" Hiro put Tadashi down and picked Z up. Tadashi then went to get breakfast. Z gave Hiro a big hug.

You missed breakfast.\" So did Tadashi but that was besides the point. Looking down at him, Tadashi saw Hiro raise his head, stretched and yawned. Tadashi then saw Hiro rise up, and up. He was looking UP at Hiro.<br>\r\n\"Hiro...?\" Tadasi said in awe. After he wiped his no longer groggy eyes, he looked down at Tadashi in awe. \"What happened to you?\" Tadashi said with both surprise and concern.<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" Hiro stuttered. \"But it's great!\"<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Tadashi said. Hiro sounded ecstatic about what has happened to him.<br>\r\n\"You guys are being loud\" Z whined.<br>\r\n\"Z, look what happen to me!\" Z got up and looked at Hiro.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, cool!\"<br>\r\n\"I know right?\"<br>\r\n\"Whoa, hold it. Hang on a minute.\" Tadashi sounded serious. \"First of all, we don't know how this happened, and second we don't know how to reverse it.\" He was worried for his younger brother, they could see that. But Hiro actually really likes what happened.<br>\r\n\"Well, until we find out what caused this, can't we treat it like its normal rather then life-threatening?\" asked Z. Tadashi realized he may cause the situation to be worse.<br>\r\n\"I suppose, but Monday we're going to the institute to run tests. It's currently going under renovations till then.\" Hiro then slightly bent down to hug his brother,<br>\r\n\"It's ok, I'M ok. Ok?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's get lunch.\" Z watch Hiro and Tadashi go downstairs. He was esthetic! And amazed how calm Tadashi was. Z could wait to see what would happen to Hiro next.

The gang was actually headed to the amusement park, something Hiro had been wanting to do. Upon reaching the park, Z was introduced to the rest of the gang. Fred, Hiro, and Z all requested to go on the rollercoaster. It was the newest ride and Hiro had been looking forward for it. After waiting in line for two hours, they were almost to the front. Z then noticed the height requirement. Hiro, who was about the same height of Gogo dispite no one else noticing, wouldn't be able to ride. Tadashi's height was the minimum requirement for the ride which means he and Gogo wouldn't be able to go on either. The way they were in the line, Z would go after Hiro who would go after Fred. Z quickly warped his arm around Hiro to grow him so he could ride. Z asked about his bots so he wouldn't notice anything.<br>\r\n\"How meny?\" The employee asked Tadashi.<br>\r\n\"Seven\" he replied.<br>\r\n\"Sorry miss, but your too short to ride. I ask if you could go to the other side to wait for your friends.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Gogo said unenthusiastic, as if she didn't care. Tadashi, Honey, Wasabi, and Fred proceeded to abroad the ride.<br>\r\n\"Sorry sir, but I'm afraid you have to wait with your friend.\" The employee said to Z.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Z.\" Hiro felt bad.<br>\r\n\"That's ok. I've never been to this amusement park before. There's tons of rides I can go on!\" Z said with a smile before going to Gogo.<br>\r\n\"Where's Hiro\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"On the ride.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, when did he get taller than me?\" Z just shrugged.

His train of thought was interrupted by a bump to his foot. It was Hiro\u2019s foot. It was reaching him from the opposite end of the table.

He wasn\u2019t given a response. Z just smiled as he seemed to rise until he was eye to eye with Neptune. Neptune was shock as that could only mean...<br>\r\n\u201cThis is awesome!!\u201d Neptune heard Sun say as he looked up. Sun turned around looking down at Neptune with his hand on his hips.

See you later!\" Z closed the front door behind him a proceeded to Tai's room.<br>\r\n\"What are you looking for?\" Davis asked.<br>\r\n\"Here it is!\" Z said while holding one of Tai's school uniforms. \"Put this on!\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Z gave Davis a look.

It was a little baggy on him.<br>\r\n\"Remember what I said I can do?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't see how that applies.\"<br>\r\n\"Just stand there.\" Davis proceeded to stand next to a height chart Tai and Kari had. Z then held Davis' hand.<br>\r\n\"THIS is how it applies.\" Z them proceeded to grow Davis. His arms and legs grew out of the sleeves of the uniform. Davis' view changed as he looked down at Z. Davis was now as tall as Tai, according to the chart, and the uniform fit perfectly.<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Cool!\" Davis then examined his new height, as well of how he looked in the uniform. He thought he looked pretty good in the uniform \"too bad\" he has to wait a few years before he gets one for himself. Z grabbed Davis' hand again. The uniform started to grow tighter as Davis grew bigger.<br>\r\n\"Wait Z!\" Z stopped as Davis grow taller than Tai's mom. Davis was a little uncomfortable. One: The uniform was kind of tight, and two: he was now getting used to his new height.<br>\r\n\"Whoops, I geuss I over did it! Your regular clothes should still fit.\" Davis then went to change again. Z really had wanted to see Davis grow in Tai's uniform. But then...</span></div></div>",

He was distracted looking way down at TK, Davis and Z's faces that he didn't saw a ceiling light, and predictably his head was hit by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" He complained as he sat down on a sofa. \"Man, I guess I'll have to get used to this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe furniture wasn't prepared for someone of his height and his long legs, he looked like an adult sitting on a chair for children.<br>\r\nHe was so tall that even as he was sitting he was taller than Takeru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had plenty of time to get used to it. You were already taller than adults even before our first trip to the digital world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reality had changed again. Tai couldn't have grown so big in less than a year, so the history had been readjusted to making him naturally tall since he had been born. And with his exceptional physique he had become a extraordinary soccer player and pretty famous in Japan. He was still too young to be professional player, but lots of teams were already trying to persuade him to join them as soon as he were 18, promising high salaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always looking up at you (metaphorically and literally)\" Takeru admited \"I wish I could become as tall as you. Your build is great for soccer, but someone as big as you will win hands down in basketball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZ remembered TK was the only one who didn't know about his power. He decided keep it that way. His reactions to his own and other's growth were cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Z, don't you think it is time to make me taller?\" Demanded Davis, dissatisfied with his quite impressive 6'10 height \"I want to be the biggest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis was a little too self-centred, even more after the transformation. Z decided it was better for everyone to focus on someone else. And he knew a kinder and shorter kid who could benefit of his powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTK body shook, and started to grow as fast he almost lost balance and fell. As his body inched upwards, his shoulders widened and his pretty slim physique gained the muscle mass of a gymnastic. Z forgot making his clothes grow with him, so they couldn't withstand the process and ripped everywhere. His feet doubled his length in seconds, bursting his shoes and kept growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached Tai's height, hitting his head violently against the ceiling, and kept growing a little more, until his shoulders were as tall as the room, forcing him to duck his body to fit in there. Zcalculated he was a little over 10 feet, so he was like 4 and a half heads taller than Davis, who wasn't happy about being surpassed by him as well. Tai was less competitive, and he felt happy for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZ magically fixed his clothes, making them to fit TK's new titanic form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what you were saying about basketball and your height?\"<br>\r\n\"I can't be happier with my body. I can slam dunk even without jumping and no one can steal the ball from me. Everyday I receive letters from the best basketball teams asking me to join them when I graduate. Probably I'll be playing in the NBA that very same year\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTK sat next to Tai in the same sofa and it collapsed under the combined weight of both teens. They laughted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about your brother?\" Z asked<br>\r\n\"Well, some time ago he didn't bear it well. When I was a little kid, the people though I was the bigger brother and that irritated him much. After our first trip to the digital world, I got taller than dad and they started to think I was his father... But currently he had accepted it (Almost).\"<br>\r\n\"What about your dailylife?\"<br>\r\n\"It's hard to be so tall. I can't cross any door without ducking a lot. Finding fitting clothes is almost impossible. But it's a small price to pay\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know the feeling\" Taichi added, almost as tall as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis went green with envy. He was conscious the story had changed and he remembered loosing against Tai multiple times in soccer and against Takeru that time he tried basketball to impress Kairi. He had lost his supremacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to Z and demanded to grow him again or shrink them.</span></div></div>",

Before he could realize what happened, he hit his head on the ceiling again. Davis had grown to around 13 feet or so. He was taller than Tai and TK, and he was as tall as Tai standing while sitting.

He also didn't realize he grew Tai to about 12 feet in response as well. Davis noticed this and picked Z up.<br>\r\n\"My turn!\" Davis said. In more or less the same position he was with Tai, Z looked more like a baby in Davis' arms.

Gatchmon was standing next to him, waving his clawed hands in the air to for Haru's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...wonder what has got Haru so dazzled?\" Z repaxed his body on a fence as he watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping up, gripping the top tight with his clawed gloves, positioning his tiny posterior on the fence. The leonine appmon shrugged. \"Beats me mate. Probably whatever is going on over there.\" Pointing a clawed thumb in the direction of the sports field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZ and Leomon looked across the field to see what it was. Immediately clicking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soccer(football) game was commencing. On the field was the taller, slightly toned, red haired Yuujin Ozora playing soccer. The green eyed redhead was working hard to kick the ball to his teammates and score, trampling their opponents with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Z and Leomon turned to look at Haru, who was tryingnto flex and imitate the fellow players with Yujin as a member playing with the person closest to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopeless\" the little lion declared with a toothy smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all! After all thanks to you I discovered my unique power!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Meetings====<br>\r\nThe two had met the Applidrivers and their partners, the two had gotten in trouble with a Malwaremon who causes unbelievable growth but distorts the Appmon into a malevolence mass of evil scribbles. During their scuffle the Applidrivers helped him by saving Leomon, but not before the evil Appmon struck Zs right arm before the damage form the battles forced Malwaremon into chip form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarked by it after the battle, the following afternoon as Z left school he moved to touch a puppy shiba inu that ran towards him. Touching the puppy with both hands as he ruffled its beautiful fur, his scar began to glow. In a flash the puppy doubled in size! He looked oddly muscular for a pup! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! I wonder what else I can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he tested it. His alarm which double in size and louder in the morning. A watch so bug he had to pick it up with two hands, and even make his food larger to enjoy more of it. It all got bulkier it grew.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====Now in the present====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to no longer watch, Z moved from the fence. Leomon happily jumping down to join in as Z tapped Haru's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Haru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah!\" Haru jumped over in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Eeeeeeh....\" Gatchmon was annoyed that of everything he had tried, including squeezing his cheeks while we went over Z's power, a single tap on the back broke Haru's concentration.<br>\r\nFaceflushung red, the green haired blue eyed boy look embarrassed. \"Did you see me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup\"<br>\r\n\"For awhile actually\" Leomon chuckled.<br>\r\n\"O-oh dear. Please don't tell Yujin!\"<br>\r\n\"That you want to play soccer with him?\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haru's been doing this a lot lately.\" Gatchmon interjected, sighing from this recurring situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of laughing like Haru would expect anyone to, Z smiled and grabbed his shoulder with his right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I know exactly how to let you play with Yujin.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep. Now do you want it? Really? Truly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru only paused for a moment before nodding, both appmons looking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I'll make your dream come true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash Haru had</span></div></div>",

He just loves watching all  the girls' reactions to their usual antics.<br>\r\n\"So you guys need help?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we've overbooked so as surprising as it may be we need a third person.\" Hikaru explained.<br>\r\n\"You don't mind, do you Z?\" Asked Kaoru.<br>\r\n\"Not at all! I love your antics!\" Something then sparked in Hikaru.<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think we should do then?\" Z had a confused expression on his face. \"About our antics. We've been doing the same things for months. I think we need something new.\"<br>\r\n\"I agree. As creative as we are, we don't always get a good idea for them.\" Kaoru added.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you argue who's bigger?\" Now it was the twins who had blank expressions. \"Your twins. You look alike. Maybe work out more and use that?\" The twins contemplated over it. The nex day Z showed up at the host club early to help them. The twins bought a lot of work out equipment to get started. The twins proceeded to take off their uniform tops and worked out shirtless. They had been only working out for a few hours.<br>\r\n\"This is too hard.\" Hikaru complained.<br>\r\n\"No pain, no gain Hikaru.\" Said Z. They then stopped for the day and started their host duties. Z showed up early the next day to find the twins exhausted. \"How long have you guys been here?\"<br>\r\n\"An hour.\" Said Kaoru. Z then helped them up. After washing off the sweat, they noticed their clothes slightly tugged on their bodies. Brushing it off, the continued to the host club. The next day, Z had to convince them to return again.<br>\r\n\"You'll never guess! Tamaki, Kyoya and Haruhi all noticed something different about you two!\"<br>\r\n\"If that's true, then hiw come they didn't tell us themselves.\" Hikaru was skeptical.<br>\r\n\"They asked me since they didn't want to get involved if you two were your antics.\"<br>\r\n\"So this working out is actually working?\" Asked Kaoru.<br>\r\n\"Yep! If you continue to bulk up, your guests will notice too!\" The change was that Z grew the twins to equal height to Tamaki yesterday, which was why their clothes were starting to tug. Z decided to help more than <i>just</i> supervise. After the twins were done today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Their uniforms were tighter. They had to unbutton their shirts a bit for relief as they put of a lot more muscle.<br>\r\n2) Their now as tall as Mori, gained a small noticeable amount of muscle. Tamaki is the only other person who questions the sudden change. Z, Tamaki, and the twins are the only ones who notice.</span></div></div>",

Also, the effects were permanent until Z undid it. Z demonstrated his quirk on the principle as he was part of the favor and grew him a foot and returned to normal height. Although it didn't work on females, Z was accepted into the Hero course after the staff saw the usefulness of the quirk.

Z stood up.<br>\r\n\"I've had it with you. In contrast to these guys, you've been demanding I grow you without any concern for what I feel. Why would the first person I grow be you? If fact, why would I use my quirk to help you when you see me as nothing as a stepping stone?\" Z had swung his arm into Deku by accident, causing Deku to receive a small burst of Z's quirk before falling over. \"Oops, sorry Deku.\"<br>\r\n\"Midoria are you okay\" asked Kirishima. Deku stood up holding his his shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was more surprising if anything. Everyone saw that Deku had grown from Z's quirk. Originally at 166cm, he was now as tall as Shoji at 187cm.<br>\r\n\"That is so cool!\" Yelled Kaminari.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Deku. I can shrink you back after lunch.\" Deku just smiled and laughed nervously and followed Z to lunch. This didn't sit well with Bakugo. Being at 172cm, Bakugo was 12cm taller than Deku. Now Deku was 15cm taller than him. A bigger difference in height than normal.</span></div></div>",

But in a positive way.\" The two continued to eat their lunch when Kaminari and Kirishima showed up with sparkles in their eyes.<br>\r\n\"Fine. Hold still.\" Z stood up and placed an arm on their shoulders and grew them to 187cm, same as Deku now.<br>\r\n\"Man this is so cool!\" Yelled Kirishima.<br>\r\n\"I know right?\" Said Kaminari. The two join Z and Deku for the remainder for lunch. Uraraka Then showed up to remind us that we had to go out to the field to practice our quirks. When we were about to leave, Uraraka tugged my arm.<br>\r\n\"Deku seems so tall now.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I did grow him to 6'2.\" She knew that, but she found it strange that she only came up to Deku's shoulders. Out on the field, Deku, Kirishima, and Kaminari were surprised to find their superhero costumes fit. Z must have grew them. Come to think of it, their school uniforms had grown with them, so it shouldn't have been that strange. Both Aoyama and Mineta were upset that Z still didn't want to grow  them, Bakugo was especially. Jiro was weirded out with Kaminari's new height getting a similar feeling that Uraraka had with Deku. After about half an hour, Deku asked why Z wasn't practicing.<br>\r\n\"Did you forget what my quirk was.\" Z smirked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" Deku sheepishly smiled while scratching the back of his head.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know!\"</span></div></div>",

He wants to do something else he had yet to do. Z gave him the idea of elevator shoes. Joe's 5'8 1/2, and has been insecure about his height, and most of his guy friends, Casper, Alfie, Jim, they are at least 6'. Z's idea was that Joe would use hidden elevator shoes, as well as the ones you put inside the shoes and see if anyone can tell the difference. They went out to buy them. They got a 6in shoes which would make him 6'2, same as Casper. 1in taller than Alfie and 1in shorter than Jim. After getting home Joe put them on and was loving the height increase. He then put them away in his closet as Casper was sleeping over to carpool to a party tomorrow. All three of them went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen does Z grow Joe?<br>\r\nWhile he sleeps?

Z got dressed and went to see Joe. He saw Joe was dressed as well. And his shoes on too.<br>\r\n\"Notice anything different?\" Joe winked as he asked.
