She shivered as the cold wind blew against her. She had heard about some strange things happening at the old, abandoned carnival down by the docks. She had planned to meet the others, but she was the only one who showed up. \"Nice, guys, leave me with all the work...\" It was pitch black. The sleuth was surrounded by run down carnival games and ripped tents. She shone the flash light in front of her, every now and then thinking she saw something move out of the corner of her eye. \"Is anybody heeere?\" she called out, when suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFLASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe lights of the carnival turned on, bright lights of every color flashing  in her glasses. \"Jinkies!\" she tensed up, looking around in alarm.

She was right! There was a show going on inside! There were lights shining all around inside, music playing, and right in the middle was a curvaceous female ring leader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come one, come all! Come see the Marvelous Magnolia's Transformation Carnival!\" the raven haired ring leader called out, \"Once you see it, you'll NEVER be the same!\" Velma made sure to make slow, quiet movements, slowly slipping into the tent. \"Now, I'm going to need some help down here in the ring! Any volunteers?\" Magnolia called out. Velma had only made it a few steps before the spotlight shone on her. She stopped dead in her tracks. \"YOU there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who, Me?\" Velma said, eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! Come on down!\" The ring leader pointed her finger at Velma. Before Velma could react, she was levitating in the air, being pulled down center stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-jinkies! Put me down!\" the sleuth tried to resist, but couldn't move. Every muscle was frozen in place until she came to the ground, right next to Magnolia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's give a big round of applause for VELMA DINKLEY!\" The sounds of thunderous applause filled the tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know my na-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY, VELMA,\" Magnolia interrupted, \"You're going to be a star!

I-I have a terrible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FEAR?\" the ring leader said, \"Oh but that's why you're here, Velma! We're going to conquer that fear!\" She pulled out a big, rubbery red nose, about the size of an apple and plonked it on Velma's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaahh! Get it off!\" Velma screamed, but no matter how hard she tried to pull, the rubbery nose wouldn't come off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's give Velma a BIG hand for agreeing to conquer her fear of clowns, folks!\" Again, the applause filled the tent. \"And the only way Velma can stop being AFRAID of clowns is to BECOME one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! No, no!! I don't want to be a clown!\" Velma pleaded, but the effects had already started.her real nose had fused with the rubbery ball, becoming a part of her body. Though she couldn't see it, white face paint had covered her entire face. she looked down at her hands as two big, puffy white gloves appeared on them. \"This can't be happening, this can't be happening... i-it's illogical! It's impossible! It must be a dream!\" Velma tried to assure herself, despite the changes happening right before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's a dream alright,\" Magnolia grinned, \"A dream come true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma tensed up as her (already large) breasts began to swell outward, with loud, audible BWOING! noises. The sound of laughter circled Velma, still in too much shock to move. \"I-it's not funny! How am I supposed to carry these things around?!\" But that wasn't her ONLY concern. Her thick, orange sweater had begun to shrink into a tiny, orange t-shirt, just barely able to cover her nipples a pair of suspenders crossed over her chest, connecting from the back to the front of her red skirt. \"Id's dot fubby, dou guys! W-whab? Whab habbened do by boice?! Why cab't I dalk right?!\" Her lips had about quadrupled inside, now a bright shiny red, flopping around with each word she attempted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't she a RIOT, folks?\" the ring leader teased, slapping one of Velma's now massive buttcheeks, hanging out from under her skirt. \"Look at those buns shake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dop! Dop doing dib do bee!\" she cried. She felt her red shoes turn into giant clown shoes, just barely able to contain her new 2-foot long feet! she tried to walk, but after the first step, she came tumbling down, tripping on her feet and onto her rubbery, boobs. Velma wasn't sure what was coming over her, but... it WAS funny! This whole thing was funny! \"Huh huh... sssneheheheee....\" she chuckled, \"BFFAAHAHAHAHAHA! HA HA HA HOOOAHAHAHA!\" She started laughing uncontrollably! her glasses had filled with multicolored spirals, making her see the world in a much more silly light. \"Duuhuhuhuh! Madamb Bagdolia ib right!  I'bba silly clown! Velma da Clown!\" What was Velma so worried about? She LOVED clowns now! She was such a happy, silly, dumb clown girl, with big bouncy boobies and butt cheeks! With a big, stupid grin, she grabbed her legs and began to bounce on her asscheeks around the ring, her breasts and clown nose wobbling around each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it up for VELMA THE CLOWN!\" Magnolia snickered, \"Now, silly widdle Velma here is going to put on a little show for all of you! She's going to...</span></div></div>",

I'd like to get a corn dog please?\" Velma squinted, looking inside the stand for anyone, but with no luck. She hadn't noticed that a corn dog had popped up right underneath her, its aroma wafting up her nose. \"Mmmmm... oh! Uhh, thanks!\" she said a bit nervously, picking up the corn dog. As soon as her teeth sunk into it, she knew this was the best corn dog she'd ever had. \"Mmmphh... mmmm, JINKIES! This is really good! Not like the cruddy food this place USED to serve...\" She took bite after bite until the entire thing was gone. \"Ahhh....\" she sighed, patting her belly, followed by a small belch. \"Oops! Excuse me!\" she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, her mind snapped back to the entire reason why she was here! She needed to find out who was behind the weird happenings at the carnival!

Looking towards the stand, she was quite surprised to find that not one, but two more corn dogs had appeared in the place of the first. \"Jinkies,\" she thought, \"very strange...\" Her stomach had begun to growl from smelling the corn dogs; they just looked so good, so fresh and warm... \"Oh, well,\" she thought aloud, \"I guess a <i>couple</i> more wouldn't hurt!\" She bit into the two corn dogs with the same vigor she used to devour the first; within a minute both of them were merely sticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma burped a bit louder and chuckled nervously, a rosy blush tinting her cheeks even though there was no one around. \"Jinkies, pardon me,\" she said to the empty air, looking back towards the stand. To her surprise, four corn dogs had appeared, lined up in a row. \"Okay,\" she said to herself, \"someone's playing a joke on me...\" She hesitantly grabbed one of the corn dogs and nibbled it. It certainly tasted like the real thing... \"Maybe I should sample ALL of them, just to be sure.\" What she considered \"sampling\" quickly turned into full-fledged eating, the girl gobbling up all four of the corn dogs in record time. She could feel her stomach start to fill up, but the corn dogs were just SO delicious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed to herself, seven corn dogs slowly digesting in her belly. She normally wouldn't have eaten so much--she preferred to leave the eating to the \"experts\", i.e. Shaggy and Scooby--but the food she'd just consumed was better than anything she'd had in a long time. Her mind buzzed back and forth; on the one hand, she still had no idea who was behind all of this, but on the other, she wondered if there would be more food. She decided to...</span></div></div>",

All she wanted were those funnel cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing these cakes off, Velma was a sight to behold. Her orange sweater was no longer able to contain her vast stomach, which was now the size of a volleyball and sitting comfortably on her noticeably larger thighs.

Shaggy gulped audibly as he tried to talk his companions out of searching the room, but alas it was to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys, we have to get to the bottom of this mystery.\" Velma said, as Shaggy and Scooby closely followed behind the orange clad young adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as soon as the trio entered the room, the door closed and locked behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoinks! I should have known that was coming.\" Shaggy said, in a frightened tone of voice as he attempted to somehow open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Shaggy was trying to budge the door, a mysterious voice began to speak to the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Velma demanded, hoping the owner of the voice would make an appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me step into the light so you can see better my dear.\" the voice remarked, as he stepped into the trio's line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overhead light now helped magnify the appearance of the same dark haired man in a lab coat who had been watching Mystery Inc. previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to introduce myself. Dr. David Crowne, at your service.\" the man said, briefly bowing in front of Velma and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what are you doing here Dr. Crowne? Professor Watkins told us that everyone on campus had left because of the weird happenings and missing equipment on campus.\" Velma said, watching the strange doctor closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Professor Watkins. That old fool is the reason why I stuck around; as one of the heads of the university's biology department, I had some business to attend to on campus, and experiments to conduct.\" Dr. Crowne replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what kind of experiments Dr. Crowne?\" Velma asked, glaring at the lab coat clad individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's where you three come in, and you in particular my dear.\" Dr. Crowne replied, motioning towards Velma as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Velma said, in a displeased tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you would like to see for yourself?\" Dr. Crowne asked in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... common sense tells me no, but scientific curiosity says I should be interested.\" Velma replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, if you would come stand next to me please.\" Dr. Crowne noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the menacing and evil tone in Dr. Crowne's voice was enough to send a shiver up Shaggy and Scooby's spines, so the duo tried to talk some sense into Velma in order to make sure she would not watch the doctor conduct his experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Velma, I think we need to get out of here while we still can.\" Shaggy said, taking hold of Velma's right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaggy, you worry too much. It's just a scientific experiment, what could go wrong?\" Velma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaggy attempted to reason with his girlfriend once again, but alas she was dead set on joining the doctor on the other side of the room. The bespectacled brunette then smiled and gave Shaggy a brief kiss on his right cheek, prior to walking to the other side of the room and standing next to Dr. Crowne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah excellent. Now, I would like to know the name of my assistant if you please...\" Dr. Crowne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Velma doctor, Velma Dinkley.\" the brunette replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Crowne then nodded and smiled, although it appeared to Shaggy and Scooby that it was a menacing smile. Dr. Crowne then picked up a glass beaker and showed it to Velma, who had a curious look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that liquid in the beaker Dr. Crowne?\" Velma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, this is a part of my experiments. It is a serum that contains the DNA of a Lizard; I have been using it in my studies of what would happen if one combined the DNA of a Reptile with the DNA of a Human Being.\" Dr. Crowne explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why? Why would you want to combine the DNA of a Reptile with the DNA of a Human?\" Velma inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Why not? As a matter of fact, that is the same thing the heads of the university's biology department said... just before they fired me.\" Dr. Crowne replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly can believe it.\" Velma said, with a disgusted look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah! You, you Miss Dinkley are just like the people at this school's biology department. No ingenuity, no comprehension of the benefits this could have for mankind!\" Dr. Crowne replied, now clearly angry with the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Benefits? This is crazy; you cannot think that combining the DNA of a human and a reptile would be beneficial to mankind could you?\" Velma asked, as she noticed the doctor staring at her unsettlingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do. Man could survive the most extreme temperatures with the DNA of a reptile; if the planet cools too much or goes into a new ice age, one could simply take the DNA of a creature that could survive in cold temperatures. Or, if the planet warms too much, one could simply take the DNA of a warm blooded creature.\" Dr. Crowne replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mankind is not equipped to handle being part animal.\" Velma reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but they will have to. Once I am done with the school and you meddlers, the world will have to recognize me as a scientific genius!\" Dr. Crowne declared, laughing menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if I have anything to say about it!\" Velma said, as she tried to turn in the other direction; however, Dr. Crowne had a death grip on her right arm and was holding the glass beaker in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Miss Dinkley, let's not do anything too hasty. You wished to see what my experiment was, and now you shall experience it first hand!\" Dr. Crowne said, uncapping the glass beaker with one hand and continuing to hold onto Velma's right arm with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what do you plan on doing with that?\" Velma asked, while Shaggy and Scooby prepared to advance on the insane doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else? I shall grant you the wondrous feeling of having the DNA of a reptile!\" Dr. Crowne said, as he moved the beaker closer and closer to Velma's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma stood helpless, she could not break free at all from the doctor's grip. While at the same time Shaggy and Scooby were quickly walking towards the mad doctor; however, as he prepared to tackle the doctor, Shaggy realized if he tried to do this, there was a chance he might accidentally cause Velma injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all of this was occurring, the doctor now had the glass beaker mere inches away from Velma's face. Velma shivered at the thought of being half reptile, but with Dr. Crowne acting like a bodybuilder, she felt helpless once again, as there was no way she could avoid her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my dear, if you will be so kind...\" Dr. Crowne said, forcing the brunette's mouth open with the top of the beaker before he began pouring the strange liquid into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Crowne in a few moments had proceeded to pour the entire beaker's contents into Velma's mouth, and soon the serum was going into the brunette's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... did you do?\" Velma asked, as she dropped to her knees, feeling as if the inside of her body was on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I merely subjected you to my first experiment Miss Dinkley. And soon, I will do the same thing your red haired friend, as females seem to make perfect test subjects.\" Dr. Crowne explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how do you k-know about D-Daphne?\" Velma asked as Shaggy and Scooby were now holding onto her arms, in an attempt to keep her standing, or at least off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've been watching you meddlers for sometime, keeping track of you.\" Dr. Crowne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Velma, I think we better get out of here and find the rest of the gang.\" Shaggy suggested, as Velma felt her mind spinning and her stomach churning, all the while shooting death glares at Dr. Crowne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will do you no good to leave, especially considering Miss Dinkley is about to become part Lizard in the next few moments.\" Dr. Crowne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're going to try to anyway.\" Shaggy replied, trying the door again... only this time it opened for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaggy, Scooby and the now woozy Velma Dinkley had now left the room, only for Dr. Crowne to taunt them as they departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will do you no good... you will be a reptile soon enough....\" Dr. Crowne said, laughing evilly as the trio went out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would have been even better if she could get a change of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, now I know how the movie theater floors feel like. At least they're starting to dry.\" Daphne murmured. Little did Daphne know that her clothes hadn't dried, they had seeped through her clothe and into her skin. It began to alter her body by increasing her metabolism and expand her body. With every step she grew bigger. Daphne was unaware of this because without her flashlight she could barely see her own two hands. Her stomach was the first to expand wth her butt following shortly after. Event hough she couldn't see her body changing, she did notice that the footprints were not only glowing but also webbed and more than 5 ft. far apart from each other. It's like they...jumped the entire way<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne was starting to feel the changes, but blamed it on her surrounding. When her bloated belly began to slow her down she assumed that the mud was getting thicker and when her bubble butt was starting to rip her skirt she automatically thought that it just got caught on a branch. Even when her bra was beginning to tear she was too focused on following the footprints to notice.When she got to the end of the trail, she found a shocking clue. In front of her were several barrels with a radioactive symbol on it that were leaking a green ooze that trickled into a nearby river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow this is incredible. This is the clue of a lifetime. I gotta tell the gang about this.\" Daphne said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrrrroak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne twirled around when she heard a loud croak behind her. She gasped when she saw in the shadows a pair of orange eyes staring at her. They were intimidating and yet enchanting at the same time. Daphne backed away slowly and fell backwards when she stumbled on a rock. When she tried to stand up she finally got a look at her body. The first thing she noticed was that her stomach which was beginning to look like she was 9 months pregnant. Next were her breasts which were now D-cups that almost blocked her view of her gut. Even though she couldn't feel it, Daphne could feel her butt had gotten bigger, like she had two balloons in her bun. Daphne started to hyperventilate, scrambled to her feet, and ran for her life. She didn't care if it was a man in a mask, she wanted to get out of there and find out what was wrong with her. Whatever was wrong with her, she hoped that it could be fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes, she spotted one of her friends in the distance. Unfortunately, she was undergoing another change at the same time.</span></div></div>",

She loved the boy but by god could he be irritating at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The big dope, he probably hasn't even noticed that I'm gone yet.\" Daphne sighed in aggrivation, all this effort for what was probably some goon in a costume that was using mass hysteria in combination with a local legend to drive people away from a abandond gold mine or some such thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo distracted was Daphne that she walks headlong into someone standing in the middle of the path, knocking her back onto her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, sorry about that I didn't see you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne looks up at who she walked into and see's a tall dark figure, wearing what appears to be a long cloak. The figure stares down at Daphne, blankly, silent as the grave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, do you even speak english?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response she gets is a deep throaty hiss, Daphne then starts crawling backwards slowly away from who, or whatever it was she was talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen slowly, painfully so, the cloak starts to unfold itself unfurling into a set of large wings, moth wings if Daphne was seeing right. A pair of feather-like antennae unfurl from its head, and the vaugly human like face splits apart revealing itself to be two small arm like appendages attached to the creatures sholders revealing a set of chitenous jaws and two insectoid eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne is stunned silent for a few seconds, before screaming like a woman posessed. The moth creature responds in kind with a roar like hiss. Then pounces on it's unlucky prey, pinning her arms and legs to the ground with it's vice like hands and feet. The moth beast roars again before opening its mouth wide and starts spraying Daphne with a thick viscous silk gagging her mouth shut and eventually cocooning her whole body in silk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith its prey securly cocooned the creature then produces a large stinger from its abdomen which it then jabs into the cocoon pumping somthing into Daphne's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mouth gagged Daphne can only moan at the burning senstation that comes from the sting which quickly spreads from the injection point to all over her body. The red head of the Mystery inc. gang writhes in agony for a few while, which only causes her silk prison to shudder slightly. A minute or so passes and soon the pain becomes to much and Daphne starts to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Feeling faint getting dizzy, am I dying?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Daphne has passed out the cocoon stops to shiver, the moth creature lets of a soft yet victorious hiss, grabbs its prize and flys deep into the forest far beyond the trails and camp grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep into the trees the creature retuns to its lair a small portion of the forest quartered off with silk tripwires to warn of intruders, and the leaves of the trees clumped together with more silk to create a think canvus that shades all beneath it from the sun, the moth creature then carefully sticks to cocoon containing Daphne to a tree in its grotto with more silk, then it finds a nearby brach hangs from it like a bat, wraps its wings around it and focuses all its attention on the cocoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the rest of the gang notice Daphne's abscense and start to search, as the hours crawl by they get the police involved, as the hours start to become days, Daphne's parents use their wealth to get private eyes, search parties, the national guard even, but none know where to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days become one week, then two, then comes the third week. In the creatures nest neither it nor the cocoon have seemed to move at all during this time, if the thin layer of dust on both is anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly a sickening squelch noise comes from inside the cocoon and it starts to shiver and shake. The moth creature perks up and drops from its spot stalking up to the cocoon and carefuly caressing it with its antennae all the while making gentle clicking sounds to whatever it was Daphne had become in the past weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a large crack appears in the cocoon spilling a sickening sludge on the ground beneath it, then whatever it was inside starts to push its way out, it tumbles from the cocoon onto the ground with an uncerimonious flop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne had emerged from her internment at last but now she was</span></div></div>",

As she kneeled down to investigate, she was suddenly overcome with a thick green fog that almost made her feel like she was floating.  As she continued to stare at the rocks, a green light arose that grew in intensity, until it was floating in front of her face and the size of a basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not be alarmed!\" said a voice emanating from the hypnotic light.  \"You have been chosen to receive a great gift!

Once out, each of them reacted differently: Fred was happy to find some place to rest and started to gather the necessary elements to build a fire. Velma, on the other hand, simply stretched and sat on a flat boulder to keep reading the encyclopedia she had recently tackled. Shaggy and Scooby, for what was about them, were busy listing what food they had left after consuming more of its half during the trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Daphne, carefully left the Mystery Machine, as she had just finished to put on her swimming suit. Fred and Velma had laughed when she told them there would be no where to take a swim and not enough of a good weather for sunbathing. The redhead had simply shrugged, telling them they would be the one regretting their decision once a beautiful lake would show up to the group. Since everyone else was busy minding their own business, Daphne allowed herself to go for a walk, hoping to find find a big enough spot to swim in and make them jealous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the young woman thought her wish had been granted when her naked feet stepped in some mud. She grinned and told herself. <br>\r\n\"I can't wait to hear them complaining about their sunburns and mosquito bites while I'll be diving into my paradise of fresh water!\" <br>\r\nUnfortunately, all what the woman could find was a bunch of puddles, filled with extremely smooth sand and clear water.<br>\r\n\"Strange... It looks like... Tiny pools...\" <br>\r\nAs she walked further to investigate her discovery, her curiosity brutally ceased when she tripped on some sort of branch.<br>\r\n\"What the-\" the redhead said before barely stabilizing herself, preventing her from sinking into the muddy surface. A quick look on what she thought to be an ordinary stick caught her attention, especially when Daphne noticed its golden grip and sharp tip, as if decorated with a shard from a shattered sapphire. <br>\r\n\"Hey, who would throw away something like that?  I'd rather bring it to Velma, she always loved to study archeology, maybe that would help her to drop that stupid book of hers.\" <br>\r\nBut as soon as Daphne grabbed the ancient item, which seemed to be a spear, its jewel glew in a powerful flash, momentarily blinding the young woman.

Rubbing her forehead like after a hangover, the young woman got up, only to notice a huge, golden structure standing in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-where am I, what happened..? \u201c She stood there for a few minutes, thinking about her situation while carefully looking around her. <br>\r\n\u201cI...I was just there, holding that thing to bring it back to Velma and-\u201d<br>\r\nShe suddenly stopped when she almost fell off into a hole in her walk. What surprised her even more was how this gap was shaped like a footprint. Daphne looked this time down, and remembered how she tripped on the spear she had found before spotting it. The young lady stared at the ground, noticing how it was composed of rocks, and not sand, as she remembered. In fact, it looked exactly like sand particles, only bigger. The next thing Daphne saw was a bunch of wooden cabins, flattened as if some monster from a Japanese movie had stomped them. Daphne's feet felt awkwardly itchy at this sight. Some explanation came to her after quickly checking them: wooden shards, probably stuck on her foot after this long walk, looked exactly like if they were made of the same material than the constructions next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw\u2026\u201d she said removing the last needle. \u201cAt least that's one thing taken care of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nDaphne then proceeded to keep analyzing the situation, causing her to look again at the huge gilded structure. After finally circumventing it, something unavoidably caught her attention: some sort of blue boulder was shining at the tip of that...thing. And it was too much of a coincidence for Daphne to prevent her from understanding what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute\u2026 if this is the spear from earlier, only thousands times bigger, and the wood shards look like the wooden planks from the cabins, not to mention those huge footprints on the ground, while I was the only one here...does that mean that\u2026 I'VE SHRUNK?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne could not believe it. There had to be a rational explanation. There had always been one. She probably had fallen asleep, and all of that was nothing but a bad dream? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's the only possibility. All what I have to do is to wake up!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, she pinched her cheek hard. The slight discomfort did not prove helpful, but what surprised Daphne instead was a sharp pain in her back!  When she turned around in the blink of an eye to understand what was happening, what she saw was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was not wearing anything if one excluded the large piece of cloth covering from his waist to his feet. What truly revealed his gender was the absence of breasts on his chest. <br>\r\nDaphne flinched at his sight: his mask was intimidating, and the spear he kept pointing at her did not help. Daphne, although not psychic, could definitely read fear in the position of her attacker, as the latter was clutching his spear as if Daphne could trigger a hurricane to send him flying by simply blowing at him. Taking this advantage into account, she, while pointing at his weapon, said:<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What the heck are you doing?! This thing hurts, you know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, standing still, slightly shook his head, as if unable to understand what the redhead just told him. But Daphne did not have the time to explain anything further since two other individuals, dressed in a similar fashion, burst out of the rocks -now as big as boulder to Daphne- and lifted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u2019\u201d she shouted, pointlessly pounding her fists against her attackers. \u201cLet me go, you brutes! You hear me? I should have stomped your entire villa-\u201d<br>\r\nBut she could not end her sentence as one of them gagged her and tied Daphne up to one of their vehicles. To the young woman\u2019s dismay, she realized the red shell she was attached on was that of a beetle ! <br>\r\n<i>\u201cOh my, am I really this tiny?!\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nAnd so the flight began. Daphne did her best to not panic. One could think that after all the captures she had gone through, the lady would no longer care, but in all previous cases, there had always been a rational explanation to what had happened, but she doubted she would be able to find one here. After all, had she not gotten shrunk as small as a bug? Even a scientist like Velma would linger baffled by that! And what was going to happen to her at this size?! How was she going to live like any other persons?  What were Fred and the others going to think if they ever found her back?  And most importantly\u2026 How was she going to use any of her makeup, now that a mere lipstick was five times bigger as she currently was? All of those questions ceased as soon as the bug landed on a leaf nearby. The other people came right after her, riding different insects as well. They lifted her through the massive vegetation, making simple grass look like a dense jungle to Daphne. In spite of their efforts to restrain her moves, she kept struggling to break free. All her attempts stopped when her abductors suddenly threw her into a wide room after entering some sort of building. <br>\r\nDaphne was almost stunned by the way the mysterious men got rid of her. The latters immediately kneed toward the far end of the room, where someone was sitting on what seemed to be a throne. Still unable to speak or move, all what she could do was to gaze at that same person approaching her. He waved the others to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThat is not good\u2026\u201d</i> Daphne thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done, the man snapped his fingers, causing the ropes and rag to untie and magically fly away from Daphne. Two ideas came to the mind of the young woman: fleeing and fight to survive in this gigantic world to live as a minuscule damsel in distress forever, or simply listen to that creep and possibly negotiate a way to grow her back to normal size. Given how shaken she felt after all that mess, she complied to the second option, hoping that guy was at least able to understand a word of English. Surprisingly, he told her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As I have told you, Majestic One, your presence here is a bless for my Empire. Allow me to introduce myself: my name is Akzolon, of Xijun, the territory under my protection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne looked at him angrily. She got back up, put her hands on her waist and said, as if scolding a child who had committed some mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what you say is that your way of greeting someone is to shrink that person, capture her like some beast, and then pretend to worship her like some deity?! And what's that \u201cMajestic One\u201d title you are calling me anyway?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkzolon, as if expecting such a reaction, did not even flinch at the accusation from the shrunken woman. <br>\r\n\u201cPlease, try to understand, we just want to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-To keep me prisoner as a toy for freaks like you?! Grow me back immediately!\u201d Daphne thundered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the chief, or whatever his title was, looked worried -even through his bizarre helmet- as if afraid of messing up a very important opportunity. This detail caught Daphne's attention, and gave her the strength to keep shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea how terrible it is to be that small, when supposed to live in a world a hundred times bigger than your current size! And how did we all got so small anyway?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkzolon took advantage of her brief silence to convince her into listening to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now that we are done, will you listen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne crossed her arms in anger, but did not interrupt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is the first time in centuries, that the Spear of Height reacted in such a way. Normally, anyone who touched it would never had been affected in any kind of way, but you...are obviously different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, am I?\u201d the sarcastic woman asked. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI assure you this is no lie. Not to mention you are the only woman I've seen in centuries!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCenturies?  Don't you think it isn't a little far-fetched?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkzolon smiled at her, and removed his mask. What was concealed behind dazzled Daphne: the skeletal face of Akzolon, as well as the rare silver hair on his head proved his words were speaking the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you see now, Majestic One, the time we have been waiting for you? For a woman to bring our civilization back to life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this sight, a thousand of questions were popping inside Daphne's head. She asked the most important one, stuttering: <br>\r\n\u201cB-but...who are you all exactly..? What do you want from me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I've told you we are what is left of an ancient empire. A fallen empire, sustaining itself on my weakening magic to not collapse for good. All the men you can see here...are my sons, who, unlike me, benefit from my powers to escape the harmful impact of time. This is how we survived for hundreds of years, shrinking ourselves to protect ourselves from those who might interfere with our desperate struggle for survival, especially since we can't have new children\u2026without females.

At least were some of them able to talk.<br>\r\n\u201cI, Akzolon, of the Xijun Empire, shall not allow this.\u201d<br>\r\nThe self-proclaimed emperor kept speaking:<br>\r\n\u201cNot only have you destroyed some of our villages, but you even dared to claim the Spear of Height, the treasure our mighty ancestors left to us for our protection!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man walked away from the shadows concealing his throne, Daphne could see how old this so-called emperor was, and from her point of view, he probably was seventy. Once close enough to check his prisoner in detail, he looked astonished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA female?!  What's a female doing here? Why didn't any of you warn me any sooner?!\u201d he barked at his subjects. <br>\r\nOne of them, coming back from the the antichamber, shaking, answered in a language Daphne could not identify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA demon, you say? You fool. What we have here is simply a woman from above, the world we chose to reject!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humble masked man had the bravery to keep explaining. Judging by his hesitating tone, this emperor was probably no one to mess with, Daphne thought. Fortunately for him, the emperor sighed as a sign of forgiveness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. So she hasn't come alone. If only one of them succeeded in causing such a mayhem\u2026then we must proceed quickly. That said, I think we have a unique opportunity here.

We struggled for a long time against our enemy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you old man,\u201d Daphne said, \u201cBut I'm currently not in the mood for a bedtime story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkzolon ignored her reply and kept talking: \u201dNone of us could defeat one another, until our own women decided to betray us. And so, our ancestors lost their powers after this treason. As a last resort to escape extinction, we had no choice but to shrink our population to escape those warmongers, after shrinking down our traitors even more, that is. You should count your blessings that the Spear of Height lost a lot of its power over time.  Otherwise, I think you would have turned even punier, even to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis scolding was interrupted again as the ground violently quaked, causing the palace to vibrate, as if shivering in terror from an upcoming danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkzolon grinned as if he knew all along what was happening.

Once she saw what was responsible for such a mayhem, Daphne screamed, but given her size, it sounded more like a squeak than a real cry for help. A massive hand burst in the palace -or what was left of it- and grabbed the miniature woman, as if catching a fruitfly. After spotting the huge golden weapon in the giant hand, it did not take long for Daphne to understand what was going on: the Spear had not shrunk to Akzolon\u2019s size, he was the one who got bigger all along, or at got back to human size !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you knew,\u201d her abductor said, \u201cHow long I had been waiting for this moment, for the Spear of Height to recover its original powers, causing our entire civilization to collapse in amazement, all of that thanks to the trap we landed to one of you, the people from above.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a wonder what was happening- anthropomorphic animals were quickly becoming more common than the local humans. But how was this happening? Well, as far as the Mystery Inc. gang knew, it had all happened rather suddenly. It all started roughly on the first day of the new school year. Everyone was excited- after all, it's not everyday that you reach junior year. Yet, despite the excitement that the gang had, as well as their other fellow juniors, one soul didn't seem as excited. That one was Hot Dog Water, otherwise known as Marcie Fleach. She seemed nervous and, concerningly, seemed to be shedding hair in fear. Velma (and Daphne, who served as liaison due to Marcie and Velma's shaky friendship) went to find out what was wrong. That's when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three met in secret after school. Marcie had been wearing a lot of clothes lately- a heavy overcoat, a wide-brimmed hat and a ton of bandages over the face (among other such things). This was weird enough- it was still partially summer, but here was Marcie, dressed like it was the middle of the harshest winter ever! However, Marcie was only beginning to show the strangeness that was going on. She tore off her heavy clothes, revealing that she was coated with fur and had metamorphed into an Anthro dachshund!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been a week ago. As time went on, however, things got worse. Marcie was taunted, of course, but she didn't seem to mind; in fact, as time went on, she seemed to get lost in an endless bliss. Imagine the shock when this fairly new Anthro had given birth to Anthro puppies during a class. The professor, none too impressed, tried to dispose of them. Marcie responded violently, biting the professor. He quickly healed from the injury- nearly instantly -and became an Anthro in a matter of seconds and (in a shocking twist) his mind suddenly went from loathing the anthros to loving them- and Marcie, in particular, who the professor now saw as a mate (awkward much?). Everyone was freaked out- but the changes still kept coming. New strains of anthros seemed to pop up within a matter of hours- cats, dogs, birds, lizards and (in a deja v\u00fa kind of moment) Anthro crabs (among other such species) began to show up everywhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police were helpless to stop this- any attempt to cull the anthros seemed to trigger a hive mind-like reaction from all the other anthros, who quickly swarmed and tore apart the cops. Thankfully, acts of aggression were few and far between. Despite this, the endless changes were becoming noticeable and the government was considering quarantining the city of Crystal Cove- or worse, cleansing the area with a bomb! This couldn't come to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing investigation on a scale never done before, Mystery Inc. began to look into the situation to see if a cure could be obtained. Thankfully, the first victim- Marcie -was more than willing to tell where the whole ordeal began. An old abandoned pet care facility- part pet daycare, part pet supply factory -situated on the edge of town was where she had been before she was turned into an Anthro. This was the first stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, only the girls were willing to go there. Scooby had gone missing in the chaos during the Anthro takeover, leaving Shaggy heartbroken. He quickly rushed off to find his canine companion. As for Fred, he had locked up his house, refusing to leave- the Anthro surge had left him in a panic over who- or what, in this case -was the dominant life form, so he began to produce major traps to prove that humanity was better than anthros. How typical of Fred- when the going gets tough, make a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here we are\" said Daphne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Marcie was right, then this place should be the source of all these mutations\" said Velma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pet facility was an eyesore, to put it bluntly. Having it settled in swampland- similar to the home of those Gator People that had shown up in one of their earlier cases -was a major turn-off for any workers. The building had also seen the wear and tear of what seemed to be years of neglect- windows were broken, doors had been coated in rust and any paint that remained on the building was flaking off. Still, it was quiet- a little TOO quiet,McGovern that this was the source of the Anthro origin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what's up. We won't be able to restore Crystal Cove just standing here\" said Velma.</span></div></div>",

As it turned out, this company had been built in the 1800s, with the founder- one Dr. Moreau -having shown an overly serious love for animals. He took in animals that had been abused, neglected and downright abandoned- which was admirable -but what he did with them afterwards was a shock. He had been taking their DNA and splicing it into the human chain. The end result was a series of anthropomorphic creatures, which the founder quickly sent to torment the city. The less-than-good Doctor was arrested, only to disappear when a prison riot saw his cell broken into. His death remained ambiguous, but his business continued, despite negative attention. Unfortunately, each successor intended to continue Moreau's work (as the police discovered), suggesting Moreau either had planned his successors in advance or had an equally insane family working under assumed identities. Either way, the facility was closed down in the aftermath of World War 2... That was when things got interesting. The police raid uncovered several ancient relics, dating to the time of the Annunaki. It was clear that Moreau had plans to bring these Anthros back to life. However, the real shock was that Moreau hadn't just been making humans animalistic, but the animals were being made into humans, too! Horrified, the government had the company shut down for good, with all employees being thrown in asylums and the lab subjects were exterminated or (in the case of the newborns that were forged from the altered animals) kept under quarantine. These latter creatures eventually escaped \"as he had expected\"... Had Moreau somehow predicted that his creations would become as smart as humans, or even smarter? What mattered now was that the facility was back on-line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But who would want to keep this going?\" wondered Velma. Just then...</span></div></div>",

The last memory that she clutched to was holding on to Scooby as she dangled from a helicopter that threatened to crash at any second, then falling when her grip have way... Everything afterwards was a blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have died, Nova\" said a voice from... somewhere. \"Your body was trampled to death by those disturbing mutant cows unleashed by the original Mystery, Inc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That definitely explains the pain\" thought Nova. A few thousand cow hooves (normal or mutant) hardly did the body any good. Straining to open her eyes, she finally realized she was... nowhere. All that stretched before her was an endless expanse of whiteness. \"Where am I?\" she wondered aloud before placing a paw to her throat; it had been so long since she had spoken coherent English. \"I can talk again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" said the voice Nova heard earlier. \"However, there is more news that you should be informed of- the warped reality that Crystal Cove once possessed is being rewritten; a certain canine friend of yours and his meddling teenage allies are to thank\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scooby...\" said Nova, a hopeful look crossing her face. However, her face was quick to turn confused. \"Wait- if reality is being remade, then why am I here? This better not be the new reality... Whatever you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankfully, this is not the new reality\" said the voice. \"As to who- or, rather, what -I am, let's just say that, for all intents and purposes, I am the guardian of the space between realities\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay- so, why am I here?\" asked Nova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was getting to that\" said the voice. \"Before you may cross into this new reality, you must be reborn\". Perhaps noting the distress on Nova's face, the voice added \"Do not worry; the procedure is neither painful, nor long. Also, you will still retain your current age, though any and all memories of your past life and this place will be destroyed\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good to know... I guess. So, when does the procedure start?\" asked Nova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Nova could even respond, a small yellow sphere enveloped her. She was temporarily blinded, while an invisible force pulled her. After a few seconds, she found that not all of her was still the same- her front paws were less like actual paws and were more like hands, just like Scooby's.
