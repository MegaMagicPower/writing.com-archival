Ever since he left Nightopia, there had been a strange throbbing in his head, and while it wasn't painful, it was certainly getting annoying.  In addition, he felt much heavier; he couldn't even fly now, only hover a foot or so above the ground.  He looked around the corridor for his room--lo and behold, there it was.  Room 005.  Taking a deep breath, he opened the door and strode into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, NiGHTS!  I've been expecting you!\"  A familiar voice boomed over an intercom system.<br>\r\n\"Hey...is that...\"<br>\r\n\"Surprised?\"<br>\r\n\"Sonic!  How ya doing, old pal!\"  NiGHTS shouted through the large testing chamber, his voice echoing all the way up to where Sonic watched in a control room.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, thanks for asking, but we can sit around and sip tea later.  Right now, it's test time, but no pressure; I made it through, and so can you!  Start off by showing us some basic attacks, like punches and kicks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiGHTS quickly lashed off some attacks.  He was quite speedy, but his delicate hands weren't very powerful.  Even at this stage, Sonic could tell NiGHTS would have a lot of finesse.  \"Alright, next we'll do something a bit more important, something every fighter has to be able to do...\"</span></div></div>",
