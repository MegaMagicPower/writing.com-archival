Mrs. Sandra Jones is resting after spending most of the morning preparing the food for the celebration later in the day.  She is on a lawn chair dressed in a small top with short shorts.  Her long and lean body is tanning in the sun as usual.  Sweat forms in small pools on her rock hard stomach.  Sandra is a woman very concerned with her appearance.  Every inch of her body is well kept from her shining white teeth down to her french manicured toe nails.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glances towards the other side of her large backyard to watch her children and smiles to herself.  Her children mean the world to her.  They're the only people she loves more than herself and would never dream of hurting them, even though she is known for her considerable temper especially around small insect pests.  She drifts off to sleep.  </span></div></div>",

Jon swings a stick around, pretending its a machete, cutting down the fantasy jungle foliage.  Megan fans herself with a paper plate and lets out a bored sigh.  She is riding on top of Blake who is pretending he is an elephant carrying the would be adventureer's supplies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan lets out another sigh.  \"Whats wrong Meg?\" says Jon looking back at his bored sister.  \"Ah nothing, I'm just getting tired of playing the same games over and over and looking at the same stupid backyard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon frowns and says to Megan, \"Well the rest of the family will be here soon, so we'll have other kids to play with.  And make sure you wear that old ring Aunt Jane gave you, it's supposed to be magic\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan glances down at her ring.  She hadn't worn it since her aunt Jane gave it to her last year.  It was old and needed polishing, and the tiny jewel encrusted in the center had a dull appearance to it.  \"Well I wish this magic ring would give us a real adventure\" says Megan, when suddenly the jewel in the ring begins to glow from a dull red to a bright crimson.  As it just so happens, the key to using the ring was to speak the words \"I wish this magic ring would...\" and thus the real adventure for the Jones siblings begins</span></div></div>",

Mrs. Jones stirs out of her slumber for a moment.  She takes off her sunglasses and rubs her eyes.  She could've sworn she saw a large red flash just a moment ago.  It must have been someone accidentally setting off a firework early.  There's no sign of her precious children anywhere.  Sandra frowns and gets out of her chair to walk over where the children were playing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile young Jon is recovering from the effects of the ring.  He feels sick and a violent swaying motion isn't helping things.  He is suspended what he guesses is about twenty feet in the air.  Below him he sees his brother and sister are passed out on the ground.  He looks around himself to get his bearings.  He's surrounded by a sea of light green plants and below are several boulders.  He looks up to see his shirt caught on a branch attached to an oddly shaped tree.  Nothing is making any sense to Jon he feels as if he wants to cry but his tears are held back when a deep rumbling moves across the earth.  Then another, and another, when finally a french manicured foot explodes with a BOOM onto the earth close by.  The foot is enormous, the size of two buses placed side by side.  It is smooth and tan but moves with a deadly power and force that betrays its feminine quality.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon looks up to see what this harbinger of doom is attached to.  His vision makes its way up a long and tan leg that streches for at least two to three miles until it reaches a pair of shorts.  The shorts give way to a flat and toned stomach and stops at two mountain sized breasts.  Further up is the face of this monolith but the sun blinds Jon for a moment.  He squints and is finally able to see the face of his titanic mother, seemingly staring right back at him.  It's all just too much, Jon finally vomits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra reaches the spot where the children were playing but all she sees is the stick Jon was using and one of those pesky weeds that always grows this time of year.  She looks at it in disgust, she hated little annoying things that were smaller than her.  She lifts up her foot and...</span></div></div>",

He looks back up to see his mother's face twisted into a mask of absolute disgust.  He had never seen such a look before, at least not from this perspective.  Yet he knew somewhere in the back of his child brain that this look meant his ultimate destruction if he didn't take action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon struggles with all his might to free himself from the weed.  His shirt begins to tear as he tries to grab hold of the weed and slide down its base.  He finally tears free and gets in position when he feels the earth tremble.  The giant tan foot of his mother is slowly lifting off the ground.  Jon knows he doesn't have much time.  He slides down the weed, creating cuts and scratches all over his body.  He yells out in pain as he slides but he knows he cannot slow down.  He lands on the rough dirt with a thump and falls backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks up to see his mother's leg raised, her knee level to her stomach.  He can see hundreds of wrinkles in the sole of her foot and in those wrinkles are tons of dirt and blades of grass.  Jon gets up and begins to run preparing himself for the inevitable.  He sees his brother and sister and dives for them.  The foot obliterates the weed and impacts the ground with an earth shaking BOOM!  Waves of dirt and dust are forced into the air creating a small cloud around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon rubs the dust out of his eyes, it was close.  The foot is only 30 of his feet away from him and his siblings.  He quickly moves and grabs both of them by their arms and begins to drag them into the nearby blades of grass.  \"I've got to wake them up and think of a plan\" Jon says to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sandra looks at the destroyed weed and smiles.  The children must have gone to a friend's house for a swim, she thinks to herself.  Sandra hears a noise behind her.  It's her husband Gary with one of their relatives.</span></div></div>",

But he also knew they would get better. After all, he was the leader of this group. He had to not just think they would survive. He had to know they would, to keep his siblings from panicking. Sighing at this he shook his head, slapped his face and pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We first have to find where the ring is. That means we need height, and right now that table dad setup last night with Uncle Bobbie's help is our best bet,\" he told Megan and Blake, his finger indicating the direction of the object. The two younger siblings, seeing the look on his face, brightened a bit, his confidence, as he'd hoped, being an infectious thing, causing them to start believing they would get out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his own head though, he admitted that it was unlikely they would succeed. In point of fact, it all depended on if the ring had shrunk with them. If it had...well they were doomed. They would never find it in the backyard, and even if they did, it's power might have shrunk with it. If it were still big though they would be able to see it from the top of the table, and then it would be just a matter of reaching it, while dodging relatives all focused on playing with explosives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove them one of those relatives is just starting to settle in, his hands full of various things for this little get together, including buns, that were both wheat, white, and some that advertised as having butter baked into them. The last he wasn't so sure about, but it was what his aunt's list, and he liked Aunt Sandra, for the most part. Behind him Uncle Gary brought a bag of charcoal, setting it down beside the grill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, so, when's this girlfriend of your's going to get here?\" asked Gary as he set about scooping some coal into the barbeque. Sandra, who had heard nothing of this looked over at Oliver, or rather Ollie to everyone he knew, her 6'5\" Basketball playing nephew and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jasmine will be here in a few minutes. I left her at the store. She was going to pick up some more stuff for the party,\" he told her, and Sandra sauntered over to him, looking him up and down in a judging way that set Ollie to scratching the back of his head and smiling nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where'd you meet this Jasmine, and what's she like?\" asked the aunt, and Ollie started on a diatribe about meeting her in one of his engineering courses at school. It turned out she already knew Jon, which was one of the reasons he hadn't told his aunt about her, as she knew Jasmine too, as Jon's teacher's aide at school, whom she had met that time Ollie had helped the little prankster fill the school's sprinkler system with a type of foam that smelled like chocolate. They got in trouble for that one, but it was one hell of a prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground level the three younger kids were unable to understand their massive relatives thanks to the disproportion of their sizes. Still they knew they had to hurry as the sound of three voices filled the air, and more would follow close behind. They knew they could probably just hide somewhere and wait for the party to get over, and then try to get to the table, but their mother's hatred of small things would work against them there, as the yard was fumigated nightly by some high tech sprinkler thing to keep bugs and little creep crawlies away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant people didn't look down, and they wouldn't have to deal with any arthropods themselves(A fancy word for bugs Jon learned from a science fiction book), but it also meant they had to find the ring today, and that they wold have to deal with unaware giants stomping around all over the place, and could probably crush them without even noticing it. Depressing as that thought was the trio press onward into the tangle of grass and dirt before them.</span></div></div>",

It probably had something to do with one of those things in the books his mother read him about star ships and things. Maybe because their mass was less than it should have been, they were able to proportionately do things better than they would have at normal size. Like an ant lifting ten times its own weight or the like, but in this case making their steps easier, and allowing them to make a steady pace along the lawn, which, underneath a thin layer of topsoil, was mostly plastic, another defense against bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we're here. Now what?\" asked Megan as she stared up at the monolithic structure before them. It seemed to reach off into space from their height, though Jon knew it was only three and a half feet off the ground. He'd been the one holding the tape measure for his uncle and father when they'd been selecting which leg to put on it after one had gotten busted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the leg in the corner toward the pool had this twisty design in it, cause dad broke the one that actually went with the table by bending it in half. The one there now came from that table mom bought for the pool. We should be able to get up that one with ease,\" he told his siblings, pointing toward what he was talking about, before walking toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, their journey, of proportionately two miles, took the kids only twenty minutes. In that time the only thing their cousin and parents had achieved was that the grill was on a low heat, buns for burgers, hotdogs, and even just sandwich bread with lunch meats and cheese, were laid out on the table, and the pool was covered, the last being one of those automatic things that moved at a touch of a button and was sturdy enough to walk on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys,\" said Jon, looking over at the distant shapes of the titans that he knew were his family, his dad twisting together the fuses of some of the professional grade fireworks that Ollie had asked Jasmine to make, her degree being chemical engineering. According to her they would blow any of those store bought things that anyone else brought out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you going to introduce me or what?\" asked Jasmine as she entered the backyard, a smile on her face as she walked over toward the table, tossing a few odds and ends, including paper plates and plastic cups, onto it, before finally approaching Ollie, who twirled her in his arms and then kissed her, while the plastic table shook from the impact, forcing the still climbing children to grab onto each other, lest they fall.</span></div></div>",

The edge had looked so far away when they had started up the twisting path of the table leg, like one of those giant spiral stairs in the old castles. It had seemed much smaller though in those minutes as everything shook violently from side to side. Sighing in relief as he leaned back he laughed to himself, smiling confidently back at Megan and Blake before leading them upward and onward once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was less than a minute later when they were just below the level of the table, and to their fortune the leg, designed for a table with an overhanging edge, literally went right up to the top of the table it was attached to now, allowing them to get onto it with only a few moments of difficulty where Jon hoisted his siblings up, an then had them help him to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there, having conquered something higher to them than any mountain, the kids were feeling good about themselves as they looked down on the ground, desperately searching for the glint of light that would tell them where the ring had fallen. Their gazes at last found it, but unfortunately for them, their sights were not the only ones that fell on it as Jasmine, just breaking her kiss with Ollie, looked down and spotted it at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, what's this?\" she asked, picking up the ring, only to find that Ollie had turned back toward his uncle, who needed help setting up the last firework, and his aunt, a woman she had met more times than she'd liked, was inside, getting some more snack food for the party ready. Sighing, the 6'3\", red-blonde haired college girl looked at her prize, and then, with a smile, slipped it on her finger, where it miraculously fit her perfectly. Thinking it was the aunt's, she decided to keep it until the end of the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the kids looked over at her, and started yelling immediately. Their initial plan of finding the ring themselves had gone out the window now, thanks to Jasmine finding it, they had to get her attention. And they had to do it before the party was over and those sprinklers rained liquid death on them too. Shouting and yelling they waved their arms as Jasmine slipped the ring onto her finger and then.....</span></div></div>",

Halfway through the burger, she swallows the meat she was chewing and feeling something dry &amp; grainy against the back of her throat...Wincing, she just swallows harder, forcing it all down inside her tummy. Her stomach gurgles ominously, but after another swig of water and the rest of that burger, Sandra's gut feels a little more settled. She sighs contendedly and goes back to the deck chair to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...Nothing like stuffing yourself on a pretty summer day.\"<br>\r\nShe leans back.

Disgusting globs of bread and meat, with chemical cheese spattered everywhere, churn and grind against each other as the ribbed, slimy walls rhythmically squeeze and relax, squeeze and relax, trying to make this sticky, not-quite-wet-enough masticated mess into a thinner kind of soup so it can be digested smoothly. The kids struggle to reunite, finally finding a quiet space, at the bottom of the stomach, just next to a certain conspicuous tightly knotted pink puckered valve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" asks Blake.<br>\r\n\"Well, now that we're all together,\" began Jon, \"I think if we all beat on the walls of her stomach, our combined strength with force her to throw up.\"<br>\r\n\"That won't be pretty,\" commented Megan, noting the huge churning mess before them.<br>\r\n\"But it's our only choice.

The stomach contracted, and everything--EVERYTHING, digested or not, was pushed very awkwarkly into poor Sandra's duodenum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-, my word...\" Sandra complained as a long, low gurgle emitted from somewhere deep inside her. There was a distinct, almost painfully full slithering sensation inside her, and she no longer felt nauseous, but the heavy, dense mush inside of her now felt as though it had traveled quickly into her intestines. \"What did Gary put into those burgers...oooh!\" She stroked the swollen lump in her abdomen, hoping to ease the intense, mushy pressure that she felt inside of her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So she relaxed in the lawn chair for a bit and began to read her summer book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as she'd reached the third chapter, there was a tiny, tiny little crafwling sensation, low down within her. She'd never quiet felt that before--except one time when, as a teenager, she'd swallowed a june bug whole on a dare and felt its tiny legs exploring her for two days--and Aunt Sandra didn't like that senation, although it did have that forbidden, slightly sexy aspect of having some alien being deep within you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probaby just an intestinal muscle spasm,\" she thought to herself. But then...a long, low grown from below her bellybutton, and a just barely painful pulling and streching feeling as her intestines worked hard to push along the copious loads of hardly-digested hamburger meat currently filling Sandra's gut. She regretted eating so many, and said so, putting a slightly wrinkled hand to her now somewhat swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she decided that she had to excuse herself from the party for a while. Sandra retired to her room, and lay down on her bed. She removed her tight-fitting clothes, as they only cramped her intestine. She put a hand to her peach-fuzzed bellybutton and moaned in pleasure as she felt the mushy contents inside her loosen up and begin to flow just a little easier. The feeling was so good, she reached down to her very wrinkly, fuzzy brown vulva and teased the wettening lips there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...\" Sandra felt relief, and closed her made-up eyes in pleasure. She lay there listening to the gurgles for a minute, feeling the pain subside somewhat. Sandra ventured a finger into her sticky vulval folds, coming closer to satisfying another urge that had gone long unfulfilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought of an option, to help ease her digestion and reach the big, heavy bathroom trip she was already looking forward to.</span></div></div>",

Something odd had definitely been happening in there, the strange fizzing feeling had not fully subsided. She felt comfort in the fact she knew her stomach was as strong on the inside as it was on the outside and what ever it was, it probably hadn\u2019t really stood much of a chance in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly for her offspring, she was right and her relaxing afternoon soaking up the sun and letting her dinner settle, had not worked out so great for her thee kids, especially as they had inadvertently played the part of her dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite a brief reunion, the siblings had little time before they witnessed the full force of their giant mothers digestive system. Strong waves of muscle contractions turned the chamber into a literal living hell. The aggressive churning quickly separated the group up and they were all swept out into a vast swirling ocean of melting meat, bread and stomach acid. Building sized chunks of what was once delicious looking food, had become the focal point of her powerful digestion, and the tiny inhabitants were merely fodder to the grown woman\u2019s internal workings. One by one the tiny swimmers disappeared under the crashing waves, submerging them into the thick, dark mass of sloshing goop. Their miniature body\u2019s offered little resistance to the strength of her acidic cocktail, which effortlessly converted them into nothing more than a couple of extra calories, the process of which was being aided by their mother gently caressing her gurgling food baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Sandra had awoken from her sleep, only a shallow bubbling swamp remained in her stomach. Everything had succumbed to the brutality of her everyday bodily function. Most of the churning ocean that raged a short time ago, was now a thick soup flowing calmly through her pulsing  intestines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afternoon drew onwards , and Sandra\u2019s tummy had now fully reduced itself back to its flat regular state. The fizzy feeling had gone and she was experiencing a boost in energy  along with a strange warmth circulating her entire body.. She decided to make good use of it by clearing away the party aftermath. \u201cMy afternoon nap has really helped today, I feel great\u201d she thought to herself. After a few minutes though she remembered that her antisocial kids had been predictively absent most of the party. \u201cTypical, they never help me with anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter things were in order and most of the guests had gone, Sandra proceeded to stomp around the house looking for her kids,  she had specifically told them to spend time with the family today. As she passed the hallway she took a moment to admire her tall trim figure  in a full length mirror. She smiled revealing her perfect set of white teeth, which she inspected with her tongue. She then looked over her bronzed torso and drummed her fingers across her well defined abs. She knew she looked good and couldn\u2019t help but compliment herself \u201cnot bad for three kids\u201d completely unaware of any irony in the statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Peaking out of the window, it didn't appear that anyone outside missed her too much or noticed she left.  She watched her husband, Gary, working the grill.

One second he was struggling against his mom's massive nipple, when he was suddenly pinned between her breast and her hand.

While still fingering herself with her right hand, Sandra was now massaging her breast with her left.  Blake was begging for his mom to notice him but to no avail.  Sandra loved the sensation of Blake rubbing against her tit, though she did not realize why.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck,\" Sandra moaned.  Before Blake knew what was happening, Sandra partially sat up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake could see his mom's face grow closer and closer.  For a second he thought he was saved.  \"Mom help me,\" he screamed, trying not to lose his grip on her nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, blames expression turned to terror as he saw his mom's giant, pink tongue extend from her mouth.  Before he could finish shouting \"Mom, no!\" Sandra began to play with her nipple with her tongue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds, Blake had been snatched up by the tongue that was being retracted into Sandra's mouth.

He looked around and saw his mom was completely naked and laying on her bed, when a shadow came over him as he saw his dad's mouth encompass him and the nipple he was holding onto. His dad began sucking on the breast and Blake was pulled off into the mouth. He was moved around for what felt like forever before it stopped, with him stuck to his dad's tongue, when he saw the world moving and a large pink thing entered his view, he didn't know what was happening but his dad thrusted him inside off the warm, pink, slimmy thing in front of him.

Jon tried his best to keep thinking positive and tried to find a way to get out of the situation, or at least not drown. He looked upand saw the clear sky outlined by the glass rim of the glass. The walls were smooth and slippery wet. He couldn't climb out. Through the glass he could see his relatives going about, preparing for the party. Right next to him was Jasmine, and Ollie still kissing. Finally they stop for a minute.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n\"I'm getting kind of thirsty.....\" Ollie comments.<br>\r\n\"Here, drink this.\" Says Jasmine as she picks up a glass of water from the table.

The lake of water he was in began to rock violently and he had trouble keeping his head above water. All this was just Jasmine raising the glass. Finally, when Jon could see again, he looked up to see Ollie's gigantic face blocking out the sky at the top of the glass. It was terrifying for Jon. Suddenly, the water rocked again, as the whole glass he was in tilted, disorienting Jon. When he regained composure, he was being swept down the length of the glass by a strong current. Then he saw two gigantic pinkish stuctures seperate and allow water to flow in, between two sets of huge white rocks. Then Jon realized what was going on. He realized the horrible truth. He was being swept into Ollies mouth. Ollie was drinking the glass of water, and Jon would be drunk as well. Jon panicked, not wanting to end up inside his own cousin's stomach. He tried to fight the current, but it was no use. He was dragged between the puffy lips, and over Ollies front teeth, scraping his body along the way. He barely had time to look around his new environment. It was a huge pinkish cave, dripping wet with saliva. all around him on 3 sides were huge white teeth much bigger than him. He could feel Ollies warm humid breath all around him as he was swept along. Finally he looked at the back of the mouth. The destination of the current. A huge slimy black hole, framed by slimy pink tonsils and a slimy uvula. It was already too late at this point. Jon screamed as he was plunged down the hole, and sucked along with the water down Ollies esophagus. <br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nOutside, Ollie finishes his drink, lets out a small burp, and goes off with Jasmine, placing the glass back on the table empty.

He wanted to just close his eyes and make this go away as he was squeezed further into Ollies body. Finally, he was squeezed through a final ring, and he could feel the pressure release on his feet. He was finally squeezed fully through, and fell into a huge chamber. He landed with a plop in a mushy mixture. Looking around, he realized he was now in Ollies stomach. He saw the slimy pink walls pulsate gently as they gently churned the mushy contents. Far above where he was was the small pink opening which was the opening to Ollies esophagus. He collapsed in the mush, tired and beaten from the experience. He listened to the sounds of his cousins body. The pounding rythmic booms of Ollies heart beating. The loud roars of his lungs inhaling and exhaling. Watery gurgles from farther down in the depths of Ollies body. There was no way out of this, Jon realized. His cousin had swallowed him and didn't even know it. if anything, Ollie would just dismiss him as an unfortunate bug which had fallen into his drink. That's basically what he was now, thought Jon. Soon, Ollies powerful stomach would digest him like anything else. He would become part of his cousin's daily nutrients, never to be seen again by his family. <br>\r\n\u00a0 <br>\r\nOutside, Ollie and Jasmine decide to grab a plate and start eating.

He never realizes what was happening inside his stomach.<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nJon is having a hard time breathing in the crushing heat of his cousins stomach. Everytime he inhales, he gets a whiff of the horrible smell of vomit that's all around him. His throat also becomes itchy, probibly as a result of inhaling small droplets of acids and enzymes. he suddenly hears a new sound. A horrible grinding, then a squelching mush sound. He realizes terrified that Ollie is now eating. At that moment, a huge amount of mush is dumped from the hole at the top of the stomach and splashes into the mush, covering Jon. Jon resurfaces, only to see another huge amount of chewed food enter the stomach. He was going to be burried under it. Ollies stomach began to churn violently in response to Ollie's meal. It released a flood of stomach acid and enzymes to digest the food. Jon was tossed around and pulled under the mush. He was being churned with the contents. He became disoriented, not knowing which way he was facing. Horribly powerful acids were also being mixed around which started to dissolve the food into a liquid. Jon wasn't going to be spared the treatment. His whole body began to itch, then tingle, then burn. Finally it felt like his skin was being pressed against white hot iron. He couldn't take it and passed out from the pain, his final thoughts being of his family and how he was going to be digested by his own cousin. Jon's body was fully dissolved after only a few minutes, and became a pasty liquid. It was sucked into Ollie's intestines with the rest of the food, and was further digested. Finally, Jon was absorbed completely into his cousin's body. <br>\r\n\u00a0 <br>\r\nOutside, the cookout was coming to an end, and Ollie had all but forgotten about his meal that day. Eventlually, people would be called in to search for Jon, but they would find nothing. Ollie would be saddened by the disappearence of his cousin. As he finished up in the bathroom a few days later, he'd look at himself in the mirror, never knowing his cousin was now a permanent part of his own body.</span></div></div>",

It looks another woman is Aunt Jane, the person who gave Megan the ring the transformed them.

Isabel was 10 years old, right around the kids age and they got along great.  Isabelle had brown hair down past her shoulders and blue eyes.  She wore a pink and white striped dress and normally stood about the same height as the kids at less that 5 feet tall but now was a true giantess.  Her bare feet scrunched the glass with her poorly painted pink toenails.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I'll wait her auntie,\" she said.  As Aunt Jane and Sandra went back inside, the kids were left in the grass near their massive cousin.  As if she wasn't enough, Isabel's older sister, Lauren came over to talk with her.  Lauren was 14 years old and normally about 5'4.  She had long blonde hair and wore a white t-shirt with short blue jean shorts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis, what're you doing out here?\" Lauren asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just waiting for the cousins, Aunt Sandy said they'd be around here,\" Isabel said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the kids realized it was probably best to get one of the giantess's attention.  \"Ok, here's the deal,\" Jon said.  \"We'll have a better chance of getting their attention if we split up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's stupid,\" said Megan.  \"We could get crushed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could get crushed anyway,\" replied Mike.  \"If we do this at least we have a better chance.  I need you two to try to get Isabel.  It'll be easier since her feet are right here.  I'll try to get to Lauren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Mikey, Blake responded.

To the sister's amazement, the ring began to shake and flew out of Laura's hand into the grass near them.  In it's place were two, hundred dollar bills.  The sister's looked at each other with jaws agape.  \"Holy shit,\" whispered Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel picked up the ring off the ground.  \"I think we're keeping this,\" she said with a smile.  \"I can't believe mom gave it away.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked at her with a cocky grin.  \"Ya know, we should play a joke on mom to get back to her.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding and smiling in agreement, Isabel seemed intrigued.  \"What do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Isabel knew her mom and Aunt Sandy always hated bugs, which gave them a few ideas.

Isabel imagined herself as that little bug on her sisters toe. So small and insignificant. Just a speck compared to her giant sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Isabel didnt know was that the bug she was looking at was no bug... but her cousin Jon trying to get her attention. Jon jumped, screamed and waved but Isabel seemed to have something on her mind distracting her from really paying attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damnit Isabel you dumb moron! Its me!! Help me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo luck. They were far to big to hear your pleas. Jon was left with no other option but to try and climb Laura and get inside her ear. He walks up her sandaled foot and grabs the cuff of her ripped faded blue jeans then begins to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moment's of thinking about it, Isabel decides it would be fun to shrink and mess with her giant family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I guess that would be pretty sweet.\", Isabel giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry Izzy. I wont let anything happen to you. Man, I wish Meg, Jon and Blake were here. They would have the best ideas with what to do with this thing. Come on, lets go behind the shed so no one see's us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura placed the ring in her pocket just as it flashed, teleporting Meg and Blake on Laura's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\", Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its Laura! She wished we were here and now were on her foot. I think i see Jon climbing up her leg. Come on lets catch up to him.\", said Meg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura grabs her sisters hand and walks with her behind the shed as Meg and Blake managed to yell at Jon and get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys! You made it!\", Jon yelled in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ofcourse we did. We're the best survivors in the world! Now lets climb our cousin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny trio reach Laura's knee as she begins to speak to Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. You ready?\", she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Do it.\", Isabel responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looks down at the ring and speaks to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Isabel would shrink down to the size of an ant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring flashes and Isabel is reduced to bug size. It takes a moment for the sisters to regain their sight but once they do Laura looks down in the grass, searching for her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izzy? Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura kneels down and pushes blades of grass aside. Unknowingly allowing her tiny cousins to walk along her thigh toward her midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura spots Isabel and places her hand on the ground allowing her to climb on. Laura then raises her hand up to her green eyes and awes in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god. Isabel your so cute! Like a little doll. What do I look like like? Like a skyscraper or something? What does my skin feel like? Can you see any ingown hairs or something? Sorry im rambling. You okay?\", asks Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah im fine! This is sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cant hear you. Hold on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura raises Isabel up to her ear. She leans over the edge of Lauras hand and yells into her sisters cavernous like ear canal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm okay! Lets do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Just one more thing.\", said Laura. \"I wish Isabel was indestructible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash emits from the ring and Isabel still feels normal. Laura pinches Isabel and askes if that hurt. Isabel says no, so Laura says shes gonna drop her and if she dies then she will just wish her back to life. Laura flips her hand over and Isabel smashes into the ground  completely unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Alright little sis lets go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura scoops up her sister and curls her fingers to keep her hidden, then she walks out and scans her family members for targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Im covered in your sticky ear wax! I cant move! Please Emma!\", she pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Im not saying I believe you... but what do you even want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont know! Stick your finger in here or... shake your head just do something!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cant believe Im going along with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking another look around to make sure nobody was watching, Emma began to quickly shake her head side to side, putting her breast length into a frenzy as it slapped her face with every turn. Eventually, Emma ceased due to her unyielding feeling of foolishness. She blew the hair away from her face and rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You happy now?\",she asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel <b>was</b> happy. The shaking had pulled her loose from the ear wax, she could now move freely again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it! Thank you so so much! Hang on a sec Im coming out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel quickly began running back towards the light at the end of the tunnel, exiting the ear canal and standing in the fold of the ear. Her full view of the outside world was blocked due to Emma's hair, but Isabel was just excited to be breathing fresh air again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick me up! Im just outside your ear! Hold your finger out and Ill jump on okay?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma couldnt fathom what was happening. She could actually feel something move inside her head when Isabel was running down her ear canal. Could it be possible that her little cousin really was shrunken down? Without a word, Emma shakily brushed her hair behind her ear and held her finger out. Her stomach dropped when she felt the tiniest little sensation move from her ear to the tip of her finger. Her eyes widened in shock... ever so slowly she brought her hand to the front of her face and found herself staring into the tiny face of her tiny cousin standing on the tip of her finger. Isabel stared into Emma's gigantic grey eyes above her, opting to break the silence herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cuz!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith them currently far away from the chatter of their relatives,Emma could hear Isabel faintly, but clear enough to understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... what... the... fuck...\", Emma replied. \"This cant be real. Lauren really shrunk you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Why would you go inside my ear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you already. To prank you. Got you pretty good huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Um, you're the one covered in ear wax.\", Emma snickered, alleviating some of the pressure she was feeling. \"This is insane. Your so small I could do anything with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, it grew into a tickling sensation, and Emma soon felt the urge to sneeze.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel screamed as there was a tremendous inhale.  Screaming for her life, Isabel had been nearly swallowed up by her cousins nostril.

She didn't want to kill Isabel after all...at least not right now, not like that. Casually, she unzipped, hooked her thumbs in the beltloops and tugged the tight denim away from her butt. It wasn't her most prominent feature, but she made sure to keep it well toned and round, a feature her shorts downplayed slightly for the family party. Now, standing in just her mint green boyshorts, she dangled Isabel behind her and gave her a good look at the perfectly toned cheeks, clenching a few times for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched out her finger and drew Isabel toward her buttcrack and Isabel screamed bloody murder, but just before she made contact with the cotton, Emma stopped. \"Just kidding, Iz.

Emma, please! Don't do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it couldn't have been more in vain. Emma plunged her cousin deep between her cheeks, not stopping until she was pressed just below her hole. Isabel had exactly two moments to take in the horrid warmth, the scent of filth that soap could never fully hide at this size and the patterned wrinkles of the source of her cousin's itch. Then Emma began to scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her finger circularly at first, tracing the edges with her little cousin, dragging her across every little ridge and crevice before moving deeper, scratching vertically. She was gentle at first, pressing Isabel against the opening, but not with force to penetrate. Isabel shrieked and screamed. She leaned back into Emma's finger, trying desperately to stay attached as every bump along the way threatened to dislodge her, every wrinkle threatened to gran her ankle and claim the tiny girl as its own. All the while, she was coming more and more loose. Emma was relishing this moment, bent over the sink and grinning to herself. \"That's a good start, cuz. But you're really gonna have to go for it to scratch this itch. It's okay, you can't hurt me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to scratch harder, alternating between circling, vertical movements and periodically pressing into the tip of her finger just barely entered her.  She bit her lip, enjoying this for far more than the torment she was inflicting, more than she was expecting. The plan had only been to go this far, but maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Isabel's legs were now swinging freely, trailing behind whichever direction Emma scratched and pulling the rest of her with them more and more. \"No!

She was probably barely visible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was not worried about her little sister.  She had wished to make her invincible, besides if anything happened she could just wish her back using the ring.  However, Isabel's situation gave Lauren a sinister idea to teach Emma a lesson in karma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're not gonna know why this is funny and ironic,\" Lauren said ominously to Emma.  \"But I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma did not even have a chance to ask what was going on.  She could only scream in horror as her tiny body was brought up to Lauren's right nostril.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Lauren!  Please don't do this!\" she screamed, with tears streaming down her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren just laughed as she underrated her tiny cousin into her nose, where the snot held the tiny girl firmly in place.  \"I'm gonna go socialize,\" Lauren said with a laugh.  \"Don't go anywhere.\"  Lauren proceeded to walk over to her mom, Jane, and her aunt Sandra and have a nice conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Emma was not having as nice of a time.  She was being held in place by her cousins snot and was on the verge of throwing up.  She was still very confused at the situation and was not crying heavily.  What she did not realize, was that her crying and sniffling had freed her own tiny prisoner from her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel screamed as she fell out of her older cousins nose.  After crash landing on Emma's knee, she soon realized something was wrong.  She was not surrounded by the outside views of her backyard.  Instead she was in some disgusting, slimy alien world.  Looking up at Emma, she was shocked to see Emma in a situation much similar to that of Isabel's previously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf soon dawned on Isabel that Emma must be in someone else's nose.  She soon realized just how tiny she was.  If Emma had been shrunken to the size of a big, then Isabel was a bug to a bug.  She probably could not even be seen by the naked eye.  Isabel knew the only way out of this would be for Lauren to fix her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat however would not happen.  Lauren took (to her) a minor inhale.  To Emma, it was a gust of wind that caused her to scream and nothing else.  To Isabel, it was a hurricane force that sucked the speck sized girl deep up the nasal passageways of her sister.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's perspective do you follow next?</span></div></div>",

She still did not know what happened or how Lauren had shrunk her.  Moreover, she couldn't understand why Lauren had decided to stick her between her sweaty, smelly toes.  Of course, to anyone else, it was obvious that Lauren was tired of being teased and picked on, but Emma failed to realize the rationality behind Lauren's actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more confused was Lauren's younger sister Isabel.  She was still trapped deep within the confines of Emma's nose, and had no idea of the recent events that had just transpired.  She was exhausted from screaming for help and just waiting it out now.  She knew that she was safe as she was being held in place by her cousins mucus.  She did however, pick up on a strong smell that resembled the smell of feet.  She had no idea why though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren began walking back towards the patio.  Emma was screaming as she was terrified she would fly off the foot and be launched elsewhere in the yard.  Lauren passed by and nearly crushed her shrunken cousins, as Ben, Mike, and Megan were still wandering the yard.  Slipping the magic ring back into her finger, Lauren took a seat right next to her Aunt Sandra and her mother, Jane.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe talked with them for several minutes.  Lauren was sitting in the chair with her legs stretched out in front of her.  As she was checking her phone, she heard her aunt Sandra gasp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren, don't panic, but there's a weird bug on your foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smiled as she remember how much her aunt hated bugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom looked at it too.  \"Ewww that's disgusting,\" she said.  \"It looks like it's trapped between your toes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was trying to think of what to say, she was worried her aunt and mom would find out she shrunk her bitchy older cousin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do Sandra and Jane decide to do?</span></div></div>",

Wait sweetie whats wrong?... what was that about?, Sandra asked Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont know. I better go check on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah okay.\", said Sandra as she flicked the corpse of her niece out from her fingers, sending her soaring into the yard. Her body collided into a blade of grass which softened her landing as she slid down its stalk and landed in the dirt on her back. Meanwhile, inside Emma's nose, Isabel had been ripped free of the snot due to the impact and due to Emma's head turned to the side, was now laying on the opposite wall she had been stuck to. Isabel groggily stood up and looked down to the nasal passageway towards the nostril, where she saw the forest of green grass just outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was completely oblivious to the entire situation that had just transpired. Snot had muffled her hearing enough that she didn't hear Emma's pleas for help. All she could put together was Emma had been thrashing around, then must have tripped over something because the next thing she knew, an impact had rocked Emma's head hard enough to set her free. But now she was still. Isabel worried for Emma's well being. As bitchy as she could be she was still family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope shes okay. Did she get knocked out? I need to get out of here and check on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teeny Isabel walked along the nasal floor towards the massive oval shaped exit until she stood on the edge of the nostril. Looking down she deduced Emma must have turned her head because below her was nothing but dirt and far ahead she could only see Emma's shoulder and arm... which wasn't moving in the slightest. Come to think of it, Isabel couldn't feel Emma's breath anymore. Fearing the worst, Isabel's eyes began to swell. She refused to believe it though, she had to get out of here and get Emma to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel ran to the end of the nostril closest to the tip of Emma's nose and began to scale along the edge until she climbed out of the nostril and now stood on top of the side of it. Isabel stared far ahead further up Emma's face to her dead blue eye. Her heart sunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god... Emma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to step closer, slowly picking up speed as she clambered up the incline of Emma's cheek. When she reached the eye, she stared into the pupil, seeing her reflection staring back at her in the dead pool of blackness. She then turned her head and looked down at Emma's torso, seeing it was crushed and mangled. Isabel dropped to her knees, pressing her face against skin. She held her arms tight against Emma and started to cry. Her cousin was dead all because of a stupid prank!

Her mind was solely on the thought of a magic ring, one capable of changing people's sizes.  What frustrated Emma was that the ring was currently in the possession of  her younger cousin Lauren, someone who didn't seem deserving of such a cool and powerful object.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma smiled, she thought she had formulated a plan to get that ring.  \"So you said Lauren has the ring that will fix you guys?\" she said, faking being worried.  Her giant eyes observed the tiny kids trying to say something, most likely agreeing with her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she doesn't know that Blake, Megan and Jon are shrunk too?\"  Again, the same response from the kids.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then we have to get her to change you guys back,\" she said.  Emma walked out from behind the shed and spottted Lauren texting by a tree.  \"Heyblauren can you come back here for a second?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren froze.  She already had a pretty good idea as to what this was about.  Obviously Emma somehow found out about Isabel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking behind the shed, Emma proceeded to call out Lauren.  \"So funny thing, after you shrunk Isabel,\" she said as Lauren's face went white.  \"After you shrunk Isabel, I found her, as well as a few other people.  Look familiar?\" Emma asked lifting her palm up to Lauren's face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren couldn't believe it.  Within her older cousins manicured hand were her sister Isabel, who she knew would be there, but also it looked like her cousins Blake, Jon and Megan.  \"What happened to you three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they shrunk obviously,\" Emma said in an annoyed tone.  \"How about you make grow them back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren sighed.  It had been fun while it lasted.  \"I wish those 4 were back to normal.\"   Just like that, Isabel, Blake, Jon and Megan returned to their normal sized.  They hugged for a few seconds and talked amongst themselves, though Emma was not really paying attention.  Everything seemed to be back to normal, though Isabel had now lost her invincibility.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma was still focused on getting that ring.  Behind the shed, it was just the six of them, with the rest of the relatives oblivious on the patio.  Emma decided to try to persuade them.  \"So Lauren, why don't you let me hold on to the ring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren paused again.  There was something in her cousins voice that wasn't sitting right with her.  \"Ummmm, it's okay Emma, I'll keep it for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma just gave her a smug smile.  \"Lauren, give me the ring.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren just paused and looked at her 4 younger cousins.  They also seemed to not know what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't give it to me, I'll tell aunt Sandra and aunt Jane what you kids were doing,\" Emma said, knowing the kids would be terrified of getting punished.  \"Imagine the trouble you'll be in,\" she said ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another pause before Isabel said, \"Lauren I don't want to get in trouble for this.

The girls watched as the ring shot off Laura\u2019s hand and appeared to fly across the yard into some bushes.  They also saw their own mother rapidly dwindle down in size, now essentially a 1/4 inch ant on the patio.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go scare her!\u201d Isabel said excitedly, scrunching her toes.

In a matter of seconds, she had shrunken to the size of an ant, and nearly been crushed by her giant daughters.  She watched as her daughters giant feet moved past her.  \u201cLaura!  Izzy!

Dylan, 12,  sat next to them playing a game on his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ok, I think our best plan is to stick together.\" Jon said as the trio approached Isabel's flip flops. Her now titanic toes move slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sounds like the best idea\" Megan replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them walked towards her pink flip flop and begin to climb. Reaching the top they take in the size of her foot. Cautiously touching it, feeling the soft, smooth surface of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Alright, this is gonna be tough.\" Said Jon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, all three began to climb the side of her calf. The conversation between the 3 giants above was loud, and hard to make out what they were saying. At their size, the tiny hairs on her leg were easy to grab a hold of. Giving them an advantage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the top of her knee, the 3 tiny children could get a much better glimpse of their new world, and a much better look at these giants. Their glances followed Isabel's thigh as it disappeared under her white dress. Craning their necks up the followed her body to the underside of her chin as she looked off into the distance. They could only make out Laura's hands as she worked on Isabel's hair. To their right they saw Dylan zoned out on  his game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the trek along Isabel's leg, she makes a small adjustment in her seating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world quaked ever so slightly for the small siblings as Isabel moved. They screamed for her to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake found himself falling and begin to roll down her inner thigh. Landing on the surface of the chair between Isabel's legs. His view changed. He saw the two tan walls stretch under her dress into a pair of white panties. Up above he heard yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Are you ok?!\" screamed Megan. <br>\r\n\"Try to climb back up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake ran towards the wall of flesh and attempted to climb, but it was no use. He couldn't get a good enough grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Keep going forward! We'll meet you at the top of her shirt!\" Megan yelled down to Blake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jon and Megan continued their journey. Blake stared at the giant wall of white that stood before him. Knowing what was behind the wall, he gently touched it. Digging his hand and feet into the fabric, he began to climb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon and Megan's trek went vertical as they began to climb her shirt. Her stomach moved ever so slightly with her breathing. As they approached her chest, they could hear her heartbeat pounding. They made it. Standing of their giant cousin's shoulder, they had a moment to rest as they waited for Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was terrified. He was alone and didn't know what to do as he scaled the crotch of Isabel's underwear. He reached the waistband. Isabel was slightly slouched back in the seat, so Blake saw her stomach would be easier at this steady inline. He continued along her flat stomach, slowly rising and falling with her breathing. The heat became unbearable as he started to sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack up top, as Jon and Megan were waiting they got a better view of Laura. She was wearing a pink skirt and a white shirt. Her eyes focused on her sister's hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon and Megan were caught off guard as Laura's hand landed on Isabel's shoulder. Followed by the loud rumblings of their god like voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kinda hungry Izzy, can I finish this after I eat?\" Asked Laura. <br>\r\n\"Just finish it real quick please!\" Isabel begged.<br>\r\n'Ok, fine but real quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked at the enormous finger the landed in front of her. She was standing between the pointer and middle fingers of Laura, but she couldn't find Jon.She screamed for him as loud as she could, trying to yell above the loud voices the echoed from her cousins. Megan saw Laura's hand slowly begin to move away, followed by a fading scream. She saw Jon screaming as he was pulled away, stuck to Laura's fingertip. Megan screamed for Jon, but he disappeared as Laura went back to doing Isabel's hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon's view quickly changed from Isabel's shoulder to her hair. He was slowly being worked around, as he  was trying to free himself from the giant finger. Then once again his view changed. He was slowly brought up to Laura's face, he screamed for her to notice him, but failed. He saw that he was was approaching her bottom lip. Her mouth slightly open. He made contact with the soft pink flesh. It was the softest thing he had ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura casually rubbed her bottom lip as she pondered about the hairstyle she was going to give Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon and rubbed side to side along Laura's bottom lip. He wouldn't admit it, but it felt wonderful. Then it stopped. He looked out and saw Laura's hand retreating, while he remained stuck on her bottom lip. The front of his body was plastered to her lip. Her mouth was still slightly open. He could see inside. Her tongue would twitch every so often. Her breath washing over him as she concentrated on her assignment. Jon felt the lip quiver, and the wet sound of her mouth. He looked to his right and saw her serpent of a tongue, gently rolling along her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura no!\" was all Jon could get out before it grabbed him and retreated into it's moist cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an out of control slip n' slide. Light was dim as her mouth was still slightly open. Jon was tossed about the soft cavern.  The sounds of her mouth, combined with her breathing was deafening to Jon.She was casually flicking her tongue about her mouth, picking her teeth; just as everyone does. Then the loudest noise he has ever heard consumed his hearing as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done!\" Laura said to Isabel. Laura then darted off towards the table of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon was tossed around one last time, the he descended into a small valley. He was under her tongue. He looked up and saw the titanic serpent falling back down on top of him. His world went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was still standing on Isabel's shoulders. She watched Laura finish Isabel's hair and walk off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have a turn?\" Isabel asked Dylan.<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'm not doing that great anyway.\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel stood up and grabbed the game from Dylan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Megan, this act was treacherous. She lost her footing and was holding onto the fabric of Isabel's shirt. When Isabel was reaching for the game she started to lose her grip. Megan looked down and saw Isabel's outstretched arm, and beneath her was Dylan's lap. Holding on for as long as she could, she eventually slipped. Now in free fall she looked down towards approaching crotch of her unaware cousin.   </span></div></div>",

You know, Sandra, she hates bugs.\u201d Dylan said, making Blake afraid. After a minute, Isabelle nodded, causing Blake to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two giants got up, Megan held on tightly to Dylan. She heard what they were doing, but she had no idea who they had, and there was no way she would be able to stop them. Megan watched helplessly as they approached her mother who was currently relaxing on a lawn chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, can you take care of this creature? It was on her, and we know how much you like killing insects.\u201d Dylan said. Sandra sat up and saw the creature in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEw, of course I can. Give it here.\u201d Sandra said, taking the \u201cbug\u201d and starting to stand up. After a minute though, Megan was able to hear more bad news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back, I need to go to the bathroom. Have fun killing it while I\u2019m gone.\u201d Dylan said, walking away. Megan buried her face in the fabric, upset that one of her siblings was in terrible danger and she wasn\u2019t going to be there for them or able to help them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Megan, determined to help her siblings, turned her attention towards her older cousin Dylan, her attention had been so focused on helping them that she failed to hear what Dylan was going to do.Having fallen down near his lap, she was close to his shirt, the fabric dangling above, she figured she could try and climb it in order to reach Dylan's ear, it was the only way for her to get help to save everyone. Waiting for the fabric to swing back towards Dylan's stomach, she reaches out and pulls herself up and begins to climb. Each footstep her cousin takes shakes her to the core and makes her journey slow until he comes to a stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*ZIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer determination is broken when she hears the sound of a massive zipper being pulled down. Megan turns her heard around to see a massive toilet bowl, her cousin had both his arms down, one hand was holding the zipper of his pants, while the other was digging around inside. She watched in horror as Dylan found exactly what he was looking for as he rolled out his 4 inch penis as it popped free of it's confinements right below her. The large phallic was smooth with small traces of peach fuzz, the tip was tucked inside his might foreskin which hung limply above the toilet. A loud sigh rings out from the heavens above as a massive stream of urine bursts out from his powerful penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely disgusted, Megan resumed her climb towards her cousins ear. The sound of the foul liquid slashing down below, was amplified by the toilet bowl which dug into Megan's psyche. It was hard for her to ignore what was going on below her especially since the air around her was becoming heavy with the smell of her cousin's pee. She begins to cough as microscopic traces of urine start to enter her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't have held it for so long, don't want to end up like last time.\" Dylan whispers to himself. Sometimes he gets so caught up playing with his siblings that he puts off using the restroom and the last time a couple years ago, they were over at their cousins and he accidentally wet his pants. As the stream of urine began to die down, the boy shook the remaining urine from his young penis<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom didn't really give me much time to clean up this morning..\" he mutters to himself as he rips a good amount of toilet paper off and runs it under the nearby sink. Reaching down, he rolls back his foreskin and begins to clean under it. The sensation sends blood pumping to his member as he fondles himself a bit while he wipes it clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, still coughing, was relieved when her cousin's stream died down. She watched as her older cousin began moving around high above her, not able to see what he was doing, as her focus was still on making as much progress towards her goal. Not paying attention to Dylan anymore, she failed to notice when his hands returned back down to his groin. It isn't until a foul smell flooded her nose that her stomach began to contract as she almost vomited. It smelled like the time she had found the expired cottage cheese. On impulse, she released his shirt to grip her stomach as she began to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to scream as she fell, she looked onward as she plummeted directly towards Dylan's hand which was carefully rubbing the moist paper onto his exposed privates. Determination setting back in, she braced herself to land on his hand. Once on his hand, she could easily make it to his ear if she planned it right. Everything was still going smoothly for her, she thought. That was until Dylan finished with the top of his cock and moved his hand to get the underside, leaving his now semi erect cock in her direct path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOO!!\" Megan screamed as she watched his hand move to clean the underside of his shaft, his smooth exposed cock head now below her. With a hard smack, she crashed down onto the hardened purple head of her cousin, body gone limp as she broke numerous bones throughout her body. In her half conscious state, she could sense Dylan's heart beat as it continued to pump blood to his half chubbed penis, the rhythmic pulse eventually lulling her broken body to rest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Dylan gave one final swipe of the damp cotton across the bottom of his member before giving off another massive sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not perfect but at least the smell is gone.\" he thinks. Unaware of his cousins predicament, he released his peeled back foreskin, watching as the wall of flesh slowly rolled back down his pole. Within seconds, his once exposed pride was tucked neatly away. Dylan maneuvered his young cock back in his pants, zipped them up and returned to the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Dylan didn't know, was that his cousin Megan's body had been rolled along the head of his cock as his foreskin returned to it's natural state around it. At least until it finally enveloped her body into it's folds. Inside the damp, dark and incredibly smelly blanket of flesh, Megan managed to survive three days before succumbing to dehydration. During those three days, Dylan would continuously pull back his foreskin to either pleasure himself or to clean himself. Every time, Megan's broken body would be rolled down along with the loose skin where she would sit in delirium inside it's folds until the signal of him being done, would roll her body back up along the smooth shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her body would find it's way free of it's prison, falling onto her cousin's toilet seat, where young Isabel would eventually pulverize her body as she sat down to relieve herself. Megan would stick to Isabel's young butt cheeks for part of the day before falling free into her panties, lost in the swishing sea of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody would ever find Megan's body. Her family reported her missing the night on the 4th of July and eventually held a ceremonial funeral for her, which all of her beautiful cousins would attend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's something no one expected after his huge amount of success with Basketball.  He's 22, extremely tall (6'5\"), lanky but muscular and his feet (slipped neatly into his flipflops) are around a size 14.<br>\r\nOllie places down the six pack of beer he has bought out into the yard (little does he know that doing so almost crushed his favourite cousins).<br>\r\n\"Hey where are the terrible trio?  I bought some stuff with me for them!\" he lowers his voice \"Thought I should by some friendship seeing as how I'm staying for a week.\" He laughs<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.  They were here one minute, next they've gone!  I thought 'Oh they must be off to use the neighbours pool!' forgetting of course about the one we had put in a month ago!  I think I'm losing my mind Ollie!\" she laughs again \"Would you believe that I thought I saw faeries dancing on that weed I just flattened?\"<br>\r\nOllie laughs and Sandra continues, quite clearly showing excitement with a hint of drunkenness.<br>\r\n\"Hey, did you know that Oliver means Elf Army??  That's what your mother told me when she picked your name, it's because of those pointy ears of yours.\"<br>\r\nOllie laughs again.<br>\r\n\"Well, you know what elves do to faeries.\" He smiles, lifts his foot and slams it down.<br>\r\nSandra and Ollie both laugh.  Then Ollie feels three little bugs niping the heal of his foot.  He lifts his foot up allowing his flipflop to make a steep slope to the ball of his foot.  The bugs slide down and just when they hit the ball of his foot he slams it back down.<br>\r\n\"See Aunt Sandra, 3 down!\"<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nJon shakes Megan and Blake in turn, trying to wake one of them up.  Soon they start to stir.  Jon begins to look around when BOOOOM a huge green wall drops behind them.  Megan and Blake jump to their feet!<br>\r\n\"What the hell?  Jon?  Where are we??\"<br>\r\nBlake starts to scream looking up at a huge figure in front of you all.  Your favourite cousin Ollie.  You all stare up for ages at your huge Cousin.  His t-shirt and shorts could hold a factory!  <br>\r\n\"Jon?! O-O-O-Ollie's here he-he-he can help us!\" Blake says as he runs forwards.<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Jon screams as Ollie picks up his foot and slams it down \"See Blake, he could crush you like a- well - like the bug you now are!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not a bug!  Ollie won't stomp me!\"<br>\r\n\"Blake,\" Jon is beginning to run out of patience \"pick up what you would now call a rock... DO IT!  Ok now throw it at his heal.\"<br>\r\nThe kids throw their 'rocks' at Ollie's huge foot - by any measure!  He lifts it up, letting the 'rocks' roll down to the ball of his foot.  As this happens, dirt falls like rain from the base of his flipflop, sounding like a thunderstorm when WHAM!<br>\r\n\"See Blake!  Don't be so stupid!  Let's hide in this box.  I think we can fit through the folds.<br>\r\nThey slowly climb into the six pack box and sit up against a warm beer.<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Jon thinks out aloud \"Ollie will take this inside to put all these bottles into the fridowwwooop!\"<br>\r\nWit that they are picked up by their cousin and listen to the Thwak Thwak of his murderous foot ware as he walks inside.  Ollie places the box down and begins to take the bottles out and put them into the mini-fridge.  And that is where Jon's plan goes wrong.  Blake wriggles out of the box to run for Ollie's feet again, screaming his name. Jon wriggles out after him dashing across the floor. In normal measure Blake would have a 30cm head start on Jon (as Jon took a little longer to wriggle out and Blake is on the school sprint team!).  Suddenly Ollie drops to one knee, separating Jon, from Blake!  Then Jon notices... Where the hell is Megan?  He looks around when he hears shrill screams from above as Megan flys through the air, stuck to the condensation on the bottle!<br>\r\n<i>Who's point of view will you take now?</i></span></div></div>",

Sandra then began to apply pressure and caused Andrews little body to burst between her toes.  \"Oops,\" she giggled.  \"I guess I don't know my own strength.\"   She could tell Ollie was really enjoying watching her crush bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like watching your pretty aunt crush stuff, huh Ollie,\" she teased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie blushed.  \"Well, to be honest, I've always had a bit of a thing for giant woman,\" he said.  \"I know it's weird but, I've always just kinda wanted to know what it's like to be shrunk.  Weird fantasy, right,\" she said nervously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, Sandra just smiled.

He felt both excitement and terror at the potentially stupid thing he was about to do.  But this may be a once in a lifetime opportunity that he could forever be questioning himself about if he passed it up.  \"You know what Aunt Sandra, I'm gonna do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra bit her lip in anticipation.  Though she hated bugs, even she was curious about the idea of having a tiny person in the palm of her hand.  \"Do it sweetie, I'll take care of you,\" she said, her voice quivering with excitement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie took another deep breathe and gripped the ring tightly in his fist before relaxing his hand and displaying it in his open palm.  Sandra's toes scrunched in her excitement.  She paid no attention to the remains of her daughter Megan and the innocent bystander Andrew that were splattered throughout her feet.  Even if someone was small enough to see them they barely even looked human.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, here we go,\" Ollie said with a smile.  \"Ok magic ring,\" he laughed.  \"I wish I was just as small as the bugs Aunt Sandra just crushed, so she can take care of me.\"  Sandra smiled hearing her nephews wish.  The magic ring began to glow and shake in Ollie's hand.  Ollie shut is eyes in fear and anticipation.  Sandra continued to bite her lip and stood up on her tip toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happened.  The ring shot off of Ollie's hand.  Sandra stood there mouth agape, staring in awe at the ground where her tall, athletic nephew had previously stood, and now was occupied by a mere ant.  \"Oh my god,\" Sandra whispered.  The tried to walk slowly towards Ollie's location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie was also looking around with his mouth agape.  The mid-sized bedroom had become a titanic Metropolis to his tiny perspective.  Suddenly he felt the ground shake enough that he fell to his knees.  Turning around, he tried to speak but nothing came out.  He was looking up at his Aunt who began taking steps towards him.  Sandra didn't mean any harm but to her ant sized nephew each step shook the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Sandra crouched down and examined Ollie's tiny body.  \"Wow, you sure are tiny Ollie,\" she whispered, trying to be considerate for his tiny ears.  She could see Ollie jumping up and down as if he was trying to communicate.  Had she not known better, she would've thought he was a bug, she thought to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra planned on picking tiny Ollie up but first she wanted to find the ring.  \"Hang on there sweetie,\" she whispered.  \"I need to find the ring.\"  The floor creaked as Sandra's massive body stretched out to her full height.  She knew she was the ring fly out the open window and proceeded to step over her tiny nephew and glance out of it.  Crap, she thought to herself.  She would have to go outside and search for it.  Sighing, she turned around to pick up little Ollie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ollie was in awe as he stood in his giantess of an Aunt's open palm.  This new world was so vast and exciting to him, it was tough to take it all in at once.  He watched as his aunt pressed her lips together and began to whisper.  \"How do you feel sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie tried to yell up, \"I feel great,\" but realized his voice was so high pitched.  He then gave his aunt a tiny thumbs up and tried to wave his arms to show he was happy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" his Aunt Sandra said with a quite giggle.  \"I could only hear a squeak.  Okay, listen, we need to go outside and find that ring so you can return to normal.  I'm gonna let you ride on my sandal between my toes.  Careful not to get squished, little guy,\" she said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ollie could protest he found himself being lowered onto Sandra's flip flop.  He steadied himself and realized he was between her first two toes.  Her big toe was like the size of a small house compared to him now.  He could even see some of the smeared remains of the two previous \"bugs\" that Aunt Sandra had crushed, though he could not recognize they were human.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aunt Sandra took her first step with a tiny nephew between her toes, Ollie realized the perils of this ordeal.  He had to be careful with each step, or there was a risk that he may end up under Sandra's big toe.  Sandra on the other hand, walked relatively quickly to get outside.  Reaching the back door, Sandra manages to slip out unnoticed.  She walks through the grass to wear she saw the ring land.  Along the way, grass shavings were constantly blowing up in Ollie's face, yet he managed to stay on the sandal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 minutes of searching, Sandra spotted the ring lying in the backyard.  Crouching down to pick it up, she also took the opportunity to check in on her tiny nephew.  \"Doing okay down there?\" she asked.  She could not here what her nephew was saying but assumed it was a yes.  In reality, Ollie was beginning to get nervous and had been yelling \"No,\" but it went unanswered.  He thought it was about time to return to normal size, especially since he noticed that his girlfriend Jasmine had now shown up to the party.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his dismay, his aunt did not hear his request.  \"Okay sounds good sweetie,\" she said.  \"I'm gonna go mingle a bit, just stay with me,\" and proceeded to get up and walk back to the party.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's point of view to you follow now?</span></div></div>",

He leaned up to Sandra's big toe, which was now becoming drenched in sweat.  Ollie was starting to realize that living out his fantasy of being shrunk at the feet of a giantess may have been a bad idea.  Looking across the patio, he could see a pair of feet with black painted toenails resting on a pair of light blue flip flops.  He recognized the person as his girlfriend Jasmine, mainly because of the mountain range tattoo on her left ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is ridiculous,\" Ollie said to himself.  He began to pound on Sandra's big toe to beg her attention, but all this resulted in was Sandra slightly moving her big toe.  Ollie watched as a massive shadow covered the lower half of Sandra's body.  Looking around he saw that Jasmine's feet were now much closer.  Ollie figured that Sandra was having a conversation with his parents as well as Jasmine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into his pocket, Ollie pulled out his cell phone.  He scrolled through and pulled up Sandra's phone number.  If he couldn't talk to her, at least he could text her.  Ollie paused for a second while debating what to send his giantess of an aunt.  'Hey Sandra, can you make me normal sized now?  I want to spend some time with Jasmine....and you're toes are getting really sweaty.' he typed out.  From far above he heard a loud ping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra looked down for a second while visiting with Ollie's girlfriend and parents.  \"I'll be right back,\" she said.  \"I gotta take this.\"  Walking away from the family gathering on the patio, she saw her younger nieces Laura and Isabelle playing in the grass and waved.  Pulling out her phone Sandra glanced at the phone and smiled, then looked down at her foot.  Lowering two fingers, she lifted the tiny Ollie up to her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're no fun,\" she playfully told Ollie.  She could hear Ollie saying something but could not hear what it was.  \"Relax sweetie, I'll change you back next time I go inside, I just can't do it out here in front of anyone.\"  She lifted him up to her lips and gave him a playful kiss then lowered him back onto her sandal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ollie was frustrated not to be back at normal size and back at his aunt's toes, he knew she was right and did not want everyone else to know about it.  He laid back against Sandra's big toe and realized his back was covered in sweat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sandra walked back towards Jasmine to wrap up their conversation, she could feel Ollie tickling her toes.  Jasmine looked at Sandra curiously.  \"Hey, do you know where Ollie is?  I know he was supposed to be here by now,\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra grinned.  Part of her really wanted to tell Jasmine that her boyfriend was down by her feet, but now was not the time.  \"Yeah he should be here soon, I had him run an errand,\" she replied, not exactly lying.  \"Speaking of which, I'll be right back,\" Sandra said.  She proceeded to do what....</span></div></div>",

Along the way she stopped and said hi to her niece Isabel, who had come inside to use the bathroom.  \"Enjoying the party, Isabel,\" Sandra asked, casually stopping to chat.  Isabel was only a 10-year-old girl but now stood like a goddess compared to her tiny cousin on her aunt's foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I'm just going back outside,\" she responded in a cheery voice.  Ollie was growing impatient, the longer Sandra waited, the longer he was stuck at the size of a bug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, c'mon,\" he said to himself.  He thought about texting her to hurry up but did not want to annoy the giantess.  He had to admit, she was intimidating when she was this big.  Luckily for him, that was the end of the conversation and Sandra walked into her bedroom and shut the door.  Ollie looked up as he saw her massive fingers reaching down to lift him up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing her bug sized nephew up to her face, Sandra smiled.  \"Had enough for now,\" she laughed.  She assumed Ollie yelled yes but could not hear him.  \"Okay hang on dear,\" she said and lowered him back onto the floor while taking a step back.  \"Magic ring, I wish my nephew Ollie was normal sized again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring began to slow and started to vibrate in Sandra's hand.  Expecting it to fly off again, Sandra made a fist to keep it in place.  Ollie felt like his stomach was in his throat as he was quickly restored to normal size.  The change was so rapid he nearly vomited and was left gasping for breathe.  He was covered in sweat and general debris from the lawn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you smell like my feet,\" Sandra said sarcastically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie shot her an annoyed look.  \"No thanks to you,\" he muttered.  \"I'm gonna have to shower before I go down to the party.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you at least enjoy it a little bit,\" Sandra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie paused for a second to think.  In hindsight, it wasn't that bad, he just wished he had more control of the situation.  \"Apart from the smell of your feet and your fast walking it wasn't too bad I guess,\" he responded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" Sandra said.  She did feel a little bad for her nephew, particularly now that his clothes were ruined and he was drenched in her foot sweat.  Then an idea struck her.  \"Tell you what, after your shower and we mingle a little bit downstairs, I'll make it up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie cocked an eye at her.  \"Oh yeah, how so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled.  \"Your choice.  I'll either shrink down to the size you were so I can go through it too, or I'll shrink both you and your girlfriend down so you can be tiny together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth options sounded intriguing to Ollie.

If Sandra could go all power hungry and mess with him at such a vulnerable time, why couldn't he do the same to her.  After all, she did say she owed him one.  Ollie threw on a pair of clean clothes and headed downstairs to socialize.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of visiting with his family and introducing several of them to his girlfriend, Ollie made his way over to Sandra.  \"Hey you look taller,\" she joked.  \"Any ideas on what you wanna do with this?\" Sandra said showing Ollie the ring in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got something in mind,\" Ollie said slyly.  \"Come on, let's go upstairs.\"  Ollie and Sandra then proceeded to make their way back into the house without trying to attract too much attention.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way into the bedroom, Sandra handed Ollie the ring.  \"Just make sure you close your hand so it doesn't fly off,\" Sandra instructed her nephew.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to use it,\" Ollie laughed.  \"I shrunk myself, remember?\"  Sandra stood up tall and waited for her nephew to make his wish.  She still was not completely sure who's size would change.  Even though she told him she was willing to shrink, she really didn't want to.  Deep down, she wanted him to shrink himself and his girlfriend for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok magic ring,\" Ollie said sarcastically.  \"I wish that my Aunt Sandra was the same size that she made me.\"  Sandra cursed under her breathe as she felt her stomach fly up into her throat.  Her world then became a blur as she was reduced to the size of an ant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD,\" Ollie boomed, as he knelt down and lifted his tiny aunt between his fingers.  \"YOU'RE SO SMALL, SANDRA,\" he said examining her tiny body.  Sandra could not believe how huge everything else looked.  She did not blame her nephew for being frustrated, everything was intimidating at this size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra felt uneasy at the look in her nephew's eye.  Ollie began to lower her down to his sandal.  \"Well Auntie, I think I'll let you experience a giant's feet, since I had to.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra started yelling up to him, begging him not to do this.  She had lost her nerve and already wanted to be back at normal size.  Realizing Ollie could not hear her at this size, as he had stood back up, she decided to try to text him.  Checking her pockets, she panicked.  Sandra realized that she had put her phone on her dresser when she entered her room.  \"God dammit,\" she yelled to herself.  She now had no way to communicate with Ollie.  She was stuck like this until he decided to grow her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie re-entered the patio area outside at the party.  Every step was terrifying for Sandra, as she tried to hold on to her nephew's toes for support.  She felt horrible for putting her nephew through what she was now experiencing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie was walking in the backyard when his sandal caught on a rock.  He paid little attention but the quick motion caused Sandra to fly off his sandal.  \"Ahhhhhhh,\" Sandra screamed as she tumbled off Ollie's foot into the yard.  She looked up in sheer terror as her giant nephew continued walking.  \"No, Ollie, wait!\" she cried.  Looking around, she tried to get a bearing on her surroundings.

Insects she normally would\u2019ve crushed underfoot would now be dangerous predators to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started to walk aimlessly, towards the massive structure that was her patio and house, a terrifying buzzing sound began to approach Sandra.

Something sounded incredibly exciting about being shrunken with his beautiful girlfriend Jasmine.  Ollie smiled, deciding that's what he wanted to do.  Putting on a clean pair of clothes his aunt had given him, he exited the bathroom and went downstairs to visit with the other people at the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his rounds throughout the party, he spotted Sandra and his girlfriend, Jasmine, talking.  Jasmine was the first person to see him.  \"Hey you,\" she said in a cheerful voice.  \"Where have you been?\" she asked after giving him a kiss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra gave Ollie a playful wink.  Ollie had an uneasy feeling in his stomach as he turned his attention back to his girlfriend.  \"Well Aunt Sandra sent me on a little adventure,\" he responded, technically not lying.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra wanted an opportunity to talk to Ollie alone.  \"Jasmine would you excuse us for a second?  I need to talk to Ollie alone,\" she said.  Ollie gulped.  He was nervous what his power hungry aunt had in mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Jasmine said with a casual shrug.  She leaned in and gave Ollie a quick kiss.  \"Come meet me in the basement,\" she said with a seductive whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie turned around to see Sandra smiling at him.  \"What's going on in my basement?\" Sandra laughed.  Slightly embarrassed, Ollie just rolled his eyes.  \"Anyway,\" Sandra said changing the subject, \"what did you have in mind with our little toy, here,\" she said showing the ring in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie had it all planned out in his head.  \"After I go inside, shrink both of us,\" Ollie said.  He proceeded to walk away and leave Sandra in the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of leaving Jasmine and Ollie alone in her basement and visiting with other family members, Sandra made her way towards the basement.  Poking her head out from around a corner, she could see Ollie and Jasmine making out on the couch.  Clutching the ring tightly in her hand, Sandra made the wish.  \"I wish that Ollie and Jasmine were shrunken to the size of those bugs from earlier,\" she said.  The ring started to glow and attempted to fly off her hand but she managed to hang on.  Looking up, she could see that Ollie and Jasmine were no longer on the couch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around to the other side, she could see what looked like two small insects on the floor.  \"Hello?\" she acted.  On the floor, Jasmine was in absolute hysteria while Ollie was taking in the sights.  From Sandra's perspective, it looked like one bug was trying to comfort the other, probably Ollie comforting Jasmine.  \"Well those are two weird looking bugs,\" she said and proceeded to kneel down.  She could see the two \"bugs\" moving back and fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ollie was yelling and waving his arms, pretending to try to get his aunt's attention, Jasmine was screaming in terror.  Ollie had not told her about his plan and she was not in on it.  She looked up in horror as Ollie was scooped up in his giant aunt's hand, a hand that then made it's way towards her.    </span></div></div>",

Her ant-sized body was lifted in front of Sandra gigantic right eye.  Sandra had promised Ollie she would make it up to him for shrinking him and putting him through hell on her feet.  Now for some reason, he wanted her to shrink him and his girlfriend.  Sandra did feel a little bit flattered, and she decided to embrace her role.  If Ollie wanted a gigantic woman to play with him and his girlfriend, she was more than happy to be that woman.  \"You two sure are some weird looking ants,\" she said with a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine continued to freak out.  \"Oh my god!

She walked back into her house to use the bathroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Sandra did not want Ollie and Jasmine to witness her in the bathroom.  She may not have had any problems with the rubbing against her nipple, but she just had a feeling this would be a particularly embarrassing bathroom experience if anyone saw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie continued to hold Jasmine and was slowly calming her down when light filled their prison.  \"What the hell,\" Ollie said as Sandra's giant fingers lifted him and Jasmine into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you little bugs,\" she said, placing them on her dresser.  \"I'm gonna run to the bathroom, don't you go anywhere,\" she says.

She left the top off so they could get air but the walls were too tall for them to escape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra then rushed down the hall and to the bathroom, where she anticipated being for a while.

She absolutely loved the feeling of power she had over her tiny nephew and his girlfriend, all made better by the fact that she knew she could wish them back to normal and there would be no permanent consequences.  Wanting to put on even more of a show for her two \"victims\" Sandra opened her mouth wide and extended her tongue as far as it could possibly go, and let out a loud \"AHHHHHH\" as if she was getting her throat checked at a doctor's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Ollie and Jasmine, the two were having completely different reactions.  Ollie was having a great time pretending to be terrified.  His giantess fantasies had come to life thanks to his aunt, and knowing that he could keep in touch with her through text to make sure nothing bad happened was extremely reassuring.  For Jasmine, who was not in on the joke, this was a living nightmare.  Somehow, she had been reduced to the size of an ant, and now her boyfriend's giant, psychotic aunt was about to eat them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gotta get the fuck out of here!\" Jasmine screamed and leapt to her feet, though she knew there was absolutely nowhere to go.  Just as Ollie hopped up to his feet in an attempt to calm her down, Sandra tilted her hand, causing both of the tiny lovebirds to fall and let on her wet, pink tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisoriented, it took Ollie a minute to realize where exactly he was.  \"Wait, where are....\" he mumbled before he heard Jasmine emit a piercing scream.  Sandra's giant tongue was moving, and it was retracting back into her mouth.....with them on it.  Jasmine was hysterical, screaming and begging for the giantess to spare them or recognize them.  Ollie was doing his best to act nervous, but when Jasmine wasn't looking texted Sandra to make sure everything was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping his arms around Jasmine to console her, Ollie began to kiss her neck to try and calm her down.  \"Relax babe, I won't let anything happen to you,\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attempts at romance were thwarted though, as Jasmine was having none of this.  \"Are you serious?  You want to make out and have sex now?!  At the size of ants?!  In your aunt's mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie paused not knowing what to say.  \"Well, if we're gonna get eaten, we might as well enjoy our time together,\" he said, trying and failing to remedy the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it, I'm gonna focus on escaping,\" Jasmine screamed and started banging on the inside of Sandra's teeth.  Sandra let out a slight giggle as this tickled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed that his girlfriend was not in the mood to have sex on his giant aunt's tongue, Ollie texted Sandra when Jasmine was not looking.  \"Hey Auntie, change of plans.

Looking around though, it became apparent that Jasmine was not underneath the couch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Sandra said nervously.  \"Jasmine?\" Sandra said in a concerned voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie picked up on this too.  \"What's wrong?\" he asked cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra looked down at her tiny nephew with a pit in her stomach.  \"Okay don't panic,\" she started.  \"But Jasmine is not underneath the couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear her bug-sized nephew freaking out and screaming.

Sure, there were plenty of giant relatives who may have been able to help them, but these relatives did not have Ollie or the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jasmine's eyes locked on to the class door, as she saw Sandra standing on the inside then walking away.  \"She's inside, we need to get to the door,\" she told the two younger boys, as they walked out from the safety of the bush.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio carefully walked alongside the house, reducing their chances of getting stepped on, or mistaken for a bug.  The three tinies continued to approach the door, yet realized an issue.  They were far too small to get inside.  \"Well I guess we're just waiting till someone goes in,\" said Jon, as the three just decided to wait by the door until someone went in so they could follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house, Sandra was trying to calm her shrunken nephew Ollie.  She had placed his big sized body right next to her ear.  Ollie was using his aunts blonde hair to stay in place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay sweetie, we'll find her, I promise,\" Sandra told him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllienjust let out a defeated sigh.  He felt hilts since part of this was his idea.  Oh, how this prank went wrong.  \"Yeah I guess we can just keep looking,\" he said, not knowing what else to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that moment when Olivia walked down the stairs past Sandra.  \"Auntie Sandra, do you need help with anything?\" she asked, with one foot out the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick lets go,\" Blake said as he, Jon, and Jasmine all entered the house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm just taking care of some stuff in here,\" Sandra said with a smile, watching her niece walk out the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia exited the room but provided enough time for the three shrinkees to successfully enter the family room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's get to your mom,\" Jasmine said, trying to sound confident in front of Blake and Jon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three shrunken victims continued to trek towards the mountainous woman.  She managed to approach her giant bare feet, when suddenly Sandra looked down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scowl was draped across the giant woman's face.  \"UGH!  ARE THOSE BUGS?!\" she said in disgust.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie looked down from her shoulder.  He was suspicious of this, as these tiny bugs did not appear to be running, or even frightened.  \"Hold on a second,\" he said, trying to get a better look at them without falling off the shoulder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get out of here!\" Jasmine screamed, starting to turn away and run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Mom will save us!\" said Blake, insisting they would be okay.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon just stood there in the middle not knowing what to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sandra raised her giant right foot, what happens next? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.

They looked like mere bugs from where he was standing, and if there was one thing that was for sure, it was that his aunt Sandra loved to crush some bugs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Sandra's perspective, this was all good fun.  She was enjoying playing around with her shrunken nephew, and the thought of his girlfriend disappearing was no longer in her mind.  Surely they would find her sooner or later.  Right now, Sandra was enjoying herself all too much.  Sandra didn't realize that the \"bug\" she had just crushed was in fact her youngest child, Blake.  Sure, she had the power to bring him back to life, but that would require her to realize it was him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra scraped her beautiful bare foot against the floor, wiping off most of Blake's remains.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jasmine was doing her best to lead Jon to safety.  Jasmine was in a bad way, shaken up and having a panic attack.  This situation was still so confusing to her.  She knew that she could not stop running.  If she did, it would surely mean death for the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Ollie?  Should I step on them?\" Sandra asked, glancing over at her tiny nephew.  The movement of her head nearly knocked Ollie off of her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie watched in anticipation as the two tiny bugs fled.  He was really enjoying watching his aunt exert her will over them.  It was actually starting to arose him a bit.  \"Do it Aunt Sandy!\" Ollie yelled out, finding himself unable to wait for what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra gave an evil smile.  \"You got it,\" she snickered.  Lifting her massive bare foot, Sandra began to hover it over Jasmine and Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon keep running,\" Jasmine screamed, as she realized Jon was falling behind.  As she turned to try to help him, the earth shook before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra brought her giant foot down hard, pinning Jon beneath her big toe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Jasmina screamed, frozen in place.  She could hear Jon's screams underneath the toe, begging for help, or at least, mercy.  It soon came, as Sandra ground her toe into the floor, reducing her oldest son into nothing but a paste.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there was one,\" Sandra said manically, turning her attention to Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine let out a terrified whimper and started to run away purely on instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look at it go, this one's smart,\" Sandra said with a smile.  \"What should I do with this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie was in a daze.  This was all starting to get to be too much for him.  He was fighting to keep his excitement levels in check but could not help but realize the erection growing in his pants.  He was thinking of how awesome it would be to play with Jasmine like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra turned her head to Ollie and says she wants to....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The giantess surrounded her pillowy lips around Ollie\u2019s top half and started to suck on him lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout realizing it, Ollie was becoming more and more ok with the situation.

Suddenly, he realized what they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAIT STOP!\u201d Ollie yelled, panicked. Sandra had her foot just above the trip, frozen. Jasmine fainted at the sight of how close it got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Sandra asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPick up those bugs, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re actually bugs.\u201d Ollie said, calmed down a little, but still pretty panicked. Sandra moved her foot away from the three, making sure not to harm them. She knelt down and carefully picked up each one and set them in the palm of her hand. Though she had an urge to squash them, she had an idea of what Ollie was trying to tell her, though it confused her because she felt there was more than there should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lifted them up, Ollie slid down Sandra\u2019s shoulder and ran onto her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it her?\u201d Sandra asked, leaning in close to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and you\u2019re not going to believe who is with her. Your sons!\u201d Ollie said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra quickly wished that they were all normal sized. Before they explained anything though, Jon took the ring from his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish that Megan was standing next to us, normal sized and completely alive and well.\u201d Jon whispered, causing a bright light to appear. Sandra flinched when she saw her daughter suddenly appear, just waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhg, where am I? What happened?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jasmine woke up, everyone traded their stories on what had happened. Sandra couldn\u2019t believe that she had killed her daughter (Megan was able to remember being crushed but she had no memories between that moment and the one where she woke up alive). She knew it wasn\u2019t entirely her fault though since she had no idea who she was at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine was a bit upset at the joke that was played on her, but since she was alive and unharmed (plus her boyfriend saved her from being crushed earlier), her anger eventually turned into curiosity for the ring. Megan grabbed the ring and looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what are we going to do with it? Should we have some more fun being tiny?\u201d Megan asked. The question caught everyone off guard since she was the one who actually died before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you scared of being crushed? Who knows you may even be devoured and digested!\u201d Jon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree completely, I don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d Sandra said, swiping the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll hold on. Yes I\u2019m a little nervous, I could easily die, and maybe I will, but think about it this way. This ring can give us an adventure, one that few humans have experienced. Besides, as long as one of us stays normal, they can just wish us back alive and safe, just like how you saved me.\u201d Megan said, confident. Without the 100% danger situation, perhaps it could be a bit of fun. As everyone looked at her, they couldn\u2019t argue. They just needed to keep an eye on the ring since it kept wanting to fly away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I did kind of like being small.\u201d Ollie said. Jasmine wrapped her arms around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m with Ollie, I suppose I\u2019m fine with it too.\u201d Jasmine added. Sandra looked at her children. The thought of them being crushed or eaten was terrifying. However, she had no argument she could throw it other than they were just kids, and they wouldn\u2019t listen to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I\u2019m fine with it too. We need to decide how to signal each other though. After all, I almost crushed you.\u201d Sandra said. Ollie smiled though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy, we\u2019ll give everyone a cell phone. You do have extras, do you?\u201d Ollie asked. Sandra nodded, she had a enough for everyone. They had originally been emergency phones for if they went camping, but they would work here as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone had a phone, they needed to decide who who stay normal sized. After a minute, the group voted for\u2026</span></div></div>",

There was different kinds of chips, hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken, and other good food. Though the gang had seen obviously seen food like this before, seeing it at a new size felt different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey how long do you think it would take me to eat this entire burger?\u201d Ollie asked his girlfriend. She simply giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe a few days, if you didn\u2019t get sick from it. Come on, follow me.\u201d Jasmine said, climbing on top of it. Ollie smiled and followed onto the burger with her. The couple sat down on it. \u201cIt feels comfortable. With the right wishes, perhaps everyone can be happy.\u201d Jasmine said, placing her hand on the meat. Ollie put his hand on hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeday my love, but for now, let\u2019s just enjoy ourselves.\u201d Ollie couldn\u2019t help himself and climbed on Jasmine, starting to kiss her. Jasmine wrapped her arms around him and started to kiss him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jon and Blake were exploring a bowl of chili. They had gotten a bit hungry, and the chili was starting to look good. Blake was starting to lean it, smelling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful, you might end up as part of the meal.\u201d Jon warned. He had realized that the power of the ring made them arrogant to their surroundings, though he wasn\u2019t sure how to convince the others of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Let\u2019s just grab a quick taste and get out.\u201d Blake said, starting to climb in. Jon sighed, he was a bit hungry. Jon looked around to see that there weren\u2019t any giants close(even though he knew they could appear any second). The shrunken boy took another sigh and climbed in with his brother to join the feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was basically alone on another part of the table. She was staring at a can of soda, looking at her reflection. Though she wasn\u2019t as afraid of dying as she was before, the though of her mother stepping on her kept playing in her mind. How her foot surrounded her, how she died almost instantly. Though she had a phone with her, she still knew she could very easily die\u2026 to anyone. Her father. Her mother. Her friends. All could end her in a moment. Though, it didn\u2019t entirely scare her. Rather, it interested her a little. She was no longer seeing life as a human, she was seeing it like a bug. Everyday bugs experience this, and now she was able to see their perspective of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan sighed and put her hand on the reflection. She truly had no memory of the afterlife. She didn\u2019t know if that was a good thing or bad thing. One thing she kept thinking though was if she really was going to get killed like a bug again, how would she die, and by who? If she had to choose, she kind of hoped it would be her dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three groups got distracted by their activities, someone was approaching the table, hungry. Everyone was so distracted, they didn\u2019t see who was approaching. Whoever it was though, they were going for\u2026</span></div></div>",

Sandra's massive mouth engulfed a giant bite of burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm.....tasty,\" Sandra said, chewing the burger before sending it down her esophagus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho got snatched up in Sandra's jaws?</span></div></div>",

He looked back over his shoulder to see her glistening lips enveloping a building sized mass of meat and bread.  \u201cPhew lucky we got out of that jaz\u201d he said confidently as he started to get to his feet. \u201cJaz.....?\u201d He scanned around in panic, he was sure she\u2019d been with him, \u201cJaz!!!!\u201d his heart sank at the realisation he was alone \u201cJASMINE!!\u2019\u201d he shouted as he span around on the spot, hoping she\u2019d suddenly just appear, it was only when the loud \u201cmmmmmmmm\u201d emitted from the giant face looming above that he realised the horror of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie could do little more than watch as Sandra happily chewed up her latest mouthful of food, her well defined jawline moved rhythmically to effortlessly pulverise everything inside her giant face. Ollie just hoped by some miracle she would feel his miniature girlfriend amongst her lunch, but the more she chewed, the wetter everything inside sounded and the less chance of her noticing anything moving in her mouthful. He turned back to his surroundings desperate to find his phone in a panic, his attention only returned to his aunt to witness the inevitable action he knew was coming. Ollie watched on in dread as he saw his aunties muscular throat muscles spasm and contract in time with the unmistakable sound of swallowing, marking the end of any hope of Sandra feeling anything untoward in her mouthful. He dropped to his knees as the bulge of food containing his girlfriends tiny body unceremoniously disappeared down his aunties throat and disappear beyond her colossal chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unsettling silence followed and Ollie desperately tried to gather himself  before she took another bite which he would more than likely be an ingredient of. He knew his best course of action was to get Sandra\u2019s attention, she had the ring after all and he would definitely be needing that as he had already concluded Jaz probably hadn\u2019t survived being chewed up and swallowed. He had also suspected his phone and clothes were probably also on their way to his aunties stomach, so he was going to have to get her attention some other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he had much chance to do anything, one of his conclusions was seemingly wrong. Sandra suddenly thumped herself hard on the chest repeatedly with her free hand, making a deep hollow thud with each strike. \u201cStupid burger doesn\u2019t want to go down\u201d she muttered quietly to herself and puffed her cheeks as if trying to let some air out of her gut. Ollie was happy to jump to conclusions and instantly summarised Jaz must be alive and the reason for his aunties discomfort. \u201cHold on baby I\u2019m coming!!\u201d He screamed at his aunties torso and readied himself on the remaining food, waiting to willingly serve his aunties hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra however had other ideas.\u201dugh.. what\u2019s up with this burger\u201d Her reluctant meal was causing so much discomfort she had to put her handful of burger back down on to her plate and reached for her water bottle, whatever this \u2018irritation\u2019 was, it was putting up so much of a fight, it was going to require some extra force to persuade it into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burger slapped hard against the plastic surface of the plate sending Ollies tiny body flying across the glossy white surface. It took him a solid minute to work out what had happened and where he actually was. When he did eventually get to his feet, he found himself looking up at his aunties athletic figure from her lap. This was a much more pleasant angle to see her from and he desperately tried not view his humongous relative as the breathtakingly attractive woman she was, but as the living prison housing his equally as attractive girlfriend. He needed a new plan and fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHang on baby\u201d he shouted toward the inclined bronzing tummy directly in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, now at the size of a bug, naked, nonetheless, he found it incredibly difficult to scale the weird texture that was his aunts skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that Sandra had very little fat to grab on to, and her stomach was covered in a thin layer of sweat, which made gripping it nearly impossible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, Ollie finally reached the belly button of his Aunt Sandra.  \"Jazz?

Everyone seemed preoccupied chatting, eating or just enjoying the sun. She saw her sister typically sprawled out across a sun chair, making sure everyone got a good eyeful if her well toned body, barley covered by her minuscule bikini. Jane scoffed at her siblings muscular frame, she was certainly not in bad shape herself, just didn\u2019t go quite to the extremes Sandra did to maintain her athletic looks. Granted her bum and tummy may not be as firm, but she had a few years on Sandra and she still felt as confident in a bikini as her sister.  \u201cWell at least I got the better sense of humour\u201d she thought to herself as she walked towards the table, eager to prove that fact to her perfect sisters kids at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping just before reaching the well stocked buffet-playground her niece and nephews currently occupied, She brought what was left of her burger and it\u2019s tiny inhabitants back to within range of tiny ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie and jaz\u2019s tiny naked forms held each other for balance as their platform ascended at speed towards the giant womans face. She warmly smiled approvingly at the two miniature figures hug. Jaz, who to Ollies surprise had taken everything shockingly well so far, gave a cheerful, yet nervous smile back to her boyfriends colossal mother. Jane then spoke up with energy and excitement   \u201cok you two, I have an idea for the best prank ever, I may even be able to trick my sister with this one too.\u201d She then motioned deliberate awkwardness with gritted teeth, \u201chowever it does mean you\u2019re  both going to have to um, be my mouth.... for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Ollie or Jaz said anything straight away. Ollie was in disbelief at the words coming out of the very location in question, they had only just escaped a horrific death in mothers jaws, and now she was going to intentionally put you back within its destructive power, she\u2019d literally just lectured them on how horrible being digested would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ollie could respond with the obvious objections, Jaz spoke up curiously  \u201cwill we be safe in there? I mean what if, you know?  Ollies look of incredulity now switched to Jaz, how could she be so casual about this? Was she actually ok with being literally in his mothers body because he definitely  wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of his questions could even be asked, his mothers voice spoke out again \u201ctrust me sweetie, I\u2019m going to keep you two nice and safe under my tongue throughout the whole thing, You both will be fine! Can you imagine everyone\u2019s faces when they think you two have actually been eaten?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie didn\u2019t really have any chance to react from then on, just Jasmines lack of resistance alone was enough for Jane to proceed with her plan and had already continued her journey to the table. Ollie thought maybe Jaz was just trying to impress her potential future mother in law, but something gave him the impression she was actually enjoying this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still focused on her own reflection, she was certainly not seeing the enjoyment in the situation her brothers were, she could hear their happy laughter from somewhere in the chilli bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a dark shadow encroached over the entire table, followed by a familiar sweet voice humming. Megan smiled with relief, she now wanted out of this giant world and her mom had returned to help her. She turned to see a solid wall of bare torso towering over her. Before she could process anything her tiny legs were already in motion towards the safety of her mothers presence. something was wrong with this belly though, its skin was way too pale, and instead of her moms defined muscles, a small tummy pouch extruded over the table slightly. She came to an abrupt stop just millimetres away from the giant figure, she knew it belonged to her auntie and once again she was in the horrifying presence of an unaware giant, so close she could smell her coconut sun cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact Jane clearly had a handful of burger left, she definitely seemed to be eyeing the table for something particular, Megan decided it was time to call mom, before her brothers ended up eaten.

Megan turned and ran as fast as her legs could take her, but the wall of flesh was catching her fast. She could feel the heat coming off Janes body as it started to engulf her world. She dived forwards in a last hope of getting clear. As she hit the hard surface of the table, her phone bounced clear of her hands, she then closed her eyes waiting for the inevitable again. She felt a pressure growing over her legs, then to her surprise stop at her waist. Megan cried with relief, her momentum had stopped just in time. Her aunts stomach had her completely pinned to the table, but she was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon and Blake were having too much fun to notice their colossal relative seductively leaning over their current bowl, grinning to herself like that cat that got the cream.

I bet this chilli does too.. let me just finish this last bite then I can make a start on this\u201d. Jane then taunted the last bite of burger in front of them, so close it actually seemed deliberate. Both boys got a good view of the naked couple sat on top of it, and both instantly reacted by trying to flag down their giant auntie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Jane wasn\u2019t pretending not to see them, it wouldn\u2019t of helped, she couldn\u2019t hear them, all her attention had switched to her meal. She slowly raised her burger remanence to her waiting lips, the lower of which she bit in anticipation, eventually  the glossy gates slowly parted and a pink tongue came out to greet it, she carefully positioned the bite into the middle of it, and cautiously retracted it, engulfing it in one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraumatic as it was for the tiny audience to witness, something about her actions seemed very theatrical, and kind of \u2018sexual\u2019. Jon even looked around to see if Jane was trying to seduce someone across the table.

So the fact that Megan was shrunk felt like an opportunity to her. Diane had swallowed a lot in the past like toys or pieces of clothing and had always teased Megan about it, saying that she could have been on the menu as well. The only reason she never tasted her before was because she was family and at a normal size. However, now that Megan was shrunk, and Diane had a magic ring, it was possible without any problems or consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 this ring can bring people back to life\u2026 right?\u201d Diane asked.

I\u2019ve always wanted to taste a person before.\u201d Diane said, bringing her spoon into her mouth. The two boys screamed as she tossed them around with her tongue before swallowing them. The two boys quickly traveled down into her stomach. Blake looked around to see there was a bit of fabric, the head of a lego man, and some food that wasn\u2019t completely digested yet. The two boys rushed to get onto a safe platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should have known she wanted to eat us. With our new size, we\u2019re perfect for the menu.\u201d Jon said, frustrated with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we were her target though. She only ate us so we couldn\u2019t tell her.\u201d Blake said, pulling out his phone. Though Diane was unaware of the phones, they had short-circuited before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer? You mean mom, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I mean Megan. Remember, Diane used to tease us.

I think it was because for whatever reason, Megan looked extremely delicious to her.\u201d Jon put his face in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, that means she\u2019s probably going after her right now. If she wants to eat her that badly, I can\u2019t imagine the kinds of things Diane might do to prepare her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the outside\u2026</span></div></div>",

It was hard to imagine that her brothers were now inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 are you going to swallow me just like how you ate them?\u201d Megan asked, making Diane laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have dreamed of you in my stomach. I\u2019m not just going to swallow you easily, I want to enjoy this moment. I\u2019m probably going to make you a little bigger so that you\u2019ll fill me up more. I also might tie you up before I get to the real preparations. However, you could go along with this willingly. That would save a bit of trouble. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re at least a little curious as to what it feels like to be eaten. I\u2019ll let you decide right now.\u201d Diane said, licking her lips. Megan thought about her two choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could try to run and struggle, however she probably wouldn\u2019t escape. Diane had the ring so she currently had complete control of the situation. Not even her mother could do anything now. However, Megan could still fight just to make things more interesting for Diane, and the shrunken girl wasn\u2019t that weak(meaning she could put up quite a fight).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, if Megan went along, things would probably be less painful. Diane was correct, Megan did kind of wonder what it would be like to be Diane\u2019s prey. She was going to end up in her belly either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what will it be? Are you going to struggle, or will you let me prepare and eat you?\u201d Diane questioned one more time.</span></div></div>",

She screamed as the light of day disappeared from her view. Gary swallowed, causing his daughter to slide down his throat into his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she landed, she was pretty cold and very wet. She knew she was about to get digested, but she wasn\u2019t afraid. She just couldn\u2019t believe that she was the first to fall victim, again! Especially considering the fact that her mother stepped on her before, and now her father just gulped her down. She was also a 100% sure that it had just been her currently, just like before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is it always me? And why to my parents? Do they just love killing me?\u201d She asked, though she was smart enough to know that both times, her parents were unaware of her. This time especially, since her father had no idea she was even there. Though her eyes hurt from the soda, she laid against the stomach wall. She was either going to get completely digested and then get brought back to life, safe and sound. Or she was going to get teleported out before she died, though she wasn\u2019t sure which one it would be. She just had to be patient.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the outside, Gary\u2019s appearance startled everyone. That had no idea that Megan was now in her stomach, but they were smart enough to try and get away from food as quickly as possible(interestingly enough, both groups were either on or in food at the moment, making the situation a bit dangerous).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie and Jasmine scrambled off of the burger they were on and rushed to the middle of the table. As Blake and Jon struggled to get out of the bowl of chili, their dad had decided that he wanted some, grabbing a small bowl, ready to scoop some out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry! He\u2019s going to grab us!\u201d Blake yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that!\u201d Jon replied frantically. As their dad was scooping some out, the two boys finally climbed out, safe now. They ran to join Ollie and Jasmine. When she saw their clothes, she could tell they had been in the chili. She wanted to yell at them for doing something dangerous, but she really coudn\u2019t considering she and her boyfriend had been on a hamburger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Megan?\u201d Ollie asked, a little worried. None of them knew, however, Jon had a dreadful idea. He watched his dad walk away and drop an empty can of soda in the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think\u2026 our dad\u2026 drank her.\u201d He said, causing everyone to turn to him. \u201cI saw her by a soda can but she didn\u2019t seem like she was trying to climb it so I didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time, but I know that dad had gotten some soda\u2026\u201d He trailed off, leading the others to piece it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with her and getting killed by our parents? Does she enjoy it or something?\u201d Blake asked, though he knew it was probably not entirely her fault. \u201cSoo\u2026 who\u2019s going to make the call to mom?\u201d He asked. Though they knew they could bring Megan back with the ring that Sandra had, it still felt awkward calling and telling her that her daughter and eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Ollie said. He was the adult of this group. Though nobody had said anything, he was most likely considered responsible for everyone.</span></div></div>",

She knew they wanted adventure, but this might be going a bit overboard. However, she didn\u2019t argue and looked to see who might be a good choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person she saw was her father, Max. At first, Sandra considered this a completely horrible idea.

However, he could make their adventure \u201cinteresting\u201d and Sandra did have the ring to revive them when they died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person she saw was Diane. Diane loved to eat, and would eat literally anything, even bugs. However, Sandra didn\u2019t think that Diane hated bugs, not entirely at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sandra looked, she did have another option to consider.

It was Megan calling.  \"Hello sweetie,\" Sandra laughed.  She could hear Megan's voice on the phone, but it was incredibly high pitches and nearly inaudible.  However, Sandra was sure she could make out the words \"food, table, and dad's idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, were gonna put you little bugs by the food,\" Sandra said, closing her hand around her three and sized children, their cousin, and his girlfriend.

Megan ran to Blake and held him. The giant placed their burger on another one that was on a plate and went to sit down on a lawn chair. Blake looked down to see the other burger and some fruit with it. \u201cWhoa, this person must be hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one person that I can think of that gets this hungry.\u201d Megan said, looking at their captor, getting a better look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan and Blake were quickly able to tell that the giantess who had them was none other than their cousin Diane (or Diana as some people called her). Diana was 20 years old with short brown hair. Despite her slender figure, she loved to eat and would eat almost anything. Though Diana sometimes chewed, she loved swallowing things whole and almost never gained weight from it. Megan could even remember times where she was teased about possibly being on the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s her. If she discovers me, she\u2019ll be teasing me left and right before swallowing me.\u201d Megan said quietly. The two of them watched the giantess place a strawberry in her mouth and swallow it whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder, do you think she would be happy to eat us fin she discovered us, even though we\u2019re humans?\u201d Blake asked Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, if she finds us, I guarantee you she will think of us as food more than humans.\u201d Megan said, watching Blake step closer. Before she could react, Diana took a huge bite along with Blake and swallowed, not chewing much. The shrunken girl watched the bulge go down her throat. Diana burped and licked her lips, preparing to take another bite.</span></div></div>",

Now, don\u2019t go anywhere while I set things up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane pulled out some string and set it next to the small girl, making Megan flinch.

Diane stopped for the moment and looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven when I was normal sized, do you see me as a family member or just a piece of meat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest. I see you as both. You are my family and I care about you, but you also look so tasty.\u201d Diane said. There was a bit of silence before Diane spoke up. \u201cDid you know I almost ate you once?\u201d Megan flinched and gave her a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou probably don\u2019t remember this, but when you were five years old, I almost ate you. I was 14 and was very hungry even then. Your family was visiting and I was in my bedroom with a lot of fruit. I guess you saw me and became interested. I was so busy chowing down, I didn\u2019t notice you.\u201d Diane said. Megan was interested as she didn\u2019t remember this at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you picked up an orange at the same time I picked it up. I pulled it into my mouth and swallowed it. I ended up pulling your arms in before I realized you were there. When I did, I immediately pulled you out, startled. At the time, most people thought I was a freak for how much I ate. They didn\u2019t want to be around me. You on the other hand\u2026you were interested. You then handed me an apple and asked me to swallow it in front of you. Heh\u2026you were so amazed when I swallowed it whole. You actually asked me if I could swallow you as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you try to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you no but you kept asking me. I\u2019ll be honest though, your arms tasted so good. If your mother hadn\u2019t walked in at that time, you might have convinced me to try and eat you there. After that, I became interested in the idea and even had a dream about having you for dinner. However, that day wasn\u2019t the just the start of me fantasizing about eating you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? What else did it start?\u201d Megan asked. She was pretty fascinated by the story and was becoming more interested in Diane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the start of a friendship. That may sound cheesy, but you were the first person to really accept me, appetite and all. Because of you, I became more confident and happier. So when ask how do I see you, yes, I see you as a tasty meal, but I also see you as my first friend. I care about you more than anybody else.\u201d Diane gave a soft smile and picked Megan up. The giantess gave her a warm hug, making Megan feel safe. When she put her back down, Megan smiled, forgetting any fear she had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, How what\u2019s the first step in my preparation?\u201d Megan asked.

She wouldn't get far though, as the chubby fingers of Michael wrapped around her tiny body.  Her screaming, flailing form was brought in front of her captor's giant face.  She could feel Michael's eyes studying her.  This whole process sent chills down Jasmine's spine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why cant everything just go back to normal?\" the tiny woman thought to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Michael long to realize who this was.  \"HEY, YOU'RE THAT REALLY HOT GIRL OLLIE IS DATING,\" the titanic 13-year-old boomed.  His voice nearly shattered Jasmine's eardrums.  \"WHAT HAPPENED,\" he asked as he brought the tiny girl up to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Jasmine had managed to explain the whole situation to Michael:  the magic ring, her shrunken companions, everything.  She was hoping he would return her to Sandra and everything would be fixed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, Michael had other plans in mind.  \"SORRY JASMINE, BUT YOU'RE JUST TOO PRETTY.  I'M GONNA KEEP YOU FOR MYSELF,\" the kid thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine was appalled.  She was an elementary school teacher but was in no mood to take crap from this teenager.  \"Hey listen here,\" she demanded.  \"Sandra's gonna return us to normal and you'll be in big trouble then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael didn't seem to care very much about what she had said.  He just looked at her, smiled and shrugged.  \"Well then I guess I'll just have to....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unlike everyone else, she had no choice when she shrunk, and thought the experice was scary enough he first time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll take the ring, I guess,\" she said, as Sandra placed it in the palm of her hand.  \"I wish the five of you would shrink down to the size of bugs,\" Jasmine was, closing her hand around the ring.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bright flash and Jasmine now saw five \"bugs\" on the floor where her boyfriend, his aunt and cousins once stood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Jasmine whispered, as she bent down and collected the shrinkees.  \"You're all so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the five shrunken people, they were staring up in amazement.

Ollie liked giant girls and was currently tiny in the hands of Jasmine who loved him, it was a perfect combination.  Once the giantess disappeared from her view, Sandra looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra had been annoyed at little things, so it was an extremely weird feeling to have been shrunk. The chair that she liked to lay in was now so much larger, she couldn\u2019t even compare it to anything else she had seen. The grass was now up to her pelvis as if it had suddenly overgrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what should we check out?\u201d Megan asked, excitedly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we see if we can find some actual bugs?\u201d Sandra was a little startled by the question. Although she knew the bugs wouldn\u2019t care who she was, the shrunken mother knew it would be weird to confront a bug that was now the same size as her when she had stepped on so many in the past. Sandra started to look up to the sky to think when she saw something that scared her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLOOK OUT!\u201d Sandra yelled, rushing to her kids and started to hold them. A giant shoe suddenly landed next to them, startling everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Blake said, getting out of Sandra\u2019s grasp and started getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful!\u201d His mother said, worried about getting crushed. She looked up and became more scared when she recognized the face. It was her father, Max. She watched him sit down in the chair next to them and get relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father was 58 years old, and loved to be a predator. He liked to hunt animals(though he never went overboard with it) and kill bugs. In fact, Sandra got her hatred of small things from her father. He had no limit to how many bugs he would kill, and he didn\u2019t always kill them in a normal way. Although he liked to crush them under his foot, he sometimes put them inside his shoe to crush or crush them between his toes. He also liked to cook and prepare bugs. Max liked to put them in the microwave or the oven, he also would cut them up or freeze them in juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra remembered a time when she was young. She had just came in after playing outside. Her father spotted a bug that had been on her head. She had watched him grab it and dropped it in his shoe. He had said they needed to learn their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe glad you\u2019re not tiny. I would kill you just like any other bug.\u201d He had told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had realized that it was her father, she immediately grabbed Blake\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Don\u2019t go towards him. Trust me, he\u2019ll kill you in a horrible way.\u201d She said, leaving Blake a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we could probably hide and watch what he does.\u201d Jon said. \u201cThis way, we can observe a giant from a bug\u2019s perspective, but safely.\u201d Despite that plan sounding not too bad, it still left Sandra a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still think we should go find some more bugs.\u201d Megan said.

Sandra was really starting to hate it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat feeling would not subside.  While her children bickered, a haunting shadow overtook Sandra's tiny body.  She and the kids looked up, only to see her giant father, and the kids grandpa, staring down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUH, I THOUGHT I TAUGHT SANDRA BETTER THAN TO HAVE BUGS IN HER YARD,\" Max said, though no one was close enough to hear him.

Sandra could not hide the nervous whimper that escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax walked inside the house and into the kitchen.  He smiled, realizing it was empty and everyone in the family was outside, or so he thought.  He glanced down at his left hand where the four tiny people were located.  Then he lowered down his right hand and plucked up two of the bugs, not knowing they were Megan and Blake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No put them down,\" screamed Sandra, though her calls fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandra will thank me for this,\" Max whispered to himself.

The giant simply smiled and set the timer for 15 seconds. Once he started it, he took the other two and dropped them into a tall clear cup and waited for his snacks to finish.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nSandra knew she should text Jasmine, but the thought of her kids in the microwave left her feeling hopeless. Even though the ring could bring them back, Sandra just felt too depressed to make the decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Jon, he had accidentally dropped his phone when his grandfather picked him up. He hadn\u2019t even thought of his mother\u2019s phone, instead, he wondered what his grandpa was planning for him and his mother.

Blake was really scared that he was about to burn to death, Megan was nervous, but ready to die again. It can be kind of hard to be scared about death when you already died once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both immediately started to get really warm. Without saying a word, they both had they same idea(that probably wouldn\u2019t help much admittedly). They started to take their clothes off and threw them in a pile, hoping to subtract some of the heat. They were too distracted to get embarrassed by the other. Megan and Blake both collapsed pretty quickly though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Megan thought she really was going to die because of the heat, the machine stopped, and she could hear the sound when the microwave gets done. As the shrunken girl stared up, she could see the world moving. She was too weak and exhausted to look around her. Her grandpa\u2019s face came into view, and he had a sharp weapon.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nSandra stared as the plate with her offspring was set on the table. Jon held her, unable to look, but Sandra was unable to look away. Megan and Blake weren\u2019t moving, and there was a burnt pile of ash next to them. Her father sat down with a fork in hand, making sure she had a view of what he was about to do.  Sandra watched as the giant stabbed his fork through Blake and lifted him up to his mouth.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nMegan currently felt defeated as she watched her brother being carried up by the sharp weapon to the giant\u2019s mouth. She was able to tell that the microwave had finished him before he left, so she was glad he wouldn\u2019t have to feel the fork or teeth, unlike her. The giant chewed Blake up and moaned with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">What a taste! I suppose that pathetic bug did have a use after all. I hope the next one tastes even better.</font>\u201d The fork came down again and pierced Megan\u2019s stomach. Though it hurt a little, the microwave had actually made her body a bit numb(not that that was an entirely good thing).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Megan watched as the giant mouth got closer and closer. However, Max had apparently decided to taste test her first, giving her a thorough lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Mm, this one DOES taste better. If my daughter were around, I would let her eat it. Too bad I have to eat this one right now.</font>\u201d Max said, placing her into his mouth. He tossed her naked body around like a piece of candy, before deciding to swallow her whole. Megan didn\u2019t make it that far though as all of the chaos in the mouth caused her to pass out.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nMax swallowed the \u201cbug\u201d down, and gave a burp. He leaned back and patted his belly. Those were some of the best bugs ever, but he had no idea why. He looked at his other two prisoners and smiled.</span></div></div>",

To lose another child in a horrible way, it was unbearable. Jon didn\u2019t struggle in his grandfather\u2019s grip, he saw no point in it. The giant placed his little \u201cbug\u201d in his shirt pocket and got to work on his next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax took out two slices of bread and covered one of them in peanut butter. As he worked, Jon peeked over to see what was happening. His mother had lost all hope and couldn\u2019t bear to look. Jon then saw what kind of sandwich he was making. As Max placed the jelly on the other piece, Jon was a little happy. He knew there was no escape and he was going to get eaten no matter what, so being eaten in his favorite after-school snack wasn\u2019t that bad of a choice to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon suddenly felt himself being lifted up and saw that he was being placed on a cutting board face up. Max had grabbed a sharper knife and raised it over his little prey. Jon couldn\u2019t help but think of this as kind of like a surgery, except this is one that he wouldn\u2019t survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready pathetic insect? I\u2019m going to cut you into tiny pieces and eat you. Don\u2019t worry, this won\u2019t take long.\u201d Max said. Jon watched as the blade came down fast, cutting his arm off. It hurt like crazy, but Jon held his screams back. He then saw the giant grab it and place it on his sandwich. The giant continued to do the same with the rest of his limbs before raising his weapon over Jon\u2019s neck. Jon closed his eyes as it came down and killed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra had been looking away this entire time. She knew that if she looked, it would terrify her. However, she slowly, but eventually, took a look. She immediately regretted her decision. She could see severed pieces on the giant sandwich. Her dad simply smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you want to be a part of my sandwich? I could cover you in your friend\u2019s remains.\u201d Max said, still completely unaware of who she was. Sandra felt like she was about to vomit, though she kept it in. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll eventually get to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax closed up his sandwich and started to eat it. He made sure to enjoy each bite. It was the tastiest sandwich he ever had. As he finished up, Sandra closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear, if Jasmine brings us back, I\u2019m going to give my father the same treatment.\u201d She said quietly. She felt herself being picked up and soon confronted the giant face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the last one. Now what should I do with you?\u201d</span></div></div>",

He pulled out the blender and opened it up. Sandra\u2019s eyes widened as she saw her destination. The tiny girl started to struggle making the giant grin even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow pathetic. Do you really think you can escape my jaws? I am invincible.\u201d He said. The giant dropped Sandra in and searched for fruits to add. As the shrunken woman fell, she cut her arm pretty badly on the blade. She screamed out in pain as blood started to drip. The giant simply hummed as he worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax soon added strawberries, cherries and a banana to the blender. Sandra\u2019s pain worsened as all of the weight pressed against her. As the Titan sealed the blender up, Sandra cried, more than she had ever before. Today was 4th of July, it was supposed to be a happy day. They had planned a barbecue and even invited their family for the fun. But now, her family had been tortured and devoured by her merciless father. He had taken everything away from her just because of her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye stupid insect. Say hello to the others when you see them.\u201d Max said. Sandra closed her eyes just as her father flicked the switch. In an instant, her body was torn apart. As she merged with the drink, the man licked his lips. He couldn\u2019t wait to try this treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it got done, Max opened it up and lifted it up. He wasted no time in devouring the blender\u2019s contents. As the smoothie touched his tongue, Max fell in love. He had never tasted anything so good before. The man drank every last drop, making sure there was no trace left behind. He slapped his belly and belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow delicious. At least I made their pathetic lives useful.\u201d He said to himself, unaware he had just devoured his own daughter.

However, she then noticed the person was holding something in his hand, something small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there. My name is Jasmine, I\u2019m Ollie\u2019s girlfriend. Who are you? And um\u2026 what exactly are you doing?\u201d The person turned on the stove for the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there. My name is Max, I\u2019m Sandra\u2019s father. I taught her everything she needs to know about how to deal with pathetic bugs. I\u2019m actually cooking up a couple right now, did you want to look?\u201d Max said. Jasmine nodded a little confused and stepped forward. She saw the two bugs he was talking about, but leaned in, afraid of a suspicion she had. She suddenly realized her suspicion was correct! Those two bugs he had were Megan and Blake, and they were in water that was heating up! Jasmine quickly turned the stove off and looked at Max(who now looked a bit annoyed).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! Young mustn\u2019t hurt these bugs! Not these two, and not the ones in your hand!\u201d Jasmine pleaded. As Sandra watched this, she was both happy and sad. It was nice that Jasmine was trying to help, but she was sad(not because she wanted to die to her father) because her father wasn\u2019t easily persuaded when it can to bugs. <br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nShe remembered a time when she was young. She was in the backyard, playing with a cricket. Her father had suddenly appeared and captured it, telling her to follow. Her dad had placed it onto a pan and started cooking it on the stove. She tried to tell him to stop and pleaded, even asking for him to eat her instead. Her dad finished cooking it and handed it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to toughen up. Are you truly willing to strip down and get cooked on that pan for dinner just to save a stupid creature? Are you truly ready to get eaten and die in my belly?\u201d Her father asked. At the time, she couldn\u2019t answer. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. You need to get stronger. Here, eat this. Perhaps it will teach you just how pathetic insects are.\u201d Sandra tried to refuse, but her dad basically forced her to eat it.  She felt guilty when it traveled down to her stomach. \u201cYou need to decide which side you\u2019re on. You\u2019re either on my side, or the side that gets pathetically killed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nWhen Sandra saw Jasmine trying to defend them, she had no idea if she could get her father to listen. All she could do was hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to understand, they\u2019re not just bugs!\u201d Jasmine pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you want to take their place? Would you truly want to get cooked in boiling water for these insects?\u201d Max asked, he couldn\u2019t believe she was standing up for them, she reminded him of when Sandra was younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I would! You need to listen to me! Take a closer look, they\u2019re not just bugs! They\u2019re your family!\u201d</span></div></div>",

In the palm of Jon's hand, Jasmine was the only one who seemed a bit uncomfortable.  Ollie noticed this but really didn't think anything of it.  After all, she was probably just being shy since this was the first time she had really met his family.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, have fun,\" Jon said with a laugh, lowering his hand to the floor and watching as the shrunken relatives all hopped off.  Jon then exited his bedroom and shut the door, going outside to socialize for a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor of the giant's bedroom, the group had split up.  Sandra and her two younger kids, Megan and Jon, were off wandering near Jon's closet.  They had stumbled across Jon's gym shoes.  Sandra laughed as Megan and Blake tentatively started to climb the laces.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, mom why do Jon's shoes smell so bad,\" complained Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're awful,\" chimed in Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra shook her head.  \"I guess you'll have to tell him to wash his feet,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jasmine and Ollie were hanging out underneath the dresser next to Jon's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong babe?\" Ollie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, I just....I just am kinda nervous at this size,\" she responded.  \"I've never met your younger cousin before and it's just kinda intimidating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie smiled and gently started to rub her back.  \"It'll be okay, Jon's a great kid.  Besides, I'll take care of you,\" he said, planting a kiss on her cheek.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor started to shake and the door opened to Jon's room.  In walked the monstrous teenager carrying a hot dog and a Pepsi, plopping down on his bed.  \"FEE FI FO FUM,\" he said, getting into character.  As he sat on his bed and began to eat, he started to scan the floor for any of the shrunken people.  \"Well what do we have here,\" he said maniacally, standing up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was Jon going to grab?</span></div></div>",

This was all too much for her and did not feel like a game anymore.  She wanted to be back to normal size and out of this crazy situation.  Instead she was captured in the hand of a giant teenage boy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW WHAT'S THIS TINY HUMAN DOING HERE?\" Jon said with a laugh.  He found that he could not stop staring at Jasmine.

Something just didn't seem right about this.  \"Hey Jon, can you grow sums back now?\" he yelled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon seemed to ignore him.  \"YOU'RE SO PRETTY JASMINE,\" he said while blushing.

Ollie yelled for Sandra to do something but she was just as helpless on the other side of the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at Jasmines tiny body, Ollie decided to put the ring on for now and worry about it later.

He resurfaced, and managed to tread soda, though getting it in his eyes and nose was quite painful. As he wiped his eyes and regained his vision, his heart sank.  He could see the approaching cave that was Jon's mouth, as the current began to pull him towards the entrance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlurping his tiny cousin into his mouth, Jon began to swish Ollie and the orange soda around.

Jon grabbed Jasmine in his right hand, and began to pump his cock with the same hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this felt absolutely amazing for Jon, it was a nightmare for Jasmine.

Suddenly, the magic ring on his finger created a bright light, startling Jon. Once it vanished, the giant sat up and noticed that Jasmine had stopped crying. Instead, she was starting to rub him willingly, moaning a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Jon didn\u2019t realize in the moment was that the ring had altered her memories and feelings. Jasmine now loved Jon instead of Ollie and would do whatever he wanted. Jon picked Jasmine up, noticing that something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong honey? Are you not having fun?\u201d Jasmine asked. Sandra, Blake, and Megan were currently under the bed, confused as to what was now going on.

Not only that, but I ate your boyfriend, Ollie. So why are you suddenly acting different?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOllie was my boyfriend, but I\u2019ve lost interest in him.

She may even torture him to get back at him. However, it would be the right thing to do. Plus, he was just trying to act like a scary giant like in the story (and he didn\u2019t intentionally make Jasmine love him).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did occur to him that he could keep her this way though. Right now, she truly loved him and wanted to be with him. Jasmine was also smoking hot which Jon was having a hard time resisting. He knew Jasmine was great, and he believed he would never find a lady like her. Plus, it wasn\u2019t like his mother could do anything right now since she was tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, Jon decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

After all, I\u2019m so helpless compared to your mighty body. I want to be your tasty prey.\u201d She said. Jon smiled and licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then. In that case, I want you to strip down to your underwear for me. I want to get a good taste.\u201d The giant commanded. Megan shuddered and did as she was told. With every piece of clothing that was removed, the tiny girl got more excited with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done and in her underwear, the giant smiled and gave her a slow lick. Megan gave a soft moan, enjoying the feeling. Jon licked her again, causing the small girl to fall onto her back. He continued to lick her, loving her taste. She was better than his mother. After a while, Megan giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, are you just going to tease me forever, or will I get to join your stomach?\u201d The girl asked. Jon blushed and raised her up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Since you\u2019re so tasty, I guess we should take it further.\u201d He said. He opened his mouth and tilted his head back, letting her slide right in. As his mouth closed, Megan smiled with joy. Jon\u2019s mouth was warm and slimy, but it had a nice feeling to it. Her brother tossed her around in his mouth like a piece of candy, tasting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken girl loved every second of it. The feeling of being helpless felt nice to her. Her smile grew as Jon tilted his head back and swallowed her. Megan moaned as she traveled down his throat and landed into his stomach. Though the acids hurt a bit, she couldn\u2019t care less. She looked around until she spotted her mother against the wall. The tiny girl smiled and traveled over to her, giving her a hug and making her flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMegan? Oh my god!

I swear, when we get out of this, he is so dead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wait! I wanted Jon to eat me.\u201d Megan said quickly. Sandra hesitated, feeling confused. \u201cWhen I saw you get eaten, I wanted to know what it felt like. He didn\u2019t force me to do anything.\u201d She explained.

Why don't we just use the magic ring to find her,\" she insisted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie's face seemed to light up at that.  \"Sure let's give it a shot,\" he said hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra grasped the magic ring in the palm of her hand.  \"Magic ring, I wish we were with Jasmine right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic ring shook and there was a bright flash.

She had only met him once and could instantly tell that he was incredibly smart and incredibly awkward.  Ollie had mentioned to her before that he was very passionate about entomology.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly are a peculiar insect,\" he said lifting her up to his glasses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine had no idea how to react in this situation.  In the end her instincts kicked in and she just froze.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've definitely got to study you,\" he said and slipped her into his pocket.  Drake was not having a great time at the party.  He was also getting worried that this bug would escape or he would inadvertently rush it.  He decided to find his mom and feign illness to get to leave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom,\" he said, fake coughing into his hand.  \"I'm really not feeling well.  Is it okay if I walk home?\"  Drake only lived a few blocks away, so getting home was no problem.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok sweetie, I wish you'd stay but if you're sick then I guess it's fine,\" his mom replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok thanks mom, I'll see you at home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving to his house, Drake quickly ran upstairs to his room.  He took little Jasmine out of his pocket and poked her to make sure she was still alive.  He smiled as she moved slightly when he did so.  \"I wonder what you are,\" he says to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Drake do with poor little Jasmine?</span></div></div>",

She felt uneasy as she starred at the cages and terrariums along the walls of the room.  There were scorpions, tarantulas, and bullfrogs, as well as a large ant farm.  Feeling nervous that she may end up in one of those tanks, Jasmine was praying that Drake would recognize her as human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine would not have to wait long, as Drake returned to the room.  He seemed to be carrying two things in his hand.  One she could tell, was a magnifying glass.  The other appeared to be a white piece of paper.  Sitting down at his desk, Drake's massive body blocked out almost all of Jasmine's view.  She had not realized just how big he was until now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay let's see what you are,\" the massive nerd said.  Jasmine screamed as she was lifted into the air.  She could see Drake place the paper down and dropped her shrunken body down on top of it.  Looking up, Jasmine stood there in awe as the magnifying glass made Drake's eye look even more huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Drake long to realize just exactly what was going on.  \"Oh my god,\" Drake said, lowering his face down over Jasmine.  \"You're a tiny person.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her up in the palm of his hand, Drake said.....</span></div></div>",

After taking several seconds to readjust his surroundings, Ollie pitched an ice to aunt Sandra.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey why don't we use the magic ring to find her?!\" he said, desperately hoping this would work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra stood there dumbfounded.  \"How did I not think of that?\" she thought to herself.  \"Great idea,\" she said to Ollie.  She took a deep breath.  This better work, as it may be their last shot to find Jasmine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic ring,\" Sandra said with a pause.  \"I wish we knew where Jasmine was.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic ring started to shake and nearly shot off Sandra's finger.

She was trapped within the high glass walls of her prison, with seemingly no choice but to wait for her captor to return.  That all changed when for some reason, her massive boyfriend and his aunt seemingly appeared in the room out of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine deducted that they must have come for her.  She patiently waited as the duo examined the first tanks and slowly made their way towards her.  Then it happened.  Sandra stood over the tank Jasmine was in and breathed a sigh of relief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra smiled and reached down, plucking Jasmine up out of the tank.  \"Hey Ollie, check out this bug I found,\" she teased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie glanced over and rolled his eyes.  He couldn't believe his aunt was still going along with all this.  \"You can give it up now, Aunt Sandra.\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either one could do anything else, hey heard footsteps returning to the room.

For starters, everything was massive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Sandra whispered, in awe at what had happened to them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen?\" asked Ollie.  Both of them were so caught up in the moment that they could barely speak.  They had been shrunken back down to the size of bugs, and were now in a metropolis sized bedroom, which also happened to be crawling with bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the ring took us to Jasmine it must've made us her size,\" Sandra said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reality struck them hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz!\" yelled Ollie, as he realized he needed to find his equally tiny girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ring!\" yelled Sandra, as she realized they needed it to get back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them found what they needed rather quickly, unfortunately, it was just out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey noticed a relatively empty terrarium on the floor, with the exception of one strange but just sitting there alone.  Ollie knew instantly it was Jazz, but since had no way of scaling the walls of the terrarium to reach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra had spotted the ring from far away.  It was simply laying there on Drake's nightstand, simply too high to be reached.  The two regrouped on the floor and began to formulate their plan, when the ground began to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously they watched as the bedroom door opened, and Drake's towering form entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear god,\" Sandra whispered.  The 14-year-old giant was carrying a magnifying glass in his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, LET'S SEE WHAT YOU ARE,\" he boomed as he walked towards Jasmine's cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something caught Drake's attention on the floor.  He took off his glasses, wiped his eyes, and then put them back on.  He knelt down and could not believe what he was seeing.  There on his floor, were two more of those strange bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of them could get away, Drake extended his hand and encircled them with his fingers.  \"Surely this must be an invasive species,\" he said to himself.  He reached into the cage and pulled out Jasmine as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs happy as Jasmine was to see Ollie, and to a lesser extent, Sandra, their reunion was interrupted.  \"Well you three a unique species, that's for sure,\" Drake said.  Drake looked at the magnifying glass, and what does he decide to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.  He puts them in the cage and looks for others<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB.

Standing before him were three shrunken people.  However they were not just any shrunken people, they were his aunt, older cousin, and cousins girlfriend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ollie?  Aunt Sandra?  What happened to you?\" Drake asked in a concerned voice, he honestly could not remember Jasmines name, but he recognized her nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra tried to explain the situation but she was simply not loud enough.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry aunt Sandra, I can't hear you,\"' Drake said as he lowered his palm.  \"Hop on and I'll bring you to my ear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra proceeded to walk onto her nephews sweaty palm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake was having a hard time hiding his excitement with the situation.

They couldn't explain why, but they just had a bad feeling about all of this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his hand so the bugs could not escape, Drake walked over to a terrarium which contained a bullfrog.  \"Alright bugs,\" Drake said, opening his hands.  \"Let's see where you fit in on the food chain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three tiny people screamed as Drake lowered two fingers down and plucked up Ollie.

He knew however that Sandra was the only person who knew he was shrunk and the only person with the capability of growing him back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in a second Jasmine, we'll talk some more,\" Sandra laughed as she began to walk back into the house.  Well time to grow the little \"bug\" back, she thought to herself.  \"You ready?\" she asked her tiny nephew with a smile?  She could see the bug-sized Ollie jumping up and down on your toes, which she assumed meant yes.  \"Okay fine, party pooper,\" she teased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie rolled his eyes in her hand.  \"C'mon just do it,\" he mumbled, growing annoyed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra prepared to grow Ollie back when a thought came across her mind.  A grin spread across her face, a grin that scared Ollie.  Sandra didn't want to waste this opportunity.  She definitely wanted to share tiny Ollie with his giant girlfriend, Jasmine.  After pondering it a little more, Sandra had made up her mind.  \"So....here's what we're gonna do,\" she said mischievously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap,\" Ollie thought to himself.  \"What the hell does she want to do now.\"  He waited to hear what Sandra had next in store for him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra continued.  \"Ollie, I really like your girlfriend Jasmine.  She's such a sweet and pretty girl, and tall too.\"  Ollie was confused on where this was going.  \"I want to get her a little more involved in our secret,\" she said with a smirk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to you mean?\" Ollie yelled up to her.  He also shrugged to ensure Sandra knew what he meant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, I'm gonna hide you somewhere on Jasmine.  Keep your phone on you and text me if you need anything.\"  Ollie could not believe how sideways this went, though he did have to admit, he liked the idea of being on is titan of a girlfriend.  It would only help if she knew he was shrunk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back outside while hiding Ollie in her hand, Sandra walks up behind Jasmine.  She sneakily puts Ollie....</span></div></div>",

If Sandra went looking for him, that would be the first place she would look. It was also theoretically possible that he might be able to get Jasmine to see that he wasn\u2019t just a bug. The problem with that though is if she couldn\u2019t realize what he truly was, she probably wouldn\u2019t let him off so easily this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie thought for a minute.

She set her plate on the ground and called him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to ask this, but would it be alright if I took some of my clothes off? It\u2019s pretty warm out here.\u201d She asked, a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine with me, just don\u2019t take everything off, there are kids around here.\u201d He said and walked off. Jasmine smiled and took her shirt and pants off, leaving the girl in her bikini. The sudden movement did catch Ollie off guard, but he was able to hold on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got to the top of her knee and stared in awe at her amazing beauty. He thought she would make the best beach babe ever. Jasmine picked her plate back up and captured a Pringle. The shrunken man simply watched as she chewed up the chip like nothing. He looked at her exposed belly button and got a little excited. He didn\u2019t know which was better, the thought of being crushed by her titan foot, or the though of being digested in that sexy belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie wasn\u2019t suicidal though, he didn\u2019t dare move onto her plate. He knew his girlfriend enough to know she ate everything on her plate, even the tiny crumbs. Just then\u2026</span></div></div>",

Maybe I'll grow you back later then.\"  Sandra then placed her panicking nephew back on her flip flops.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention back to the ring, Sandra began to sweat with anticipation at the possibilities.

It had gone silent, and she was growing more excited by the second at what she had just done.  She had just wished that her Chinese neighbors, the Chen family who she found extremely irritating, would shrink to the size of bugs.  They appeared to be having a noisy party, but all that had stopped.  She was almost certain they had become tiny.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on Sandra's foot, Ollie was starting to get worried.  It appeared his aunt was starting to go mad with power upon realizing the abilities this magic ring gave her.  He tried to hold onto his aunt's giant foot as best he could, but each step she took threatened to throw him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?  Anyone home?\" Sandra asked, pushing the front door open, and letting herself into the house.  She looked around and continued to smile.  There were no responses despite several cars parked in front of the house.  \"Nice place,\" she mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sandra saw something that brought joy to her heart.  Scampering towards her on the ground appeared to be a bug about the size of an ant.  Or at least anyone else who would've seen it would think so.  However, Sandra knew exactly what this was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie watched in horror at the poor, middle aged woman running towards Sandra waving her arms.  He watched the shadow from Sandra's foot expand as she lifted her opposite foot high into the air.  \"Aunt Sandra, don't!\" he screamed.  His scream for mercy for the tiny women went unheard.  Sandra brought her foot down, causing the shrunken woman's body to explode upon impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They should really keep their place clean, there's a lot of bugs in here,\" Sandra giggled to herself.  As she stomped off to the living room, what happens next?  </span></div></div>",

She could not believe she lost her nephew who she had just been bonding with.  She also knew she had to go back outside and get the ring before something happened to it.  If that happened there may be no way to grow Ollie back once she finds him.  Thinking fast, Sandra had an idea.  She quickly went into her bathroom and brought out a paper cup.  \"OLLIE?\" she called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOllie covered his ears at the incredible volume of the giantesses voice.  Sandra continued, \"IF YOU CAN HEAR ME, I'M GONNA GO FIND THE RING.  COME WAIT IN THIS CUP FOR WHEN I GET BACK.\"  Sandra proceeded to lay the Dixie Cup down on its's side so Ollie could enter.

Her husband Gary stood at the grill cooking burgers, he looked at his wife looking around the yard and smiled. He then turned his attention to his young niece Olivia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Olivia\" Gary said as he put his hands over his eyes \"Do you think you could run and grab my sunglasses of my dresser.

Help!\" He screamed as he grabbed his legs. He heard booms coming from outside of the room. He again screamed for help hoping his Aunt would see him. The booming grew louder and Ollie turned to see the giant figure of his cousin Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no, No!\" Ollie yelled as Olivia came closer. She didn't even think to look where she was going. The Shadow of her foot loomed over him and he screamed one last time but no one heard it. Olivia's foot slammed down on the boy. He burst into a puddle of blood on the floor. Olivia felt the pop below her foot and smeared it across the floor. She saw the  small blood smear on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" Olivia said looking at the sole of her foot \"That must have been one Big mosquito.\" She placed her foot on the floor and grabbed the sunglasses of the dresser. She walked back out of the room and passed her aunt Sandra on the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hi Olivia, where are you coming from?\" Her Aunt asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uncle Gary just asked me to get his sunglasses from your room\" She said with a warm smile \"Oh and auntie Sandra I accidentally crushed a bug in your room. It left a smear but I can clean it I just need to give these to uncle Gary first.\" Olivia continued to walk as a look of horror came across Sandra, She looked at the bottoms of Olivias feet as she walked away and saw the faint red sploch. Sandra ran to her room ring in hand and way the smear of blood right infront of the door. With the ring in hand she wished for Ollie to go back to normal size but nothing happened. She then wished for him to be alive again and still nothing. \"Oh Ollie Im so sorry,\" Sandra looked at the ring in her hand and again at the floor. Tears fell from her eyes as she cried. What was she going to do, how was she gonna tell her sister that her son was dead and it was her fault. Sandra sat on her bed and looked at the ring. Suddenly a dark idea popped into her head. Slowly Sandra opened her mouth \"I wish I could forget all of this.\" Suddenly all the grief went away. What had happened in the last twenty minutes had become a memory of her sitting out in the back yard with her family. Olivia came back and started to wipe up the mess on the floor. She looked up at her aunt \"Man this guy must have been huge!\" She said with a smile almost as if she was proud of her kill. Sandra went back to normal \"Must have been. But I'm glad you got him. Would hate to think about a disgusting bug running around my house.\" Like that Ollie had been forgotten about and SAndra and Olivia went back to the BBQ. </span></div></div>",

Sandra knew exactly what he was doing, and it both aroused and scared her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait, this will be fun.\u201d He said, lowering Sandra to his erected penis. He started to rub her, causing her to moan. She knew this was bad and that it was going to get worse, but it felt good right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gary did that, he took his other hand and grabbed Megan. He moved her around, making sure she had enough peanut butter on. He then took her out and pulled her up to his face, licking his face. Despite her face covered in peanut butter, she could see pretty well. Her dad was about to devour her, he was basically having sex with his wife while he was doing this, and there was literally no way out of this. As Gary started to dangle her daughter over his mouth, Megan strangely lost the feeling of fear. Instead, his open mouth made her want to be eaten, to be part of his giant body. As this was happening, Sandra was able to see her daughter from her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 please\u2026\u201d she said, unable to stop her moaning. Gary finally let go and let Megan fall towards his mouth. Once he caught her, he swirled her around and moaned even more, she was the tastiest doll ever. Megan had closed her eyes and decided to just go along with it. Gary started to rub his wife faster. Everything was so enjoyable, the taste in his mouth, the feeling the \u201cdoll\u201d on his dick, how much power he had compared to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gary came, he swallowed Megan. The shrunken girl stayed quiet as she went down into his belly. The giant laid back with his wife in his hand, satisfied. The tiny woman had gotten covered with cum during that. Sandra had mixed feelings though. That was the best time she ever had with her husband, but she witnessed her daughter get swallowed. She had no idea what to think or feel.

However, she just could not bring herself to do it.  She was too mentally drained after everything she had just been through.  She was currently dealing with the knowledge that she had been shrunken by a magic ring, all three of her children had also been shrunken and had been killed (one even by her), and her husband thought she was nothing but a sex doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters even worse, she had just witnessed her giant husband literally eat her daughter while he masturbated using her tiny body.  She felt physically worn out from him jacking off with her, and being covered in his ejaculate made her feel like absolute garbage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to take in any more stress, Sandra passed out cold in the palm of Gary's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went unnoticed by Gary as he placed his tiny, unconscious doll of a wife in the top drawer of his dresser.

However, now that I\u2019m looking at it, I think this might be a magical ring, or at least that\u2019s what I have been told in the past. I don\u2019t know if it truly works though. Here, why don\u2019t you take a look.\u201d Gary said, taking off the ring and handing it to Diane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO! STOP!\u201d Sandra yelled from the jar. Though she couldn\u2019t see everything that was happening, she could hear it and knew that only trouble would come from it. It was bad enough that her daughter was gulped down by Diane, but if she used that ring, Sandra knew that it would only lead to more people getting swallowed up. She shuddered at the thought of her friends screaming helplessly as Diane dropped them into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Diane thought she heard yelling, but she decided it was most likely her imagination. She grabbed the ring and instinctively put it on. It was quite pretty to her, especially with the jewel in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish that I could eat more tasty dolls like the one from before.\u201d Diane said to herself.

There were people screaming and running, trying to avoid her ever expanding feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiane stopped growing at 200 feet tall.

Even though there was people yelling and chaos around her, the giantess simply walked off as if nothing was happening around her. She walked through town, searching for her desired treat. It only took a few minutes before she spotted a bright yellow bus full of children. Diane drooled at the sight of it and captured it with ease. Everyone screamed as she gave them a hungry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bus in hand, Diane walked over to the park and sat down. She then tore the entire roof off of the vehicle and pulled the teacher and bus driver out. At first, Diane was planning to eat them, but after a moment, she decided they weren\u2019t worthy of being her meal. He giantess dropped the adults to the ground and crushed them with her foot. She then turned to her prisoners. There were plenty of students comprised of different age groups, and they looked so sweet to the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re all going to go on the ride of your lifetime. Any volunteers to go first?\u201d Diane asked, licking her lips. Everyone was nervous to do anything. Suddenly, a small boy raised his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you like the big bad wolf where you want to eat us?\u201d He asked. Diane smiled and carefully picked him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, would you like to be part of the wolf\u2019s first bite?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026sure, but can you make the trip easy?\u201d Diane winked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t feel a thing. Now close your eyes, the big bad wolf is tired of waiting.\u201d The boy did what she asked, making her smile. Being careful, she gave him a taste before placing him on her tooth. With blinding speed, she bit down, killing him instantly. Diane swallowed and giggled. \u201cMm, he really was good. Any other volunteers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen nobody spoke up, the giantess plucked a random tiny girl. She screamed as she was tossed into the hungry mouth and swallowed whole. Diane continued to eat them one by one. Each one was full of flavor. She eventually got a handful of them and tossed them all into her mouth at the same time. She moaned with delight. Finally, there was one boy left, who looked to be about 18 years old. The giantess pulled him out and crushed the empty bus with her other hand, throwing it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell lucky you, you\u2019re the last one of this group. I guess that means you\u2019re the best.\u201d Diane licked her lips in anticipation. She took notice thought that the tiny person wasn\u2019t afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope I satisfy you my queen.\u201d He boy said, catching her off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s just that you\u2019re so beautiful, and I kind of like domination. just watching you eat all of those people, it was actually kind of exciting.\u201d Diane became intrigued by this, she had never met someone like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you have\u2026interesting fun with your girlfriend?\u201d Diane asked, laying down on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026actually, I don\u2019t have a girlfriend. I used to, but she dumped me when she found out I wanted to be dominated. She said it was for my safety.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm, she doesn\u2019t sound very smart. A good-looking guy like you who wants to serve a lady any way she wants, any intelligent girl would take it.\u2026you know, I could make you my servant, if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would I have to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything I desire, and I can use magic to make you come back to life if I kill you, so I may want you as a snack often. Is that what you want? Just so you know, there\u2019s no turning back, and I may humiliate you in the worst ways.\u201d Diane gave a smile, thinking of all the ways she could toy with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care, I want you to use me however you like. I would love to be dominated by a sexy gal like you.\u201d The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, my name is Diane, but for now you will refer to me as queen or master. What is your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Joe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right Joe. Hold on a minute.\u201d Diane said. She closed her eyes and whispered, making a wish for him to respawn when he died. Once the bright light passed, the giantess smiled. \u201cAll right, my little toy.

None of those facts would help though as Gary was wearing sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked up to see her husband towering over her. She felt afraid, knowing he could step on her and not even notice. However, his size also made her a bit curious.

The girl watched as the giant\u2019s finger approached, going for her clothes. She watched as he stripped her down, not fighting back. She didn\u2019t mind being naked in front of her husband, though she really felt like it wasn\u2019t the best time for that. Once she was completely naked, she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, get a good look sweetie!

He had to avoid everyone at the barbeque but he was able to do that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, still in her birthday suit, sat patiently in her dad's shirt pocket waiting to arrive at their destination.

She wrapped two giant fingers around Gary's tiny body and lifted him up to her gigantic face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary was trying to plead with his giant wife to listen to reason.  Despite the face that Sandra thought this whole thing was a dream, Gary obviously knew better.  \"Sandy, you have to listen to me,\" Gary said nervously.  He felt very intimidated by the giant woman holding him high in the air right now.  \"You're not dreaming right now, you have to stay calm and be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra just started laughing at that.  \"Very funny, Gary.  Like this could actual happen in real life.\"  Sandra licked her lips and brought Gary closer to her mouth.  \"I'm gonna send you down towards my tummy now babe,\" Sandra giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary screamed and tried to struggle but it was no use.  Sandra dropped her tiny, struggling husband onto her tongue and retracted it back into her mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe don't do this,\" Gary screamed.  He was terrified that his wife would swallow him and not realize any of this was real.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was no use.

After all, she was almost 200 feet tall.

Is that what you want? To die in my womanhood? <font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">I suppose some men would actually like that.</font>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra lifted Gary back to her face. He didn\u2019t know what she was planning, but it couldn\u2019t be good. It was obvious to him that she thought she was dreaming, meaning she had little remorse for him. What scared him more though was once she had her fun with him, she would go after the town next. Dozens ending up under her foot, or being given a worse fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you are my husband, whether I or not I like it we are \u201ceternally bound together for eternity\u201d even if you became my worst enemy. I suppose I have no choice.\u201d She said, not sounding serious at all. She pulled open her shirt and bra just enough to drop her husband in. Gary screamed as he fell and landed in front of her enormous breast. He started to panic as she shut her clothes up, sealing him in darkness. \u201cYou\u2019re all mine now. I\u2019ll check up on you later. If you\u2019re still alive, perhaps we can make this relationship work.\u201d Sandra giggled, taking a couple of steps away from her now wreaked home.</span></div></div>",

You still have the ring, you can make everything go back to normal, just like how you brought me here\u2026 That\u2026 doesn\u2019t mean\u2026 we can\u2019t\u2026 have fun first\u2026 if you want.\u201d Megan said, slowly. Sandra simply stared at her, eventually smiling. She was right, the ring was clearly powerful enough to make it so, but they could enjoy this size for now. She looked at her husband who had been listening to everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary was both happy and scared.

She was able to feel Megan against her, and it felt nice. However, she was starting to get a little impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you really going to let her go when you get the ring?\u201d Leo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a consideration.

Lynette nodded and pulled open her pants, revealing the shrunken girl. At first, the giant was happy to see her struggling, but he soon started to get annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lynette asked, observing his expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair, Sandra always gets the good things.. Just seeing her daughter\u2026grr, why is she always better than me? She\u2019s dominant over me in every way.\u201d Leo said, annoyed. Lynette simply giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you wish you were the dominant one? I bet we can make that happen with the ring. If you had the chance, what would you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would keep her as my servant. I would take everything she has and get rid of it in front of her.\u201d Leo said a bit more annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an idea.\u201d Leo looked over and suddenly noticed his mother-in-law was handing Megan to him. \u201cI\u2019ll let you do one thing to her while they\u2019re gone. Don\u2019t kill her, but pretend she is your sister. Show me one thing that you would do.\u201d Lynette said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stayed silent as she looked at her uncle. She was really nervous, she had never seen this side of him before. Leo grabbed her and smiled. Before she knew it, Leo placed her on his seat and sat on her, light enough so it didn\u2019t kill her, but heavy enough so it wouldn\u2019t feel good. Megan screamed as the giant butt was rubbed on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake this! Know your place!\u201d Leo said, a bit enthusiastically.

They headed back as quickly as they could, finding Megan where she had been before. Lynette simply smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s the ring, now take me and let my daughter go.\u201d Gary said. Lynette put it on and smiled.</span></div></div>",

It smelled bad, and the stomach acids were hurting her a bit. Megan rushed until she came across a hotdog that had been partly digested. She climbed on and took a deep breath. For the moment, she was in a safe place and was able to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019ve been swallowed by my mother and her body wants to digest me. I\u2019m just food for her now.\u201d Megan listened to the sounds of the stomach. She remembered how Blake was swallowed by a bird. She now knew how it felt to be inside a creature\u2019s body. Megan sighed. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy\u2026or pleasant, but maybe I can escape. I have two options, both have their downsides.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked up. She knew that it would be possible to climb back out through the throat. The issue though was that it could hurt her mother, and it would take a lot of effort. The other issue was that if she failed, she would fall plunge right into the stomach acids, and she probably wouldn\u2019t be able to escape it a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other option was to follow the digestive tract. It would technically be easier, but she would end up exiting out her mother\u2019s behind, which was pretty gross. Not to mention, there would be a good chance she would end up in the toilet, and she didn\u2019t know if she would be able to get out of that situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Megan considered a third option. She was pretty close to the stomach wall, so perhaps if she started to attack it, her mother\u2019s stomach would get upset. If it did, it would be possible that Megan would exit with puke. It wouldn\u2019t be pretty, but that was probably the easiest solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Megan decided\u2026</span></div></div>",

However, this person had experience with the ring before and knew it\u2019s power: Aunt Jane.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nJane was Gary\u2019s sister. She had a slender figure and long red hair. Her grandmother had taught her about real and mysterious magic. Very few people learned what she was taught, even Jane\u2019s own parents didn\u2019t have knowledge of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane\u2019s grandmother had taught her that humans were able to use magic long ago. However, most humans had forgotten how to use and control it. Very few people in the world still know about magic, and the magic that is still in the world now only exists in items, like the ring. As long as people holds or wears the item that contains magic, they can use that magic. Jane had received it from her grandmother and decided to trust Megan with it long ago.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nAunt Jane had just gotten to the reunion and looked around. She wasn\u2019t able to find her brother or his family. She took a few steps onto the grass before looking down and noticing the ring. She grabbed it and put in on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell well, it looks like my old ring has fallen to the ground. I know Megan wouldn\u2019t loose you that easily so she must have accidentally made a wish.\u201d Jane said to herself. She remembered that the magic in the ring could only grant wishes, but there was no limit to what the wishes could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had some trouble in the past due to this, so she suspected the ring had caused some trouble again. Unfortunately for everyone around her, Jane liked to cause trouble or see what trouble the ring could cause, meaning she was looking forward to what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I knew what happened with the ring today.\u201d Jane said. A bright light flashed from the ring. It tried to fly off, but Jane made sure she held it tightly. She learned that the kids shrunk and ran into big trouble. \u201cHm, Jon was crushed by his mother. Blake ended up as a birdseed. And Megan is currently digesting in her mother\u2019s belly. Interesting. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve played with the ring, but I\u2019m sure I can still use it to have fun now.\u201d Jane smiled, looking at the ring.</span></div></div>",

The reason she was confident in this decision was that she had a secondary magical item: a beautiful leg bracelet. This item was able to protect her when she died. If she gets squished for example, she will respawn in a safe location with everything she had before. This artifact was also on loose enough so that it was comfortable to wear, but tight enough so that it wouldn\u2019t fall off easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish to be shrunk.\u201d Jane said.

Jane took a deep breath. \u201cThis brings back memories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane looked around. She was able to see a few giant humans in the backyard with her. The one problem with her leg bracelet was that it typically made her cocky and enjoy the feeling of being killed by something. She typically liked to look for dangerous trouble because of this. When she saw the giants, the first thing she thought of was that she could be stepped on by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea she thought of was that she could climb up the table and join their food. She wondered what it was like to be eaten and digested. It also made her a little bit jealous that Blake and Megan had the experience of being eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more idea she had was to go look for bugs. They would be the same size as her so she would have a new experience. For instance, she could follow some ants into their hill or climb onto a bee and enter a hive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, she decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

She was now left alone with her mother, who hated bugs, and her grandmother, who liked to toy with them. The tiny girl watched the Titan slowly pull her pants off.

Her greatest fear though was being pushed completely inside and never coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her grandmother rubbed quicker, her moans increased.

It must feel so worthless by now.\u201d Sandra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, it gets to serve a superior being such as myself.

They were becoming more intense and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess was rubbing pretty quickly now. The thought of a live creature inside her was too much to resist. It was now hers and she was going to play with it however she desired. She gave a loud moan, sensing her body was getting ready. Within a few moments, she came into her hand. Lynette\u2019s moans became smoother and she became more relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess lifted her hand up to see her prize. She could tell it was tired and smiled.

Sandra nodded and started to walk back into the house with Megan in hand. Though they weren\u2019t specific, the shrunken girl had an idea on where her mother was heading. Just before her mother walked into the house though, she saw something on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm? What\u2019s this doing here? Someone could step on it.\u201d Megan\u2019s mother said, bending down to pick it up. As she did, Megan realized that it was the ring, it gave her a little hope now that she knew where it was (even though her mother now had it). Sandra put the ring on and continued inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, Megan saw where they were heading:the garage.

It was 3 years ago and had been night time when Megan had gotten a bit curious. When she went in there, her mother happened to be in there as well. Megan could remember that her mother seemed to be drunk that night. When she went in there, her mother spotted her pretty quickly, but wasn\u2019t angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 hey Megan. Did you want to see mommy work? I\u2019m taking care of\u2026 *hic*\u2026 another prisoner.\u201d She said. Megan walked up to her. They stood next to a table with a saw blade and a conveyor belt attached. Her father had told her it was to cut wood. However this was a bug on the conveyor belt. Her mother giggled as she turned it on and watched the bug get carried into the blade. Megan on the other hand was a bit startled as the bug was cut in half. When Sandra turned the machine off, her daughter looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this what you do when you work?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*hic*\u2026yep. I like killing bugs in different ways, it\u2019s kind of fun.\u201d Her mother responded. Suddenly, she turned her head towards her with a creepy smile. \u201cSay\u2026*hic* I wonder what it\u2019s like to see you cut up.\u201d Megan became scared as her mother picked her up and put her on the conveyor belt. The girl immediately grabbed her mother\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! I don\u2019t want to be cut up, you\u2019ll kill me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026*hic* worry. I\u2019ll put you back together. Now hold still or else this will get messy.\u201d Her mother started to reach for the on switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, can you at least wait till morning? I\u2019m sure dad would like to watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026*hic*\u2026all right. I suppose it can wait till tomorrow.\u201d Her mother said, taking her off the table. The two of them went to bed without anyone else waking up. During the night, Megan had a nightmare of her mother cutting her up and laughing about it. She never mentioned it to anyone. In the morning, her mother had no memory of what happened last night, which Megan was grateful for.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\nWhen her mother carried her into the garage, that scary memory came back to her. She really hoped she didn\u2019t end up like the bug from three years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to my special chamber for bugs like you. There are quite a few options on how to deal with you.

The Jones clan was a large one, and the Fourth of July was the one occasion in the year when they all got together under one roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra was anxious to be hosting the festivities that year.  The performance of each host or hostess was what served to define their standing among the family for the rest of the year, and any flaws in the presentation would be swiftly pounced upon as the source of jokes at their expense for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children running off God knew where was a bad sign.

How would it look if she couldn't even control her own children?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Sandra managed to keep a smile on her face as she embraced the first guest.

They had very little time to sense the movement of the air as their cousin's foot descended on their unfortunate patch of dirt at breakneck speed. They had very little time to hear the light whistle of the air rushing between her dirt-caked toes, and they had very little time to avoid said toes ramming into them without forgiveness, very little time before Olivia put her full weight into her stride and her tanned flesh sank slightly into the dirt and left a shallow impression. They had very little time until every bone in their body would be broken and shattered into innumerable fragments, very little time until every blood vessel and structure would be burst and their tiny beings would be reduced to paste, very little time before they would be reduced to tiny, indistinguishable red stains in one or two of those shallow impressions, very little time before they would join Jon -- they had very little time before they would die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey certainly used it well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCall it intuition, fortune, fate, luck, providence, or something else, but Blake had turned around enough to see the behemoth and tackled his older sister, safely sending them both out of harm's way. There was just enough time for them to draw in a gasping breath before Olivia's foot slammed down right where they had been. As the giantess shuddered at the sudden sensation of loam in between her bare toes instead of grass and she retracted her foot, the bug-sized children ran for the cover of the grass. Though they had avoided being squished under their cousin's foot, they were still in the area between her legs, and Olivia still had to retrieve her sandal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Olivia, who did not enjoy the feeling of the dirt under the rosebush, took a couple steps back and eyed her entangled footwear. It would be difficult to retrieve it without getting pricked, she decided. And so she re-approached the bush slowly and fell into a crouch. She was so focused on the problem at hand that she did not notice two tiny bugs ducking and weaving through the grass blades. Megan and Blake were hoping to run between Olivia's bent legs and out into the yard, where they might have a better chance at survival. They had made it to a small depression where Olivia's butt was hovering when the enormous cousin pricked her finger and lost her balance, toppling backwards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two siblings were suddenly millimeters away from Olivia's shorts, which covered the entire depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" asked Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan pointed at the denim canopy. \"Look! We can just climb into her back pocket and we'll be safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the two quickly struggled into Olivia's shorts pocket and huddled together, finally (if temporarily) safe. Olivia's butt -- with tiny stowaways -- lifted up as she sheepishly pulled herself out of the dip in the ground. For the tiny siblings, gravity turned sideways and they were trapped at the very bottom of the pocket, meaning they were unable to escape should they need to leave. Olivia, meanwhile, quickly retrieved her sandal, and was putting it on when a drop of sweat came down her nose and she realized that it was going to be one of <i>those </i>summer days -- the blisteringly hot ones. Not to be deterred, however, she sauntered into the house, grabbed a washcloth from the bathroom, and jammed it in her back pocket -- the one with the twins, who quickly got between her butt and the washcloth, hoping it might cushion the inevitable sitting. But as Olivia walked back outside, she was hit with a wall of heat, and began to sweat once more as she made her way to the bench. But did she need to use the washcloth before she plopped down?</span></div></div>",

If anything happened to Blake she wasn't sure she would be able to go on anymore. <br>\r\nShe was snapped from her thoughts as Olivia finally managed to grabbed hold of the sandal.

She noticed the ground was warm, and a stream of juices flowed from its surface. Finally she put two and two together, she was on the plate of food! She tried to stand up, but she was still disorientated from her fall and fell back down. Again she wobbled to her feet, and trudged over the hot surface.

She sat down trying to catch her breath. <br>\r\nJust then a loud rumbling was heard and the entire table shook. Remembering where she was she made a dash toward the edge of the plate.

She would eat the whole cow if you gave her the chance. Megan heard the voice of her mother from across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness Olivia, i'll never understand how you can eat like that and not gain a pound\" she said with a hint of jealousy. Olivia giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure fast metabolism I guess.\" Megan waved her arms trying to get her cousins attention, but she was to wrapped up in her conversation to notice her. Olivia grabbed the bottle of ketchup, absently squirted it on her food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan gasped as the long nozzle of the ketchup bottle hovered over her. She had just enough time to shut her eyes as a torrent of ketchup pored down on her. The wave knocked her on her back, blending her in with the surrounding area. Her whole body was soaked in ketchup as she tried to lift herself back up, but the thick liquid held her fast. She managed to clear the ketchup from her eyes just in time to see Olivia devour a hamburger. The hapless patty was scarfed down in less than a second, and her hand was already latched onto a second one. The burger was brought up to her lips and nearly sucked down, her throat moving like a flowing stream. Her eyes widened in horror as Olivia's hand grasped the hot dog she was on. She flew up to her mouth watching her jaws opening to greet her. A wave of warm breath mixed with her already devoured meal washed over her. With a mighty bite the ground in front of her was ripped away, before being obliterated by her might jaws. A very audible swallow preceded the bulge that traveled down her throat to the confines of her stomach. Her jaws opened again this time looming over her like a beast cornering its prey. Her lips passed over head and she screamed trying to get her attention. Looking back she saw her mother across the table calmly eating. She tried to call out to her just as Olivia's jaws snapped shut sealing her in darkness. Her powerful teeth ground her vessel to bits narrowly missing dicing her to bits. The jaws suddenly stopped and a powerful suction pulled her to the back of her throat. The ground seemed to open beneath her and she was pulled down, pushed through her esophagus along with the rest of her food. She was pushed and squeezed farther down into the depths of her cousin, before being deposited in her cavernous stomach. She fell down into a pool of half digested burgers and acid. She scrambled out of the way as more food was deposited. The stomach floor lurched sending her flying in a wave of gastric acid, slamming into a wall. The ground lurched again propelling her back to the center of the cavern. She was tossed around as Olivia's stomach digested everything put in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing signaling her cousins distress was a series of gurgles and groans emanating from her stomach. She had just finished her third hamburger and was moving on to her fourth hot dog. Finishing that she guzzled down a can of soda, and patted her stomach. A string of gurgles erupted from her stomach, causing her to giggle. <br>\r\n\"Hey Aunt Sandra where are my cousins I haven't seen them all day.\" <br>\r\nSandra simply shrugged \"There around her somewhere the probable wandered of to some neighbors house or something.\" She was unaware her cousin was cousin was closer than she could ever imagine.

His head was throbbing and everything around him was blurred into a single mass. Eventually his vision returned to normal, but a rather large whelp remained on the side of his head. The last thing he remembered was sprinting out of the way of Olivia's falling sandal. He had just made out of the way as the sandal slammed into the ground sending dust, and dirt flying past him. The resulting shock wave had thrown him off his feet, slamming him rather mercilessly into a nearby rock, knocking him out. Finally looking around he noticed that the sandal was already gone, leaving an imprint where it had once been. Just then a cold chill ran down his spine, he had nearly forgotten about Megan, she didn't make it out of the way in time. Looking back at the crater nearly dashed any hopes he might have had about her surviving, still he walked to the edge. Coming up he half expected to see his sister's crushed remains, but much to his relief nothing was there. With renewed confidence he called out to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan, it's me Blake are you out there?\" he listened for a moment but the only sound he heard was the bush overhead rustling in the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she went to find someone\" he thought to himself. Peering out the bush he saw Olivia lounging in one of the lawn chairs across the yard. Both of her sandals sat on the ground in front of her. His mother was near the table chatting with some new arrivals. Blake knew it was far to dangerous to stay out in the open at this size especially with his mothers tendency for smashing bugs, the second she saw them. What had happened to Jon was a painful reminder of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill it was more dangerous to sit around doing nothing, at this size. So he ventured out toward Olivia's chair. Pushing through the tall grass was harder than it looked, but he was moving a good pace so far. When he made about halfway across the yard, the gate swung open. Looking up he saw that his Aunt Jade and her family had just arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was Sandra's older sister by 2 years. While Sandra had her mothers naturally blond hair, Jade had black hair like their father. She was shorter than Sandra standing at only 5'8, but was in very good shape. Walking in behind her was her nineteen year old daughter Lily. Lily was the shortest one in the family at only 5'4, but was rather well endowed. Her hair was dark black like her mother's. Coming in with Lily were the twins Stacey and Ashley. They were 17, and stood at 5'6 with brown hair like their father, they were both known for being rather random, or acting on a whim most of the time. The final few to walk through the gate were Jade's son Erick and her husband John. Erick was what you  could call a carbon copy of his father, looking almost exactly like he did in his younger days. Erick was 15 standing at about 5'5 with his father's brown hair, while John was 39 standing at 6'2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the new people walking around the ground was constantly shaking, Jade and John were talking with Sandra by the table, while the kids went to join Olivia, by the chairs. Finally everything calmed down once everyone reached their destinations, and now Blake found himself at a loss for what to do. Should he try and contact the adults, that would probably be best, but his mom would probably squash him with out even looking at him. He could contact the younger group but they might not be able to help return him to normal. He decides to go with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

Je saw what happened to his brother when his mom saw him at that size. He moved closer to His aunt and uncle. He reached the concrete patio and heard the laughter of his older cousins in the distance. He turned back to see them all in a circle chatting. Olivia in the center. His gaze went down to her sandals and saw what had almost snuffed the life out of him earlier that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoom! A loud thud came from behind him. A large leg came swinging overhead and planted its foot on the ground. The wind blew blake onto his ass. His uncle had gotten up and went to grab something. Blake turned to look at the two older women but all he saw was his aunts cheat coming down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade tripped on the patio chair. her whole body landed on the ground and she layed there for amount thinking about how people must have thought she was already drunk. Sandra grabbed Jades arm and john grabbed the other. The two helped the lady up. She brushed herself off and looked around smiling to show that she was not hurt.<br>\r\n\"Sorry everyone\" She said with a nervous laugh \"Not drunk yet\"<br>\r\nEveryone gave a laugh.<br>\r\n Blake had his world shook as the gigantic soft breasts on his aunt fell ontop of him. He was pushed into the canyon that was her cleavage with only his tiny head poking out. He saw everyone looking at him and tried to get his arms free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra helped her sister into the house, The walked through it towards Sandras bedroom \"That was a nasty fall,\" Sandra said <br>\r\n\"Im fine, I just feel alittle dizzy, I can manage to the bedroom by myself,\" Sandra let her sister hobble through the hall way and watched as she shut the door to the master bedroom.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't believe his cousin was about to grind his puny body into the dirt, mistaking him for just another pesky bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Olivia's foot was about 12 inches off the ground at this point, the cold, dirty, damp sole right above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I gotta get out of here QUICK!\" Blake said to himself.  He looked around and saw a smooth stone to his right, approx. 15 ft away from his perspective, that appeared to have a slight gap under it just big enough for him to squeeze under.  He quickly darts off towards the stone, looking up to see the foot is now only 6 inches away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oooo, I cannot WAIT to feel your tiny bug body crunch under my foot!,\" Olivia bellows, \"I'm gonna smear you all over it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Blake takes a dive under the stone.  Just as he gets under and turns around to look out, everything goes totally dark and all other sounds cancel out, all he hears is the mushing and shifting of Olivia's foot as it twists and sinks in the soft, moist ground.  The stone is also pressed down by her foot a little, closing the gap that Blake crawled in through.  He didn't realize it had sunk until she lifted her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Olivia pulled her foot back, expecting to see a pile of slimy bug guts all over, but instead just her large foot imprint in the dirt.  Even looking at the bottom of her foot, she saw nothing but dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What the fuck?\"  she Questioned herself, kind of loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Sandra heard her and came running over barefoot.  \"What's the matter Olivia?  Can't get your flip flop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh..no aunt Sandra, I'm fine, just trying to squash a little bug that somehow vanished!\" Olivia said pointing at the imprint, \"It was laying right here next to this....rock.  Hmm, that rock...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Sandra laughed and said, \"You know, Olivia.  I also fancy crushing bugs with my bare feet.  Feeling their guts squish out all over the place, popping one by one, it is kind of like lotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Olivia was a little surprised that her aunt enjoys the same feeling as herself.  \"Wow aunt Sandra, I didn't know you liked that stuff!  Do you want to help me find the bug?  Hmm, maybe I should check under this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Oh, I would love too!\" Sandra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Meanwhile, Blake was clawing at the dirt a little bit, trying to let light in.  He could hear their conversation and became frightened!  He was about to go through hell once more.  Fortunately the light that shined in was enought to let him look around.  He noticed a small crevice in the rock that may just save his life one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Just then, Olivia and Sandra both knelt down over the rock, Olivia's hand grabbing for it.  Blake hurried and climbed into the crevice in the rock just as she picked it up and glared underneath it, holding the rock sort of in front of her above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It was like a roller coaster to Blake, with in milliseconds he was lifted miles (from his perspective) into the air.  Looking down, he saw the blue painted toes of his cousin and the freshly painted pink toes of his mother.  He could smell the polish and knew his mom had just got done painting them, so they were probably wet still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Damn it, I wonder where that little bug could have gone.\"  Olivia sighed, \"I was really looking forward to crushing it.  Well, maybe I'll find another one after I get my flip flop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Olivia got to her feet and tossed the rock down in front Sandra, tossing Blake...</span></div></div>",

After nearly passing out, he opened his eyes and carefully looked around.  He couldn't see much more than pink at the moment, his vision was a bit blurry still.  He then tried to roll over and sit up, but he couldn't move, he was stuck.  Then it dawned on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I'm stuck on my mother's big toe,\" Blake sighed, \"Hmm, If I can manage to roll over I may have a chance of getting her attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then he felt himself being lifted into the air at high speed.  He turned his head up to see his mother starting to head back over to the patio.  Fortunately, he didn't have to hold on because he was stuck in her nail polish, which was still a bit tacky.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra sat down in the lawn chair at the edge of the patio and had a sip of her iced tea as she rubbed her feet in the moist grass.  She just loved the feeling when the grass slightly tickled her toes.  She would occasionally wiggle them around, making rolling over that more difficult for her son, his whereabouts unknown to his giantess mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was having a hell of a time trying to adjust himself.  The pink polish was finally starting to dry, gluing his clothes to the enormous nail.  After tugging hard and ripping them up a bit, he broke free and was able to roll over and sit.  He noticed Olivia walking back over, her sandal in her hand.  \"Ugh, I hope Meg is ok,\" he muttered to himself, \"I hope I can get mom's attention...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked up to the sky trying to find his mother's face.  He couldn't see her though, for her long toned mountainous legs were blocking his view.  He tried yelling, \"MOM!?.. ..MOMMY!??.....MOM, IT'S BLAKE, PLEASE HELP ME!  I'M DOWN HERE, ON YOUR RIGHT BIG TOE!! MOMMY?!  MOO...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's cries were overtaken by an even louder voice, which seemed to have crept up from behind him.  It was Olivia, returning to sit down in the grass next to Sandra, letting out a loud sigh as she plopped down.  She tossed both of her sandals right next to the chair Sandra was sitting in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think of my toenails?  Aren't they beautiful?\" Sandra asked Olivia as she lifted her feet a little bit and pointed them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, they are amazing!\" Olivia gasped, \"Very nicely done too!  May I take a closer look Aunt Sandra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course dear,\" Sandra said, placing her right foot on Olivia's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blake felt like he was once again on a roller coaster.  When his mother's giant foot came to rest on Olivia's lap, he knew he was saved, or so he thought.  With a big smile on his face, he began waving his arms and calling for her.  \"Olivia...OLIVIA!..I'M RIGHT HERE! IT'S ME, BLAKE!...CAN YOU HEAR ME?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia held Sandra's foot closer to her face, admiring the perfectly trimmed and polished nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\"  Olivia giggled, \"Guess what I have found on your big toe nail Aunt Sandra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Sandra questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our little bug friend from the bushes some how made it's way onto your big toe and got stuck in the polish while it was still a little wet! Haha, silly little bug.  Want me to get it off for you? Olivia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure go ahead Olivia,\" said Sandra, \"Be careful not to squish him just yet, I got something planned for this guy, I'm gonna go wash my feet off, I will be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was terrified as Olivia's hand came down and pulled him out of the polish.  Just when he thought he was saved, Olivia still thinks he is just a puny bug.  \"Okay, I got it!\"  Olivia said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra got up and went over to the hose laying on the ground to rinse off her feet.  After rinsing them, she sat back down in her seat and used her towel to dry them.  Then, she proceeded to apply a good bit of coconut scented lotion to her feet, making sure to get every crack in between her beautiful toes.  Olivia gave the bug (Blake) to her Aunt Sandra to do as she pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, who was scared half to death and crying, looked up into his mothers eyes as she brought him close to her pretty face.  She eyed him up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a very interesting looking specimen,\" she said, \"Quite unique color...\"  She paused for a moment, then grinned an evil grin. \"You know...little bug, you ruined my nail polish that spent soo much time doing.  So, unfortunately, I can't let you walk free from this one, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlakes heart was shattered!  He couldn't believe that his own mother has mistaken him for a bug, even after looking at him so closely.  And what she going to do to him, she wasn't going to let him go...then he remembered what his mother and Olivia discussed earlier about squishing bugs for fun.....his heart sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra leaned forward and placed Blake, who she had so unfortunately mistaken for a worthless bug, down on the towel that she had been resting her feet.  Blake watched as her massive sexy toes flexed up and down.  He knew he would soon be placed unwillingly underneath them, and he would probably get stuck to them because of the lotion.  Sandra tipped her right foot up high above Blake and curled her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called down to him, \"So little bug, how is the view down there?  Do you enjoy seeing my foot hovering above your puny little body!?  I moisturized them just for you.  Who knows, maybe you will be lucky enough to slide up in a wrinkle and avoid an instant squish!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake couldn't take it, he had no time to think, it was either run for his life or face death!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking up, he could see Olivia's massive hand reaching down for the screaming girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia lifted what she thought was a tiny bug between two fingers.  She obviously could not hear the little girl screaming for help.  As the little girl let out another scream she was squeezed too hard and burst in between Olivia's thumb and index finger.  \"Oops,\" Olivia said with a smile, and took another sip of her wine.  Examining her fingers, Olivia noticed what the thought were weird appendages from the bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm, what are those?\" Olivia said to herself.  Glancing down, she reached for another bug.  Little did she know the inset she picked up was actually her cousin Blake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia it's me!\" Blake screamed.  \"Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, Olivia began to examine the bug closer when her eyes widened.  \"What the hell?\" she whispered.  She needed to get a closer look at this bug or something.  Olivia proceeded to do what?</span></div></div>",

This is the ring the children had. It is supposed to fulfill wishes ... she said with a smile. I should not have given sonething valuable to children... They let it just lie here. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt grant wishes? Ling asked curiously. Yes, that's just a rumor. Every family has their legends and whatnot. Sandra said. Olivia was curious about this ring as well, but remember what her and Sandra were trying accomplish. Wait! Before we go into this, we still have a pest to squish. Olivia said. Oh,right. Our little bug friend.  Sandra said. All three giantesses eyes land right on Blake, who is feeling unsure staying when he could have been running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and Olivia were going to flatten this little insect, but now I guess we're back to square one. Sandra said. Ling was interested in Olivia and Sandra' s need to squish this pest. Ling would be lying to herself if she said she never enjoyed stomping on insects as she came across them. Ling remembers this one time when she was a preteen, she crushed a huge bug. The thing was she didn't stop crushing it. She continually kept stomping it until it was stuck to her foot and she left a deep imprint of her foot in the ground. It was the best feeling to her in the world to her back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLing wanted to feel that feeling one more time. Before they could decide who gets the privilege of crushing the bug, ling quickly raised her foot and stomp down hard. Blake had no time to even acknowledge what was going on before he was turned into a red, gooey  paste that ling grinds her foot on Blake's remains and adds a final stomp for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra and Olivia were surprised to see ling quickly and brutally eradicate the bug. Awww, I wanted to feel its guts pop under my foot. Olivia pouts. Ling.....I didn't know you could do this. Sandra said. It just been a while since I have. I forget how good it feels to pop an insect and grind it to dust. Bling said.  I believe we are going to be just fine together. Sandra said with a smile. With the ring in hand and part of Blake's guts stuck to line's sole, the ladies went to see if this ring was magical. Unbeknown to them that they bonded over Sandra's crushed  son.</span></div></div>",

Maybe he was just checking up on her.  \u201cHello?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Sam\u2019s prison, a voice like thunder spoke.  The walls around him boomed and echoed at the word hello.

Then her mother's tongue sloshed her around, sucking her flavor, feeling her movement across the tastebuds, and experiencing pleasure like none other. Then, after that horrible moment passed, Sandra's fate was sealed as her mother's tongue lifted up, making her slide down the throat and her pleas for mercy and help gone deaf behind her esophagus as she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Katherine's neck bobbed as she felt the tiny morsel go down her throat, none the wiser that the morse was her daughter.
