You move cautiously over to her, making sure not to raise an alarm by tripping over a toy, and turn her on her back. She doesn't react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinnie is often the reason people call out to you in public, they always say things like \"That's got to be the cutest little munchkin i've ever seen\" and then proceed to pinch Minnie's cheeks, even against her wish's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop for a moment wondering why out of everyone in the house you chose to switch with Minnie. <i>Probably because it'd be fun to be a little kid, no responsibilities and all that</i> you thought to yourself as you placed the ring on Minnie's still sleeping face. \"Welp, here goes nothing...\" you said out loud and pressed you face to Minnie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing you new you were jolted away by someone picking you up. You looked around startled before remembering what had happened. You gazed down at your body and saw Minnie's adorable pajamas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy shit!</i> you thought as you looked to see who was princess carrying you. It was you mom. She hadn't noticed you awaken yet, so you followed her gaze to see where you were headed... the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis normally wouldn't have been a big deal, but the couch was where your mom took Minnie after naps to breastfeed! Your mom pulled a couch cushion from the middle of the couch and placed it by the armrest before laying down with you on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Minnie\" your mom said with a smile  as she began pulling up her shirt. \"It's time for nursing little one\" she said as she exposed one of her breasts. It was a beautiful breast, large and supple, with wide areola swollen at the nip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so caught by her bare breast that you hadn't decided how to handle this situation yet. Were you supposed to just commit to the act (and give into your perversion) by sucking you mother's breast in your sisters body or should you stop now before you give up on morales? </span></div></div>",

Your cousin Hazel hears her and gathers all the spoons and forks they already laid down on the flowery table mat. She hurriedly crosses between Marly and August who are bringing the new silverware from the kitchen. As she passes she makes eye contact with you and you try to give her a smirk (Bad Idea). Her gaze immediately shifts away but you catch her looking at the hoop in your hand before she enters the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a slap on your back and turn to see Natalien trying her absolute best from the couch to reach you with minimum effort, her body in a back bend exposing her belly button tattoo. She meets your eyes and gives a devilish smirk, she signals for you to come closer and when you do she pulls you on top of her. You squirm but she holds you in a tight hug and starts cuddling with you, smothering you with kisses and tight squeezes against her breast and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sigh</i><br>\r\nYou hear from the corner and managing to look between you sisters arms you see your other sister Cassidy giving you both a look. You feel embarrassed but Nat's voice breaths into the back your neck. \"Care to join in Cassy-Sassy?\" she says with a say with, probably the same childish grin she always has, you don't even need to see her to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy doesn't pay either of you any heed and strides past you towards the table, swaying her hips (which you swear she is doing on purpose, even if she acts like its natural). A short second after you her you Mom calling for everyone else to come. With one last smothering kiss and cuddle Nat finally lets you go and gets up herself, pulling her light wool shirt up that had popped over her shoulder in the struggle, giving you a glimpse that she wasn't wearing a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down in-between Nat and Cassidy and across from Hazel (who's eyes refused to meet yours). You Mom and Marly brought in the rest of the food and sat down with the rest of you.</span></div></div>",
